| **[Semantic-Supervised Spatial-Temporal Fusion for LiDAR-based 3D Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10579v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LiDAR-based 3D object detection presents significant challenges due to the inherent sparsity of LiDAR points. A common solution involves long-term temporal LiDAR data to densify the inputs. However, efficiently leveraging spatial-temporal information remains an open problem. In this paper, we propose a novel Semantic-Supervised Spatial-Temporal Fusion (ST-Fusion) method, which introduces a novel fusion module to relieve the spatial misalignment caused by the object motion over time and a feature-level semantic supervision to sufficiently unlock the capacity of the proposed fusion module. Specifically, the ST-Fusion consists of a Spatial Aggregation (SA) module and a Temporal Merging (TM) module. The SA module employs a convolutional layer with progressively expanding receptive fields to aggregate the object features from the local regions to alleviate the spatial misalignment, the TM module dynamically extracts object features from the preceding frames based on the attention mechanism for a comprehensive sequential presentation. Besides, in the semantic supervision, we propose a Semantic Injection method to enrich the sparse LiDAR data via injecting the point-wise semantic labels, using it for training a teacher model and providing a reconstruction target at the feature level supervised by the proposed object-aware loss. Extensive experiments on various LiDAR-based detectors demonstrate the effectiveness and universality of our proposal, yielding an improvement of approximately +2.8% in NDS based on the nuScenes benchmark.</p></details> | Accepted by ICRA2025 |

In this paper, we rethink that the redundancy in inversion-based image editing exists in both the spatial and temporal dimensions, such as the unnecessary computation in unedited regions and the redundancy in the inversion progress. To tackle these challenges, we propose a practical framework, named EEdit, to achieve efficient image editing. Specifically, we introduce three techniques to solve them one by one. For spatial redundancy, spatial locality caching is introduced to compute the edited region and its neighboring regions while skipping the unedited regions, and token indexing preprocessing is designed to further accelerate the caching. For temporal redundancy, inversion step skipping is proposed to reuse the latent for efficient editing. Our experiments demonstrate an average of 2.46 $\times$ acceleration without performance drop in a wide range of editing tasks including prompt-guided image editing, dragging and image composition.

Recent works introduce self-supervised cross-modal knowledge distillation (KD) as a way to transfer these powerful generalization capabilities into 3D LiDAR-based models. However, they either rely on highly complex distillation losses, pseudo-semantic maps, or limit KD to features useful for semantic segmentation only. In this work, we propose CleverDistiller, a self-supervised, cross-modal 2D-to-3D KD framework introducing a set of simple yet effective design choices: Unlike contrastive approaches relying on complex loss design choices, our method employs a direct feature similarity loss in combination with a multi layer perceptron (MLP) projection head to allow the 3D network to learn complex semantic dependencies throughout the projection. Crucially, our approach does not depend on pseudo-semantic maps, allowing for direct knowledge transfer from a VFM without explicit semantic supervision. Additionally, we introduce the auxiliary self-supervised spatial task of occupancy prediction to enhance the semantic knowledge, obtained from a VFM through KD, with 3D spatial reasoning capabilities. Experiments on standard autonomous driving benchmarks for 2D-to-3D KD demonstrate that CleverDistiller achieves state-of-the-art performance in both semantic segmentation and 3D object detection (3DOD) by up to 10% mIoU, especially when fine tuning on really low data amounts, showing the effectiveness of our simple yet powerful KD strategy</p></details> |  |
| **[Augmenting Teamwork through AI Agents as Spatial Collaborators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09794v1)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As Augmented Reality (AR) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) continue to converge, new opportunities emerge for AI agents to actively support human collaboration in immersive environments. While prior research has primarily focused on dyadic human-AI interactions, less attention has been given to Human-AI Teams (HATs) in AR, where AI acts as an adaptive teammate rather than a static tool. This position paper takes the perspective of team dynamics and work organization to propose that AI agents in AR should not only interact with individuals but also recognize and respond to team-level needs in real time. We argue that spatially aware AI agents should dynamically generate the resources necessary for effective collaboration, such as virtual blackboards for brainstorming, mental map models for shared understanding, and memory recall of spatial configurations to enhance knowledge retention and task coordination. This approach moves beyond predefined AI assistance toward context-driven AI interventions that optimize team performance and decision-making.</p></details> | <details><summary>Posit...</summary><p>Positional paper for the CHI 2025 Everyday AR through AI-in-the-Loop Workshop</p></details> |
| **[SASNet: Spatially-Adaptive Sinusoidal Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09750v1)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sinusoidal neural networks (SNNs) have emerged as powerful implicit neural representations (INRs) for low-dimensional signals in computer vision and graphics. They enable high-frequency signal reconstruction and smooth manifold modeling; however, they often suffer from spectral bias, training instability, and overfitting. To address these challenges, we propose SASNet, Spatially-Adaptive SNNs that robustly enhance the capacity of compact INRs to fit detailed signals. SASNet integrates a frequency embedding layer to control frequency components and mitigate spectral bias, along with jointly optimized, spatially-adaptive masks that localize neuron influence, reducing network redundancy and improving convergence stability. Robust to hyperparameter selection, SASNet faithfully reconstructs high-frequency signals without overfitting low-frequency regions. Our experiments show that SASNet outperforms state-of-the-art INRs, achieving strong fitting accuracy, super-resolution capability, and noise suppression, without sacrificing model compactness.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 7 figures, supplementary materials</p></details> |
| **[Learning Spatially Adaptive $\ell_1$-Norms Weights for Convolutional Synthesis Regularization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09483v1)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose an unrolled algorithm approach for learning spatially adaptive parameter maps in the framework of convolutional synthesis-based $\ell_1$ regularization. More precisely, we consider a family of pre-trained convolutional filters and estimate deeply parametrized spatially varying parameters applied to the sparse feature maps by means of unrolling a FISTA algorithm to solve the underlying sparse estimation problem. The proposed approach is evaluated for image reconstruction of low-field MRI and compared to spatially adaptive and non-adaptive analysis-type procedures relying on Total Variation regularization and to a well-established model-based deep learning approach. We show that the proposed approach produces visually and quantitatively comparable results with the latter approaches and at the same time remains highly interpretable. In particular, the inferred parameter maps quantify the local contribution of each filter in the reconstruction, which provides valuable insight into the algorithm mechanism and could potentially be used to discard unsuited filters.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be submitted to the EUSIPCO 2025 conference</p></details> |
| **[Pig behavior dataset and Spatial-temporal perception and enhancement networks based on the attention mechanism for pig behavior recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09378v1)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recognition of pig behavior plays a crucial role in smart farming and welfare assurance for pigs. Currently, in the field of pig behavior recognition, the lack of publicly available behavioral datasets not only limits the development of innovative algorithms but also hampers model robustness and algorithm optimization.This paper proposes a dataset containing 13 pig behaviors that significantly impact welfare.Based on this dataset, this paper proposes a spatial-temporal perception and enhancement networks based on the attention mechanism to model the spatiotemporal features of pig behaviors and their associated interaction areas in video data. The network is composed of a spatiotemporal perception network and a spatiotemporal feature enhancement network. The spatiotemporal perception network is responsible for establishing connections between the pigs and the key regions of their behaviors in the video data. The spatiotemporal feature enhancement network further strengthens the important spatial features of individual pigs and captures the long-term dependencies of the spatiotemporal features of individual behaviors by remodeling these connections, thereby enhancing the model's perception of spatiotemporal changes in pig behaviors. Experimental results demonstrate that on the dataset established in this paper, our proposed model achieves a MAP score of 75.92%, which is an 8.17% improvement over the best-performing traditional model. This study not only improces the accuracy and generalizability of individual pig behavior recognition but also provides new technological tools for modern smart farming. The dataset and related code will be made publicly available alongside this paper.</p></details> |  |
| **[High-Precision Overlay Registration via Spatial-Terminal Iterative Learning in Roll-to-Roll Manufacturing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08835v1)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Roll-to-roll (R2R) printing technologies are promising for high-volume continuous production of substrate-based electronic products. One of the major challenges in R2R flexible electronics printing is achieving tight alignment tolerances, as specified by the device resolution (usually at the micro-meter level), for multi-layer printed electronics. The alignment of the printed patterns in different layers is known as registration. Conventional registration control methods rely on real-time feedback controllers, such as PID control, to regulate the web tension and the web speed. However, those methods may lose effectiveness in compensating for recurring disturbances and supporting effective mitigation of registration errors. In this paper, we propose a Spatial-Terminal Iterative Learning Control (STILC) method integrated with PID control to iteratively learn and reduce registration error cycle-by-cycle, converging it to zero. This approach enables unprecedented precision in the creation, integration, and manipulation of multi-layer microstructures in R2R processes. We theoretically prove the convergence of the proposed STILC-PID hybrid approach and validate its effectiveness through a simulated registration error scenario caused by axis mismatch between roller and motor, a common issue in R2R systems. The results demonstrate that the STILC-PID hybrid control method can fully eliminate the registration error after a feasible number of iterations. Additionally, we analyze the impact of different learning gains on the convergence performance of STILC.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Event-Based Object Detection: A Hybrid Neural Network with Spatial and Temporal Attention](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10173v3)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Event cameras offer high temporal resolution and dynamic range with minimal motion blur, making them promising for robust object detection. While Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) on neuromorphic hardware are often considered for energy-efficient and low latency event-based data processing, they often fall short of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) in accuracy and flexibility. Here, we introduce Attention-based Hybrid SNN-ANN backbones for event-based object detection to leverage the strengths of both SNN and ANN architectures. A novel Attention-based SNN-ANN bridge module captures sparse spatial and temporal relations from the SNN layer and converts them into dense feature maps for the ANN part of the backbone. Additionally, we present a variant that integrates DWConvL-STMs to the ANN blocks to capture slower dynamics. This multi-timescale network combines fast SNN processing for short timesteps with long-term dense RNN processing, effectively capturing both fast and slow dynamics. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method surpasses SNN-based approaches by significant margins, with results comparable to existing ANN and RNN-based methods. Unlike ANN-only networks, the hybrid setup allows us to implement the SNN blocks on digital neuromorphic hardware to investigate the feasibility of our approach. Extensive ablation studies and implementation on neuromorphic hardware confirm the effectiveness of our proposed modules and architectural choices. Our hybrid SNN-ANN architectures pave the way for ANN-like performance at a drastically reduced parameter, latency, and power budget.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Resource Allocation in 5G Massive MIMO-NOMA Networks: Comparative Analysis of SINR-Aware Power Allocation and Spatial Correlation-Based Clustering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08466v1)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the evolution of 5G networks, optimizing resource allocation has become crucial to meeting the increasing demand for massive connectivity and high throughput. Combining Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) and massive Multi-Input Multi-Output (MIMO) enhances spectral efficiency, power efficiency, and device connectivity. However, deploying MIMO-NOMA in dense networks poses challenges in managing interference and optimizing power allocation while ensuring that the Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio (SINR) meets required thresholds. Unlike previous studies that analyze user clustering and power allocation techniques under simplified assumptions, this work provides a comparative evaluation of multiple clustering and allocation strategies under identical spatially correlated network conditions. We focus on maximizing the number of served users under a given Quality of Service (QoS) constraint rather than the conventional sum-rate maximization approach. Additionally, we consider spatial correlation in user grouping, a factor often overlooked despite its importance in mitigating intra-cluster interference. We evaluate clustering algorithms, including user pairing, random clustering, Correlation Iterative Clustering Algorithm (CIA), K-means++-based User Clustering (KUC), and Grey Wolf Optimizer-based clustering (GWO), in a downlink spatially correlated MIMO-NOMA environment. Numerical results demonstrate that the GWO-based clustering algorithm achieves superior energy efficiency while maintaining scalability, whereas CIA effectively maximizes the number of served users. These findings provide valuable insights for designing MIMO-NOMA systems that optimize resource allocation in next-generation wireless networks.</p></details> |  |
| **[SoTCKGE:Continual Knowledge Graph Embedding Based on Spatial Offset Transformation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08189v1)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current Continual Knowledge Graph Embedding (CKGE) methods primarily rely on translation-based embedding methods, leveraging previously acquired knowledge to initialize new facts. To enhance learning efficiency, these methods often integrate fine-tuning or continual learning strategies. However, this compromises the model's prediction accuracy and the translation-based methods lack support for complex relational structures (multi-hop relations). To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel CKGE framework SoTCKGE grounded in Spatial Offset Transformation. Within this framework, entity positions are defined as being jointly determined by base position vectors and offset vectors. This not only enhances the model's ability to represent complex relational structures but also allows for the embedding update of both new and old knowledge through simple spatial offset transformations, without the need for continuous learning methods. Furthermore, we introduce a hierarchical update strategy and a balanced embedding method to refine the parameter update process, effectively minimizing training costs and augmenting model accuracy. To comprehensively assess the performance of our model, we have conducted extensive experimlents on four publicly accessible datasets and a new dataset constructed by us. Experimental results demonstrate the advantage of our model in enhancing multi-hop relationship learning and further improving prediction accuracy.</p></details> | 9 pages, 5 figures |
| **[SweetTok: Semantic-Aware Spatial-Temporal Tokenizer for Compact Video Discretization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10443v3)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents the \textbf{S}emantic-a\textbf{W}ar\textbf{E} spatial-t\textbf{E}mporal \textbf{T}okenizer (SweetTok), a novel video tokenizer to overcome the limitations in current video tokenization methods for compacted yet effective discretization. Unlike previous approaches that process flattened local visual patches via direct discretization or adaptive query tokenization, SweetTok proposes a decoupling framework, compressing visual inputs through distinct spatial and temporal queries via \textbf{D}ecoupled \textbf{Q}uery \textbf{A}uto\textbf{E}ncoder (DQAE). This design allows SweetTok to efficiently compress video token count while achieving superior fidelity by capturing essential information across spatial and temporal dimensions. Furthermore, we design a \textbf{M}otion-enhanced \textbf{L}anguage \textbf{C}odebook (MLC) tailored for spatial and temporal compression to address the differences in semantic representation between appearance and motion information. SweetTok significantly improves video reconstruction results by \textbf{42.8\%} w.r.t rFVD on UCF-101 dataset. With a better token compression strategy, it also boosts downstream video generation results by \textbf{15.1\%} w.r.t gFVD. Additionally, the compressed decoupled tokens are imbued with semantic information, enabling few-shot recognition capabilities powered by LLMs in downstream applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Boundary Prompting: Elastic Urban Region Representation via Graph-based Spatial Tokenization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07991v1)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Urban region representation is essential for various applications such as urban planning, resource allocation, and policy development. Traditional methods rely on fixed, predefined region boundaries, which fail to capture the dynamic and complex nature of real-world urban areas. In this paper, we propose the Boundary Prompting Urban Region Representation Framework (BPURF), a novel approach that allows for elastic urban region definitions. BPURF comprises two key components: (1) A spatial token dictionary, where urban entities are treated as tokens and integrated into a unified token graph, and (2) a region token set representation model which utilize token aggregation and a multi-channel model to embed token sets corresponding to region boundaries. Additionally, we propose fast token set extraction strategy to enable online token set extraction during training and prompting. This framework enables the definition of urban regions through boundary prompting, supporting varying region boundaries and adapting to different tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of BPURF in capturing the complex characteristics of urban regions.</p></details> |  |
| **[STRMs: Spatial Temporal Reasoning Models for Vision-Based Localization Rivaling GPS Precision](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07939v1)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper explores vision-based localization through a biologically-inspired approach that mirrors how humans and animals link views or perspectives when navigating their world. We introduce two sequential generative models, VAE-RNN and VAE-Transformer, which transform first-person perspective (FPP) observations into global map perspective (GMP) representations and precise geographical coordinates. Unlike retrieval-based methods, our approach frames localization as a generative task, learning direct mappings between perspectives without relying on dense satellite image databases. We evaluate these models across two real-world environments: a university campus navigated by a Jackal robot and an urban downtown area navigated by a Tesla sedan. The VAE-Transformer achieves impressive precision, with median deviations of 2.29m (1.37% of environment size) and 4.45m (0.35% of environment size) respectively, outperforming both VAE-RNN and prior cross-view geo-localization approaches. Our comprehensive Localization Performance Characteristics (LPC) analysis demonstrates superior performance with the VAE-Transformer achieving an AUC of 0.777 compared to 0.295 for VIGOR 200 and 0.225 for TransGeo, establishing a new state-of-the-art in vision-based localization. In some scenarios, our vision-based system rivals commercial smartphone GPS accuracy (AUC of 0.797) while requiring 5x less GPU memory and delivering 3x faster inference than existing methods in cross-view geo-localization. These results demonstrate that models inspired by biological spatial navigation can effectively memorize complex, dynamic environments and provide precise localization with minimal computational resources.</p></details> | 11 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Sparkle: Mastering Basic Spatial Capabilities in Vision Language Models Elicits Generalization to Spatial Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16162v3)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision language models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance across a wide range of downstream tasks. However, their proficiency in spatial reasoning remains limited, despite its crucial role in tasks involving navigation and interaction with physical environments. Specifically, most of these tasks rely on the core spatial reasoning capabilities in two-dimensional (2D) environments, and our evaluation reveals that state-of-the-art VLMs frequently generate implausible and incorrect responses to composite spatial reasoning problems, including simple pathfinding tasks that humans can solve effortlessly at a glance. To address this, we explore an effective approach to enhance 2D spatial reasoning within VLMs by training the model solely on basic spatial capabilities. We begin by disentangling the key components of 2D spatial reasoning: direction comprehension, distance estimation, and localization. Our central hypothesis is that mastering these basic spatial capabilities can significantly enhance a model's performance on composite spatial tasks requiring advanced spatial understanding and combinatorial problem-solving, with generalized improvements in real-world visual-spatial tasks. To investigate this hypothesis, we introduce Sparkle: a framework that uses synthetic data generation to provide targeted supervision for vision language models (VLMs) in three basic spatial capabilities, creating an instruction dataset for each capability. Our experiments demonstrate that VLMs fine-tuned with Sparkle achieve significant performance gains, not only in the basic tasks themselves but also in generalizing to composite and out-of-distribution real-world spatial reasoning tasks. These findings offer insights into systematic strategies for improving VLMs' spatial reasoning capabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[AutoSpatial: Visual-Language Reasoning for Social Robot Navigation through Efficient Spatial Reasoning Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07557v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a novel method, AutoSpatial, an efficient approach with structured spatial grounding to enhance VLMs' spatial reasoning. By combining minimal manual supervision with large-scale Visual Question-Answering (VQA) pairs auto-labeling, our approach tackles the challenge of VLMs' limited spatial understanding in social navigation tasks. By applying a hierarchical two-round VQA strategy during training, AutoSpatial achieves both global and detailed understanding of scenarios, demonstrating more accurate spatial perception, movement prediction, Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning, final action, and explanation compared to other SOTA approaches. These five components are essential for comprehensive social navigation reasoning. Our approach was evaluated using both expert systems (GPT-4o, Gemini 2.0 Flash, and Claude 3.5 Sonnet) that provided cross-validation scores and human evaluators who assigned relative rankings to compare model performances across four key aspects. Augmented by the enhanced spatial reasoning capabilities, AutoSpatial demonstrates substantial improvements by averaged cross-validation score from expert systems in: perception & prediction (up to 10.71%), reasoning (up to 16.26%), action (up to 20.50%), and explanation (up to 18.73%) compared to baseline models trained only on manually annotated data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Look Inside for More: Internal Spatial Modality Perception for 3D Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13461v2)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D anomaly detection has recently become a significant focus in computer vision. Several advanced methods have achieved satisfying anomaly detection performance. However, they typically concentrate on the external structure of 3D samples and struggle to leverage the internal information embedded within samples. Inspired by the basic intuition of why not look inside for more, we introduce a straightforward method named Internal Spatial Modality Perception~(ISMP) to explore the feature representation from internal views fully. Specifically, our proposed ISMP consists of a critical perception module, Spatial Insight Engine~(SIE), which abstracts complex internal information of point clouds into essential global features. Besides, to better align structural information with point data, we propose an enhanced key point feature extraction module for amplifying spatial structure feature representation. Simultaneously, a novel feature filtering module is incorporated to reduce noise and redundant features for further aligning precise spatial structure. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our proposed method, achieving object-level and pixel-level AUROC improvements of 3.2\% and 13.1\%, respectively, on the Real3D-AD benchmarks. Note that the strong generalization ability of SIE has been theoretically proven and is verified in both classification and segmentation tasks.</p></details> | AAAI2025 Poster |
| **[Towards Spatial Transcriptomics-guided Pathological Image Recognition with Batch-Agnostic Encoder](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07173v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial transcriptomics (ST) is a novel technique that simultaneously captures pathological images and gene expression profiling with spatial coordinates. Since ST is closely related to pathological features such as disease subtypes, it may be valuable to augment image representation with pathological information. However, there are no attempts to leverage ST for image recognition ({\it i.e,} patch-level classification of subtypes of pathological image.). One of the big challenges is significant batch effects in spatial transcriptomics that make it difficult to extract pathological features of images from ST. In this paper, we propose a batch-agnostic contrastive learning framework that can extract consistent signals from gene expression of ST in multiple patients. To extract consistent signals from ST, we utilize the batch-agnostic gene encoder that is trained in a variational inference manner. Experiments demonstrated the effectiveness of our framework on a publicly available dataset.

| **[Multivariate spatial models for small area estimation of species-specific forest inventory parameters](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07118v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>National Forest Inventories (NFIs) provide statistically reliable information on forest resources at national and other large spatial scales. As forest management and conservation needs become increasingly complex, NFIs are being called upon to provide forest parameter estimates at spatial scales smaller than current design-based estimation procedures can provide. This is particularly true when estimates are desired by species or species groups. Here we propose a multivariate spatial model for small area estimation of species-specific forest inventory parameters. The hierarchical Bayesian modeling framework accounts for key complexities in species-specific forest inventory data, such as zero-inflation, correlations among species, and residual spatial autocorrelation. Importantly, by fitting the model directly to the individual plot-level data, the framework enables estimates of species-level forest parameters, with associated uncertainty, across any user-defined small area of interest. A simulation study revealed minimal bias and higher accuracy of the proposed model-based approach compared to the design-based estimator and a non-parametric k-nearest neighbor (kNN) estimator. We applied the model to estimate species-specific county-level aboveground biomass for the 20 most abundant tree species in the southern United States using Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) data. Biomass estimates from the proposed model had high correlations with design-based estimates and kNN estimates. Importantly, the proposed model provided large gains in precision across all 20 species. On average across species, 91.5% of county-level biomass estimates had higher precision compared to the design-based estimates. The proposed framework improves the ability of NFI data users to generate species-level forest parameter estimates with reasonable precision at management-relevant spatial scales.</p></details> | 35 pages, 6 figures |

Existing approaches often rely on simple spatiotemporal stacking, which introduces feature redundancy, while subtle joint-level details remain overlooked from a spatial perspective. To this end, we propose a novel HiSTF Mamba framework. The framework is composed of three key modules: Dual-Spatial Mamba, Bi-Temporal Mamba, and Dynamic Spatiotemporal Fusion Module (DSFM). Dual-Spatial Mamba incorporates ``Part-based + Whole-based'' parallel modeling to represent both whole-body coordination and fine-grained joint dynamics. Bi-Temporal Mamba adopts a bidirectional scanning strategy, effectively encoding short-term motion details and long-term dependencies. DSFM further performs redundancy removal and extraction of complementary information for temporal features, then fuses them with spatial features, yielding an expressive spatio-temporal representation. Experimental results on the HumanML3D dataset demonstrate that HiSTF Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple metrics. In particular, it reduces the FID score from 0.283 to 0.189, a relative decrease of nearly 30%. These findings validate the effectiveness of HiSTF Mamba in achieving high fidelity and strong semantic alignment in text-to-motion generation.</p></details> | 11pages,3figures, |
| **[A2I-Calib: An Anti-noise Active Multi-IMU Spatial-temporal Calibration Framework for Legged Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06844v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, multi-node inertial measurement unit (IMU)-based odometry for legged robots has gained attention due to its cost-effectiveness, power efficiency, and high accuracy. However, the spatial and temporal misalignment between foot-end motion derived from forward kinematics and foot IMU measurements can introduce inconsistent constraints, resulting in odometry drift. Therefore, accurate spatial-temporal calibration is crucial for the multi-IMU systems. Although existing multi-IMU calibration methods have addressed passive single-rigid-body sensor calibration, they are inadequate for legged systems. This is due to the insufficient excitation from traditional gaits for calibration, and enlarged sensitivity to IMU noise during kinematic chain transformations. To address these challenges, we propose A$^2$I-Calib, an anti-noise active multi-IMU calibration framework enabling autonomous spatial-temporal calibration for arbitrary foot-mounted IMUs. Our A$^2$I-Calib includes: 1) an anti-noise trajectory generator leveraging a proposed basis function selection theorem to minimize the condition number in correlation analysis, thus reducing noise sensitivity, and 2) a reinforcement learning (RL)-based controller that ensures robust execution of calibration motions. Furthermore, A$^2$I-Calib is validated on simulation and real-world quadruped robot platforms with various multi-IMU settings, which demonstrates a significant reduction in noise sensitivity and calibration errors, thereby improving the overall multi-IMU odometry performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Highly Multivariate Large-scale Spatial Stochastic Processes -- A Cross-Markov Random Field Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10396v2)** | 2025-03-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Key challenges in the analysis of highly multivariate large-scale spatial stochastic processes, where both the number of components (p) and spatial locations (n) can be large, include achieving maximal sparsity in the joint precision matrix, ensuring efficient computational cost for its generation, accommodating asymmetric cross-covariance in the joint covariance matrix, and delivering scientific interpretability. We propose a cross-MRF model class, consisting of a mixed spatial graphical model framework and cross-MRF theory, to collectively address these challenges in one unified framework across two modelling stages. The first stage exploits scientifically informed conditional independence (CI) among p component fields and allows for a step-wise parallel generation of joint covariance and precision matrix, enabling a simultaneous accommodation of asymmetric cross-covariance in joint covariance matrix and sparsity in joint precision matrix. The second stage extends the first-stage CI to doubly CI among both p and n and unearths the cross-MRF via an extended Hammersley-Clifford theorem for multivariate spatial stochastic processes. This results in the sparsest possible representation of the joint precision matrix and ensures its lowest generation complexity. We demonstrate with 1D simulated comparative studies and 2D real-world data.</p></details> | 54 pages; 10 figures |
| **[Efficient Robust Adaptive Beamforming Based on Spatial Sampling with Virtual Sensors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06540v1)** | 2025-03-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robust adaptive beamforming (RAB) based on interference-plus-noise covariance (IPNC) matrix reconstruction can experience serious performance degradation in the presence of look direction and array geometry mismatches, particularly when the input signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is large. In this work, we present a RAB technique to address covariance matrix reconstruction problems. The proposed method involves IPNC matrix reconstruction using a low-complexity spatial sampling process (LCSSP) and employs a virtual received array vector. In particular, we devise a power spectrum sampling strategy based on a projection matrix computed in a higher dimension. A key feature of the proposed LCSSP technique is to avoid reconstruction of the IPNC matrix by integrating over the angular sector of the interference-plus-noise region. Simulation results are shown and discussed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed LCSSP method against existing approaches.</p></details> | 6 pages, 6 figures |

Existing topological segmentation loss functions are primarily based on the persistent homology of the image. They match the persistent features from the segmentation with the persistent features from the ground truth and minimize the difference between them. However, these methods suffer from an ambiguous matching problem since the matching only relies on the information in the topological space. In this work, we propose an effective and efficient Spatial-Aware Topological Loss Function that further leverages the information in the original spatial domain of the image to assist the matching of persistent features. Extensive experiments on images of various types of tubular structures show that the proposed method has superior performance in improving the topological accuracy of the segmentation compared with state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Ambiguity-Free Spatial Foundation Model: Rethinking and Decoupling Depth Ambiguity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06014v1)** | 2025-03-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Depth ambiguity is a fundamental challenge in spatial scene understanding, especially in transparent scenes where single-depth estimates fail to capture full 3D structure. Existing models, limited to deterministic predictions, overlook real-world multi-layer depth. To address this, we introduce a paradigm shift from single-prediction to multi-hypothesis spatial foundation models. We first present \texttt{MD-3k}, a benchmark exposing depth biases in expert and foundational models through multi-layer spatial relationship labels and new metrics. To resolve depth ambiguity, we propose Laplacian Visual Prompting (LVP), a training-free spectral prompting technique that extracts hidden depth from pre-trained models via Laplacian-transformed RGB inputs. By integrating LVP-inferred depth with standard RGB-based estimates, our approach elicits multi-layer depth without model retraining. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of LVP in zero-shot multi-layer depth estimation, unlocking more robust and comprehensive geometry-conditioned visual generation, 3D-grounded spatial reasoning, and temporally consistent video-level depth inference. Our benchmark and code will be available at https://github.com/Xiaohao-Xu/Ambiguity-in-Space.</p></details> | <details><summary>32 pa...</summary><p>32 pages, 31 figures, github repo: https://github.com/Xiaohao-Xu/Ambiguity-in-Space</p></details> |
| **[GestureLSM: Latent Shortcut based Co-Speech Gesture Generation with Spatial-Temporal Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18898v2)** | 2025-03-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating full-body human gestures based on speech signals remains challenges on quality and speed. Existing approaches model different body regions such as body, legs and hands separately, which fail to capture the spatial interactions between them and result in unnatural and disjointed movements. Additionally, their autoregressive/diffusion-based pipelines show slow generation speed due to dozens of inference steps. To address these two challenges, we propose GestureLSM, a flow-matching-based approach for Co-Speech Gesture Generation with spatial-temporal modeling. Our method i) explicitly model the interaction of tokenized body regions through spatial and temporal attention, for generating coherent full-body gestures. ii) introduce the flow matching to enable more efficient sampling by explicitly modeling the latent velocity space. To overcome the suboptimal performance of flow matching baseline, we propose latent shortcut learning and beta distribution time stamp sampling during training to enhance gesture synthesis quality and accelerate inference. Combining the spatial-temporal modeling and improved flow matching-based framework, GestureLSM achieves state-of-the-art performance on BEAT2 while significantly reducing inference time compared to existing methods, highlighting its potential for enhancing digital humans and embodied agents in real-world applications.

Recent computational advancements allow efficient, relatively simple, and quick approximate Bayesian estimation for MRP. As population health outcomes of interest including vaccination uptake are known to have spatial structure, precision may be gained by including space in the model. We test a recently proposed spatial MRP method that includes a BYM2 spatial term that smooths across demographics and geographic areas using a large, unrepresentative survey. We produce California county-level estimates of first-dose COVID-19 vaccination up to June 2021 using classic and spatial MRP models, and poststratify using data from the American Community Survey (US Census Bureau). We assess validity using reported first-dose vaccination counts from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC). Neither classic nor spatial MRP models performed well, highlighting: 1. spatial MRP may be most appropriate for richer data contexts, 2. some demographics in the survey data are over-sampled and -aggregated, producing model over-smoothing, and 3. a need for survey producers to share user-representative metrics to better benchmark estimates.</p></details> | <details><summary>45 pa...</summary><p>45 pages (12 main article + 33 pages of appendix), 3 figures.

For this reason, self-supervised image-only pretraining is still the go-to method for many dense vision applications (e.g. depth estimation, semantic segmentation), despite the lack of explicit supervisory signals. In this paper, we close this gap between image-text and self-supervised learning, by proposing a novel general-purpose image-text model, which can be effectively used off the shelf for dense and global vision tasks. Our method, which we refer to as Text-Image Pretraining with Spatial awareness (TIPS), leverages two simple and effective insights. First, on textual supervision: we reveal that replacing noisy web image captions by synthetically generated textual descriptions boosts dense understanding performance significantly, due to a much richer signal for learning spatially aware representations. We propose an adapted training method that combines noisy and synthetic captions, resulting in improvements across both dense and global understanding tasks. Second, on the learning technique: we propose to combine contrastive image-text learning with self-supervised masked image modeling, to encourage spatial coherence, unlocking substantial enhancements for downstream applications. Building on these two ideas, we scale our model using the transformer architecture, trained on a curated set of public images. Our experiments are conducted on 8 tasks involving 16 datasets in total, demonstrating strong off-the-shelf performance on both dense and global understanding, for several image-only and image-text tasks. Code and models are released at https://github.com/google-deepmind/tips.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR2...</summary><p>ICLR2025 camera-ready + appendix</p></details> |
| **[Spatial regularisation for improved accuracy and interpretability in keypoint-based registration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04499v2)** | 2025-03-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unsupervised registration strategies bypass requirements in ground truth transforms or segmentations by optimising similarity metrics between fixed and moved volumes. Among these methods, a recent subclass of approaches based on unsupervised keypoint detection stand out as very promising for interpretability. Specifically, these methods train a network to predict feature maps for fixed and moving images, from which explainable centres of mass are computed to obtain point clouds, that are then aligned in closed-form. However, the features returned by the network often yield spatially diffuse patterns that are hard to interpret, thus undermining the purpose of keypoint-based registration. Here, we propose a three-fold loss to regularise the spatial distribution of the features. First, we use the KL divergence to model features as point spread functions that we interpret as probabilistic keypoints. Then, we sharpen the spatial distributions of these features to increase the precision of the detected landmarks. Finally, we introduce a new repulsive loss across keypoints to encourage spatial diversity. Overall, our loss considerably improves the interpretability of the features, which now correspond to precise and anatomically meaningful landmarks. We demonstrate our three-fold loss in foetal rigid motion tracking and brain MRI affine registration tasks, where it not only outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised strategies, but also bridges the gap with state-of-the-art supervised methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/BenBillot/spatial_regularisation.</p></details> | under review |
| **[Spatial Distillation based Distribution Alignment (SDDA) for Cross-Headset EEG Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05349v1)** | 2025-03-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A non-invasive brain-computer interface (BCI) enables direct interaction between the user and external devices, typically via electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. However, decoding EEG signals across different headsets remains a significant challenge due to differences in the number and locations of the electrodes. To address this challenge, we propose a spatial distillation based distribution alignment (SDDA) approach for heterogeneous cross-headset transfer in non-invasive BCIs. SDDA uses first spatial distillation to make use of the full set of electrodes, and then input/feature/output space distribution alignments to cope with the significant differences between the source and target domains. To our knowledge, this is the first work to use knowledge distillation in cross-headset transfers. Extensive experiments on six EEG datasets from two BCI paradigms demonstrated that SDDA achieved superior performance in both offline unsupervised domain adaptation and online supervised domain adaptation scenarios, consistently outperforming 10 classical and state-of-the-art transfer learning algorithms.</p></details> | 10 pages, 5 figures |
| **[SpatialVLA: Exploring Spatial Representations for Visual-Language-Action Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15830v4)** | 2025-03-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we claim that spatial understanding is the keypoint in robot manipulation, and propose SpatialVLA to explore effective spatial representations for the robot foundation model. Specifically, we introduce Ego3D Position Encoding to inject 3D information into the input observations of the visual-language-action model, and propose Adaptive Action Grids to represent spatial robot movement actions with adaptive discretized action grids, facilitating learning generalizable and transferrable spatial action knowledge for cross-robot control. SpatialVLA is first pre-trained on top of a vision-language model with 1.1 Million real-world robot episodes, to learn a generalist manipulation policy across multiple robot environments and tasks. After pre-training, SpatialVLA is directly applied to perform numerous tasks in a zero-shot manner. The superior results in both simulation and real-world robots demonstrate its advantage of inferring complex robot motion trajectories and its strong in-domain multi-task generalization ability. We further show the proposed Adaptive Action Grids offer a new and effective way to fine-tune the pre-trained SpatialVLA model for new simulation and real-world setups, where the pre-learned action grids are re-discretized to capture robot-specific spatial action movements of new setups. The superior results from extensive evaluations demonstrate the exceptional in-distribution generalization and out-of-distribution adaptation capability, highlighting the crucial benefit of the proposed spatial-aware representations for generalist robot policy learning. All the details and codes will be open-sourced.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spectral-Spatial Extraction through Layered Tensor Decomposition for Hyperspectral Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05183v1)** | 2025-03-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Low rank tensor representation (LRTR) methods are very useful for hyperspectral anomaly detection (HAD). To overcome the limitations that they often overlook spectral anomaly and rely on large-scale matrix singular value decomposition, we first apply non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) to alleviate spectral dimensionality redundancy and extract spectral anomaly and then employ LRTR to extract spatial anomaly while mitigating spatial redundancy, yielding a highly efffcient layered tensor decomposition (LTD) framework for HAD. An iterative algorithm based on proximal alternating minimization is developed to solve the proposed LTD model, with convergence guarantees provided. Moreover, we introduce a rank reduction strategy with validation mechanism that adaptively reduces data size while preventing excessive reduction. Theoretically, we rigorously establish the equivalence between the tensor tubal rank and tensor group sparsity regularization (TGSR) and, under mild conditions, demonstrate that the relaxed formulation of TGSR shares the same global minimizers and optimal values as its original counterpart. Experimental results on the Airport-Beach-Urban and MVTec datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in the HAD task.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatial Context-Driven Positive Pair Sampling for Enhanced Histopathology Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05170v1)** | 2025-03-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning has demonstrated great promise in cancer classification from whole-slide images (WSIs) but remains constrained by the need for extensive annotations. Annotation-free methods, such as multiple instance learning (MIL) and self-supervised learning (SSL), have emerged to address this challenge; however, current SSL techniques often depend on synthetic augmentations or temporal context, which may not adequately capture the intricate spatial relationships inherent to histopathology. In this work, we introduce a novel spatial context-driven positive pair sampling strategy for SSL that leverages the natural coherence of adjacent patches in WSIs. By constructing biologically relevant positive pairs from spatially proximate patches, our approach harnesses inherent spatial coherence to enhance patch-level representations, ultimately boosting slide-level classification performance. Experiments on multiple datasets reveal that our strategy improves classification accuracy by 5\% to 10\% over the standard method, paving the way for more clinically relevant AI models in cancer diagnosis.

| **[UniArray: Unified Spectral-Spatial Modeling for Array-Geometry-Agnostic Speech Separation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05110v1)** | 2025-03-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Array-geometry-agnostic speech separation (AGA-SS) aims to develop an effective separation method regardless of the microphone array geometry. Conventional methods rely on permutation-free operations, such as summation or attention mechanisms, to capture spatial information. However, these approaches often incur high computational costs or disrupt the effective use of spatial information during intra- and inter-channel interactions, leading to suboptimal performance. To address these issues, we propose UniArray, a novel approach that abandons the conventional interleaving manner. UniArray consists of three key components: a virtual microphone estimation (VME) module, a feature extraction and fusion module, and a hierarchical dual-path separator. The VME ensures robust performance across arrays with varying channel numbers. The feature extraction and fusion module leverages a spectral feature extraction module and a spatial dictionary learning (SDL) module to extract and fuse frequency-bin-level features, allowing the separator to focus on using the fused features. The hierarchical dual-path separator models feature dependencies along the time and frequency axes while maintaining computational efficiency. Experimental results show that UniArray outperforms state-of-the-art methods in SI-SDRi, WB-PESQ, NB-PESQ, and STOI across both seen and unseen array geometries.</p></details> | 5 pages, Prepirnt |
| **[Deep unrolling for learning optimal spatially varying regularisation parameters for Total Generalised Variation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16532v2)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We extend a recently introduced deep unrolling framework for learning spatially varying regularisation parameters in inverse imaging problems to the case of Total Generalised Variation (TGV). The framework combines a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) inferring the two spatially varying TGV parameters with an unrolled algorithmic scheme that solves the corresponding variational problem. The two subnetworks are jointly trained end-to-end in a supervised fashion and as such the CNN learns to compute those parameters that drive the reconstructed images as close to the ground truth as possible. Numerical results in image denoising and MRI reconstruction show a significant qualitative and quantitative improvement compared to the best TGV scalar parameter case as well as to other approaches employing spatially varying parameters computed by unsupervised methods. We also observe that the inferred spatially varying parameter maps have a consistent structure near the image edges, asking for further theoretical investigations. In particular, the parameter that weighs the first-order TGV term has a triple-edge structure with alternating high-low-high values whereas the one that weighs the second-order term attains small values in a large neighbourhood around the edges.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Poverty Targeting with Spatial Machine Learning: An application to Indonesia](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04300v1)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study leverages spatial machine learning (SML) to enhance the accuracy of Proxy Means Testing (PMT) for poverty targeting in Indonesia. Conventional PMT methodologies are prone to exclusion and inclusion errors due to their inability to account for spatial dependencies and regional heterogeneity. By integrating spatial contiguity matrices, SML models mitigate these limitations, facilitating a more precise identification and comparison of geographical poverty clusters. Utilizing household survey data from the Social Welfare Integrated Data Survey (DTKS) for the periods 2016 to 2020 and 2016 to 2021, this study examines spatial patterns in income distribution and delineates poverty clusters at both provincial and district levels. Empirical findings indicate that the proposed SML approach reduces exclusion errors from 28% to 20% compared to standard machine learning models, underscoring the critical role of spatial analysis in refining machine learning-based poverty targeting. These results highlight the potential of SML to inform the design of more equitable and effective social protection policies, particularly in geographically diverse contexts. Future research can explore the applicability of spatiotemporal models and assess the generalizability of SML approaches across varying socio-economic settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Wasserstein Spatial Depth](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10646v2)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modeling observations as random distributions embedded within Wasserstein spaces is becoming increasingly popular across scientific fields, as it captures the variability and geometric structure of the data more effectively. However, the distinct geometry and unique properties of Wasserstein space pose challenges to the application of conventional statistical tools, which are primarily designed for Euclidean spaces. Consequently, adapting and developing new methodologies for analysis within Wasserstein spaces has become essential. The space of distributions on $\mathbb{R}^d$ with $d>1$ is not linear, and "mimic" the geometry of a Riemannian manifold. In this paper, we extend the concept of statistical depth to distribution-valued data, introducing the notion of Wasserstein spatial depth. This new measure provides a way to rank and order distributions, enabling the development of order-based clustering techniques and inferential tools. We show that Wasserstein spatial depth (WSD) preserves critical properties of conventional statistical depths, notably, ranging within $[0,1]$, transformation invariance, vanishing at infinity, reaching a maximum at the geometric median, and continuity. Additionally, the population WSD has a straightforward plug-in estimator based on sampled empirical distributions. We establish the estimator's consistency and asymptotic normality. Extensive simulation and real-data application showcase the practical efficacy of WSD.</p></details> |  |

During the inference stage, these learned embeddings guide a diffusion network that operates without requiring heavy text encoders. By adjusting the relative significance of the two prompts and employing classifier-free guidance, users can control the intensity of removal or creation. Furthermore, I introduce a method to spatially vary the intensity of guidance by assigning different scales to individual pixels.</p></details> |  |

Each 3D Gaussian function represents a flexible region of interest and its semantic features, which are iteratively refined by the attention mechanism. In the experiment, it is found that the Gaussian function required by this method is larger than the query resolution of the original dense grid network, resulting in impaired performance. Therefore, we consider optimizing GaussianFormer by using unused temporal information. We learn the Spatial-Temporal Self-attention Mechanism from the previous grid-given occupation network and improve it to GaussianFormer. The experiment was conducted with the NuScenes dataset, and the experiment is currently underway.</p></details> |  |

Existing spatial keyword querying methods that target such data have focused primarily on efficiency and often involve proposals for index structures for efficient query processing. In these studies, due to challenges in measuring the semantic relevance of textual data, query constraints on the textual attributes are largely treated as a keyword matching process, ignoring richer query and data semantics. To advance the semantic aspects, we propose a system named SemaSK that exploits the semantic capabilities of large language models to retrieve geo-textual objects that are more semantically relevant to a query. Experimental results on a real dataset offer evidence of the effectiveness of the system, and a system demonstration is presented in this paper.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at EDBT'25</p></details> |

In this paper, we propose a novel spatial-temporal traversability assessment method, which aims to enable autonomous robots to effectively navigate through complex terrains. Our approach utilizes sparse Gaussian processes (SGP) to extract geometric features (curvature, gradient, elevation, etc.) directly from point cloud scans. These features are then used to construct a high-resolution local traversability map. Then, we design a spatial-temporal Bayesian Gaussian kernel (BGK) inference method to dynamically evaluate traversability scores, integrating historical and real-time data while considering factors such as slope, flatness, gradient, and uncertainty metrics. GPU acceleration is applied in the feature extraction step, and the system achieves real-time performance. Extensive simulation experiments across diverse terrain scenarios demonstrate that our method outperforms SOTA approaches in both accuracy and computational efficiency. Additionally, we develop an autonomous navigation framework integrated with the traversability map and validate it with a differential driven vehicle in complex outdoor environments. Our code will be open-source for further research and development by the community, https://github.com/ZJU-FAST-Lab/FSGP_BGK.</p></details> | 8 pages, 10 figures |

Different to mainstream RL which makes decisions at individual steps, recent studies have incorporated action repetition into RL, achieving enhanced action persistence with improved sample efficiency and superior performance. However, existing methods treat all action dimensions as a whole during repetition, ignoring variations among them. This constraint leads to inflexibility in decisions, which reduces policy agility with inferior effectiveness. In this work, we propose a novel repetition framework called SDAR, which implements Spatially Decoupled Action Repetition through performing closed-loop act-or-repeat selection for each action dimension individually. SDAR achieves more flexible repetition strategies, leading to an improved balance between action persistence and diversity. Compared to existing repetition frameworks, SDAR is more sample efficient with higher policy performance and reduced action fluctuation. Experiments are conducted on various continuous control scenarios, demonstrating the effectiveness of spatially decoupled repetition design proposed in this work.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |
| **[Spatial-Temporal Perception with Causal Inference for Naturalistic Driving Action Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04078v1)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Naturalistic driving action recognition is essential for vehicle cabin monitoring systems. However, the complexity of real-world backgrounds presents significant challenges for this task, and previous approaches have struggled with practical implementation due to their limited ability to observe subtle behavioral differences and effectively learn inter-frame features from video. In this paper, we propose a novel Spatial-Temporal Perception (STP) architecture that emphasizes both temporal information and spatial relationships between key objects, incorporating a causal decoder to perform behavior recognition and temporal action localization. Without requiring multimodal input, STP directly extracts temporal and spatial distance features from RGB video clips. Subsequently, these dual features are jointly encoded by maximizing the expected likelihood across all possible permutations of the factorization order. By integrating temporal and spatial features at different scales, STP can perceive subtle behavioral changes in challenging scenarios. Additionally, we introduce a causal-aware module to explore relationships between video frame features, significantly enhancing detection efficiency and performance. We validate the effectiveness of our approach using two publicly available driver distraction detection benchmarks. The results demonstrate that our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  |

However, most spatial clustering algorithms cannot pull information from nearby nodes and suffer performance drops when dealing with higher dimensionality and large datasets, making them suboptimal for large-scale and high-dimensional clustering. Due to modern data growing in size and dimension, clustering algorithms become weaker when addressing multifaceted issues. To improve upon this, we develop ConstellationNet, a convolution neural network(CNN)-graph neural network(GNN) framework that leverages the embedding power of a CNN, the neighbor aggregation of a GNN, and a neural network's ability to deal with batched data to improve spatial clustering and classification with graph augmented predictions. ConstellationNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on both supervised classification and unsupervised clustering across several datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art classification and clustering while reducing model size and training time by up to tenfold and improving baselines by 10 times. Because of its fast training and powerful nature, ConstellationNet holds promise in fields like epidemiology and medical imaging, able to quickly train on new data to develop robust responses.</p></details> |  |

We propose a Bayesian disaggregation framework that links misaligned data to a continuous domain model using an iteratively linearised integration method via integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA). The framework supports point pattern and aggregated count models under four covariate field scenarios: \textit{Raster at Full Resolution (RastFull), Raster Aggregation (RastAgg), Polygon Aggregation (PolyAgg), and Point Values (PointVal)}. The first three involve aggregation, while the latter two have incomplete fields. For PolyAgg and PointVal, we estimate the full covariate field using \textit{Value Plugin, Joint Uncertainty, and Uncertainty Plugin} methods, with the latter two accounting for uncertainty propagation. These methods demonstrate superior performance, and remain more robust even under model misspecification (i.e.\ modelling a nonlinear field as linear). In landslide studies, landslide occurrences are often aggregated into counts based on slope units, reducing spatial detail. The results indicate that point pattern observations and full-resolution covariate fields should be prioritized. For incomplete fields, methods incorporating uncertainty propagation are preferred. This framework supports landslide susceptibility and other spatial mapping, integrating seamlessly with INLA-extension packages.</p></details> | 103 pages |

However, FCL needs to address not only spatial data heterogeneity between clients but also temporal data heterogeneity between tasks. In this paper, empirical experiments demonstrate that such input-level heterogeneity significantly affects the model's internal parameters and outputs, leading to severe spatial-temporal catastrophic forgetting of local and previous knowledge. To this end, we propose Federated Tail Anchor (FedTA) to mix trainable Tail Anchor with the frozen output features to adjust their position in the feature space, thereby overcoming parameter-forgetting and output-forgetting. Three novel components are also included: Input Enhancement for improving the performance of pre-trained models on downstream tasks; Selective Input Knowledge Fusion for fusion of heterogeneous local knowledge on the server; and Best Global Prototype Selection for finding the best anchor point for each class in the feature space. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FedTA not only outperforms existing FCL methods but also effectively preserves the relative positions of features.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted by CVPR 2025</p></details> |

In this paper, we explore a coordinated solution based on online learning to drive the optimization of Spatial Reuse (SR), a method that allows multiple devices to perform simultaneous transmissions by controlling interference through Packet Detect (PD) adjustment and transmit power control. In particular, we focus on a Multi-Agent Multi-Armed Bandit (MA-MAB) setting, where multiple decision-making agents concurrently configure SR parameters from coexisting networks by leveraging the MAPC framework, and study various algorithms and reward-sharing mechanisms. We evaluate different MA-MAB implementations using Komondor, a well-adopted Wi-Fi simulator, and demonstrate that AI-native SR enabled by coordinated MABs can improve the network performance over current Wi-Fi operation: mean throughput increases by 15%, fairness is improved by increasing the minimum throughput across the network by 210%, while the maximum access delay is kept below 3 ms.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deep Learning-Based Diffusion MRI Tractography: Integrating Spatial and Anatomical Information](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03329v1)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion MRI tractography technique enables non-invasive visualization of the white matter pathways in the brain. It plays a crucial role in neuroscience and clinical fields by facilitating the study of brain connectivity and neurological disorders. However, the accuracy of reconstructed tractograms has been a longstanding challenge. Recently, deep learning methods have been applied to improve tractograms for better white matter coverage, but often comes at the expense of generating excessive false-positive connections. This is largely due to their reliance on local information to predict long range streamlines. To improve the accuracy of streamline propagation predictions, we introduce a novel deep learning framework that integrates image-domain spatial information and anatomical information along tracts, with the former extracted through convolutional layers and the later modeled via a Transformer-decoder. Additionally, we employ a weighted loss function to address fiber class imbalance encountered during training. We evaluate the proposed method on the simulated ISMRM 2015 Tractography Challenge dataset, achieving a valid streamline rate of 66.2%, white matter coverage of 63.8%, and successfully reconstructing 24 out of 25 bundles. Furthermore, on the multi-site Tractoinferno dataset, the proposed method demonstrates its ability to handle various diffusion MRI acquisition schemes, achieving a 5.7% increase in white matter coverage and a 4.1% decrease in overreach compared to RNN-based methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reduced Spatial Dependency for More General Video-level Deepfake Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03270v1)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As one of the prominent AI-generated content, Deepfake has raised significant safety concerns. Although it has been demonstrated that temporal consistency cues offer better generalization capability, existing methods based on CNNs inevitably introduce spatial bias, which hinders the extraction of intrinsic temporal features. To address this issue, we propose a novel method called Spatial Dependency Reduction (SDR), which integrates common temporal consistency features from multiple spatially-perturbed clusters, to reduce the dependency of the model on spatial information. Specifically, we design multiple Spatial Perturbation Branch (SPB) to construct spatially-perturbed feature clusters. Subsequently, we utilize the theory of mutual information and propose a Task-Relevant Feature Integration (TRFI) module to capture temporal features residing in similar latent space from these clusters. Finally, the integrated feature is fed into a temporal transformer to capture long-range dependencies. Extensive benchmarks and ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness and rationale of our approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 2 figures.

Currently, the inherent trade-off between constraint compliance and computational efficiency enhancement in UAV trajectory optimization problems has not been sufficiently addressed. To enhance the performance of UAV trajectory optimization, we propose a spatial-temporal iterative optimization framework. Firstly, B-splines are utilized to represent UAV trajectories, with rigorous safety assurance achieved through strict enforcement of constraints on control points. Subsequently, a set of QP-LP subproblems via spatial-temporal decoupling and constraint linearization is derived. Finally, an iterative optimization strategy incorporating guidance gradients is employed to obtain high-performance UAV trajectories in different scenarios. Both simulation and real-world experimental results validate the efficiency and high-performance of the proposed optimization framework in generating safe and fast trajectories.

| **[GravMAD: Grounded Spatial Value Maps Guided Action Diffusion for Generalized 3D Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20154v6)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robots' ability to follow language instructions and execute diverse 3D manipulation tasks is vital in robot learning. Traditional imitation learning-based methods perform well on seen tasks but struggle with novel, unseen ones due to variability. Recent approaches leverage large foundation models to assist in understanding novel tasks, thereby mitigating this issue. However, these methods lack a task-specific learning process, which is essential for an accurate understanding of 3D environments, often leading to execution failures. In this paper, we introduce GravMAD, a sub-goal-driven, language-conditioned action diffusion framework that combines the strengths of imitation learning and foundation models. Our approach breaks tasks into sub-goals based on language instructions, allowing auxiliary guidance during both training and inference. During training, we introduce Sub-goal Keypose Discovery to identify key sub-goals from demonstrations. Inference differs from training, as there are no demonstrations available, so we use pre-trained foundation models to bridge the gap and identify sub-goals for the current task. In both phases, GravMaps are generated from sub-goals, providing GravMAD with more flexible 3D spatial guidance compared to fixed 3D positions. Empirical evaluations on RLBench show that GravMAD significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, with a 28.63% improvement on novel tasks and a 13.36% gain on tasks encountered during training. Evaluations on real-world robotic tasks further show that GravMAD can reason about real-world tasks, associate them with relevant visual information, and generalize to novel tasks. These results demonstrate GravMAD's strong multi-task learning and generalization in 3D manipulation.

There is a bottleneck in scalable computation for general scientific use as the existing solutions require high-performance computing domain knowledge and are tailored for specific use cases. This study presents an R package `chopin` to reduce the technical burden for parallelization in geocomputation. Supporting popular spatial analysis packages in R, `chopin` leverages parallel computing by partitioning data that are involved in a computation task. The partitioning is implemented at regular grids, data hierarchies, and multiple file inputs with flexible input types for interoperability between different packages and efficiency. This approach makes the geospatial covariate calculation to the scale of the available processing power in a wide range of computing assets from laptop computers to high-performance computing infrastructure. Testing use cases in environmental exposure assessment demonstrated that the package reduced the execution time by order of processing units used. The work is expected to provide broader research communities using geospatial data with an efficient tool to process large scale data.</p></details> |  |

In scenarios such as household assistance and rescue, mobile robots need to understand a human command, such as "find a person wearing black". We present a novel vision-language navigation (VL-Nav) system that integrates efficient spatial reasoning on low-power robots. Unlike prior methods that rely on a single image-level feature similarity to guide a robot, our method integrates pixel-wise vision-language features with curiosity-driven exploration. This approach enables robust navigation to human-instructed instances across diverse environments. We deploy VL-Nav on a four-wheel mobile robot and evaluate its performance through comprehensive navigation tasks in both indoor and outdoor environments, spanning different scales and semantic complexities. Remarkably, VL-Nav operates at a real-time frequency of 30 Hz with a Jetson Orin NX, highlighting its ability to conduct efficient vision-language navigation. Results show that VL-Nav achieves an overall success rate of 86.3%, outperforming previous methods by 44.15%.</p></details> |  |

However, the performance gap between SNNs and ANNs remains a substantial challenge hindering the widespread adoption of SNNs. In this paper, we propose a Spatial-Temporal Attention Aggregator SNN (STAA-SNN) framework, which dynamically focuses on and captures both spatial and temporal dependencies. First, we introduce a spike-driven self-attention mechanism specifically designed for SNNs. Additionally, we pioneeringly incorporate position encoding to integrate latent temporal relationships into the incoming features. For spatial-temporal information aggregation, we employ step attention to selectively amplify relevant features at different steps. Finally, we implement a time-step random dropout strategy to avoid local optima. As a result, STAA-SNN effectively captures both spatial and temporal dependencies, enabling the model to analyze complex patterns and make accurate predictions. The framework demonstrates exceptional performance across diverse datasets and exhibits strong generalization capabilities. Notably, STAA-SNN achieves state-of-the-art results on neuromorphic datasets CIFAR10-DVS, with remarkable performances of 97.14%, 82.05% and 70.40% on the static datasets CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet, respectively. Furthermore, our model exhibits improved performance ranging from 0.33\% to 2.80\% with fewer time steps.

An Attention Mechanism Perspective on Focus Areas](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01773v2)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Vision Language Models (VLMs) have long struggled with spatial reasoning tasks. Surprisingly, even simple spatial reasoning tasks, such as recognizing "under" or "behind" relationships between only two objects, pose significant challenges for current VLMs. In this work, we study the spatial reasoning challenge from the lens of mechanistic interpretability, diving into the model's internal states to examine the interactions between image and text tokens. By tracing attention distribution over the image through out intermediate layers, we observe that successful spatial reasoning correlates strongly with the model's ability to align its attention distribution with actual object locations, particularly differing between familiar and unfamiliar spatial relationships. Motivated by these findings, we propose ADAPTVIS based on inference-time confidence scores to sharpen the attention on highly relevant regions when confident, while smoothing and broadening the attention window to consider a wider context when confidence is lower. This training-free decoding method shows significant improvement (e.g., up to a 50 absolute point improvement) on spatial reasoning benchmarks such as WhatsUp and VSR with negligible cost. We make code and data publicly available for research purposes at https://github.com/shiqichen17/AdaptVis.</p></details> |  |
| **[Regularized Principal Spline Functions to Mitigate Spatial Confounding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05373v2)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes a new approach to address the problem of unmeasured confounding in spatial designs. Spatial confounding occurs when some confounding variables are unobserved and not included in the model, leading to distorted inferential results about the effect of an exposure on an outcome. We show the relationship existing between the confounding bias of a non-spatial model and that of a semi-parametric model that includes a basis matrix to represent the unmeasured confounder conditional on the exposure. This relationship holds for any basis expansion, however it is shown that using the semi-parametric approach guarantees a reduction in the confounding bias only under certain circumstances, which are related to the spatial structures of the exposure and the unmeasured confounder, the type of basis expansion utilized, and the regularization mechanism. To adjust for spatial confounding, and therefore try to recover the effect of interest, we propose a Bayesian semi-parametric regression model, where an expansion matrix of principal spline basis functions is used to approximate the unobserved factor, and spike-and-slab priors are imposed on the respective expansion coefficients in order to select the most important bases. From the results of an extensive simulation study, we conclude that our proposal is able to reduce the confounding bias more than competing approaches, and it also seems more robust to bias amplification.</p></details> |  |

Nevertheless, the majority of current BEV map generation studies focusing on visual map generation lack depth-aware reasoning capabilities. They exhibit limited efficacy in managing occlusions and handling complex environments, with a notable decline in perceptual performance under adverse weather conditions or low-light scenarios. Therefore, this paper proposes TS-CGNet, which leverages Temporal-Spatial fusion with Centerline-Guided diffusion. This visual framework, grounded in prior knowledge, is designed for integration into any existing network for building BEV maps. Specifically, this framework is decoupled into three parts: Local mapping system involves the initial generation of semantic maps using purely visual information; The Temporal-Spatial Aligner Module (TSAM) integrates historical information into mapping generation by applying transformation matrices; The Centerline-Guided Diffusion Model (CGDM) is a prediction module based on the diffusion model. CGDM incorporates centerline information through spatial-attention mechanisms to enhance semantic segmentation reconstruction. We construct BEV semantic segmentation maps by our methods on the public nuScenes and the robustness benchmarks under various corruptions. Our method improves 1.90%, 1.73%, and 2.87% for perceived ranges of 60x30m, 120x60m, and 240x60m in the task of BEV HD mapping. TS-CGNet attains an improvement of 1.92% for perceived ranges of 100x100m in the task of BEV semantic mapping. Moreover, TS-CGNet achieves an average improvement of 2.92% in detection accuracy under varying weather conditions and sensor interferences in the perception range of 240x60m.

This paper proposes to resolve the above issues from a spatial-temporal modeling perspective. First, we propose a novel Temporally-smooth Procrustean Alignment module that estimates 3D deforming shapes and adjusts the camera motion by aligning the 3D shape sequence consecutively. Our new alignment module remedies the requirement of complex reference 3D shape during alignment, which is more conductive to non-isotropic deformation modeling. Second, we propose a spatial-weighted approach to enforce the low-rank constraint adaptively at different locations to accommodate drastic spatially-variant deformation reconstruction better. Our modeling outperform existing low-rank based methods, and extensive experiments across different datasets validate the effectiveness of our method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2024; The new version adds additional experiments and corrects typos</p></details> |

Emerging tissue profiling technologies enable the construction of a comprehensive atlas of the mammalian brain with sub-cellular resolution and spatially resolved gene expression data. However, such tera-scale volumetric datasets present significant computational challenges in understanding complex brain functions within their native 3D spatial context. Here, we propose the novel generative approach $\textbf{Tera-MIND}$, which can simulate $\textbf{Tera}$-scale $\textbf{M}$ouse bra$\textbf{IN}$s in 3D using a patch-based and boundary-aware $\textbf{D}$iffusion model. Taking spatial transcriptomic data as the conditional input, we generate virtual mouse brains with comprehensive cellular morphological detail at teravoxel scale. Through the lens of 3D $gene$-$gene$ self-attention, we identify spatial molecular interactions for key transcriptomic pathways in the murine brain, exemplified by glutamatergic and dopaminergic neuronal systems. Importantly, these $in$-$silico$ biological findings are consistent and reproducible across three tera-scale virtual mouse brains. Therefore, Tera-MIND showcases a promising path toward efficient and generative simulations of whole organ systems for biomedical research.

However, many works focus on tweaking existing 2D backbones due to the reliance of ImageNet pretraining, which restrains the models from achieving higher efficiency for video recognition. In this work we introduce a simple and very efficient 3D convolutional neural network for video action recognition. The design of the building block consists of a channel-wise convolution, followed by a spatial group convolution, and finally a temporal convolution. We evaluate the performance and efficiency of our proposed network on several video action recognition datasets by directly training on the target dataset without relying on pertaining. On Something-Something-V1&V2, Kinetics-400 and Multi-Moments in Time, our network can match or even surpass the performance of other models which are several times larger. On the fine-grained action recognition dataset FineGym, we beat the previous state-of-the-art accuracy achieved with 2-stream methods by more than 5% using only RGB input.</p></details> |  |

Analysis of Basketball Shot Charts via Log Gaussian Cox Processes with Spatially Varying Coefficients](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02137v1)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Basketball shot charts provide valuable information regarding local patterns of in-game performance to coaches, players, sports analysts, and statisticians. The spatial patterns of where shots were attempted and whether the shots were successful suggest options for offensive and defensive strategies as well as historical summaries of performance against particular teams and players. The data represent a marked spatio-temporal point process with locations representing locations of attempted shots and an associated mark representing the shot's outcome (made/missed). Here, we develop a Bayesian log Gaussian Cox process model allowing joint analysis of the spatial pattern of locations and outcomes of shots across multiple games. We build a hierarchical model for the log intensity function using Gaussian processes, and allow spatially varying effects for various game-specific covariates. We aim to model the spatial relative risk under different covariate values. For inference via posterior simulation, we design a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm based on a kernel convolution approach. We illustrate the proposed method using extensive simulation studies. A case study analyzing the shot data of NBA legends Stephen Curry, LeBron James, and Michael Jordan highlights the effectiveness of our approach in real-world scenarios and provides practical insights into optimizing shooting strategies by examining how different playing conditions, game locations, and opposing team strengths impact shooting efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[HanDrawer: Leveraging Spatial Information to Render Realistic Hands Using a Conditional Diffusion Model in Single Stage](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02127v1)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although diffusion methods excel in text-to-image generation, generating accurate hand gestures remains a major challenge, resulting in severe artifacts, such as incorrect number of fingers or unnatural gestures. To enable the diffusion model to learn spatial information to improve the quality of the hands generated, we propose HanDrawer, a module to condition the hand generation process. Specifically, we apply graph convolutional layers to extract the endogenous spatial structure and physical constraints implicit in MANO hand mesh vertices. We then align and fuse these spatial features with other modalities via cross-attention. The spatially fused features are used to guide a single stage diffusion model denoising process for high quality generation of the hand region. To improve the accuracy of spatial feature fusion, we propose a Position-Preserving Zero Padding (PPZP) fusion strategy, which ensures that the features extracted by HanDrawer are fused into the region of interest in the relevant layers of the diffusion model. HanDrawer learns the entire image features while paying special attention to the hand region thanks to an additional hand reconstruction loss combined with the denoising loss. To accurately train and evaluate our approach, we perform careful cleansing and relabeling of the widely used HaGRID hand gesture dataset and obtain high quality multimodal data. Quantitative and qualitative analyses demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our method on the HaGRID dataset through multiple evaluation metrics. Source code and our enhanced dataset will be released publicly if the paper is accepted.</p></details> | 9 pages |

The available data are extremely large, making uncertainty quantification in a fully Bayesian framework quite difficult, as traditional implementations do not scale reasonably to the size of the data. We specifically consider roughly 8 million observations obtained from NASA's Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instrument. To analyze data on this scale, we introduce Scalable Multivariate Exact Posterior Regression (SM-EPR) which combines the recently introduced data subset approach and Exact Posterior Regression (EPR). EPR is a new Bayesian hierarchical model where it is possible to sample independent replicates of fixed and random effects directly from the posterior without the use of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). We extend EPR to the multivariate spatial context, where the multiple variables may be distributed according to different distributions. The combination of the data subset approach with EPR allows one to perform exact Bayesian inference without MCMC for effectively any sample size. Additional motivation is provided via technical results illustrating favorable Kullback-Leibler and covariance properties. We demonstrate SM-EPR using a motivating big remote sensing data application and provide several simulations.</p></details> |  |

However, its practical deployment is hindered by the coupled challenges posed by high-dimensional channel estimation and real-time position optimization. This paper bridges wireless propagation physics with compressed sensing theory to address these challenges through three aspects. First, we establish a group-sparse recovery framework for space-frequency characteristics (SFC) in FAS, formally characterizing leakage-induced sparsity degradation from limited aperture and bandwidth as a structured group-sparsity problem. By deriving dictionary-adapted group restricted isometry property (D-GRIP), we prove tight recovery bounds for a convex $\ell_1/\ell_2$-mixed norm optimization formulation that preserves leakage-aware sparsity patterns. Second, we develop a Descending Correlation Group Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (DC-GOMP) algorithm that systematically relaxes leakage constraints to reduce subcoherence. This approach enables robust FSC recovery with accelerated convergence and superior performance compared to conventional compressive sensing methods like OMP or GOMP. Third, we formulate spatial equalization (SE) as a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem, ensuring optimality through the branch-and-bound method. To achieve real-time implementability while maintaining near-optimal performance, we complement this with a greedy algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate the proposed channel estimation algorithm effectively resolves energy misallocation and enables recovery of weak details, achieving superior recovery accuracy and convergence rate. The SE framework suppresses deep fading phenomena and reduces hardware deployment overhead while maintaining equivalent link reliability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spiking Transformer with Spatial-Temporal Attention](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19764v3)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spike-based Transformer presents a compelling and energy-efficient alternative to traditional Artificial Neural Network (ANN)-based Transformers, achieving impressive results through sparse binary computations. However, existing spike-based transformers predominantly focus on spatial attention while neglecting crucial temporal dependencies inherent in spike-based processing, leading to suboptimal feature representation and limited performance. To address this limitation, we propose Spiking Transformer with Spatial-Temporal Attention (STAtten), a simple and straightforward architecture that efficiently integrates both spatial and temporal information in the self-attention mechanism. STAtten introduces a block-wise computation strategy that processes information in spatial-temporal chunks, enabling comprehensive feature capture while maintaining the same computational complexity as previous spatial-only approaches. Our method can be seamlessly integrated into existing spike-based transformers without architectural overhaul. Extensive experiments demonstrate that STAtten significantly improves the performance of existing spike-based transformers across both static and neuromorphic datasets, including CIFAR10/100, ImageNet, CIFAR10-DVS, and N-Caltech101.

However, they typically perform well in scenes with a single object and motion, struggling in compositional scenarios with multiple objects and distinct motions to accurately reflect the semantic content of text prompts. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{StarVid}, a plug-and-play, training-free method that improves semantic alignment between multiple subjects, their motions, and text prompts in T2V models. StarVid first leverages the spatial reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) for two-stage motion trajectory planning based on text prompts. Such trajectories serve as spatial priors, guiding a spatial-aware loss to refocus cross-attention (CA) maps into distinctive regions. Furthermore, we propose a syntax-guided contrastive constraint to strengthen the correlation between the CA maps of verbs and their corresponding nouns, enhancing motion-subject binding. Both qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly outperforms baseline methods, delivering videos of higher quality with improved semantic consistency.</p></details> |  |

Previous methods for spatial gene expression prediction usually crop spots of interest from pathology tissue slide images, and learn a model that maps each spot to a single gene expression profile. However, it fundamentally loses spatial resolution of gene expression: 1) each spot often contains multiple cells with distinct gene expression; 2) spots are cropped at fixed resolutions, limiting the ability to predict gene expression at varying spatial scales. To address these limitations, this paper presents PixNet, a dense prediction network capable of predicting spatially resolved gene expression across spots of varying sizes and scales directly from pathology images. Different from previous methods that map individual spots to gene expression values, we generate a dense continuous gene expression map from the pathology image, and aggregate values within spots of interest to predict the gene expression. Our PixNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods on 3 common ST datasets, while showing superior performance in predicting gene expression across multiple spatial scales. The source code will be publicly available.</p></details> |  |
| **[STGAN: Spatial-temporal Graph Autoregression Network for Pavement Distress Deterioration Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01152v1)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pavement distress significantly compromises road integrity and poses risks to drivers. Accurate prediction of pavement distress deterioration is essential for effective road management, cost reduction in maintenance, and improvement of traffic safety. However, real-world data on pavement distress is usually collected irregularly, resulting in uneven, asynchronous, and sparse spatial-temporal datasets. This hinders the application of existing spatial-temporal models, such as DCRNN, since they are only applicable to regularly and synchronously collected data. To overcome these challenges, we propose the Spatial-Temporal Graph Autoregression Network (STGAN), a novel graph neural network model designed for accurately predicting irregular pavement distress deterioration using complex spatial-temporal data. Specifically, STGAN integrates the temporal domain into the spatial domain, creating a larger graph where nodes are represented by spatial-temporal tuples and edges are formed based on a similarity-based connection mechanism. Furthermore, based on the constructed spatiotemporal graph, we formulate pavement distress deterioration prediction as a graph autoregression task, i.e., the graph size increases incrementally and the prediction is performed sequentially. This is accomplished by a novel spatial-temporal attention mechanism deployed by STGAN. Utilizing the ConTrack dataset, which contains pavement distress records collected from different locations in Shanghai, we demonstrate the superior performance of STGAN in capturing spatial-temporal correlations and addressing the aforementioned challenges. Experimental results further show that STGAN outperforms baseline models, and ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of its novel modules. Our findings contribute to promoting proactive road maintenance decision-making and ultimately enhancing road safety and resilience.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 16 figures, 4 tables, accepted by IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems (TITS)</p></details> |

Compared to classic STVG locating only a single target, OmniSTVG enables localization of not only an arbitrary number of text-referred targets but also their interacting counterparts in the query from the video, making it more flexible and practical in real scenarios for comprehensive understanding. In order to facilitate exploration of OmniSTVG, we introduce BOSTVG, a large-scale benchmark dedicated to OmniSTVG. Specifically, our BOSTVG consists of 10,018 videos with 10.2M frames and covers a wide selection of 287 classes from diverse scenarios. Each sequence in BOSTVG, paired with a free-form textual query, encompasses a varying number of targets ranging from 1 to 10.

| **[Inductive Spatio-Temporal Kriging with Physics-Guided Increment Training Strategy for Air Quality Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09646v1)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The deployment of sensors for air quality monitoring is constrained by high costs, leading to inadequate network coverage and data deficits in some areas. Utilizing existing observations, spatio-temporal kriging is a method for estimating air quality at unobserved locations during a specific period. Inductive spatio-temporal kriging with increment training strategy has demonstrated its effectiveness using virtual nodes to simulate unobserved nodes. However, a disparity between virtual and real nodes persists, complicating the application of learning patterns derived from virtual nodes to actual unobserved ones. To address these limitations, this paper presents a Physics-Guided Increment Training Strategy (PGITS). Specifically, we design a dynamic graph generation module to incorporate the advection and diffusion processes of airborne particles as physical knowledge into the graph structure, dynamically adjusting the adjacency matrix to reflect physical interactions between nodes. By using physics principles as a bridge between virtual and real nodes, this strategy ensures the features of virtual nodes and their pseudo labels are closer to actual nodes. Consequently, the learned patterns of virtual nodes can be applied to actual unobserved nodes for effective kriging.</p></details> |  |

Such data occurs widely, ranging from the scientific and medical domains to the industrial and environmental domains. When the properties in time series exhibit spatial variations, we often call the data spatio-temporal. As part of the continued digitalization of processes throughout society, increasingly large volumes of time series and spatio-temporal data are available. In this tutorial, we focus on data-driven decision making with such data, e.g., enabling greener and more efficient transportation based on traffic time series forecasting. The tutorial adopts the holistic paradigm of "data-governance-analytics-decision." We first introduce the data foundation of time series and spatio-temporal data, which is often heterogeneous. Next, we discuss data governance methods that aim to improve data quality. We then cover data analytics, focusing on five desired characteristics: automation, robustness, generality, explainability, and resource efficiency. We finally cover data-driven decision making strategies and briefly discuss promising research directions. We hope that the tutorial will serve as a primary resource for researchers and practitioners who are interested in value creation from time series and spatio-temporal data.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted by ICDE 2025</p></details> |
| **[Efficient Traffic Prediction Through Spatio-Temporal Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10459v2)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) have gained considerable attention in recent years for traffic flow prediction due to their ability to learn spatio-temporal pattern representations through a graph-based message-passing framework. Although GNNs have shown great promise in handling traffic datasets, their deployment in real-life applications has been hindered by scalability constraints arising from high-order message passing. Additionally, the over-smoothing problem of GNNs may lead to indistinguishable region representations as the number of layers increases, resulting in performance degradation. To address these challenges, we propose a new knowledge distillation paradigm termed LightST that transfers spatial and temporal knowledge from a high-capacity teacher to a lightweight student. Specifically, we introduce a spatio-temporal knowledge distillation framework that helps student MLPs capture graph-structured global spatio-temporal patterns while alleviating the over-smoothing effect with adaptive knowledge distillation. Extensive experiments verify that LightST significantly speeds up traffic flow predictions by 5X to 40X compared to state-of-the-art spatio-temporal GNNs, all while maintaining superior accuracy.</p></details> | 9 pages |

Due to the inherent uncertainty in vessel behavior, trajectory prediction systems must adopt a multimodal approach to accurately model potential future motion states. However, existing vessel trajectory prediction methods lack the ability to comprehensively model behavioral multi-modality. To better capture multimodal behavior in interactive scenarios, we propose modeling interactions as dynamic graphs, replacing traditional aggregation-based techniques that rely on vessel states. By leveraging the natural multimodal capabilities of diffusion models, we frame the trajectory prediction task as an inverse process of motion uncertainty diffusion, wherein uncertainties across potential navigational areas are progressively eliminated until the desired trajectories is produced. In summary, we pioneer the integration of Spatio-Temporal Graph (STG) with diffusion models in ship trajectory prediction. Extensive experiments on real Automatic Identification System (AIS) data validate the superiority of our approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been ACCEPTED as a FULL PAPER at DASFAA 2025</p></details> |
| **[STEAD: Spatio-Temporal Efficient Anomaly Detection for Time and Compute Sensitive Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07942v1)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a new method for anomaly detection in automated systems with time and compute sensitive requirements, such as autonomous driving, with unparalleled efficiency. As systems like autonomous driving become increasingly popular, ensuring their safety has become more important than ever. Therefore, this paper focuses on how to quickly and effectively detect various anomalies in the aforementioned systems, with the goal of making them safer and more effective. Many detection systems have been developed with great success under spatial contexts; however, there is still significant room for improvement when it comes to temporal context. While there is substantial work regarding this task, there is minimal work done regarding the efficiency of models and their ability to be applied to scenarios that require real-time inference, i.e., autonomous driving where anomalies need to be detected the moment they are within view. To address this gap, we propose STEAD (Spatio-Temporal Efficient Anomaly Detection), whose backbone is developed using (2+1)D Convolutions and Performer Linear Attention, which ensures computational efficiency without sacrificing performance. When tested on the UCF-Crime benchmark, our base model achieves an AUC of 91.34%, outperforming the previous state-of-the-art, and our fast version achieves an AUC of 88.87%, while having 99.70% less parameters and outperforming the previous state-of-the-art as well.

Deep Learning (DL), particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs), have revolutionized this field by enhancing the accuracy of classification tasks. In this work, a novel approach combining a transformer-based Swin-Unet architecture with seasonal synthesized spatio-temporal images has been employed to classify LC types using spatio-temporal features extracted from Sentinel-1 (S1) Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data, organized into seasonal clusters. The study focuses on three distinct regions - Amazonia, Africa, and Siberia - and evaluates the model performance across diverse ecoregions within these areas. By utilizing seasonal feature sequences instead of dense temporal sequences, notable performance improvements have been achieved, especially in regions with temporal data gaps like Siberia, where S1 data distribution is uneven and non-uniform. The results demonstrate the effectiveness and the generalization capabilities of the proposed methodology in achieving high overall accuracy (O.A.) values, even in regions with limited training data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing</p></details> |
| **[Temporal Reversal Regularization for Spiking Neural Networks: Hybrid Spatio-Temporal Invariance for Generalization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09108v3)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have received widespread attention as an ultra-low power computing paradigm. Recent studies have shown that SNNs suffer from severe overfitting, which limits their generalization performance. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective Temporal Reversal Regularization (TRR) to mitigate overfitting during training and facilitate generalization of SNNs. We exploit the inherent temporal properties of SNNs to perform input/feature temporal reversal perturbations, prompting the SNN to produce original-reversed consistent outputs and learn perturbation-invariant representations. To further enhance generalization, we utilize the lightweight ``star operation" (Hadamard product) for feature hybridization of original and temporally reversed spike firing rates, which expands the implicit dimensionality and acts as a spatio-temporal regularizer. We show theoretically that our method is able to tighten the upper bound of the generalization error, and extensive experiments on static/neuromorphic recognition as well as 3D point cloud classification tasks demonstrate its effectiveness, versatility, and adversarial robustness. In particular, our regularization significantly improves the recognition accuracy of low-latency SNN for neuromorphic objects, contributing to the real-world deployment of neuromorphic computational software-hardware integration.</p></details> | 17 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Leveraging Consistent Spatio-Temporal Correspondence for Robust Visual Odometry](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16923v4)** | 2025-03-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent approaches to VO have significantly improved performance by using deep networks to predict optical flow between video frames. However, existing methods still suffer from noisy and inconsistent flow matching, making it difficult to handle challenging scenarios and long-sequence estimation. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Spatio-Temporal Visual Odometry (STVO), a novel deep network architecture that effectively leverages inherent spatio-temporal cues to enhance the accuracy and consistency of multi-frame flow matching. With more accurate and consistent flow matching, STVO can achieve better pose estimation through the bundle adjustment (BA). Specifically, STVO introduces two innovative components: 1) the Temporal Propagation Module that utilizes multi-frame information to extract and propagate temporal cues across adjacent frames, maintaining temporal consistency; 2) the Spatial Activation Module that utilizes geometric priors from the depth maps to enhance spatial consistency while filtering out excessive noise and incorrect matches. Our STVO achieves state-of-the-art performance on TUM-RGBD, EuRoc MAV, ETH3D and KITTI Odometry benchmarks. Notably, it improves accuracy by 77.8% on ETH3D benchmark and 38.9% on KITTI Odometry benchmark over the previous best methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[DropletVideo: A Dataset and Approach to Explore Integral Spatio-Temporal Consistent Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06053v1)** | 2025-03-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal consistency is a critical research topic in video generation. A qualified generated video segment must ensure plot plausibility and coherence while maintaining visual consistency of objects and scenes across varying viewpoints. Prior research, especially in open-source projects, primarily focuses on either temporal or spatial consistency, or their basic combination, such as appending a description of a camera movement after a prompt without constraining the outcomes of this movement. However, camera movement may introduce new objects to the scene or eliminate existing ones, thereby overlaying and affecting the preceding narrative. Especially in videos with numerous camera movements, the interplay between multiple plots becomes increasingly complex. This paper introduces and examines integral spatio-temporal consistency, considering the synergy between plot progression and camera techniques, and the long-term impact of prior content on subsequent generation. Our research encompasses dataset construction through to the development of the model. Initially, we constructed a DropletVideo-10M dataset, which comprises 10 million videos featuring dynamic camera motion and object actions. Each video is annotated with an average caption of 206 words, detailing various camera movements and plot developments. Following this, we developed and trained the DropletVideo model, which excels in preserving spatio-temporal coherence during video generation. The DropletVideo dataset and model are accessible at https://dropletx.github.io.</p></details> |  |

However, understanding the predictions from a model is crucial to ensure reliability and trustworthiness, particularly for high-risk applications, such as healthcare and transport. Few existing methods are able to generate explanations for models trained on continuous-time dynamic graph data and, of these, the computational complexity and lack of suitable explanation objectives pose challenges. In this paper, we propose $\textbf{S}$patio-$\textbf{T}$emporal E$\textbf{X}$planation $\textbf{Search}$ (STX-Search), a novel method for generating instance-level explanations that is applicable to static and dynamic temporal graph structures. We introduce a novel search strategy and objective function, to find explanations that are highly faithful and interpretable. When compared with existing methods, STX-Search produces explanations of higher fidelity whilst optimising explanation size to maintain interpretability.</p></details> |  |

Traditional approaches have relied on separate models tailored to either grid-based data, representing cities as uniform cells, or graph-based data, modeling cities as networks of nodes and edges. In this paper, we build UniFlow, a foundational model for general urban flow prediction that unifies both grid-based and graphbased data. We first design a multi-view spatio-temporal patching mechanism to standardize different data into a consistent sequential format and then introduce a spatio-temporal transformer architecture to capture complex correlations and dynamics. To leverage shared spatio-temporal patterns across different data types and facilitate effective cross-learning, we propose SpatioTemporal Memory Retrieval Augmentation (ST-MRA). By creating structured memory modules to store shared spatio-temporal patterns, ST-MRA enhances predictions through adaptive memory retrieval. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniFlow outperforms existing models in both grid-based and graph-based flow prediction, excelling particularly in scenarios with limited data availability, showcasing its superior performance and broad applicability. The datasets and code implementation have been released on https://github.com/YuanYuan98/UniFlow.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we demonstrate that effective information compression may occur over time or space during sequences of node communications in distributed algorithms, leading to the concept of spatio-temporal compressors. This abstraction classifies existing compressors as spatio-temporal compressors, with their effectiveness described by constructive stability criteria from nonlinear system theory. Subsequently, we apply these spatio-temporal compressors to standard continuous-time consensus flows and distributed prime-dual flows, establishing conditions ensuring convergence. Additionally, we introduce a novel observer-based distributed primal-dual continuous flow integrated with spatio-temporal compressors, which provides broader convergence conditions. These continuous flows achieve exponential convergence to the global optimum when the objective function is strongly convex and can be discretized using Euler approximations. Finally, numerical simulations illustrate the versatility of the proposed spatio-temporal compressors and verify the convergence of algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2408.02332</p></details> |

State-of-the-art association methods in agriculture are dedicated towards matching larger crops using either high-resolution point clouds or temporally stable features, which are both difficult to obtain for smaller fruit in the field. To address these challenges, we propose a transformer-based architecture that encodes the shape and position of each fruitlet, and propagates and refines these features through a series of transformer encoder layers with alternating self and cross-attention. We demonstrate that our method is able to achieve an F1-score of 92.4% on data collected in a commercial apple orchard and outperforms all baselines and ablations.</p></details> |  |

The standard neuron model for spike-based computation on such systems has long been the leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neuron. A computationally light augmentation of the LIF neuron model with an adaptation mechanism has recently been shown to exhibit superior performance on spatio-temporal processing tasks. The root of the superiority of these so-called adaptive LIF neurons however is not well understood. In this article, we thoroughly analyze the dynamical, computational, and learning properties of adaptive LIF neurons and networks thereof. Our investigation reveals significant challenges related to stability and parameterization when employing the conventional Euler-Forward discretization for this class of models. We report a rigorous theoretical and empirical demonstration that these challenges can be effectively addressed by adopting an alternative discretization approach - the Symplectic Euler method, allowing to improve over state-of-the-art performances on common event-based benchmark datasets. Our further analysis of the computational properties of networks of adaptive LIF neurons shows that they are particularly well suited to exploit the spatio-temporal structure of input sequences without any normalization techniques.</p></details> |  |

Here we present new generally applicable methodology to perform this task. We introduce a parsimonious representation of seasonality and a biologically informed specification of the outbreak component to avoid parameter identifiability issues. We develop a computationally efficient Bayesian inference methodology for the proposed models, including techniques to detect outbreaks by computing marginal posterior probabilities at each spatial location and time point. We show that it is possible to efficiently integrate out the discrete parameters associated with outbreak states, enabling the use of dynamic Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) as a complementary alternative to a hybrid Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm. Furthermore, we introduce a robust Bayesian model comparison framework based on importance sampling to approximate model evidence in high-dimensional space. The performance of our methodology is validated through systematic simulation studies, where simulated outbreaks were successfully detected, and our model comparison strategy demonstrates strong reliability. We also apply our new methodology to monthly incidence data on invasive meningococcal disease from 28 European countries. The results highlight outbreaks across multiple countries and months, with model comparison analysis showing that the new specification outperforms previous approaches.

To achieve this goal, we propose the Spatio-Temporal Memory Agent (STMA), a novel framework designed to enhance task planning and execution by integrating spatio-temporal memory. STMA is built upon three critical components: (1) a spatio-temporal memory module that captures historical and environmental changes in real time, (2) a dynamic knowledge graph that facilitates adaptive spatial reasoning, and (3) a planner-critic mechanism that iteratively refines task strategies. We evaluate STMA in the TextWorld environment on 32 tasks, involving multi-step planning and exploration under varying levels of complexity. Experimental results demonstrate that STMA achieves a 31.25% improvement in success rate and a 24.7% increase in average score compared to the state-of-the-art model.

Inspired by recent advances in vision-language foundation models, we investigate their utility for WSTVG, leveraging their zero-shot grounding capabilities. However, we find that a simple adaptation lacks essential spatio-temporal grounding abilities. To bridge this gap, we introduce Tubelet Referral Grounding (TRG), which connects textual queries to tubelets to enable spatio-temporal predictions. Despite its promise, TRG struggles with compositional action understanding and dense scene scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose STPro, a novel progressive learning framework with two key modules: (1) Sub-Action Temporal Curriculum Learning (SA-TCL), which incrementally builds compositional action understanding, and (2) Congestion-Guided Spatial Curriculum Learning (CG-SCL), which adapts the model to complex scenes by spatially increasing task difficulty. STPro achieves state-of-the-art results on three benchmark datasets, with improvements of 1.0% on VidSTG-Declarative and 3.0% on HCSTVG-v1.</p></details> | CVPR'25 Conference |

To address these limitations, this paper presents the Spatio-Temporal GraphFormer framework (STGFormer) for 3D human pose estimation in videos. First, we introduce a Spatio-Temporal criss-cross Graph (STG) attention mechanism, designed to more effectively leverage the inherent graph priors of the human body within continuous sequence distributions while capturing spatiotemporal long-range dependencies. Next, we present a dual-path Modulated Hop-wise Regular GCN (MHR-GCN) to independently process temporal and spatial dimensions in parallel, preserving features rich in temporal dynamics and the original or high-dimensional representations of spatial structures. Furthermore, the module leverages modulation to optimize parameter efficiency and incorporates spatiotemporal hop-wise skip connections to capture higher-order information. Finally, we demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Human3.6M and MPIINF-3DHP datasets.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces the Hierarchical Federated Learning Transformer Network (H-FLTN) framework to address these challenges. H-FLTN employs a three-tier hierarchical architecture comprising EVs, community Distributed Energy Resource Management Systems (DERMS), and the Energy Provider Data Centre (EPDC) to enable accurate spatio-temporal predictions of EV charging needs while preserving privacy. Temporal prediction is enhanced using Transformer-based learning, capturing complex dependencies in charging behavior. Privacy is ensured through Secure Aggregation, Additive Secret Sharing, and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Sharing with Augmentation, which allow only secret shares of model weights to be exchanged while securing all transmissions. To improve training efficiency and resource management, H-FLTN integrates Dynamic Client Capping Mechanism (DCCM) and Client Rotation Management (CRM), ensuring that training remains both computationally and temporally efficient as the number of participating EVs increases. DCCM optimises client participation by limiting excessive computational loads, while CRM balances training contributions across epochs, preventing imbalanced participation. Our simulation results based on large-scale empirical vehicle mobility data reveal that DCCM and CRM reduce the training time complexity with increasing EVs from linear to constant. Its integration into real-world smart city infrastructure enhances energy demand forecasting, resource allocation, and grid stability, ensuring reliability and sustainability in future mobility ecosystems.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 7 tables, 2 figures, Journal Paper</p></details> |

Recently, advancements in monitoring technology have facilitated the effective recording of nuclear radiation levels and related factors, such as weather conditions. The abundance of monitoring data enables the development of accurate and reliable nuclear radiation forecasting models, which play a crucial role in informing decision-making for individuals and governments. However, this task is challenging due to the imbalanced distribution of monitoring stations over a wide spatial range and the non-stationary radiation variation patterns. In this study, we introduce NRFormer, a novel framework tailored for the nationwide prediction of nuclear radiation variations. By integrating a non-stationary temporal attention module, an imbalance-aware spatial attention module, and a radiation propagation prompting module, NRFormer collectively captures complex spatio-temporal dynamics of nuclear radiation.

However, traditional approaches to assess patient actions often rely on manual observation and scoring, which are subjective and time-consuming. In this paper, we propose an automated approach for patient action assessment using a Multi-Residual Spatio Temporal Graph Network (MR-STGN) that incorporates both angular and positional 3D skeletons. The MR-STGN is specifically designed to capture the spatio-temporal dynamics of patient actions. It achieves this by integrating information from multiple residual layers, with each layer extracting features at distinct levels of abstraction. Furthermore, we integrate an attention fusion mechanism into the network, which facilitates the adaptive weighting of various features. This empowers the model to concentrate on the most pertinent aspects of the patient's movements, offering precise instructions regarding specific body parts or movements that require attention. Ablation studies are conducted to analyze the impact of individual components within the proposed model.

Based on the analysis of localized displacement phenomenon, we establish the relationship between the characteristic strain rate extreme events and the local slip state. This approach enables the detection of both the spatial distribution and temporal dynamics of stick-slip regions. Also, the proposed method can be applied to strain distribution sensing devices, such as vision-based tactile sensors. Simulations and prototype experiments validated the effectiveness of this approach under varying contact conditions, including different contact geometries, friction coefficients, and combined loads. Experiments demonstrated that this method not only accurately and reliably delineates incipient slip, but also facilitates friction parameter estimation and adaptive grasping control.</p></details> | 21 pages, 19 figures |

However, most approaches are based on the assumption of the availability of and accessibility to a sufficiently dense data source, which is rather the rare case in reality. Traffic sensors in road networks are generally highly sparse in their distribution: fleet-based traffic sensing is sparse in space but also sparse in time. There are also other traffic application, besides road traffic, like moving objects in the marine space, where observations are sparsely and arbitrarily distributed in space. In this paper, we tackle the problem of traffic prediction on sparse and spatially irregular and non-deterministic traffic observations. We draw a border between imputations and this work as we consider high sparsity rates and no fixed sensor locations. We advance correlation mining methods with a Sparse Unstructured Spatio Temporal Reconstruction (SUSTeR) framework that reconstructs traffic states from sparse non-stationary observations. For the prediction the framework creates a hidden context traffic state which is enriched in a residual fashion with each observation. Such an assimilated hidden traffic state can be used by existing traffic prediction methods to predict future traffic states. We query these states with query locations from the spatial domain.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted and presented at ACM SIGSPATIAL '23</p></details> |

However, existing whole-body-object interaction video benchmarks overlook the truth that open-world objects are diverse, that is, they usually provide limited and predefined object classes. Therefore, we introduce a new open-world benchmark: Grounding Interacted Objects (GIO) including 1,098 interacted objects class and 290K interacted object boxes annotation. Accordingly, an object grounding task is proposed expecting vision systems to discover interacted objects. Even though today's detectors and grounding methods have succeeded greatly, they perform unsatisfactorily in localizing diverse and rare objects in GIO. This profoundly reveals the limitations of current vision systems and poses a great challenge. Thus, we explore leveraging spatio-temporal cues to address object grounding and propose a 4D question-answering framework (4D-QA) to discover interacted objects from diverse videos. Our method demonstrates significant superiority in extensive experiments compared to current baselines.

HD EEG devices improve the spatial resolution of EEG by placing more electrodes on the scalp, which meet the requirements of clinical diagnostic applications such as epilepsy focus localization. However, this technique faces challenges, such as high acquisition costs and limited usage scenarios. In this paper, spatio-temporal adaptive diffusion models (STAD) are proposed to pioneer the use of diffusion models for achieving spatial SR reconstruction from low-resolution (LR, 64 channels or fewer) EEG to high-resolution (HR, 256 channels) EEG. Specifically, a spatio-temporal condition module is designed to extract the spatio-temporal features of LR EEG, which are then used as conditional inputs to direct the reverse denoising process. Additionally, a multi-scale Transformer denoising module is constructed to leverage multi-scale convolution blocks and cross-attention-based diffusion Transformer blocks for conditional guidance to generate subject-adaptive SR EEG. Experimental results demonstrate that the STAD significantly enhances the spatial resolution of LR EEG and quantitatively outperforms existing methods. Furthermore, STAD demonstrate their value by applying synthetic SR EEG to classification and source localization tasks, indicating their potential to substantially boost the spatial resolution of EEG.</p></details> |  |

With around 2000 ball events per game, their precise and exhaustive annotation based on a monocular video stream remains a tedious and costly manual task. While state-of-the-art spatio-temporal action detection methods show promise for automating this task, they lack contextual understanding of the game. Assuming professional players' behaviors are interdependent, we hypothesize that incorporating surrounding players' information such as positions, velocity and team membership can enhance purely visual predictions. We propose a spatio-temporal action detection approach that combines visual and game state information via Graph Neural Networks trained end-to-end with state-of-the-art 3D CNNs, demonstrating improved metrics through game state integration.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Fixed Variables: Expanding-variate Time Series Forecasting via Flat Scheme and Spatio-temporal Focal Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15296v1)** | 2025-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate Time Series Forecasting (MTSF) has long been a key research focus. Traditionally, these studies assume a fixed number of variables, but in real-world applications, Cyber-Physical Systems often expand as new sensors are deployed, increasing variables in MTSF. In light of this, we introduce a novel task, Expanding-variate Time Series Forecasting (EVTSF). This task presents unique challenges, specifically (1) handling inconsistent data shapes caused by adding new variables, and (2) addressing imbalanced spatio-temporal learning, where expanding variables have limited observed data due to the necessity for timely operation. To address these challenges, we propose STEV, a flexible spatio-temporal forecasting framework. STEV includes a new Flat Scheme to tackle the inconsistent data shape issue, which extends the graph-based spatio-temporal modeling architecture into 1D space by flattening the 2D samples along the variable dimension, making the model variable-scale-agnostic while still preserving dynamic spatial correlations through a holistic graph. We introduce a novel Spatio-temporal Focal Learning strategy that incorporates a negative filter to resolve potential conflicts between contrastive learning and graph representation, and a focal contrastive loss as its core to guide the framework to focus on optimizing the expanding variables. We benchmark EVTSF performance using three real-world datasets and compare it against three potential solutions employing SOTA MTSF models tailored for EVSTF. Experimental results show that STEV significantly outperforms its competitors, particularly on expanding variables. Notably, STEV, with only 5% of observations from the expanding period, is on par with SOTA MTSF models trained with complete observations. Further exploration of various expanding strategies underscores the generalizability of STEV in real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

In a graphon particle system, the interactions among particles are characterized by the coupled mean field terms through an underlying graphon and the randomness of the coefficients comes from the stochastic processes associated with the particle labels. By constructing two-level approximated sequences converging in 2-Wasserstein distance, we prove the existence and uniqueness of the solution to the system. Besides, by constructing two-level approximated functions converging to the graphon mean field terms, we establish the law of large numbers, which reveals that if the number of particles tends to infinity and the discretization step tends to zero, then the discrete-time interacting particle system over a large-scale network converges to the graphon particle system. As a byproduct, we discover that the graphon particle system can describe the limiting dynamics of the distributed stochastic gradient descent algorithm over the large-scale network and prove that if the gradients of the local cost functions are Lipschitz continuous, then the graphon particle system can be regarded as the spatio-temporal approximation of the discrete-time distributed stochastic gradient descent algorithm as the number of network nodes tends to infinity and the algorithm step size tends to zero.</p></details> |  |

Compared with the traditional trajectory composed of a set of point-estimates obtained by a tracker in the measurement time-series, the trajectory that our series of studies including this paper pursued is given by a curve function of time (FoT). The trajectory FoT provides complete information of the movement of the target over time and can be used to infer the state corresponding to arbitrary time, not only at the measurement time. However, there are no metrics available for comparing and evaluating the trajectory FoT. To address this lacuna, we propose a metric denominated as the spatiotemporal-aligned trajectory integral distance (Star-ID). The StarID associates and aligns the estimated and actual trajectories in the spatio-temporal domain and distinguishes between the time-aligned and unaligned segments in calculating the spatial divergence including false alarm, miss-detection and localization errors. The effectiveness of the proposed distance metric and the time-averaged version is validated through theoretical analysis and numerical examples of a single target or multiple targets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Part ...</summary><p>Part I of a series of companion papers; 11 pages, 10 figures</p></details> |

Digital Subtraction Angiography (DSA) sequences, recognized as the gold standard for diagnosing CVDs, can clearly visualize the dynamic flow and reveal pathological conditions within the cerebrovasculature. Therefore, precise segmentation of cerebral arteries (CAs) and classification between their main trunks and branches are crucial for physicians to accurately quantify diseases. However, achieving accurate CA segmentation in DSA sequences remains a challenging task due to small vessels with low contrast, and ambiguity between vessels and residual skull structures. Moreover, the lack of publicly available datasets limits exploration in the field. In this paper, we introduce a DSA Sequence-based Cerebral Artery segmentation dataset (DSCA), the publicly accessible dataset designed specifically for pixel-level semantic segmentation of CAs. Additionally, we propose DSANet, a spatio-temporal network for CA segmentation in DSA sequences. Unlike existing DSA segmentation methods that focus only on a single frame, the proposed DSANet introduces a separate temporal encoding branch to capture dynamic vessel details across multiple frames. To enhance small vessel segmentation and improve vessel connectivity, we design a novel TemporalFormer module to capture global context and correlations among sequential frames. Furthermore, we develop a Spatio-Temporal Fusion (STF) module to effectively integrate spatial and temporal features from the encoder. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DSANet outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in CA segmentation, achieving a Dice of 0.9033.</p></details> | Published by TMI |
| **[Hierarchical Spatio-Temporal Uncertainty Quantification for Distributed Energy Adoption](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12193v2)** | 2025-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid deployment of distributed energy resources (DER) has introduced significant spatio-temporal uncertainties in power grid management, necessitating accurate multilevel forecasting methods. However, existing approaches often produce overly conservative uncertainty intervals at individual spatial units and fail to properly capture uncertainties when aggregating predictions across different spatial scales. This paper presents a novel hierarchical spatio-temporal model based on the conformal prediction framework to address these challenges. Our approach generates circuit-level DER growth predictions and efficiently aggregates them to the substation level while maintaining statistical validity through a tailored non-conformity score. Applied to a decade of DER installation data from a local utility network, our method demonstrates superior performance over existing approaches, particularly in reducing prediction interval widths while maintaining coverage.</p></details> |  |

They primarily emphasize temporal sharing while overlooking spatial and spectral dimensions. We propose an adaptive, AI-driven spectrum-sharing framework within the O-RAN architecture, integrating discriminative and generative AI (GenAI) to forecast spectrum needs across multiple timescales and spatial granularities. A marketplace model, managed by an authorized spectrum broker, enables operators to trade spectrum dynamically, balancing static assignments with real-time trading. GenAI enhances traffic prediction, spectrum estimation, and allocation, optimizing utilization while reducing costs. This modular, flexible approach fosters operator collaboration, maximizing efficiency and revenue. A key research challenge is refining allocation granularity and spatio-temporal dynamics beyond existing models.</p></details> |  |

Discretization in space is based on the theory of geometric quantization, which yields a spatially discretized analogue of the MHD equations as a finite-dimensional Lie--Poisson system on the dual of the magnetic extension Lie algebra $\mathfrak{f}=\mathfrak{su}(N)\ltimes\mathfrak{su}(N)^{*}$. We also give accompanying structure preserving time discretizations for Lie--Poisson systems on the dual of semi-direct product Lie algebras of the form $\mathfrak{f}=\mathfrak{g}\ltimes\mathfrak{g^{*}}$, where $\mathfrak{g}$ is a $J$-quadratic Lie algebra. The time integration method is free of computationally costly matrix exponentials. We prove that the full method preserves a modified Lie--Poisson structure and corresponding Casimir functions, and that the modified structure and Casimirs converge to the continuous ones. The method is demonstrated for two models of magnetic fluids: incompressible magnetohydrodynamics and Hazeltine's model.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, convergence results for Casimirs added in sect. 3, typos corrected</p></details> |

We propose AQ-Net, a spatiotemporal reanalysis model for both observed and unobserved stations in the near future. AQ-Net utilizes the LSTM and multi-head attention for the temporal regression. We also propose a cyclic encoding technique to ensure continuous time representation. To learn fine-grained spatial air quality estimation, we incorporate AQ-Net with the neural kNN to explore feature-based interpolation, such that we can fill the spatial gaps given coarse observation stations. To demonstrate the efficiency of our model for spatiotemporal reanalysis, we use data from 2013-2017 collected in northern China for PM2.5 analysis. Extensive experiments show that AQ-Net excels in air quality reanalysis, highlighting the potential of hybrid spatio-temporal models to better capture environmental dynamics, especially in urban areas where both spatial and temporal variability are critical.</p></details> |  |

Existing spatio-temporal data secure retrieval schemes have significant shortcomings regarding dynamic updates, either compromising privacy through leakage during updates (forward insecurity) or incurring excessively high update costs that hinder practical application. Under these circumstances, we first propose a basic filter-based spatio-temporal range query scheme \TrinityI that supports low-cost dynamic updates and automatic expansion. Furthermore, to improve security, reduce storage cost, and false positives, we propose a forward secure and verifiable scheme \TrinityII that simultaneously minimizes storage overhead. A formal security analysis proves that \TrinityI and \TrinityII are Indistinguishable under Selective Chosen-Plaintext Attack (IND-SCPA). Finally, extensive experiments demonstrate that our design \TrinityII significantly reduces storage requirements by 80\%, enables data retrieval at the 1 million-record level in just 0.01 seconds, and achieves 10 $\times$ update efficiency than state-of-art.</p></details> | 14pages,6 figures |

Naturally, automated detection of forged Deepfake videos is attracting a proportional amount of interest of researchers. Current methods for detecting forged videos mainly rely on global frame features and under-utilize the spatio-temporal inconsistencies found in the manipulated videos. Moreover, they fail to attend to manipulation-specific subtle and well-localized pattern variations along both spatial and temporal dimensions. Addressing these gaps, we propose a neural Deepfake detector that focuses on the localized manipulative signatures of the forged videos at individual frame level as well as frame sequence level. Using a ResNet backbone, it strengthens the shallow frame-level feature learning with a spatial attention mechanism. The spatial stream of the model is further helped by fusing texture enhanced shallow features with the deeper features. Simultaneously, the model processes frame sequences with a distance attention mechanism that further allows fusion of temporal attention maps with the learned features at the deeper layers. The overall model is trained to detect forged content as a classifier. We evaluate our method on two popular large data sets and achieve significant performance over the state-of-the-art methods.Moreover, our technique also provides memory and computational advantages over the competitive techniques.</p></details> |  |

Full-scale resolving simulations for systems such as highly turbulent flows are not feasible in the foreseeable future, and reduced-order models must capture dynamics that involve interactions across scales. In the present work, we propose a novel framework, Graph-based Learning of Effective Dynamics (Graph-LED), that leverages graph neural networks (GNNs), as well as an attention-based autoregressive model, to extract the effective dynamics from a small amount of simulation data. GNNs represent flow fields on unstructured meshes as graphs and effectively handle complex geometries and non-uniform grids. The proposed method combines a GNN based, dimensionality reduction for variable-size unstructured meshes with an autoregressive temporal attention model that can learn temporal dependencies automatically. We evaluated the proposed approach on a suite of fluid dynamics problems, including flow past a cylinder and flow over a backward-facing step over a range of Reynolds numbers. The results demonstrate robust and effective forecasting of spatio-temporal physics; in the case of the flow past a cylinder, both small-scale effects that occur close to the cylinder as well as its wake are accurately captured.</p></details> | <details><summary>Confe...</summary><p>Conference on Parsimony and Learning (CPAL)</p></details> |

In this paper, we articulate a vision for the future of STFMs, outlining their essential characteristics and the generalization capabilities necessary for broad applicability. We critically assess the current state of research, identifying gaps relative to these ideal traits, and highlight key challenges that impede their progress.

Real-world measurements of such processes are often collected at irregularly distributed points in space, which can be effectively represented as graphs; however, there are currently only a few existing datasets. Our work aims to make advancements in the field of PDE-modeling accessible to the temporal graph machine learning community, while addressing the data scarcity problem, by creating and utilizing datasets based on PDEs. In this work, we create and use synthetic datasets based on PDEs to support spatio-temporal graph modeling in machine learning for different applications. More precisely, we showcase three equations to model different types of disasters and hazards in the fields of epidemiology, atmospheric particles, and tsunami waves. Further, we show how such created datasets can be used by benchmarking several machine learning models on the epidemiological dataset. Additionally, we show how pre-training on this dataset can improve model performance on real-world epidemiological data.

In particular, ride-hailing vehicles can effectively facilitate flexible data collection and contribute towards urban intelligence, despite resource limitations. Therefore, this work explores a promising scenario, where edge-assisted vehicles perform joint tasks of order serving and the emerging foundation model fine-tuning using various urban data. However, integrating the VCS AI task with the conventional order serving task is challenging, due to their inconsistent spatio-temporal characteristics: (i) The distributions of ride orders and data point-of-interests (PoIs) may not coincide in geography, both following a priori unknown patterns; (ii) they have distinct forms of temporal effects, i.e., prolonged waiting makes orders become instantly invalid while data with increased staleness gradually reduces its utility for model fine-tuning.To overcome these obstacles, we propose an online framework based on multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) with careful augmentation. A new quality-of-service (QoS) metric is designed to characterize and balance the utility of the two joint tasks, under the effects of varying data volumes and staleness. We also integrate graph neural networks (GNNs) with MARL to enhance state representations, capturing graph-structured, time-varying dependencies among vehicles and across locations. Extensive experiments on our testbed simulator, utilizing various real-world foundation model fine-tuning tasks and the New York City Taxi ride order dataset, demonstrate the advantage of our proposed method.</p></details> |  |

This progress enables applications such as match outcome prediction, player scouting, and tactical analysis. In soccer, the effective utilization of event and tracking data is fundamental for capturing and analyzing the dynamics of the game. However, there are two primary challenges: the limited availability of event data, primarily restricted to top-tier teams and leagues, and the scarcity and high cost of tracking data, which complicates its integration with event data for comprehensive analysis. Here we propose OpenSTARLab, an open-source framework designed to democratize spatio-temporal agent data analysis in sports by addressing these key challenges. OpenSTARLab includes the Pre-processing Package that standardizes event and tracking data through Unified and Integrated Event Data and State-Action-Reward formats, the Event Modeling Package that implements deep learning-based event prediction, alongside the RLearn Package for reinforcement learning tasks. These technical components facilitate the handling of diverse data sources and support advanced analytical tasks, thereby enhancing the overall functionality and usability of the framework. To assess OpenSTARLab's effectiveness, we conducted several experimental evaluations. These demonstrate the superior performance of the specific event prediction model in terms of action and time prediction accuracies and maintained its robust event simulation performance. Furthermore, reinforcement learning experiments reveal a trade-off between action accuracy and temporal difference loss and show comprehensive visualization.

In this paper, we adapt and specialise the robust and conjugate GP (RCGP) framework of Altamirano et al. (2024) to the spatio-temporal setting. In doing so, we obtain an outlier-robust spatio-temporal GP with a computational cost comparable to classical spatio-temporal GPs. We also overcome the three main drawbacks of RCGPs: their unreliable performance when the prior mean is chosen poorly, their lack of reliable uncertainty quantification, and the need to carefully select a hyperparameter by hand. We study our method extensively in finance and weather forecasting applications, demonstrating that it provides a reliable approach to spatio-temporal modelling in the presence of outliers.</p></details> |  |

Spatio-semantic graphs are a useful tool for analyzing this narrative path from transcripts alone, however they are limited by the need for manual tagging of content information units (CIUs). In this paper, we propose an automated approach for estimation of spatio-semantic graphs (via automated extraction of CIUs) from the Cookie Theft picture commonly used in cognitive-linguistic analyses. The method enables the automatic characterization of the visual semantic path during picture description. Experiments demonstrate that the automatic spatio-semantic graphs effectively differentiate between cognitively impaired and unimpaired speakers.

| **[Intrinsic Random Functions and Parametric Covariance Models of Spatio-Temporal Random Processes on the Sphere](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00579v1)** | 2025-02-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Identifying an appropriate covariance function is one of the primary interests in spatial and spatio-temporal statistics because it allows researchers to analyze the dependence structure of the random process. For this purpose, spatial homogeneity and temporal stationarity are widely used assumptions, and many parametric covariance models have been developed under these assumptions. However, these are strong and unrealistic conditions in many cases. In addition, on the sphere, although different statistical approaches from those on Euclidean space should be applied to build a proper covariance model considering its unique characteristics, relevant studies are rare. In this research, we introduce novel parameterized models of the covariance function for spatially non-homogeneous and temporally non-stationary random processes on the sphere. To alleviate the spatial homogeneity assumption and temporal stationarity, and to consider the spherical domain and time domain together, this research will apply the theories of Intrinsic Random Functions (IRF). We also provide a methodology to estimate the associated parameters for the model. Finally, through a simulation study and analysis of a real-world data set about global temperature anomaly, we demonstrate validity of the suggested covariance model with its advantage of interpretability.</p></details> |  |

Existing state-of-the-art methods, like Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs), achieve high imputation accuracy; however, they suffer from significant computational costs and are notably time-consuming due to their iterative nature. In this work, we propose CoSTI, an innovative adaptation of Consistency Models (CMs) for the MTSI domain. CoSTI employs Consistency Training to achieve comparable imputation quality to DDPMs while drastically reducing inference times, making it more suitable for real-time applications. We evaluate CoSTI across multiple datasets and missing data scenarios, demonstrating up to a 98% reduction in imputation time with performance on par with diffusion-based models. This work bridges the gap between efficiency and accuracy in generative imputation tasks, providing a scalable solution for handling missing data in critical spatio-temporal systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 5 figures, 13 tables</p></details> |
| **[A Deep Spatio-Temporal Architecture for Dynamic Effective Connectivity Network Analysis Based on Dynamic Causal Discovery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18859v1)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dynamic effective connectivity networks (dECNs) reveal the changing directed brain activity and the dynamic causal influences among brain regions, which facilitate the identification of individual differences and enhance the understanding of human brain. Although the existing causal discovery methods have shown promising results in effective connectivity network analysis, they often overlook the dynamics of causality, in addition to the incorporation of spatio-temporal information in brain activity data. To address these issues, we propose a deep spatio-temporal fusion architecture, which employs a dynamic causal deep encoder to incorporate spatio-temporal information into dynamic causality modeling, and a dynamic causal deep decoder to verify the discovered causality. The effectiveness of the proposed method is first illustrated with simulated data. Then, experimental results from Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC) demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method in inferring dECNs, which reveal the dynamic evolution of directed flow between brain regions. The analysis shows the difference of dECNs between young adults and children. Specifically, the directed brain functional networks transit from fluctuating undifferentiated systems to more stable specialized networks as one grows. This observation provides further evidence on the modularization and adaptation of brain networks during development, leading to higher cognitive abilities observed in young adults.</p></details> |  |
| **[Foundation for unbiased cross-validation of spatio-temporal models for species distribution modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03480v1)** | 2025-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Species Distribution Models (SDMs) often suffer from spatial autocorrelation (SAC), leading to biased performance estimates. We tested cross-validation (CV) strategies - random splits, spatial blocking with varied distances, environmental (ENV) clustering, and a novel spatio-temporal method - under two proposed training schemes: LAST FOLD, widely used in spatial CV at the cost of data loss, and RETRAIN, which maximizes data usage but risks reintroducing SAC. LAST FOLD consistently yielded lower errors and stronger correlations. Spatial blocking at an optimal distance (SP 422) and ENV performed best, achieving Spearman and Pearson correlations of 0.485 and 0.548, respectively, although ENV may be unsuitable for long-term forecasts involving major environmental shifts. A spatio-temporal approach yielded modest benefits in our moderately variable dataset, but may excel with stronger temporal changes. These findings highlight the need to align CV approaches with the spatial and temporal structure of SDM data, ensuring rigorous validation and reliable predictive outcomes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Classification of Mild Cognitive Impairment Based on Dynamic Functional Connectivity Using Spatio-Temporal Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16409v1)** | 2025-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dynamic functional connectivity (dFC) using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) is an advanced technique for capturing the dynamic changes of neural activities, and can be very useful in the studies of brain diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Yet, existing studies have not fully leveraged the sequential information embedded within dFC that can potentially provide valuable information when identifying brain conditions. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that jointly learns the embedding of both spatial and temporal information within dFC based on the transformer architecture. Specifically, we first construct dFC networks from rs-fMRI data through a sliding window strategy. Then, we simultaneously employ a temporal block and a spatial block to capture higher-order representations of dynamic spatio-temporal dependencies, via mapping them into an efficient fused feature representation. To further enhance the robustness of these feature representations by reducing the dependency on labeled data, we also introduce a contrastive learning strategy to manipulate different brain states. Experimental results on 345 subjects with 570 scans from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method for MCI (Mild Cognitive Impairment, the prodromal stage of AD) prediction, highlighting its potential for early identification of AD.</p></details> |  |

Rabies is a prominent example with various instances globally, facilitated by a surplus of meso-predators (commonly, facultative synanthropic species e.g., golden jackals [Canis aureus, hereafter jackals]) thanks to the abundance of anthropogenic resources leading to dense populations close to human establishments. To mitigate rabies outbreaks and prevent human infections, authorities target the jackal which is the main rabies vector in many regions, through the dissemination of oral vaccines in known jackals' activity centers, as well as opportunistic culling to reduce population density. Because dilution (i.e., culling) is not selective towards sick or un-vaccinated individuals, these two complementary epizootic intervention policies (EIPs) can interfere with each other. Nonetheless, there is only limited examination of the interactive effectiveness of these EIPs and their potential influence on rabies epizootic spread dynamics, highlighting the need to understand these measures and the spread of rabies in wild jackals. In this study, we introduce a novel spatio-temporal extended-SIR (susceptible-infected-recovered) model with a graph-based spatial framework for evaluating mitigation efficiency. We implement the model in a case study using a jackal population in northern Israel, and using spatial and movement data collected by Advanced Tracking and Localization of Animals in real-life Systems (ATLAS) telemetry. An agent-based simulation approach allows us to explore various biologically-realistic scenarios, and assess the impact of different EIPs configurations. Our model suggests that under biologically-realistic underlying assumptions and scenarios, the effectiveness of both EIPs is not influenced much by the jackal population size but is sensitive to their dispersal between activity centers.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Spatio-temporal Graph Network Allowing Incomplete Trajectory Input for Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13973v1)** | 2025-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pedestrian trajectory prediction is important in the research of mobile robot navigation in environments with pedestrians. Most pedestrian trajectory prediction algorithms require the input historical trajectories to be complete. If a pedestrian is unobservable in any frame in the past, then its historical trajectory become incomplete, the algorithm will not predict its future trajectory. To address this limitation, we propose the STGN-IT, a spatio-temporal graph network allowing incomplete trajectory input, which can predict the future trajectories of pedestrians with incomplete historical trajectories. STGN-IT uses the spatio-temporal graph with an additional encoding method to represent the historical trajectories and observation states of pedestrians. Moreover, STGN-IT introduces static obstacles in the environment that may affect the future trajectories as nodes to further improve the prediction accuracy. A clustering algorithm is also applied in the construction of spatio-temporal graphs. Experiments on public datasets show that STGN-IT outperforms state of the art algorithms on these metrics.</p></details> |  |
| **[DSTSA-GCN: Advancing Skeleton-Based Gesture Recognition with Semantic-Aware Spatio-Temporal Topology Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12086v1)** | 2025-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph convolutional networks (GCNs) have emerged as a powerful tool for skeleton-based action and gesture recognition, thanks to their ability to model spatial and temporal dependencies in skeleton data. However, existing GCN-based methods face critical limitations: (1) they lack effective spatio-temporal topology modeling that captures dynamic variations in skeletal motion, and (2) they struggle to model multiscale structural relationships beyond local joint connectivity. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework called Dynamic Spatial-Temporal Semantic Awareness Graph Convolutional Network (DSTSA-GCN). DSTSA-GCN introduces three key modules: Group Channel-wise Graph Convolution (GC-GC), Group Temporal-wise Graph Convolution (GT-GC), and Multi-Scale Temporal Convolution (MS-TCN). GC-GC and GT-GC operate in parallel to independently model channel-specific and frame-specific correlations, enabling robust topology learning that accounts for temporal variations. Additionally, both modules employ a grouping strategy to adaptively capture multiscale structural relationships. Complementing this, MS-TCN enhances temporal modeling through group-wise temporal convolutions with diverse receptive fields. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DSTSA-GCN significantly improves the topology modeling capabilities of GCNs, achieving state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets for gesture and action recognition, including SHREC17 Track, DHG-14\/28, NTU-RGB+D, and NTU-RGB+D-120.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submit to Neurocomputing</p></details> |

In this regard, covariance properties with respect to geometric image transformations in the earliest layers of the visual hierarchy are essential for expressing robust image operations, and for formulating invariant visual operations at higher levels. This paper defines and proves a set of joint covariance properties for spatio-temporal receptive fields in terms of spatio-temporal derivative operators applied to spatio-temporally smoothed image data under compositions of spatial scaling transformations, spatial affine transformations, Galilean transformations and temporal scaling transformations. Specifically, the derived relations show how the parameters of the receptive fields need to be transformed, in order to match the output from spatio-temporal receptive fields under composed spatio-temporal image transformations. For this purpose, we also fundamentally extend the notion of scale-normalized derivatives to affine-normalized derivatives, that are computed based on spatial smoothing with affine Gaussian kernels, and analyze the covariance properties of the resulting affine-normalized derivatives for the affine group as well as for important subgroups thereof. We conclude with a geometric analysis, showing how the derived joint covariance properties make it possible to relate or match spatio-temporal receptive field responses, when observing, possibly moving, local surface patches from different views, under locally linearized perspective or projective transformations, as well as when observing different instances of spatio-temporal events, that may occur either faster or slower between different views of similar spatio-temporal events.</p></details> | <details><summary>46 pa...</summary><p>46 pages, 19 figures.

| **[Spatio-temporal characterisation of underwater noise through semantic trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11131v1)** | 2025-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Underwater noise pollution from human activities, particularly shipping, has been recognised as a serious threat to marine life. The sound generated by vessels can have various adverse effects on fish and aquatic ecosystems in general. In this setting, the estimation and analysis of the underwater noise produced by vessels is an important challenge for the preservation of the marine environment. In this paper we propose a model for the spatio-temporal characterisation of the underwater noise generated by vessels. The approach is based on the reconstruction of the vessels' trajectories from Automatic Identification System (AIS) data and on their deployment in a spatio-temporal database. Trajectories are enriched with semantic information like the acoustic characteristics of the vessels' engines or the activity performed by the vessels. We define a model for underwater noise propagation and use the trajectories' information to infer how noise propagates in the area of interest. We develop our approach for the case study of the fishery activities in the Northern Adriatic sea, an area of the Mediterranean sea which is well known to be highly exploited. We implement our approach using MobilityDB, an open source geospatial trajectory data management and analysis platform, which offers spatio-temporal operators and indexes improving the efficiency of our system. We use this platform to conduct various analyses of the underwater noise generated in the Northern Adriatic Sea, aiming at estimating the impact of fishing activities on underwater noise pollution and at demonstrating the flexibility and expressiveness of our approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fine-grained Spatio-temporal Event Prediction with Self-adaptive Anchor Graph](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08653v2)** | 2025-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Event prediction tasks often handle spatio-temporal data distributed in a large spatial area. Different regions in the area exhibit different characteristics while having latent correlations. This spatial heterogeneity and correlations greatly affect the spatio-temporal distributions of event occurrences, which has not been addressed by state-of-the-art models. Learning spatial dependencies of events in a continuous space is challenging due to its fine granularity and a lack of prior knowledge. In this work, we propose a novel Graph Spatio-Temporal Point Process (GSTPP) model for fine-grained event prediction. It adopts an encoder-decoder architecture that jointly models the state dynamics of spatially localized regions using neural Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs). The state evolution is built on the foundation of a novel Self-Adaptive Anchor Graph (SAAG) that captures spatial dependencies. By adaptively localizing the anchor nodes in the space and jointly constructing the correlation edges between them, the SAAG enhances the model's ability of learning complex spatial event patterns. The proposed GSTPP model greatly improves the accuracy of fine-grained event prediction. Extensive experimental results show that our method greatly improves the prediction accuracy over existing spatio-temporal event prediction approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to SIAM International Conference on Data Mining 2025 (SDM'25)</p></details> |

Multi-sensor synchronous measurement has proven to be more effective for WHAR than using a single sensor. However, existing WHAR methods use shared convolutional kernels for indiscriminate temporal feature extraction across each sensor variable, which fails to effectively capture spatio-temporal relationships of intra-sensor and inter-sensor variables. We propose the DecomposeWHAR model consisting of a decomposition phase and a fusion phase to better model the relationships between modality variables. The decomposition creates high-dimensional representations of each intra-sensor variable through the improved Depth Separable Convolution to capture local temporal features while preserving their unique characteristics. The fusion phase begins by capturing relationships between intra-sensor variables and fusing their features at both the channel and variable levels. Long-range temporal dependencies are modeled using the State Space Model (SSM), and later cross-sensor interactions are dynamically captured through a self-attention mechanism, highlighting inter-sensor spatial correlations. Our model demonstrates superior performance on three widely used WHAR datasets, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art models while maintaining acceptable computational efficiency. Our codes and supplementary materials are available at https://github.com/Anakin2555/DecomposeWHAR.</p></details> |  |
| **[Vulnerability-Aware Spatio-Temporal Learning for Generalizable and Interpretable Deepfake Video Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01184v2)** | 2025-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Detecting deepfake videos is highly challenging due to the complex intertwined spatial and temporal artifacts in forged sequences. Most recent approaches rely on binary classifiers trained on both real and fake data. However, such methods may struggle to focus on important artifacts, which can hinder their generalization capability. Additionally, these models often lack interpretability, making it difficult to understand how predictions are made. To address these issues, we propose FakeSTormer, offering two key contributions. First, we introduce a multi-task learning framework with additional spatial and temporal branches that enable the model to focus on subtle spatio-temporal artifacts. These branches also provide interpretability by highlighting video regions that may contain artifacts. Second, we propose a video-level data synthesis algorithm that generates pseudo-fake videos with subtle artifacts, providing the model with high-quality samples and ground truth data for our spatial and temporal branches. Extensive experiments on several challenging benchmarks demonstrate the competitiveness of our approach compared to recent state-of-the-art methods.

Concretely, earth science systems rely heavily on the extensive deployment of sensors, however, the data collection from sensors is constrained by complex geographical and social factors, making it challenging to achieve comprehensive coverage and uniform deployment. To alleviate the obstacle, traditional approaches to sensor deployment utilize specific algorithms to design and deploy sensors. These methods \textit{dynamically adjust the activation times of sensors to optimize the detection process across each sub-region}. Regrettably, formulating an activation strategy generally based on historical observations and geographic characteristics, which make the methods and resultant models were neither simple nor practical. Worse still, the complex technical design may ultimately lead to a model with weak generalizability. In this paper, we introduce for the first time the concept of spatio-temporal data dynamic sparse training and are committed to adaptively, dynamically filtering important sensor distributions. To our knowledge, this is the \textbf{first} proposal (\textit{termed DynST}) of an \textbf{industry-level} deployment optimization concept at the data level. However, due to the existence of the temporal dimension, pruning of spatio-temporal data may lead to conflicts at different timestamps. To achieve this goal, we employ dynamic merge technology, along with ingenious dimensional mapping to mitigate potential impacts caused by the temporal aspect. During the training process, DynST utilize iterative pruning and sparse training, repeatedly identifying and dynamically removing sensor perception areas that contribute the least to future predictions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Get Rid of Isolation: A Continuous Multi-task Spatio-Temporal Learning Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10524v2)** | 2025-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatiotemporal learning has become a pivotal technique to enable urban intelligence. Traditional spatiotemporal models mostly focus on a specific task by assuming a same distribution between training and testing sets. However, given that urban systems are usually dynamic, multi-sourced with imbalanced data distributions, current specific task-specific models fail to generalize to new urban conditions and adapt to new domains without explicitly modeling interdependencies across various dimensions and types of urban data. To this end, we argue that there is an essential to propose a Continuous Multi-task Spatio-Temporal learning framework (CMuST) to empower collective urban intelligence, which reforms the urban spatiotemporal learning from single-domain to cooperatively multi-dimensional and multi-task learning. Specifically, CMuST proposes a new multi-dimensional spatiotemporal interaction network (MSTI) to allow cross-interactions between context and main observations as well as self-interactions within spatial and temporal aspects to be exposed, which is also the core for capturing task-level commonality and personalization. To ensure continuous task learning, a novel Rolling Adaptation training scheme (RoAda) is devised, which not only preserves task uniqueness by constructing data summarization-driven task prompts, but also harnesses correlated patterns among tasks by iterative model behavior modeling. We further establish a benchmark of three cities for multi-task spatiotemporal learning, and empirically demonstrate the superiority of CMuST via extensive evaluations on these datasets. The impressive improvements on both few-shot streaming data and new domain tasks against existing SOAT methods are achieved.

Point processes specified on linear networks can provide a more accurate description of crime incidents by considering the geometry of the city. We propose a spatio-temporal Dirichlet process mixture model on a linear network to analyze crime events in Valencia, Spain. We propose a Bayesian hierarchical model with a Dirichlet process prior to automatically detect space-time clusters of the events and adopt a convolution kernel estimator to account for the network structure in the city. From the fitted model, we provide crime hotspot visualizations that can inform social interventions to prevent crime incidents. Furthermore, we study the relationships between the detected cluster centers and the city's amenities, which provides an intuitive explanation of criminal contagion.</p></details> |  |

Recently, we have witnessed the rise of variational autoencoder-based latent factor models, which learn latent factors self-adaptively. While these models focus on modeling overall market conditions, they often fail to effectively capture the temporal patterns of individual stocks. Additionally, representing multiple factors as single values simplifies the model but limits its ability to capture complex relationships and dependencies. As a result, the learned factors are of low quality and lack diversity, reducing their effectiveness and robustness across different trading periods. To address these issues, we propose a Spatio-Temporal factOR Model based on dual vector quantized variational autoencoders, named STORM, which extracts features of stocks from temporal and spatial perspectives, then fuses and aligns these features at the fine-grained and semantic level, and represents the factors as multi-dimensional embeddings. The discrete codebooks cluster similar factor embeddings, ensuring orthogonality and diversity, which helps distinguish between different factors and enables factor selection in financial trading. To show the performance of the proposed factor model, we apply it to two downstream experiments: portfolio management on two stock datasets and individual trading tasks on six specific stocks. The extensive experiments demonstrate STORM's flexibility in adapting to downstream tasks and superior performance over baseline models.</p></details> |  |

ANN-to-SNN knowledge distillation can improve SNN performance, but previous methods either focus solely on label information, missing valuable intermediate layer features, or use a layer-wise approach that neglects spatial and temporal semantic inconsistencies, leading to performance degradation.To address these limitations, we propose a novel method called self-attentive spatio-temporal calibration (SASTC). SASTC uses self-attention to identify semantically aligned layer pairs between ANN and SNN, both spatially and temporally. This enables the autonomous transfer of relevant semantic information. Extensive experiments show that SASTC outperforms existing methods, effectively solving the mismatching problem. Superior accuracy results include 95.12% on CIFAR-10, 79.40% on CIFAR-100 with 2 time steps, and 68.69% on ImageNet with 4 time steps for static datasets, and 97.92% on DVS-Gesture and 83.60% on DVS-CIFAR10 for neuromorphic datasets. This marks the first time SNNs have outperformed ANNs on both CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, shedding the new light on the potential applications of SNNs.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches typically utilize external information such as semantic maps to improve video prediction accuracy, which often neglect the inherent physical knowledge embedded within videos. Worse still, their high computational costs could impede their applications for high-resolution videos. To address these constraints, we introduce a novel framework called \underline{P}hysics-\underline{a}ssisted \underline{S}patio-\underline{t}emporal \underline{Net}work (PastNet) for high-quality video prediction. The core of PastNet lies in incorporating a spectral convolution operator in the Fourier domain, which efficiently introduces inductive biases from the underlying physical laws. Additionally, we employ a memory bank with the estimated intrinsic dimensionality to discretize local features during the processing of complex spatio-temporal signals, thereby reducing computational costs and facilitating efficient high-resolution video prediction. Extensive experiments on various widely-used spatio-temporal video benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed PastNet compared with a range of state-of-the-art methods, particularly in high-resolution scenarios.</p></details> | 11 |

However, existing approaches that separate anomaly preprocessing from model training for multivariate time series prediction encounter significant limitations. Specifically, these methods fail to utilize auxiliary information crucial for identifying latent anomalies associated with spatiotemporal factors during the preprocessing stage. Instead, they rely solely on data distribution for anomaly detection, which can result in the incorrect processing of numerous samples that could otherwise contribute positively to model training. To address this, we propose STTS-EAD, an end-to-end method that seamlessly integrates anomaly detection into the training process of multivariate time series forecasting and aims to improve Spatio-Temporal learning based Time Series prediction via Embedded Anomaly Detection. Our proposed STTS-EAD leverages spatio-temporal information for forecasting and anomaly detection, with the two parts alternately executed and optimized for each other. To the best of our knowledge, STTS-EAD is the first to integrate anomaly detection and forecasting tasks in the training phase for improving the accuracy of multivariate time series forecasting. Extensive experiments on a public stock dataset and two real-world sales datasets from a renowned coffee chain enterprise show that our proposed method can effectively process detected anomalies in the training stage to improve forecasting performance in the inference stage and significantly outperform baselines.</p></details> | 11 pages |

Small perturbations in conditions can often lead to significant changes in fire spread (such as speed and direction), necessitating a computationally expensive large set of simulations to quantify uncertainty. Model emulation seeks alternative representations of physical models using machine learning, aiming to provide more efficient and/or simplified surrogate models. We propose a dedicated spatio-temporal neural network based framework for model emulation, able to capture the complex behaviour of fire spread models. The proposed approach can approximate forecasts at fine spatial and temporal resolutions that are often challenging for neural network based approaches. Furthermore, the proposed approach is robust even with small training sets, due to novel data augmentation methods. Empirical experiments show good agreement between simulated and emulated firefronts, with an average Jaccard score of 0.76.</p></details> |  |
| **[KITS: Inductive Spatio-Temporal Kriging with Increment Training Strategy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02565v2)** | 2025-01-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sensors are commonly deployed to perceive the environment. However, due to the high cost, sensors are usually sparsely deployed. Kriging is the tailored task to infer the unobserved nodes (without sensors) using the observed source nodes (with sensors). The essence of kriging task is transferability. Recently, several inductive spatio-temporal kriging methods have been proposed based on graph neural networks, being trained based on a graph built on top of observed nodes via pretext tasks such as masking nodes out and reconstructing them. However, the graph in training is inevitably much sparser than the graph in inference that includes all the observed and unobserved nodes. The learned pattern cannot be well generalized for inference, denoted as graph gap. To address this issue, we first present a novel Increment training strategy: instead of masking nodes (and reconstructing them), we add virtual nodes into the training graph so as to mitigate the graph gap issue naturally. Nevertheless, the empty-shell virtual nodes without labels could have bad-learned features and lack supervision signals. To solve these issues, we pair each virtual node with its most similar observed node and fuse their features together; to enhance the supervision signal, we construct reliable pseudo labels for virtual nodes. As a result, the learned pattern of virtual nodes could be safely transferred to real unobserved nodes for reliable kriging. We name our new Kriging model with Increment Training Strategy as KITS. Extensive experiments demonstrate that KITS consistently outperforms existing kriging methods by large margins, e.g., the improvement over MAE score could be as high as 18.33%.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted by AAAI'25</p></details> |
| **[AutoSTF: Decoupled Neural Architecture Search for Cost-Effective Automated Spatio-Temporal Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16586v2)** | 2025-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal forecasting is a critical component of various smart city applications, such as transportation optimization, energy management, and socio-economic analysis. Recently, several automated spatio-temporal forecasting methods have been proposed to automatically search the optimal neural network architecture for capturing complex spatio-temporal dependencies. However, the existing automated approaches suffer from expensive neural architecture search overhead, which hinders their practical use and the further exploration of diverse spatio-temporal operators in a finer granularity. In this paper, we propose AutoSTF, a decoupled automatic neural architecture search framework for cost-effective automated spatio-temporal forecasting. From the efficiency perspective, we first decouple the mixed search space into temporal space and spatial space and respectively devise representation compression and parameter-sharing schemes to mitigate the parameter explosion. The decoupled spatio-temporal search not only expedites the model optimization process but also leaves new room for more effective spatio-temporal dependency modeling. From the effectiveness perspective, we propose a multi-patch transfer module to jointly capture multi-granularity temporal dependencies and extend the spatial search space to enable finer-grained layer-wise spatial dependency search. Extensive experiments on eight datasets demonstrate the superiority of AutoSTF in terms of both accuracy and efficiency. Specifically, our proposed method achieves up to 13.48x speed-up compared to state-of-the-art automatic spatio-temporal forecasting methods while maintaining the best forecasting accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by KDD 2025 Research Track</p></details> |

However, due to the high heterogeneity in structure and semantics among various spatio-temporal modalities, the joint interpretation of multimodal spatio-temporal data has long been an extremely challenging problem. The primary challenge resides in striking a trade-off between the cohesion and autonomy of diverse modalities. This trade-off becomes progressively nonlinear as the number of modalities expands. Inspired by the human cognitive system and linguistic philosophy, where perceptual signals from the five senses converge into language, we introduce the Language as Reference Framework (LaRF), a fundamental principle for constructing a multimodal unified model. Building upon this, we propose AllSpark, a multimodal spatio-temporal general artificial intelligence model. Our model integrates ten different modalities into a unified framework. To achieve modal cohesion, AllSpark introduces a modal bridge and multimodal large language model (LLM) to map diverse modal features into the language feature space. To maintain modality autonomy, AllSpark uses modality-specific encoders to extract the tokens of various spatio-temporal modalities. Finally, observing a gap between the model's interpretability and downstream tasks, we designed modality-specific prompts and task heads, enhancing the model's generalization capability across specific tasks. Experiments indicate that the incorporation of language enables AllSpark to excel in few-shot classification tasks for RGB and point cloud modalities without additional training, surpassing baseline performance by up to 41.82\%.

However, traditional prediction methods are often limited by static spatial modeling, making it difficult to accurately capture the dynamic and complex relationships between time and space, thereby affecting prediction accuracy. This paper proposes an innovative traffic flow prediction network, SFADNet, which categorizes traffic flow into multiple traffic patterns based on temporal and spatial feature matrices. For each pattern, we construct an independent adaptive spatio-temporal fusion graph based on a cross-attention mechanism, employing residual graph convolution modules and time series modules to better capture dynamic spatio-temporal relationships under different fine-grained traffic patterns. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that SFADNet outperforms current state-of-the-art baselines across four large-scale datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by 2025 lEEE International Conference on Acoustics, speech, and signal Processing (lCASSP2025)</p></details> |
| **[STContext: A Multifaceted Dataset for Developing Context-aware Spatio-temporal Crowd Mobility Prediction Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03583v1)** | 2025-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In smart cities, context-aware spatio-temporal crowd flow prediction (STCFP) models leverage contextual features (e.g., weather) to identify unusual crowd mobility patterns and enhance prediction accuracy. However, the best practice for incorporating contextual features remains unclear due to inconsistent usage of contextual features in different papers. Developing a multifaceted dataset with rich types of contextual features and STCFP scenarios is crucial for establishing a principled context modeling paradigm. Existing open crowd flow datasets lack an adequate range of contextual features, which poses an urgent requirement to build a multifaceted dataset to fill these research gaps. To this end, we create STContext, a multifaceted dataset for developing context-aware STCFP models. Specifically, STContext provides nine spatio-temporal datasets across five STCFP scenarios and includes ten contextual features, including weather, air quality index, holidays, points of interest, road networks, etc. Besides, we propose a unified workflow for incorporating contextual features into deep STCFP methods, with steps including feature transformation, dependency modeling, representation fusion, and training strategies. Through extensive experiments, we have obtained several useful guidelines for effective context modeling and insights for future research. The STContext is open-sourced at https://github.com/Liyue-Chen/STContext.</p></details> |  |

Most approaches explore spatio-temporal information of multi-scan to identify the semantic classes and motion states for each point. However, these methods often overlook the segmentation consistency in space and time, which may result in point clouds within the same object being predicted as different categories. To handle this issue, our core idea is to generate cluster labels across multiple frames that can reflect the complete spatial structure and temporal information of objects. These labels serve as explicit guidance for our dual-branch network, 4D-CS, which integrates point-based and cluster-based branches to enable more consistent segmentation. Specifically, in the point-based branch, we leverage historical knowledge to enrich the current feature through temporal fusion on multiple views. In the cluster-based branch, we propose a new strategy to produce cluster labels of foreground objects and apply them to gather point-wise information to derive cluster features. We then merge neighboring clusters across multiple scans to restore missing features due to occlusion. Finally, in the point-cluster fusion stage, we adaptively fuse the information from the two branches to optimize segmentation results. Extensive experiments confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method, and we achieve state-of-the-art results on the multi-scan semantic and moving object segmentation on SemanticKITTI and nuScenes datasets.

However, the high costs of building sensor networks limit their scale and coverage, making fine-grained deployment challenging. Inductive Spatio-Temporal Kriging (ISK) addresses this issue by introducing virtual sensors. Based on graph neural networks (GNNs) extracting the relationships between physical and virtual sensors, ISK can infer the measurements of virtual sensors from physical sensors. However, current ISK methods rely on conventional message-passing mechanisms and network architectures, without effectively extracting spatio-temporal features of physical sensors and focusing on representing virtual sensors. Additionally, existing graph construction methods face issues of sparse and noisy connections, destroying ISK performance. To address these issues, we propose DarkFarseer, a novel ISK framework with three key components. First, we propose the Neighbor Hidden Style Enhancement module with a style transfer strategy to enhance the representation of virtual nodes in a temporal-then-spatial manner to better extract the spatial relationships between physical and virtual nodes. Second, we propose Virtual-Component Contrastive Learning, which aims to enrich the node representation by establishing the association between the patterns of virtual nodes and the regional patterns within graph components. Lastly, we design a Similarity-Based Graph Denoising Strategy, which reduces the connectivity strength of noisy connections around virtual nodes and their neighbors based on their temporal information and regional spatial patterns. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DarkFarseer significantly outperforms existing ISK methods.</p></details> | TKDE (Under Review) |

However, these models often struggle with balancing computational efficiency and model flexibility. To address this challenge, this study develops a fast and flexible method for STVC modeling. For enhanced flexibility in modeling, we assume multiple processes in each varying coefficient, including purely spatial, purely temporal, and spatio-temporal interaction processes with or without time cyclicity. While considering multiple processes can be time consuming, we combine a pre-conditioning method with a model selection procedure, inspired by reluctant interaction modeling. This approach allows us to computationally efficiently select and specify the latent space-time structure. Monte Carlo experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms alternatives in terms of coefficient estimation accuracy and computational efficiency. Finally, we apply the proposed method to crime analysis using a sample size of 279,360, confirming that the proposed method provides reasonable estimates of varying coefficients. The STVC model is implemented in an R package spmoran.</p></details> |  |

In light of this, we propose a deep spatio-temporal hypergraph convolutional neural network for soft sensing (ST-HCSS). In particular, our proposed framework is able to construct and leverage a higher-order graph (hypergraph) to model the complex multi-interactions between sensor nodes in the absence of prior structural knowledge. To capture rich spatio-temporal relationships underlying sensor data, our proposed ST-HCSS incorporates stacked gated temporal and hypergraph convolution layers to effectively aggregate and update hypergraph information across time and nodes. Our results validate the superiority of ST-HCSS compared to existing state-of-the-art soft sensors, and demonstrates that the learned hypergraph feature representations aligns well with the sensor data correlations.

| **[Trajectory Representation Learning on Road Networks and Grids with Spatio-Temporal Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14014v2)** | 2025-01-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory representation learning is a fundamental task for applications in fields including smart city, and urban planning, as it facilitates the utilization of trajectory data (e.g., vehicle movements) for various downstream applications, such as trajectory similarity computation or travel time estimation. This is achieved by learning low-dimensional representations from high-dimensional and raw trajectory data. However, existing methods for trajectory representation learning either rely on grid-based or road-based representations, which are inherently different and thus, could lose information contained in the other modality. Moreover, these methods overlook the dynamic nature of urban traffic, relying on static road network features rather than time varying traffic patterns. In this paper, we propose TIGR, a novel model designed to integrate grid and road network modalities while incorporating spatio-temporal dynamics to learn rich, general-purpose representations of trajectories. We evaluate TIGR on two realworld datasets and demonstrate the effectiveness of combining both modalities by substantially outperforming state-of-the-art methods, i.e., up to 43.22% for trajectory similarity, up to 16.65% for travel time estimation, and up to 10.16% for destination prediction.</p></details> |  |

| **[STORM: Spatio-Temporal Reconstruction Model for Large-Scale Outdoor Scenes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00602v1)** | 2024-12-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present STORM, a spatio-temporal reconstruction model designed for reconstructing dynamic outdoor scenes from sparse observations. Existing dynamic reconstruction methods often rely on per-scene optimization, dense observations across space and time, and strong motion supervision, resulting in lengthy optimization times, limited generalization to novel views or scenes, and degenerated quality caused by noisy pseudo-labels for dynamics. To address these challenges, STORM leverages a data-driven Transformer architecture that directly infers dynamic 3D scene representations--parameterized by 3D Gaussians and their velocities--in a single forward pass. Our key design is to aggregate 3D Gaussians from all frames using self-supervised scene flows, transforming them to the target timestep to enable complete (i.e., "amodal") reconstructions from arbitrary viewpoints at any moment in time. As an emergent property, STORM automatically captures dynamic instances and generates high-quality masks using only reconstruction losses. Extensive experiments on public datasets show that STORM achieves precise dynamic scene reconstruction, surpassing state-of-the-art per-scene optimization methods (+4.3 to 6.6 PSNR) and existing feed-forward approaches (+2.1 to 4.7 PSNR) in dynamic regions. STORM reconstructs large-scale outdoor scenes in 200ms, supports real-time rendering, and outperforms competitors in scene flow estimation, improving 3D EPE by 0.422m and Acc5 by 28.02%. Beyond reconstruction, we showcase four additional applications of our model, illustrating the potential of self-supervised learning for broader dynamic scene understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page at: https://jiawei-yang.github.io/STORM/</p></details> |
| **[STARFormer: A Novel Spatio-Temporal Aggregation Reorganization Transformer of FMRI for Brain Disorder Diagnosis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00378v1)** | 2024-12-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many existing methods that use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) classify brain disorders, such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), often overlook the integration of spatial and temporal dependencies of the blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signals, which may lead to inaccurate or imprecise classification results. To solve this problem, we propose a Spatio-Temporal Aggregation eorganization ransformer (STARFormer) that effectively captures both spatial and temporal features of BOLD signals by incorporating three key modules. The region of interest (ROI) spatial structure analysis module uses eigenvector centrality (EC) to reorganize brain regions based on effective connectivity, highlighting critical spatial relationships relevant to the brain disorder. The temporal feature reorganization module systematically segments the time series into equal-dimensional window tokens and captures multiscale features through variable window and cross-window attention. The spatio-temporal feature fusion module employs a parallel transformer architecture with dedicated temporal and spatial branches to extract integrated features. The proposed STARFormer has been rigorously evaluated on two publicly available datasets for the classification of ASD and ADHD. The experimental results confirm that the STARFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple evaluation metrics, providing a more accurate and reliable tool for the diagnosis of brain disorders and biomedical research. The codes will be available at: https://github.com/NZWANG/STARFormer.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatio-Temporal Multi-Subgraph GCN for 3D Human Motion Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00317v1)** | 2024-12-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human motion prediction (HMP) involves forecasting future human motion based on historical data. Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have garnered widespread attention in this field for their proficiency in capturing relationships among joints in human motion. However, existing GCN-based methods tend to focus on either temporal-domain or spatial-domain features, or they combine spatio-temporal features without fully leveraging the complementarity and cross-dependency of these two features. In this paper, we propose the Spatial-Temporal Multi-Subgraph Graph Convolutional Network (STMS-GCN) to capture complex spatio-temporal dependencies in human motion. Specifically, we decouple the modeling of temporal and spatial dependencies, enabling cross-domain knowledge transfer at multiple scales through a spatio-temporal information consistency constraint mechanism. Besides, we utilize multiple subgraphs to extract richer motion information and enhance the learning associations of diverse subgraphs through a homogeneous information constraint mechanism. Extensive experiments on the standard HMP benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our method.</p></details> |  |

However, the lack of justified graph kernels for spatio-temporal modelling has held back their use in graph problems. We leverage an explicit link between stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) and GPs on graphs, introduce a framework for deriving graph kernels via SPDEs, and derive non-separable spatio-temporal graph kernels that capture interaction across space and time. We formulate the graph kernels for the stochastic heat equation and wave equation. We show that by providing novel tools for spatio-temporal GP modelling on graphs, we outperform pre-existing graph kernels in real-world applications that feature diffusion, oscillation, and other complicated interactions.</p></details> |  |

By analyzing data over a 30-day period with comparable climate and average temperatures, we explored differences in BSS usage between weekdays and weekends in those cities using Jensen-Shannon divergence (JSD) and rank distribution analysis. Our findings reveal significant temporal differences in BSS usage that were commonly observed in all cities, with weekday patterns dominated by commute peaks and weekend patterns reflecting recreational activities. Friday emerges as a transitional day, sharing the characteristics of both weekdays and weekends. Meanwhile, docking station usage rank distributions show remarkable consistency between weekdays and weekends for most cities, with London being a unique anomaly. This study highlights the potential of BSS data to uncover urban mobility patterns and the underlying structures of cities. The results suggest that BSS usage reflects both intrinsic user behavior and external influences such as urban planning.</p></details> | 16pages, 5figures |

However, existing FER methods face three key challenges in real-world applications: (i) they rely on large amounts of continuously annotated data to ensure accuracy since emotions are complex and ambiguous in reality, which is costly and time-consuming; (ii) they cannot capture the temporal heterogeneity caused by changing emotion patterns, because they usually assume that the temporal correlation within sampling periods is the same; (iii) they do not consider the spatial heterogeneity of different FER scenarios, that is, the distribution of emotion information in different data may have bias or interference. To address these challenges, we propose a Spatio-Temporal Fuzzy-oriented Multi-modal Meta-learning framework (ST-F2M). Specifically, ST-F2M first divides the multi-modal videos into multiple views, and each view corresponds to one modality of one emotion. Multiple randomly selected views for the same emotion form a meta-training task. Next, ST-F2M uses an integrated module with spatial and temporal convolutions to encode the data of each task, reflecting the spatial and temporal heterogeneity. Then it adds fuzzy semantic information to each task based on generalized fuzzy rules, which helps handle the complexity and ambiguity of emotions. Finally, ST-F2M learns emotion-related general meta-knowledge through meta-recurrent neural networks to achieve fast and robust fine-grained emotion recognition. Extensive experiments show that ST-F2M outperforms various state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and model efficiency. In addition, we construct ablation studies and further analysis to explore why ST-F2M performs well.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, Submitted to TMM in 30-May-2024</p></details> |

However, the actual channel variations over time are highly complex in high-mobility scenarios, which makes it difficult for existing predictors to obtain future channels accurately. The low accuracy of channel predictors leads to difficulties in supporting reliable communication. To overcome this challenge, we propose a channel predictor based on spatio-temporal electromagnetic (EM) kernel learning (STEM-KL). Specifically, inspired by recent advancements in EM information theory (EIT), the STEM kernel function is derived. The velocity and the concentration kernel parameters are designed to reflect the time-varying propagation of the wireless signal. We obtain the parameters through kernel learning. Then, the future channels are predicted by computing their Bayesian posterior, with the STEM kernel acting as the prior. To further improve the stability and model expressibility, we propose a grid-based EM mixed kernel learning (GEM-KL) scheme. We design the mixed kernel to be a convex combination of multiple sub-kernels, where each of the sub-kernel corresponds to a grid point in the set of pre-selected parameters. This approach transforms non-convex STEM kernel learning problem into a convex grid-based problem that can be easily solved by weight optimization. Finally, simulation results verify that the proposed STEM-KL and GEM-KL schemes can achieve more accurate channel prediction. This indicates that EIT can improve the performance of wireless system efficiently.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper proposes an EIT-inspired Gaussian process regression (GPR)-based channel predictor with improved performance.

Among the many variables captured through satellite sensors, Land Surface Temperature (LST) plays a critical role in understanding key environmental processes. However, obtaining high-resolution LST data remains a challenge, as satellite sensors often face a trade-off between spatial and temporal resolutions. In response, Spatio-Temporal Fusion (STF) has emerged as a powerful method to integrate two satellite data sources, one providing high spatial but low temporal resolution, and the other offering high temporal but low spatial resolution. Although a range of STF techniques have been proposed, from traditional methods to cutting-edge deep learning (DL) models, most have focused on surface reflectance, with limited application to LST estimation. DL approaches, in particular, show promise in improving the spatial and temporal resolutions of LST by capturing complex, non-linear relationships between input and output LST data. This paper offers a comprehensive review of the latest advancements in DL-based STF techniques for LST estimation. We analyze key research developments, mathematically formulate the STF problem, and introduce a novel taxonomy for DL-based STF methods. Furthermore, we discuss the challenges faced by current methods and highlight future research directions. In addition, we present the first open-source benchmark STF dataset for LST estimation, consisting of 51 pairs of MODIS-Landsat images spanning from 2013 to 2024. To support our findings, we conduct extensive experiments on state-of-the-art methods and present both quantitative and qualitative assessments. This is the first survey paper focused on DL-based STF for LST estimation.

Developing techniques to identify and analyze communities in these time-varying graph structures is an important challenge. In this work, we generalize existing spectral clustering algorithms from static to dynamic graphs using canonical correlation analysis (CCA) to capture the temporal evolution of clusters. Based on this extended canonical correlation framework, we define the spatio-temporal graph Laplacian and investigate its spectral properties. We connect these concepts to dynamical systems theory via transfer operators, and illustrate the advantages of our method on benchmark graphs by comparison with existing methods. We show that the spatio-temporal graph Laplacian allows for a clear interpretation of cluster structure evolution over time for directed and undirected graphs.</p></details> |  |

Determining the optimal provisioning of edge resources to meet the varying and uncertain demand cost-effectively is a critical task for SPs. This paper introduces a novel two-stage multi-period robust model for edge service placement and workload allocation, aiming to minimize the SP's operating costs while ensuring service quality. The salient feature of this model lies in its ability to enable SPs to utilize dynamic service placement and leverage spatio-temporal correlation in demand uncertainties to mitigate the inherent conservatism of robust solutions. In our model, resource reservation is optimized in the initial stage, preemptively, before the actual demand is disclosed, whereas dynamic service placement and workload allocation are determined in the subsequent stage, following the revelation of uncertainties. To address the challenges posed by integer recourse variables in the second stage of the resulting tri-level adjustable robust optimization problem, we propose a novel iterative, decomposition-based approach, ensuring finite convergence to an exact optimal solution. Extensive numerical results are provided to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed model and approach.</p></details> | 15 pages |

Despite that, accurately estimating domains of attraction for nonlinear systems remains a challenging task, where available estimation approaches are either conservative or limited to low-dimensional systems. In this work, we propose an iterative approach to accurately underapproximate safe (i.e., state-constrained) domains of attraction for general discrete-time autonomous nonlinear systems. Our approach relies on implicit representations of safe backward reachable sets of safe regions of attraction, where such regions can be be easily constructed using, e.g., quadratic Lyapunov functions. The iterations of our approach are monotonic (in the sense of set inclusion), where each iteration results in a safe region of attraction, given as a sublevel set, that underapproximates the safe domain of attraction. The sublevel set representations of the resulting regions of attraction can be efficiently utilized in verifying the inclusion of given points of interest in the safe domain of attraction. We illustrate our approach through two numerical examples, involving two- and four-dimensional nonlinear systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This updated manuscript corrects errors in the formulas for the bounds used in computing ellipsoidal regions of attraction</p></details> |

T. Parker constructed an orthogonal pair of $10\times10$ Latin squares in 1959, an orthogonal triple of $10\times10$ Latin squares has been one of the most sought-after combinatorial designs. Despite extensive work, the existence of such an orthogonal triple remains an open problem, though some negative results are known. In 1999, W. Myrvold derived some highly restrictive constraints in the special case in which one of the Latin squares in the triple contains a $4\times4$ Latin subsquare. In particular, Myrvold showed there were twenty-eight possible cases for an orthogonal pair in such a triple, twenty of which were removed from consideration. We implement a computational approach that quickly verifies all of Myrvold's nonexistence results and in the remaining eight cases finds explicit examples of orthogonal pairs -- thus explaining for the first time why Myrvold's approach left eight cases unsolved. As a consequence, the eight remaining cases cannot be removed by a strategy of focusing on the existence of an orthogonal pair; the third square in the triple must necessarily be considered as well. Our approach uses a Boolean satisfiability (SAT) solver to derive the nonexistence of twenty of the orthogonal pair types and find explicit examples of orthogonal pairs in the eight remaining cases. To reduce the existence problem into Boolean logic we use a duality between the concepts of transversal representation and orthogonal pair and we provide a formulation of this duality in terms of a composition operation on Latin squares. Using our SAT encoding, we find transversal representations (and equivalently orthogonal pairs) in the remaining eight cases in under a day of computing.</p></details> |  |

We propose OODD, a novel test-time OOD detection method that dynamically maintains and updates an OOD dictionary without fine-tuning. Our approach leverages a priority queue-based dictionary that accumulates representative OOD features during testing, combined with an informative inlier sampling strategy for in-distribution (ID) samples. To ensure stable performance during early testing, we propose a dual OOD stabilization mechanism that leverages strategically generated outliers derived from ID data. To our best knowledge, extensive experiments on the OpenOOD benchmark demonstrate that OODD significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving a 26.0% improvement in FPR95 on CIFAR-100 Far OOD detection compared to the state-of-the-art approach. Furthermore, we present an optimized variant of the KNN-based OOD detection framework that achieves a 3x speedup while maintaining detection performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Estimating relapse time distribution from longitudinal biomarker trajectories using iterative regression and continuous time Markov processes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10448v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Biomarker measurements obtained by blood sampling are often used as a non-invasive means of monitoring tumour progression in cancer patients. Diseases evolve dynamically over time, and studying longitudinal observations of specific biomarkers can help to understand patients response to treatment and predict disease progression. We propose a novel iterative regression-based method to estimate changes in patients status within a cohort that includes censored patients, and illustrate it on clinical data from myeloma cases. We formulate the relapse time estimation problem in the framework of Piecewise Deterministic Markov processes (PDMP), where the Euclidean component is a surrogate biomarker for patient state. This approach enables continuous-time estimation of the status-change dates, which in turn allows for accurate inference of the relapse time distribution. A key challenge lies in the partial observability of the process, a complexity that has been rarely addressed in previous studies. . We evaluate the performance of our procedure through a simulation study and compare it with different approaches. This work is a proof of concept on biomarker trajectories with simple behaviour, but our method can easily be extended to more complex dynamics.</p></details> |  |

Simulation is a key ingredient for conducting such testing in a cost-effective and scalable way. Neural rendering methods have gained popularity, as they can build simulation environments from collected logs in a data-driven manner. However, existing neural radiance field (NeRF) methods for sensor-realistic rendering of camera and lidar data suffer from low rendering speeds, limiting their applicability for large-scale testing. While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables real-time rendering, current methods are limited to camera data and are unable to render lidar data essential for autonomous driving. To address these limitations, we propose SplatAD, the first 3DGS-based method for realistic, real-time rendering of dynamic scenes for both camera and lidar data. SplatAD accurately models key sensor-specific phenomena such as rolling shutter effects, lidar intensity, and lidar ray dropouts, using purpose-built algorithms to optimize rendering efficiency. Evaluation across three autonomous driving datasets demonstrates that SplatAD achieves state-of-the-art rendering quality with up to +2 PSNR for NVS and +3 PSNR for reconstruction while increasing rendering speed over NeRF-based methods by an order of magnitude.

| **[A nonlinear real time capable motion cueing algorithm based on deep reinforcement learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10419v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In motion simulation, motion cueing algorithms are used for the trajectory planning of the motion simulator platform, where workspace limitations prevent direct reproduction of reference trajectories. Strategies such as motion washout, which return the platform to its center, are crucial in these settings. For serial robotic MSPs with highly nonlinear workspaces, it is essential to maximize the efficient utilization of the MSPs kinematic and dynamic capabilities. Traditional approaches, including classical washout filtering and linear model predictive control, fail to consider platform-specific, nonlinear properties, while nonlinear model predictive control, though comprehensive, imposes high computational demands that hinder real-time, pilot-in-the-loop application without further simplification. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a novel approach using deep reinforcement learning for motion cueing, demonstrated here for the first time in a 6-degree-of-freedom setting with full consideration of the MSPs kinematic nonlinearities. Previous work by the authors successfully demonstrated the application of DRL to a simplified 2-DOF setup, which did not consider kinematic or dynamic constraints. This approach has been extended to all 6 DOF by incorporating a complete kinematic model of the MSP into the algorithm, a crucial step for enabling its application on a real motion simulator. The training of the DRL-MCA is based on Proximal Policy Optimization in an actor-critic implementation combined with an automated hyperparameter optimization. After detailing the necessary training framework and the algorithm itself, we provide a comprehensive validation, demonstrating that the DRL MCA achieves competitive performance against established algorithms. Moreover, it generates feasible trajectories by respecting all system constraints and meets all real-time requirements with low...</p></details> |  |
| **[Standard Heisenberg's uncertainty principles of Cohen's class time-frequency distribution with specific kernels](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10360v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time-frequency concentration and resolution of the Cohen's class time-frequency distribution (CCTFD) has attracted much attention in time-frequency analysis. A variety of uncertainty principles of the CCTFD is therefore derived, including the weak Heisenberg type, the Hardy type, the Nazarov type, and the local type. However, the standard Heisenberg type still remains unresolved. In this study, we address the question of how the standard Heisenberg's uncertainty principle of the CCTFD is affected by fundamental properties. The investigated distribution properties are Parseval's relation and the concise frequency domain definition (i.e., only frequency variables are explicitly found in the tensor product), based on which we confine our attention to the CCTFD with some specific kernels. That is the unit modulus and v-independent time translation, reversal and scaling invariant kernel CCTFD (UMITRSK-CCTFD). We then extend the standard Heisenberg's uncertainty principles of the Wigner distribution to those of the UMITRSK-CCTFD, giving birth to various types of attainable lower bounds on the uncertainty product in the UMITRSK-CCTFD domain. The derived results strengthen the existing weak Heisenberg type and fill gaps in the standard Heisenberg type.</p></details> |  |

In response, this paper presents Personalized Alignment at Decoding-time (PAD), a novel framework designed to align LLM outputs with diverse personalized preferences during the inference phase, eliminating the need for additional training. By introducing a unique personalized reward modeling strategy, this framework decouples the text generation process from personalized preferences, facilitating the generation of generalizable token-level personalized rewards. The PAD algorithm leverages these rewards to guide the decoding process, dynamically tailoring the base model's predictions to personalized preferences. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that PAD not only outperforms existing training-based alignment methods in terms of aligning with diverse preferences but also shows significant generalizability to preferences unseen during training and scalability across different base models. This work advances the capability of LLMs to meet user needs in real-time applications, presenting a substantial step forward in personalized LLM alignment.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |

Several studies have analyzed over-parameterized linear models with high-dimensional data, which may not be sparse; however, existing results rely on the assumption of sample independence. In this study, we analyze a linear regression model with dependent time-series data in an over-parameterized setting. We consider an estimator using interpolation and develop a theory for the excess risk of the estimator. Then, we derive non-asymptotic risk bounds for the estimator for cases with dependent data. This analysis reveals that the coherence of the temporal covariance plays a key role; the risk bound is influenced by the product of temporal covariance matrices at different time steps. Moreover, we show the convergence rate of the risk bound and demonstrate that it is also influenced by the coherence of the temporal covariance. Finally, we provide several examples of specific dependent processes applicable to our setting.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Bernoulli</p></details> |

| **[Bayesian analysis of restricted mean survival time adjusted for covariates using pseudo-observations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05225v2)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The difference in restricted mean survival time (RMST) is a clinically meaningful measure to quantify treatment effect in randomized controlled trials, especially when the proportional hazards assumption does not hold. Several frequentist methods exist to estimate RMST adjusted for covariates based on modeling and integrating the survival function. A more natural approach may be a regression model on RMST using pseudo-observations, which allows for a direct estimation without modeling the survival function. Only a few Bayesian methods exist, and each requires a model of the survival function. We developed a new Bayesian method that combines the use of pseudo-observations with the generalized method of moments. This offers RMST estimation adjusted for covariates without the need to model the survival function, making it more attractive than existing Bayesian methods. A simulation study was conducted with different time-dependent treatment effects (early, delayed, and crossing survival) and covariate effects, showing that our approach provides valid results, aligns with existing methods, and shows improved precision after covariate adjustment. For illustration, we applied our approach to a phase III trial in prostate cancer, providing estimates of the treatment effect on RMST, comparable to existing methods. In addition, our approach provided the effect of other covariates on RMST and determined the posterior probability of the difference in RMST exceeds any given time threshold for any covariate, allowing for nuanced and interpretable results.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deep Learning for Time Series Forecasting: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10198v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting (TSF) has long been a crucial task in both industry and daily life. Most classical statistical models may have certain limitations when applied to practical scenarios in fields such as energy, healthcare, traffic, meteorology, and economics, especially when high accuracy is required. With the continuous development of deep learning, numerous new models have emerged in the field of time series forecasting in recent years. However, existing surveys have not provided a unified summary of the wide range of model architectures in this field, nor have they given detailed summaries of works in feature extraction and datasets. To address this gap, in this review, we comprehensively study the previous works and summarize the general paradigms of Deep Time Series Forecasting (DTSF) in terms of model architectures. Besides, we take an innovative approach by focusing on the composition of time series and systematically explain important feature extraction methods. Additionally, we provide an overall compilation of datasets from various domains in existing works. Finally, we systematically emphasize the significant challenges faced and future research directions in this field.</p></details> |  |
| **[Age of Synchronization Minimization in Wireless Networks with Random Updates and Time-Varying Timeliness Requirement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04281v2)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study considers a wireless network where multiple nodes transmit status updates to a base station (BS) via a shared, error-free channel with limited bandwidth. The status updates arrive at each node randomly. We use the Age of Synchronization (AoS) as a metric to measure the information freshness of the updates. The AoS of each node has a timely-varying importance which follows a Markov chain. Our objective is to minimize the weighted sum AoS of the system. The optimization problem is relaxed and formulated as a constrained Markov decision process (CMDP). Solving the relaxed CMDP by a linear programming algorithm yields a stationary policy, which helps us propose a near-stationary policy for the original problem. Numerical simulations show that in most configurations, the AoS performance of our policy outperforms the policy choosing the maximum AoS regardless of weight variations.</p></details> |  |

Our method relies on reversing the dynamics of the forward process and using this to learn a score function, which, via Doob's $h$-transform, yields a bridged diffusion process; that is, a process conditioned on an endpoint. In contrast to prior methods, we learn the score term $\nabla_x \log p(t, x; T, y)$ directly, for given $t, y$, completely avoiding first learning a time-reversal. We compare the performance of our algorithm with existing methods and see that it outperforms using the (learned) time-reversals to learn the score term.

| **[Accuracy of Discretely Sampled Stochastic Policies in Continuous-time Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09981v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Stochastic policies are widely used in continuous-time reinforcement learning algorithms. However, executing a stochastic policy and evaluating its performance in a continuous-time environment remain open challenges. This work introduces and rigorously analyzes a policy execution framework that samples actions from a stochastic policy at discrete time points and implements them as piecewise constant controls. We prove that as the sampling mesh size tends to zero, the controlled state process converges weakly to the dynamics with coefficients aggregated according to the stochastic policy. We explicitly quantify the convergence rate based on the regularity of the coefficients and establish an optimal first-order convergence rate for sufficiently regular coefficients. Additionally, we show that the same convergence rates hold with high probability concerning the sampling noise, and further establish a $1/2$-order almost sure convergence when the volatility is not controlled. Building on these results, we analyze the bias and variance of various policy evaluation and policy gradient estimators based on discrete-time observations. Our results provide theoretical justification for the exploratory stochastic control framework in [H. Wang, T. Zariphopoulou, and X.Y. Zhou, J. Mach. Learn. Res., 21 (2020), pp. 1-34].</p></details> |  |

While previous research has predominantly focused on functional motion generation, the critical aspect of expressive motion in human-robot interaction remains largely unexplored. This paper presents a novel real-time motion generation planner that enhances interactivity by creating expressive robotic motions between arbitrary start and end states within predefined time constraints. Our approach involves three key contributions: first, we develop a mapping algorithm to construct an expressive motion dataset derived from human dance movements; second, we train motion generation models in both Cartesian and joint spaces using this dataset; third, we introduce an optimization algorithm that guarantees smooth, collision-free motion while maintaining the intended expressive style. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, which can generate expressive and generalized motions in under 0.5 seconds while satisfying all specified constraints.</p></details> |  |
| **[PI-Controlled Variable Time-Step Power System Simulation Using an Adaptive Order Differential Transformation Method](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09898v1)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dynamic simulation plays a crucial role in power system transient stability analysis, but traditional numerical integration-based methods are time-consuming due to the small time step sizes. Other semi-analytical solution methods, such as the Differential Transformation method, often struggle to select proper orders and steps, leading to slow performance and numerical instability. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel adaptive dynamic simulation approach for power system transient stability analysis. The approach adds feedback control and optimization to selecting the step and order, utilizing the Differential Transformation method and a proportional-integral control strategy to control truncation errors. Order selection is formulated as an optimization problem resulting in a variable-step-optimal-order method that achieves significantly larger time step sizes without violating numerical stability. It is applied to three systems: the IEEE 9-bus, 3-generator system, IEEE 39-bus, 10-generator system, and a Polish 2383-bus, 327-generator system, promising computational efficiency and numerical robustness for large-scale power system is demonstrated in comprehensive case studies.</p></details> |  |

However, their robustness and reliability in real-world applications remain under-explored, particularly concerning their susceptibility to adversarial attacks. In this paper, we introduce a targeted adversarial attack framework for LLM-based time series forecasting. By employing both gradient-free and black-box optimization methods, we generate minimal yet highly effective perturbations that significantly degrade the forecasting accuracy across multiple datasets and LLM architectures. Our experiments, which include models like LLMTime with GPT-3.5, GPT-4, LLaMa, and Mistral, TimeGPT, and TimeLLM show that adversarial attacks lead to much more severe performance degradation than random noise, and demonstrate the broad effectiveness of our attacks across different LLMs. The results underscore the critical vulnerabilities of LLMs in time series forecasting, highlighting the need for robust defense mechanisms to ensure their reliable deployment in practical applications.

However, achieving real-time decision-making with Digital Twins requires efficient optimization driven by accurate predictions of highly nonlinear manufacturing systems. This paper presents a simultaneous multi-step Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework for real-time decision-making, using a multivariate deep neural network, named Time-Series Dense Encoder (TiDE), as the surrogate model. Unlike conventional MPC models which only provide one-step ahead prediction, TiDE is capable of predicting future states within the prediction horizon in one shot (multi-step), significantly accelerating the MPC. Using Directed Energy Deposition (DED) additive manufacturing as a case study, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed MPC in achieving melt pool temperature tracking to ensure part quality, while reducing porosity defects by regulating laser power to maintain melt pool depth constraints. In this work, we first show that TiDE is capable of accurately predicting melt pool temperature and depth. Second, we demonstrate that the proposed MPC achieves precise temperature tracking while satisfying melt pool depth constraints within a targeted dilution range (10\%-30\%), reducing potential porosity defects. Compared to PID controller, the MPC results in smoother and less fluctuating laser power profiles with competitive or superior melt pool temperature control performance. This demonstrates the MPC's proactive control capabilities, leveraging time-series prediction and real-time optimization, positioning it as a powerful tool for future Digital Twin applications and real-time process optimization in manufacturing.</p></details> |  |
| **[Approximately Counting and Sampling Hamiltonian Motifs in Sublinear Time](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09810v1)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Counting small subgraphs, referred to as motifs, in large graphs is a fundamental task in graph analysis, extensively studied across various contexts and computational models. In the sublinear-time regime, the relaxed problem of approximate counting has been explored within two prominent query frameworks: the standard model, which permits degree, neighbor, and pair queries, and the strictly more powerful augmented model, which additionally allows for uniform edge sampling. Currently, in the standard model, (optimal) results have been established only for approximately counting edges, stars, and cliques, all of which have a radius of one. This contrasts sharply with the state of affairs in the augmented model, where algorithmic results (some of which are optimal) are known for any input motif, leading to a disparity which we term the ``scope gap" between the two models. In this work, we make significant progress in bridging this gap. Our approach draws inspiration from recent advancements in the augmented model and utilizes a framework centered on counting by uniform sampling, thus allowing us to establish new results in the standard model and simplify on previous results. In particular, our first, and main, contribution is a new algorithm in the standard model for approximately counting any Hamiltonian motif in sublinear time. Our second contribution is a variant of our algorithm that enables nearly uniform sampling of these motifs, a capability previously limited in the standard model to edges and cliques. Our third contribution is to introduce even simpler algorithms for stars and cliques by exploiting their radius-one property. As a result, we simplify all previously known algorithms in the standard model for stars (Gonen, Ron, Shavitt (SODA 2010)), triangles (Eden, Levi, Ron Seshadhri (FOCS 2015)) and cliques (Eden, Ron, Seshadri (STOC 2018)).</p></details> |  |

Transformer effectively combines information from the past input and output samples in auto-regressive manner so that each sample becomes aware of all inputs and outputs. In sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) modeling, the transformer processed samples become effective in predicting the next output. Time series forecasting is a Seq2Seq problem. The original architecture is defined for discrete input and output sequence tokens, but to adopt it for time series, the model must be adapted for continuous data. This work introduces minimal adaptations to make the original transformer architecture suitable for continuous value time series data.</p></details> | 8 pages, 8 figures |

As extreme weather events driven by climate change increase, identifying risky FCs becomes crucial for mitigating cascading failures and ensuring grid stability. However, the complexity of the spatio-temporal dependencies among grid components and the exponential growth of the search space with system size pose significant challenges to modeling and risky FC search. To tackle this, we model the search process as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP), which is subsequently solved via a time-varying graph recurrent neural network (GRNN). This approach captures the spatial and temporal structure induced by the system's topology and dynamics, while efficiently summarizing the system's history in the GRNN's latent space, enabling scalable and effective identification of risky FCs.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2303.08864</p></details> |

In recent years, deep neural networks (DNNs) have greatly enhanced the performance of TSC models in these critical domains. However, DNNs are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where attackers can covertly implant triggers into models to induce malicious outcomes. Existing backdoor attacks targeting DNN-based TSC models remain elementary. In particular, early methods borrow trigger designs from computer vision, which are ineffective for time series data. More recent approaches utilize generative models for trigger generation, but at the cost of significant computational complexity. In this work, we analyze the limitations of existing attacks and introduce an enhanced method, FreqBack. Drawing inspiration from the fact that DNN models inherently capture frequency domain features in time series data, we identify that improper perturbations in the frequency domain are the root cause of ineffective attacks. To address this, we propose to generate triggers both effectively and efficiently, guided by frequency analysis. FreqBack exhibits substantial performance across five models and eight datasets, achieving an impressive attack success rate of over 90%, while maintaining less than a 3% drop in model accuracy on clean data.</p></details> | WWW 2025 (Oral) |

The problem has a long history in statistics and signal processing and various algorithms have been developed primarily for simple parametric models. In this work, we focus on modeling the data through feed-forward neural networks and develop a detection strategy based on the following two-step procedure. In the first step, the neural network is trained over a prespecified window of the data, and its test error function is calibrated over another prespecified window. Then, the test error function is used over a moving window to identify the change point. Once a change point is detected, the procedure involving these two steps is repeated until all change points are identified. The proposed strategy yields consistent estimates for both the number and the locations of the change points under temporal dependence of the data-generating process. The effectiveness of the proposed strategy is illustrated on synthetic data sets that provide insights on how to select in practice tuning parameters of the algorithm and in real data sets. Finally, we note that although the detection strategy is general and can work with different neural network architectures, the theoretical guarantees provided are specific to feed-forward neural architectures.</p></details> |  |

The asymptotic convergence theory for classical, non-parametric estimators, is well-understood, but the non-asymptotic theory is still rather limited. Our recent work gave the first non-asymptotic error bounds on the well-known Bartlett and Welch methods, but under restrictive assumptions. In this paper, we derive non-asymptotic error bounds for a class of non-parametric spectral estimators, which includes the classical Bartlett and Welch methods, under the assumption that the data is an $L$-mixing stochastic process. A broad range of processes arising in time-series analysis, such as autoregressive processes and measurements of geometrically ergodic Markov chains, can be shown to be $L$-mixing. In particular, $L$-mixing processes can model a variety of nonlinear phenomena which do not satisfy the assumptions of our prior work. Our new error bounds for $L$-mixing processes match the error bounds in the restrictive settings from prior work up to logarithmic factors.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 2 figures, accepted by American Control Conference</p></details> |

| **[Harnessing Causality in Reinforcement Learning With Bagged Decision Times](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14659v2)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider reinforcement learning (RL) for a class of problems with bagged decision times. A bag contains a finite sequence of consecutive decision times. The transition dynamics are non-Markovian and non-stationary within a bag. All actions within a bag jointly impact a single reward, observed at the end of the bag. For example, in mobile health, multiple activity suggestions in a day collectively affect a user's daily commitment to being active. Our goal is to develop an online RL algorithm to maximize the discounted sum of the bag-specific rewards. To handle non-Markovian transitions within a bag, we utilize an expert-provided causal directed acyclic graph (DAG). Based on the DAG, we construct states as a dynamical Bayesian sufficient statistic of the observed history, which results in Markov state transitions within and across bags. We then formulate this problem as a periodic Markov decision process (MDP) that allows non-stationarity within a period. An online RL algorithm based on Bellman equations for stationary MDPs is generalized to handle periodic MDPs. We show that our constructed state achieves the maximal optimal value function among all state constructions for a periodic MDP. Finally, we evaluate the proposed method on testbed variants built from real data in a mobile health clinical trial.</p></details> |  |

Unlike classical network interdiction models where the leader is subject to a single budget constraint, in our setting, both the leader and the follower are subject to several independent capacity constraints and engage in a zero-sum game. While the problem of finding a maximum weight independent set in a partition matroid is known to be polynomially solvable, we prove that the considered bilevel problem is $NP$-hard even when the weights of ground elements are all binary. On a positive note, it is revealed that, if the number of capacity constraints is fixed for either the leader or the follower, then the considered class of bilevel problems admits several polynomial-time solution schemes. Specifically, these schemes are based on a single-level dual reformulation, a dynamic programming-based approach, and a greedy algorithm for the leader.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The proof of Theorem 4 is refined</p></details> |
| **[Doubly Robust and Efficient Calibration of Prediction Sets for Censored Time-to-Event Outcomes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04615v2)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Our objective is to construct well-calibrated prediction sets for a time-to-event outcome subject to right-censoring with guaranteed coverage. Our approach is inspired by modern conformal inference literature in that, unlike classical frameworks, we obviate the need for a well-specified parametric or semiparametric survival model to accomplish our goal. In contrast to existing conformal prediction methods for survival data, which restrict censoring to be of Type I, whereby potential censoring times are assumed to be fully observed on all units in both training and validation samples, we consider the more common right-censoring setting in which either only the censoring time or only the event time of primary interest is directly observed, whichever comes first. Under a standard conditional independence assumption between the potential survival and censoring times given covariates, we propose and analyze two methods to construct valid and efficient lower predictive bounds for the survival time of a future observation. The proposed methods build upon modern semiparametric efficiency theory for censored data, in that the first approach incorporates inverse-probability-of-censoring weighting to account for censoring, while the second approach is based on augmenting this method with an additional correction term. For both methods, we formally establish asymptotic coverage guarantees and demonstrate, both theoretically and through empirical experiments, that the augmented approach substantially improves efficiency over the inverse-probability-of-censoring weighting method. Specifically, its coverage error bound is of second-order mixed bias type, that is doubly robust, and therefore guaranteed to be asymptotically negligible relative to the coverage error of the non-augmented method.</p></details> | 39 pages, 6 figures |

To provide varying Quality of Service (QoS) for these traffic types, TSN incorporates different scheduling and shaping mechanisms. However, assigning traffic types to the proper scheduler or shaper, known as Traffic-Type Assignment (TTA), is a known NP-hard problem. Relying solely on domain expertise to make these design decisions can be inefficient, especially in complex network scenarios. In this paper, we present a proof-of-concept highlighting the advantages of a learning-based approach to the TTA problem. We formulate an optimization model for TTA in TSN and develop a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) based Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) model, called ``TTASelector'', to assign traffic types to TSN flows efficiently. Using synthetic and realistic test cases, our evaluation shows that TTASelector assigns a higher number of traffic types to HRT and SRT flows compared to the state-of-the-art Tabu Search-based metaheuristic method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in technical session at the IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Dual Test-time Training for Out-of-distribution Recommender System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15620v2)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning has been widely applied in recommender systems, which has achieved revolutionary progress recently. However, most existing learning-based methods assume that the user and item distributions remain unchanged between the training phase and the test phase. However, the distribution of user and item features can naturally shift in real-world scenarios, potentially resulting in a substantial decrease in recommendation performance. This phenomenon can be formulated as an Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) recommendation problem. To address this challenge, we propose a novel Dual Test-Time-Training framework for OOD Recommendation, termed DT3OR. In DT3OR, we incorporate a model adaptation mechanism during the test-time phase to carefully update the recommendation model, allowing the model to specially adapt to the shifting user and item features. To be specific, we propose a self-distillation task and a contrastive task to assist the model learning both the user's invariant interest preferences and the variant user/item characteristics during the test-time phase, thus facilitating a smooth adaptation to the shifting features. Furthermore, we provide theoretical analysis to support the rationale behind our dual test-time training framework. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first work to address OOD recommendation via a test-time-training strategy. We conduct experiments on three datasets with various backbones. Comprehensive experimental results have demonstrated the effectiveness of DT3OR compared to other state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bidirectional Prototype-Reward co-Evolution for Test-Time Adaptation of Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09394v1)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Test-time adaptation (TTA) is crucial in maintaining Vision-Language Models (VLMs) performance when facing real-world distribution shifts, particularly when the source data or target labels are inaccessible. Existing TTA methods rely on CLIP's output probability distribution for feature evaluation, which can introduce biases under domain shifts. This misalignment may cause features to be misclassified due to text priors or incorrect textual associations. To address these limitations, we propose Bidirectional Prototype-Reward co-Evolution (BPRE), a novel TTA framework for VLMs that integrates feature quality assessment with prototype evolution through a synergistic feedback loop. BPRE first employs a Multi-Dimensional Quality-Aware Reward Module to evaluate feature quality and guide prototype refinement precisely. The continuous refinement of prototype quality through Prototype-Reward Interactive Evolution will subsequently enhance the computation of more robust Multi-Dimensional Quality-Aware Reward Scores. Through the bidirectional interaction, the precision of rewards and the evolution of prototypes mutually reinforce each other, forming a self-evolving cycle. Extensive experiments are conducted across 15 diverse recognition datasets encompassing natural distribution shifts and cross-dataset generalization scenarios. Results demonstrate that BPRE consistently achieves superior average performance compared to state-of-the-art methods across different model architectures, such as ResNet-50 and ViT-B/16. By emphasizing comprehensive feature evaluation and bidirectional knowledge refinement, BPRE advances VLM generalization capabilities, offering a new perspective on TTA.</p></details> |  |

Factors contributing to these disparities include limited access to quality healthcare, socioeconomic inequalities, and variations in healthcare infrastructure. Addressing these issues is crucial for improving health outcomes for mothers and newborns, particularly in underserved communities. To mitigate these challenges, we have developed an AI-enabled smartphone application designed to provide decision support at the point-of-care. This tool aims to enhance health monitoring during pregnancy by leveraging machine learning (ML) techniques. The intended use of this application is to assist midwives during routine home visits by offering real-time analysis and providing feedback based on collected data. The application integrates TensorFlow Lite (TFLite) and other Python-based algorithms within a Kotlin framework to process data in real-time. It is designed for use in low-resource settings, where traditional healthcare infrastructure may be lacking. The intended patient population includes pregnant women and new mothers in underserved areas and the developed system was piloted in rural Guatemala. This ML-based solution addresses the critical need for accessible and quality perinatal care by empowering healthcare providers with decision support tools to improve maternal and neonatal health outcomes.</p></details> |  |
| **[EVA-Gaussian: 3D Gaussian-based Real-time Human Novel View Synthesis under Diverse Multi-view Camera Settings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01425v2)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Feed-forward based 3D Gaussian Splatting methods have demonstrated exceptional capability in real-time novel view synthesis for human models. However, current approaches are confined to either dense viewpoint configurations or restricted image resolutions. These limitations hinder their flexibility in free-viewpoint rendering across a wide range of camera view angle discrepancies, and also restrict their ability to recover fine-grained human details in real time using commonly available GPUs. To address these challenges, we propose a novel pipeline named EVA-Gaussian for 3D human novel view synthesis across diverse multi-view camera settings. Specifically, we first design an Efficient Cross-View Attention (EVA) module to effectively fuse cross-view information under high resolution inputs and sparse view settings, while minimizing temporal and computational overhead. Additionally, we introduce a feature refinement mechianism to predict the attributes of the 3D Gaussians and assign a feature value to each Gaussian, enabling the correction of artifacts caused by geometric inaccuracies in position estimation and enhancing overall visual fidelity. Experimental results on the THuman2.0 and THumansit datasets showcase the superiority of EVA-Gaussian in rendering quality across diverse camera settings.

| **[A Time-Triggered Communication Method Based on Urgency-Based Scheduler in Time-Sensitive Networking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20077v2)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The development of the automotive industry and automation has led to a growing demand for time-critical systems to have low latency and jitter for critical traffic. To address this issue, the IEEE 802.1 Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) task group proposed the Time-Aware Shaper (TAS) to implement Time-Triggered (TT) communication, enabling deterministic transmission by assigning specific time windows to each stream. While Fixed Routing and Waiting-Allowed (FR-WA) scheduling algorithms offer flexibility, they suffer from inefficiencies in solution time and scalability. This study analyzes TAS implementation challenges, emphasizing how network scale expansion increases computational constraints. We propose an Urgency-Based Scheduler method (TT-UBS) to address these limitations to enhance deterministic transmission and computational efficiency under anomalies. A novel scheduling algorithm for TT-UBS parameter determination is developed, alongside simulations and comparative evaluations. Results show that TT-UBS guarantees deterministic traffic delivery while reducing solution time by 98.22% in test scenarios compared to traditional approaches. The methodology is extended to other scheduling algorithms to assess efficiency improvements. This advancement supports TSN's application in mission-critical systems by optimizing time-triggered communication performance and enabling reliable network deployment. The framework demonstrates significant potential for real-time in-vehicle networks requiring latency and jitter control.</p></details> |  |

Recent studies have revealed that Large Language Models (LLMs), with their powerful in-contextual modeling capabilities, hold significant potential for TSF. However, existing LLM-based methods usually perform suboptimally because they neglect the inherent characteristics of time series data. Unlike the textual data used in LLM pre-training, the time series data is semantically sparse and comprises distinctive temporal patterns. To address this problem, we propose LLM-PS to empower the LLM for TSF by learning the fundamental \textit{Patterns} and meaningful \textit{Semantics} from time series data. Our LLM-PS incorporates a new multi-scale convolutional neural network adept at capturing both short-term fluctuations and long-term trends within the time series. Meanwhile, we introduce a time-to-text module for extracting valuable semantics across continuous time intervals rather than isolated time points. By integrating these patterns and semantics, LLM-PS effectively models temporal dependencies, enabling a deep comprehension of time series and delivering accurate forecasts. Intensive experimental results demonstrate that LLM-PS achieves state-of-the-art performance in both short- and long-term forecasting tasks, as well as in few- and zero-shot settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bayesian Test-Time Adaptation for Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09248v1)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Test-time adaptation with pre-trained vision-language models, such as CLIP, aims to adapt the model to new, potentially out-of-distribution test data. Existing methods calculate the similarity between visual embedding and learnable class embeddings, which are initialized by text embeddings, for zero-shot image classification. In this work, we first analyze this process based on Bayes theorem, and observe that the core factors influencing the final prediction are the likelihood and the prior. However, existing methods essentially focus on adapting class embeddings to adapt likelihood, but they often ignore the importance of prior. To address this gap, we propose a novel approach, \textbf{B}ayesian \textbf{C}lass \textbf{A}daptation (BCA), which in addition to continuously updating class embeddings to adapt likelihood, also uses the posterior of incoming samples to continuously update the prior for each class embedding. This dual updating mechanism allows the model to better adapt to distribution shifts and achieve higher prediction accuracy. Our method not only surpasses existing approaches in terms of performance metrics but also maintains superior inference rates and memory usage, making it highly efficient and practical for real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

Although extensive research has been conducted in this field, the challenge of rapid traversal through such environments has not been fully addressed. This paper addresses this problem by proposing a novel real-time scheduling scheme designed to optimize the passage of multi-robot systems through complex, obstacle-rich maps. Inspired from network flow optimization, our scheme decomposes the environment into a network structure, enabling the efficient allocation of robots to paths based on real-time congestion data. The proposed scheduling planner operates on top of existing collision avoidance algorithms, focusing on minimizing traversal time by balancing robot detours and waiting times. Our simulation results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed scheme. Additionally, we validated its effectiveness through real world flight tests using ten quadrotors. This work contributes a lightweight, effective scheduling planner capable of meeting the real-time demands of multi-robot systems in obstacle-rich environments.</p></details> |  |

In this letter, we introduce a novel turbojet-powered UAV platform named Hex-Jet. Our concept integrates thrust vectoring and differential thrust for comprehensive attitude control. This approach notably simplifies the thrust vectoring mechanism. We utilize a predictor-based time delay control method based on the frequency domain model in our Hex-Jet controller design to mitigate the delay in roll attitude control caused by turbojet dynamics. Our comparative studies provide valuable insights for the UAV community, and flight tests on the scaled prototype demonstrate the successful implementation and verification of the proposed predictor-based time delay control technique.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters. 8 pages, 11 figures</p></details> |

There is a growing trend in the development of deep learning methods for analyzing censored time-to-event data, especially when dealing with high-dimensional predictors that are complexly interrelated. Many existing deep learning approaches for estimating the conditional survival functions extend the Cox regression models by replacing the linear function of predictor effects by a shallow feed-forward neural network while maintaining the proportional hazards assumption. Their implementation can be computationally intensive due to the use of the full dataset at each iteration because the use of batch data may distort the at-risk set of the partial likelihood function. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel deep learning approach to non-parametric estimation of the conditional survival functions using the generative adversarial networks leveraging self-consistent equations. The proposed method is model-free and does not require any parametric assumptions on the structure of the conditional survival function. We establish the convergence rate of our proposed estimator of the conditional survival function. In addition, we evaluate the performance of the proposed method through simulation studies and demonstrate its application on a real-world dataset.</p></details> |  |

Using the input-state trajectories of an expert agent, the proposed algorithms separately utilize control policy information and the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation to estimate different sets of cost function parameters. This approach allows the algorithms to achieve broader applicability while maintaining a model-free framework. Also, the model-free algorithm reduces complexity compared to existing methods, as it requires solving a forward optimal control problem only once during initialization. Furthermore, in our partially model-free algorithm, this step can be bypassed entirely for systems with known input dynamics. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our algorithms, highlighting their potential for real-world deployment in autonomous systems and robotics.</p></details> |  |

While team strategies have been widely studied, analyzing inconsistencies in professional matches remains a significant challenge. The complexity lies in defining and quantifying the difference between real-time and preferred professional strategies, as well as understanding the disparities between them.

SANA-Sprint is built on a pre-trained foundation model and augmented with hybrid distillation, dramatically reducing inference steps from 20 to 1-4. We introduce three key innovations: (1) We propose a training-free approach that transforms a pre-trained flow-matching model for continuous-time consistency distillation (sCM), eliminating costly training from scratch and achieving high training efficiency. Our hybrid distillation strategy combines sCM with latent adversarial distillation (LADD): sCM ensures alignment with the teacher model, while LADD enhances single-step generation fidelity. (2) SANA-Sprint is a unified step-adaptive model that achieves high-quality generation in 1-4 steps, eliminating step-specific training and improving efficiency. (3) We integrate ControlNet with SANA-Sprint for real-time interactive image generation, enabling instant visual feedback for user interaction. SANA-Sprint establishes a new Pareto frontier in speed-quality tradeoffs, achieving state-of-the-art performance with 7.59 FID and 0.74 GenEval in only 1 step - outperforming FLUX-schnell (7.94 FID / 0.71 GenEval) while being 10x faster (0.1s vs 1.1s on H100).

Even though, some wildfires may be initially caused by human activity, but the spread of wildfires is mainly determined by environmental factors, for examples, (1) weather conditions such as temperature, wind direction and intensity, and moisture levels; (2) the amount and types of dry vegetation in a local area, and (3) topographic or local terrian conditions, which affects how much rain an area gets and how fire dynamics will be constrained or faciliated. Thus, to accurately forecast wildfire occurrence has become one of most urgent and taunting environmental challenges in global scale. In this work, we developed a real-time Multimodal Transformer Neural Network Machine Learning model that combines several advanced artificial intelligence techniques and statistical methods to practically forecast the occurrence of wildfire at the precise location in real time, which not only utilizes large scale data information such as hourly weather forecasting data, but also takes into account small scale topographical data such as local terrain condition and local vegetation conditions collecting from Google Earth images to determine the probabilities of wildfire occurrence location at small scale as well as their timing synchronized with weather forecast information. By using the wildfire data in the United States from 1992 to 2015 to train the multimodal transformer neural network, it can predict the probabilities of wildfire occurrence according to the real-time weather forecast and the synchronized Google Earth image data to provide the wildfire occurrence probability in any small location ($100m^2$) within 24 hours ahead.</p></details> |  |

| **[Two Simple Principles for Diffusion-Based Test-Time Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05274v2)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, diffusion-based test-time adaptations (TTA) have shown great advances, which leverage a diffusion model to map the images in the unknown test domain to the training domain. The unseen and diverse test domains make diffusion-based TTA an ill-posed problem. In this paper, we unravel two simple principles of the design tricks for diffusion-based methods. Intuitively, \textit{Principle 1} says semantic similarity preserving. We should preserve the semantic similarity between the original and generated test images. \textit{Principle 2} suggests minimal modifications. This principle enables the diffusion to map the test images to the training domain with minimal modifications of the test images. In particular, following the two principles, we propose our simple yet effective principle-guided diffusion-based test-time adaptation method (PDDA). Concretely, following Principle 1, we propose a semantic keeper, the method to preserve feature similarity, where the semantic keeper could filter the corruption introduced from the test domain, thus better preserving the semantics. Following Principle 2, we propose a modification keeper, where we introduce a regularization constraint into the generative process to minimize modifications to the test image. Meanwhile, there is a hidden conflict between the two principles. We further introduce the gradient-based view to unify the direction generated from two principles. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10C, CIFAR-100C, ImageNet-W, and ImageNet-C with WideResNet-28-10, ResNet-50, Swin-T, and ConvNext-T demonstrate that PDDA significantly performs better than the complex state-of-the-art baselines. Specifically, PDDA achieves 2.4\% average accuracy improvements in ImageNet-C without any training process.</p></details> |  |

These environmental factors impair the performance of cameras, LiDAR, and radar, leading to reduced situational awareness and increased accident risks. Conventional cloud-based AI systems introduce communication delays, making them unsuitable for the rapid decision-making required in real-time autonomous navigation. This paper presents a novel Edge AI-driven real-time decision-making framework designed to enhance AV responsiveness under adverse weather conditions. The proposed approach integrates convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for improved perception, alongside reinforcement learning (RL)-based strategies to optimize vehicle control in uncertain environments. By processing data at the network edge, this system significantly reduces decision latency while improving AV adaptability. The framework is evaluated using simulated driving scenarios in CARLA and real-world data from the Waymo Open Dataset, covering diverse weather conditions. Experimental results indicate that the proposed model achieves a 40% reduction in processing time and a 25% enhancement in perception accuracy compared to conventional cloud-based systems. These findings highlight the potential of Edge AI in improving AV autonomy, safety, and efficiency, paving the way for more reliable self-driving technology in challenging real-world environments.</p></details> |  |

| **[Over-the-Air Time-Frequency Synchronization in Distributed ISAC Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08920v1)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A distributed integrated sensing and communication (D-ISAC) system offers significant cooperative gains for both sensing and communication performance. These gains, however, can only be fully realized when the distributed nodes are perfectly synchronized, which is a challenge that remains largely unaddressed in current ISAC research. In this paper, we propose an over-the-air time-frequency synchronization framework for the D-ISAC system, leveraging the reciprocity of bistatic sensing channels. This approach overcomes the impractical dependency of traditional methods on a direct line-of-sight (LoS) link, enabling the estimation of time offset (TO) and carrier frequency offset (CFO) between two ISAC nodes even in non-LoS (NLOS) scenarios. To achieve this, we introduce a bistatic signal matching (BSM) technique with delay-Doppler decoupling, which exploits offset reciprocity (OR) in bistatic observations. This method compresses multiple sensing links into a single offset for estimation. We further present off-grid super-resolution estimators for TO and CFO, including the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) and the matrix pencil (MP) method, combined with BSM processing. These estimators provide accurate offset estimation compared to spectral cross-correlation techniques. Also, we extend the pairwise synchronization leveraging OR between two nodes to the synchronization of $N$ multiple distributed nodes, referred to as centralized pairwise synchronization. We analyze the Cramer-Rao bounds (CRBs) for TO and CFO estimates and evaluate the impact of D-ISAC synchronization on the bottom-line target localization performance. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, confirm the theoretical analysis, and demonstrate that the proposed synchronization approach can recover up to 96% of the bottom-line target localization performance of the fully-synchronous D-ISAC.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 10 figures, submitted to IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |
| **[Real-time simulation enabled navigation control of magnetic soft continuum robots in confined lumens](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08864v1)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Magnetic soft continuum robots (MSCRs) have emerged as a promising technology for minimally invasive interventions, offering enhanced dexterity and remote-controlled navigation in confined lumens. Unlike conventional guidewires with pre-shaped tips, MSCRs feature a magnetic tip that actively bends under applied magnetic fields. Despite extensive studies in modeling and simulation, achieving real-time navigation control of MSCRs in confined lumens remains a significant challenge. The primary reasons are due to robot-lumen contact interactions and computational limitations in modeling MSCR nonlinear behavior under magnetic actuation. Existing approaches, such as Finite Element Method (FEM) simulations and energy-minimization techniques, suffer from high computational costs and oversimplified contact interactions, making them impractical for real-world applications. In this work, we develop a real-time simulation and navigation control framework that integrates hard-magnetic elastic rod theory, formulated within the Discrete Differential Geometry (DDG) framework, with an order-reduced contact handling strategy. Our approach captures large deformations and complex interactions while maintaining computational efficiency. Next, the navigation control problem is formulated as an inverse design task, where optimal magnetic fields are computed in real time by minimizing the constrained forces and enhancing navigation accuracy. We validate the proposed framework through comprehensive numerical simulations and experimental studies, demonstrating its robustness, efficiency, and accuracy. The results show that our method significantly reduces computational costs while maintaining high-fidelity modeling, making it feasible for real-time deployment in clinical settings.</p></details> | 22 pages, 12 figures |
| **[Real-time Deformation-aware Control for Autonomous Robotic Subretinal Injection under iOCT Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06557v2)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robotic platforms provide consistent and precise tool positioning that significantly enhances retinal microsurgery. Integrating such systems with intraoperative optical coherence tomography (iOCT) enables image-guided robotic interventions, allowing autonomous performance of advanced treatments, such as injecting therapeutic agents into the subretinal space. However, tissue deformations due to tool-tissue interactions constitute a significant challenge in autonomous iOCT-guided robotic subretinal injections. Such interactions impact correct needle positioning and procedure outcomes. This paper presents a novel method for autonomous subretinal injection under iOCT guidance that considers tissue deformations during the insertion procedure. The technique is achieved through real-time segmentation and 3D reconstruction of the surgical scene from densely sampled iOCT B-scans, which we refer to as B${^5}$-scans. Using B${^5}$-scans we monitor the position of the instrument relative to a virtual target layer between the ILM and RPE. Our experiments on ex vivo porcine eyes demonstrate dynamic adjustment of the insertion depth and overall improved accuracy in needle positioning compared to prior autonomous insertion approaches. Compared to a 35% success rate in subretinal bleb generation with previous approaches, our method reliably created subretinal blebs in 90% our experiments.</p></details> |  |

A more robust understanding of the dynamics of cycle time may help practitioners avoid pitfalls in relying on velocity measures while evaluating software work. We analyze cycle time, a widely-used metric measuring time from ticket creation to completion, using a dataset of over 55,000 observations across 216 organizations. Through Bayesian hierarchical modeling that appropriately separates individual and organizational variation, we examine how coding time, task scoping, and collaboration patterns affect cycle time while characterizing its substantial variability across contexts. We find precise but modest associations between cycle time and factors including coding days per week, number of merged pull requests, and degree of collaboration. However, these effects are set against considerable unexplained variation both between and within individuals. Our findings suggest that while common workplace factors do influence cycle time in expected directions, any single observation provides limited signal about typical performance. This work demonstrates methods for analyzing complex operational metrics at scale while highlighting potential pitfalls in using such measurements to drive decision-making. We conclude that improving software delivery velocity likely requires systems-level thinking rather than individual-focused interventions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimal Output Feedback Learning Control for Discrete-Time Linear Quadratic Regulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06226v2)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper studies the linear quadratic regulation (LQR) problem of unknown discrete-time systems via dynamic output feedback learning control. In contrast to the state feedback, the optimality of the dynamic output feedback control for solving the LQR problem requires an implicit condition on the convergence of the state observer. Moreover, due to unknown system matrices and the existence of observer error, it is difficult to analyze the convergence and stability of most existing output feedback learning-based control methods. To tackle these issues, we propose a generalized dynamic output feedback learning control approach with guaranteed convergence, stability, and optimality performance for solving the LQR problem of unknown discrete-time linear systems. In particular, a dynamic output feedback controller is designed to be equivalent to a state feedback controller. This equivalence relationship is an inherent property without requiring convergence of the estimated state by the state observer, which plays a key role in establishing the off-policy learning control approaches. By value iteration and policy iteration schemes, the adaptive dynamic programming based learning control approaches are developed to estimate the optimal feedback control gain. In addition, a model-free stability criterion is provided by finding a nonsingular parameterization matrix, which contributes to establishing a switched iteration scheme. Furthermore, the convergence, stability, and optimality analyses of the proposed output feedback learning control approaches are given. Finally, the theoretical results are validated by two numerical examples.</p></details> | 16 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Can LLMs Understand Time Series Anomalies?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05440v3)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained popularity in time series forecasting, but their potential for anomaly detection remains largely unexplored. Our study investigates whether LLMs can understand and detect anomalies in time series data, focusing on zero-shot and few-shot scenarios. Inspired by conjectures about LLMs' behavior from time series forecasting research, we formulate key hypotheses about LLMs' capabilities in time series anomaly detection. We design and conduct principled experiments to test each of these hypotheses. Our investigation reveals several surprising findings about LLMs for time series: (1) LLMs understand time series better as images rather than as text, (2) LLMs do not demonstrate enhanced performance when prompted to engage in explicit reasoning about time series analysis. (3) Contrary to common beliefs, LLMs' understanding of time series does not stem from their repetition biases or arithmetic abilities. (4) LLMs' behaviors and performance in time series analysis vary significantly across different models. This study provides the first comprehensive analysis of contemporary LLM capabilities in time series anomaly detection. Our results suggest that while LLMs can understand trivial time series anomalies, we have no evidence that they can understand more subtle real-world anomalies. Many common conjectures based on their reasoning capabilities do not hold. All synthetic dataset generators, final prompts, and evaluation scripts have been made available in https://github.com/rose-stl-lab/anomllm.</p></details> |  |
| **[On a new robust method of inference for general time series models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08655v1)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this article, we propose a novel logistic quasi-maximum likelihood estimation (LQMLE) for general parametric time series models. Compared to the classical Gaussian QMLE and existing robust estimations, it enjoys many distinctive advantages, such as robustness in respect of distributional misspecification and heavy-tailedness of the innovation, more resiliency to outliers, smoothness and strict concavity of the log logistic quasi-likelihood function, and boundedness of the influence function among others. Under some mild conditions, we establish the strong consistency and asymptotic normality of the LQMLE. Moreover, we propose a new and vital parameter identifiability condition to ensure desirable asymptotics of the LQMLE. Further, based on the LQMLE, we consider the Wald test and the Lagrange multiplier test for the unknown parameters, and derive the limiting distributions of the corresponding test statistics. The applicability of our methodology is demonstrated by several time series models, including DAR, GARCH, ARMA-GARCH, DTARMACH, and EXPAR. Numerical simulation studies are carried out to assess the finite-sample performance of our methodology, and an empirical example is analyzed to illustrate its usefulness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Ideas in Inference-time Scaling can Benefit Generative Pre-training Algorithms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07154v2)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent years have seen significant advancements in foundation models through generative pre-training, yet algorithmic innovation in this space has largely stagnated around autoregressive models for discrete signals and diffusion models for continuous signals. This stagnation creates a bottleneck that prevents us from fully unlocking the potential of rich multi-modal data, which in turn limits the progress on multimodal intelligence. We argue that an inference-first perspective, which prioritizes scaling efficiency during inference time across sequence length and refinement steps, can inspire novel generative pre-training algorithms. Using Inductive Moment Matching (IMM) as a concrete example, we demonstrate how addressing limitations in diffusion models' inference process through targeted modifications yields a stable, single-stage algorithm that achieves superior sample quality with over an order of magnitude greater inference efficiency.</p></details> |  |

A common solution involves long-term temporal LiDAR data to densify the inputs. However, efficiently leveraging spatial-temporal information remains an open problem. In this paper, we propose a novel Semantic-Supervised Spatial-Temporal Fusion (ST-Fusion) method, which introduces a novel fusion module to relieve the spatial misalignment caused by the object motion over time and a feature-level semantic supervision to sufficiently unlock the capacity of the proposed fusion module. Specifically, the ST-Fusion consists of a Spatial Aggregation (SA) module and a Temporal Merging (TM) module. The SA module employs a convolutional layer with progressively expanding receptive fields to aggregate the object features from the local regions to alleviate the spatial misalignment, the TM module dynamically extracts object features from the preceding frames based on the attention mechanism for a comprehensive sequential presentation. Besides, in the semantic supervision, we propose a Semantic Injection method to enrich the sparse LiDAR data via injecting the point-wise semantic labels, using it for training a teacher model and providing a reconstruction target at the feature level supervised by the proposed object-aware loss. Extensive experiments on various LiDAR-based detectors demonstrate the effectiveness and universality of our proposal, yielding an improvement of approximately +2.8% in NDS based on the nuScenes benchmark.</p></details> | Accepted by ICRA2025 |
| **[Interactive Multimodal Fusion with Temporal Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10523v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents our method for the estimation of valence-arousal (VA) in the 8th Affective Behavior Analysis in-the-Wild (ABAW) competition. Our approach integrates visual and audio information through a multimodal framework. The visual branch uses a pre-trained ResNet model to extract spatial features from facial images. The audio branches employ pre-trained VGG models to extract VGGish and LogMel features from speech signals. These features undergo temporal modeling using Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs). We then apply cross-modal attention mechanisms, where visual features interact with audio features through query-key-value attention structures. Finally, the features are concatenated and passed through a regression layer to predict valence and arousal. Our method achieves competitive performance on the Aff-Wild2 dataset, demonstrating effective multimodal fusion for VA estimation in-the-wild.</p></details> |  |

Compared to classic STVG locating only a single target, OmniSTVG enables localization of not only an arbitrary number of text-referred targets but also their interacting counterparts in the query from the video, making it more flexible and practical in real scenarios for comprehensive understanding. In order to facilitate exploration of OmniSTVG, we introduce BOSTVG, a large-scale benchmark dedicated to OmniSTVG. Specifically, our BOSTVG consists of 10,018 videos with 10.2M frames and covers a wide selection of 287 classes from diverse scenarios. Each sequence in BOSTVG, paired with a free-form textual query, encompasses a varying number of targets ranging from 1 to 10. To ensure high quality, each video is manually annotated with meticulous inspection and refinement. To our best knowledge, BOSTVG is to date the first and the largest benchmark for OmniSTVG. To encourage future research, we introduce a simple yet effective approach, named OmniTube, which, drawing inspiration from Transformer-based STVG methods, is specially designed for OmniSTVG and demonstrates promising results. By releasing BOSTVG, we hope to go beyond classic STVG by locating every object appearing in the query for more comprehensive understanding, opening up a new direction for STVG. Our benchmark, model, and results will be released at https://github.com/JellyYao3000/OmniSTVG.</p></details> |  |

While large language models (LLMs) achieve unification through task-agnostic data and generation, existing visual generation models fail to meet these principles. Current approaches either rely on per-task datasets and large-scale training or adapt pre-trained image models with task-specific modifications, limiting their generalizability. In this work, we explore video models as a foundation for unified image generation, leveraging their inherent ability to model temporal correlations. We introduce RealGeneral, a novel framework that reformulates image generation as a conditional frame prediction task, analogous to in-context learning in LLMs. To bridge the gap between video models and condition-image pairs, we propose (1) a Unified Conditional Embedding module for multi-modal alignment and (2) a Unified Stream DiT Block with decoupled adaptive LayerNorm and attention mask to mitigate cross-modal interference. RealGeneral demonstrates effectiveness in multiple important visual generation tasks, e.g., it achieves a 14.5% improvement in subject similarity for customized generation and a 10% enhancement in image quality for canny-to-image task.

In this paper, we rethink that the redundancy in inversion-based image editing exists in both the spatial and temporal dimensions, such as the unnecessary computation in unedited regions and the redundancy in the inversion progress. To tackle these challenges, we propose a practical framework, named EEdit, to achieve efficient image editing. Specifically, we introduce three techniques to solve them one by one. For spatial redundancy, spatial locality caching is introduced to compute the edited region and its neighboring regions while skipping the unedited regions, and token indexing preprocessing is designed to further accelerate the caching. For temporal redundancy, inversion step skipping is proposed to reuse the latent for efficient editing. Our experiments demonstrate an average of 2.46 $\times$ acceleration without performance drop in a wide range of editing tasks including prompt-guided image editing, dragging and image composition.

Effective utilization of temporal information is crucial for SNNs, leading to the exploration of attention mechanisms to enhance this capability. Conventional attention operations either apply identical operation or employ non-identical operations across target dimensions. We identify that these approaches provide distinct perspectives on temporal information. To leverage the strengths of both operations, we propose a novel Dual Temporal-channel-wise Attention (DTA) mechanism that integrates both identical/non-identical attention strategies. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to concentrate on both the correlation and dependency of temporal-channel using both identical and non-identical attention operations. Experimental results demonstrate that the DTA mechanism achieves state-of-the-art performance on both static datasets (CIFAR10, CIFAR100, ImageNet-1k) and dynamic dataset (CIFAR10-DVS), elevating spike representation and capturing complex temporal-channel relationship.

To address this limitation, we curate a dedicated instruction fine-tuning dataset that focuses on enhancing temporal comprehension across five key dimensions. In order to reduce reliance on costly temporal annotations, we introduce a multi-task prompt fine-tuning approach that seamlessly integrates temporal-sensitive tasks into existing instruction datasets without requiring additional annotations. Furthermore, we develop a novel benchmark for temporal-sensitive video understanding that not only fills the gaps in dimension coverage left by existing benchmarks but also rigorously filters out potential shortcuts, ensuring a more accurate evaluation. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances the temporal understanding of video-LLMs while avoiding reliance on shortcuts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Temporal Difference Flows](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09817v1)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predictive models of the future are fundamental for an agent's ability to reason and plan. A common strategy learns a world model and unrolls it step-by-step at inference, where small errors can rapidly compound. Geometric Horizon Models (GHMs) offer a compelling alternative by directly making predictions of future states, avoiding cumulative inference errors. While GHMs can be conveniently learned by a generative analog to temporal difference (TD) learning, existing methods are negatively affected by bootstrapping predictions at train time and struggle to generate high-quality predictions at long horizons. This paper introduces Temporal Difference Flows (TD-Flow), which leverages the structure of a novel Bellman equation on probability paths alongside flow-matching techniques to learn accurate GHMs at over 5x the horizon length of prior methods. Theoretically, we establish a new convergence result and primarily attribute TD-Flow's efficacy to reduced gradient variance during training. We further show that similar arguments can be extended to diffusion-based methods. Empirically, we validate TD-Flow across a diverse set of domains on both generative metrics and downstream tasks including policy evaluation. Moreover, integrating TD-Flow with recent behavior foundation models for planning over pre-trained policies demonstrates substantial performance gains, underscoring its promise for long-horizon decision-making.</p></details> |  |
| **[Complexity of Safety and coSafety Fragments of Linear Temporal Logic](http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.14913v2)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) is the de-facto standard temporal logic for system specification, whose foundational properties have been studied for over five decades. Safety and cosafety properties define notable fragments of LTL, where a prefix of a trace suffices to establish whether a formula is true or not over that trace. In this paper, we study the complexity of the problems of satisfiability, validity, and realizability over infinite and finite traces for the safety and cosafety fragments of LTL. As for satisfiability and validity over infinite traces, we prove that the majority of the fragments have the same complexity as full LTL, that is, they are PSPACE-complete. The picture is radically different for realizability: we find fragments with the same expressive power whose complexity varies from 2EXPTIME-complete (as full LTL) to EXPTIME-complete. Notably, for all cosafety fragments, the complexity of the three problems does not change passing from infinite to finite traces, while for all safety fragments the complexity of satisfiability (resp., realizability) over finite traces drops to NP-complete (resp., ${\Pi}^P_2$-complete).</p></details> |  |

Currently, in the field of pig behavior recognition, the lack of publicly available behavioral datasets not only limits the development of innovative algorithms but also hampers model robustness and algorithm optimization.This paper proposes a dataset containing 13 pig behaviors that significantly impact welfare.Based on this dataset, this paper proposes a spatial-temporal perception and enhancement networks based on the attention mechanism to model the spatiotemporal features of pig behaviors and their associated interaction areas in video data. The network is composed of a spatiotemporal perception network and a spatiotemporal feature enhancement network. The spatiotemporal perception network is responsible for establishing connections between the pigs and the key regions of their behaviors in the video data. The spatiotemporal feature enhancement network further strengthens the important spatial features of individual pigs and captures the long-term dependencies of the spatiotemporal features of individual behaviors by remodeling these connections, thereby enhancing the model's perception of spatiotemporal changes in pig behaviors. Experimental results demonstrate that on the dataset established in this paper, our proposed model achieves a MAP score of 75.92%, which is an 8.17% improvement over the best-performing traditional model. This study not only improces the accuracy and generalizability of individual pig behavior recognition but also provides new technological tools for modern smart farming. The dataset and related code will be made publicly available alongside this paper.</p></details> |  |

Recent studies have revealed that Large Language Models (LLMs), with their powerful in-contextual modeling capabilities, hold significant potential for TSF. However, existing LLM-based methods usually perform suboptimally because they neglect the inherent characteristics of time series data. Unlike the textual data used in LLM pre-training, the time series data is semantically sparse and comprises distinctive temporal patterns. To address this problem, we propose LLM-PS to empower the LLM for TSF by learning the fundamental \textit{Patterns} and meaningful \textit{Semantics} from time series data. Our LLM-PS incorporates a new multi-scale convolutional neural network adept at capturing both short-term fluctuations and long-term trends within the time series. Meanwhile, we introduce a time-to-text module for extracting valuable semantics across continuous time intervals rather than isolated time points. By integrating these patterns and semantics, LLM-PS effectively models temporal dependencies, enabling a deep comprehension of time series and delivering accurate forecasts. Intensive experimental results demonstrate that LLM-PS achieves state-of-the-art performance in both short- and long-term forecasting tasks, as well as in few- and zero-shot settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[TempMe: Video Temporal Token Merging for Efficient Text-Video Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01156v2)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most text-video retrieval methods utilize the text-image pre-trained models like CLIP as a backbone. These methods process each sampled frame independently by the image encoder, resulting in high computational overhead and limiting practical deployment. Addressing this, we focus on efficient text-video retrieval by tackling two key challenges: 1. From the perspective of trainable parameters, current parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods incur high inference costs; 2. From the perspective of model complexity, current token compression methods are mainly designed for images to reduce spatial redundancy but overlook temporal redundancy in consecutive frames of a video. To tackle these challenges, we propose Temporal Token Merging (TempMe), a parameter-efficient and training-inference efficient text-video retrieval architecture that minimizes trainable parameters and model complexity. Specifically, we introduce a progressive multi-granularity framework. By gradually combining neighboring clips, we reduce spatio-temporal redundancy and enhance temporal modeling across different frames, leading to improved efficiency and performance. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of our TempMe. Compared to previous parameter-efficient text-video retrieval methods, TempMe achieves superior performance with just 0.50M trainable parameters. It significantly reduces output tokens by 95% and GFLOPs by 51%, while achieving a 1.8X speedup and a 4.4% R-Sum improvement. With full fine-tuning, TempMe achieves a significant 7.9% R-Sum improvement, trains 1.57X faster, and utilizes 75.2% GPU memory usage.

Utilizing existing observations, spatio-temporal kriging is a method for estimating air quality at unobserved locations during a specific period. Inductive spatio-temporal kriging with increment training strategy has demonstrated its effectiveness using virtual nodes to simulate unobserved nodes. However, a disparity between virtual and real nodes persists, complicating the application of learning patterns derived from virtual nodes to actual unobserved ones. To address these limitations, this paper presents a Physics-Guided Increment Training Strategy (PGITS). Specifically, we design a dynamic graph generation module to incorporate the advection and diffusion processes of airborne particles as physical knowledge into the graph structure, dynamically adjusting the adjacency matrix to reflect physical interactions between nodes. By using physics principles as a bridge between virtual and real nodes, this strategy ensures the features of virtual nodes and their pseudo labels are closer to actual nodes. Consequently, the learned patterns of virtual nodes can be applied to actual unobserved nodes for effective kriging.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods struggle with retrieving cross-modal information from long videos, especially when relevant details are sparsely distributed. We introduce UMaT (Unified Multi-modal as Text), a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework that efficiently processes extremely long videos while maintaining cross-modal coherence. UMaT converts visual and auditory data into a unified textual representation, ensuring semantic and temporal alignment. Short video clips are analyzed using a vision-language model, while automatic speech recognition (ASR) transcribes dialogue. These text-based representations are structured into temporally aligned segments, with adaptive filtering to remove redundancy and retain salient details. The processed data is embedded into a vector database, enabling precise retrieval of dispersed yet relevant content. Experiments on a benchmark LVQA dataset show that UMaT outperforms existing methods in multimodal integration, long-form video understanding, and sparse information retrieval. Its scalability and interpretability allow it to process videos over an hour long while maintaining semantic and temporal coherence. These findings underscore the importance of structured retrieval and multimodal synchronization for advancing LVQA and long-form AI systems.</p></details> |  |

Recent methods predominantly adapt Video LLMs to generate event boundary timestamps to handle temporal localization tasks, which struggle to leverage LLMs' powerful semantic understanding. In this work, we introduce MeCo, a novel timestamp-free framework that enables video LLMs to fully harness their intrinsic semantic capabilities for temporal localization tasks. Rather than outputting boundary timestamps, MeCo partitions videos into holistic event and transition segments based on the proposed structural token generation and grounding pipeline, derived from video LLMs' temporal structure understanding capability. We further propose a query-focused captioning task that compels the LLM to extract fine-grained, event-specific details, bridging the gap between localization and higher-level semantics and enhancing localization performance. Extensive experiments on diverse temporal localization tasks show that MeCo consistently outperforms boundary-centric methods, underscoring the benefits of a semantic-driven approach for temporal localization with video LLMs.</p></details> |  |

While Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) on neuromorphic hardware are often considered for energy-efficient and low latency event-based data processing, they often fall short of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) in accuracy and flexibility. Here, we introduce Attention-based Hybrid SNN-ANN backbones for event-based object detection to leverage the strengths of both SNN and ANN architectures. A novel Attention-based SNN-ANN bridge module captures sparse spatial and temporal relations from the SNN layer and converts them into dense feature maps for the ANN part of the backbone. Additionally, we present a variant that integrates DWConvL-STMs to the ANN blocks to capture slower dynamics. This multi-timescale network combines fast SNN processing for short timesteps with long-term dense RNN processing, effectively capturing both fast and slow dynamics. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method surpasses SNN-based approaches by significant margins, with results comparable to existing ANN and RNN-based methods. Unlike ANN-only networks, the hybrid setup allows us to implement the SNN blocks on digital neuromorphic hardware to investigate the feasibility of our approach. Extensive ablation studies and implementation on neuromorphic hardware confirm the effectiveness of our proposed modules and architectural choices. Our hybrid SNN-ANN architectures pave the way for ANN-like performance at a drastically reduced parameter, latency, and power budget.</p></details> |  |
| **[ReTaKe: Reducing Temporal and Knowledge Redundancy for Long Video Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20504v3)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in video understanding. However, existing VideoLLMs often inherit the limitations of their backbone LLMs in handling long sequences, leading to challenges for long video understanding. Common solutions either simply uniformly sample videos' frames or compress visual tokens, which focus primarily on low-level temporal visual redundancy, overlooking high-level knowledge redundancy. This limits the achievable compression rate with minimal loss. To this end. we introduce a training-free method, $\textbf{ReTaKe}$, containing two novel modules DPSelect and PivotKV, to jointly model and reduce both temporal visual redundancy and knowledge redundancy for long video understanding. Specifically, DPSelect identifies keyframes with local maximum peak distance based on their visual features, which are closely aligned with human video perception. PivotKV employs the obtained keyframes as pivots and conducts KV-Cache compression for the non-pivot tokens with low attention scores, which are derived from the learned prior knowledge of LLMs. Experiments on benchmarks VideoMME, MLVU, and LVBench, show that ReTaKe can support 4x longer video sequences with minimal performance loss (<1%) and outperform all similar-size VideoLLMs with 3%-5%, even surpassing or on par with much larger ones.

| **[TT-GaussOcc: Test-Time Compute for Self-Supervised Occupancy Prediction via Spatio-Temporal Gaussian Splatting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08485v1)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-supervised 3D occupancy prediction offers a promising solution for understanding complex driving scenes without requiring costly 3D annotations. However, training dense voxel decoders to capture fine-grained geometry and semantics can demand hundreds of GPU hours, and such models often fail to adapt to varying voxel resolutions or new classes without extensive retraining. To overcome these limitations, we propose a practical and flexible test-time occupancy prediction framework termed TT-GaussOcc. Our approach incrementally optimizes time-aware 3D Gaussians instantiated from raw sensor streams at runtime, enabling voxelization at arbitrary user-specified resolution. Specifically, TT-GaussOcc operates in a "lift-move-voxel" symphony: we first "lift" surrounding-view semantics obtained from 2D vision foundation models (VLMs) to instantiate Gaussians at non-empty 3D space; Next, we "move" dynamic Gaussians from previous frames along estimated Gaussian scene flow to complete appearance and eliminate trailing artifacts of fast-moving objects, while accumulating static Gaussians to enforce temporal consistency; Finally, we mitigate inherent noises in semantic predictions and scene flow vectors by periodically smoothing neighboring Gaussians during optimization, using proposed trilateral RBF kernels that jointly consider color, semantic, and spatial affinities. The historical static and current dynamic Gaussians are then combined and voxelized to generate occupancy prediction. Extensive experiments on Occ3D and nuCraft with varying voxel resolutions demonstrate that TT-GaussOcc surpasses self-supervised baselines by 46% on mIoU without any offline training, and supports finer voxel resolutions at 2.6 FPS inference speed.</p></details> |  |

Such data occurs widely, ranging from the scientific and medical domains to the industrial and environmental domains. When the properties in time series exhibit spatial variations, we often call the data spatio-temporal. As part of the continued digitalization of processes throughout society, increasingly large volumes of time series and spatio-temporal data are available. In this tutorial, we focus on data-driven decision making with such data, e.g., enabling greener and more efficient transportation based on traffic time series forecasting. The tutorial adopts the holistic paradigm of "data-governance-analytics-decision." We first introduce the data foundation of time series and spatio-temporal data, which is often heterogeneous. Next, we discuss data governance methods that aim to improve data quality. We then cover data analytics, focusing on five desired characteristics: automation, robustness, generality, explainability, and resource efficiency. We finally cover data-driven decision making strategies and briefly discuss promising research directions. We hope that the tutorial will serve as a primary resource for researchers and practitioners who are interested in value creation from time series and spatio-temporal data.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted by ICDE 2025</p></details> |
| **[Comorbidity Patterns and Temporal Associations of Multiple Long-Term Conditions in Adults with Intellectual Disability: an observational study in the United Kingdom](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08378v1)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Objectives: To examine the distribution, temporal associations, and age/sex-specific patterns of multiple long-term conditions (MLTCs) in adults with intellectual disability (ID). Study Design: Observational study using longitudinal healthcare data. Methods: Analysis of 18144 adults with ID (10168 males and 7976 females) identified in the Clinical Practice Research Datalink, linked to Hospital Episode Statistics Admitted Patient Care and Outpatient data (2000-2021). We used temporal analysis to establish directional associations among 40 long-term conditions, stratified by sex and age groups (under 45, 45-64, 65 and over). Results: The high prevalence of enduring mental illness across all age groups is an important finding unique to this population. In males, mental illness occurred along with upper gastrointestinal conditions (specifically reflux disorders), while in females, mental illness presented alongside reflux disorders, chronic pain, and endocrine conditions such as thyroid problems. Among young males with intellectual disability, the combination of cerebral palsy with dysphagia, epilepsy, chronic constipation, and chronic pneumonia represents a distinctive pattern. In those aged 45-64, we observed early onset of lifestyle conditions like diabetes and hypertension, though notably these conditions co-occurred with mental illness and anaemia at rates exceeding those in the general population. The health conditions in those aged 65 and over largely mirrored those seen in the general aging population. Conclusions: Our findings highlight the complex patterns of MLTCs in this population, revealing sex-specific associations across age groups, and identified temporal associations, thus providing insights into disease progression, which can inform targeted prevention strategies and interventions to prevent premature mortality.</p></details> |  |

Despite notable progress in single-image virtual try-on (VTO), current methodologies often struggle to preserve a consistent and authentic appearance of clothing across extended video sequences. This challenge arises from the complexities of capturing dynamic human pose and maintaining target clothing characteristics. We leverage pre-existing video foundation models to introduce RealVVT, a photoRealistic Video Virtual Try-on framework tailored to bolster stability and realism within dynamic video contexts. Our methodology encompasses a Clothing & Temporal Consistency strategy, an Agnostic-guided Attention Focus Loss mechanism to ensure spatial consistency, and a Pose-guided Long Video VTO technique adept at handling extended video sequences.Extensive experiments across various datasets confirms that our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art models in both single-image and video VTO tasks, offering a viable solution for practical applications within the realms of fashion e-commerce and virtual fitting environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages (8 pages main text, 2 pages references), 5 figures in the main text, and 4 pages supplementary materials with 3 additional figures</p></details> |
| **[Efficient Traffic Prediction Through Spatio-Temporal Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10459v2)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) have gained considerable attention in recent years for traffic flow prediction due to their ability to learn spatio-temporal pattern representations through a graph-based message-passing framework. Although GNNs have shown great promise in handling traffic datasets, their deployment in real-life applications has been hindered by scalability constraints arising from high-order message passing. Additionally, the over-smoothing problem of GNNs may lead to indistinguishable region representations as the number of layers increases, resulting in performance degradation. To address these challenges, we propose a new knowledge distillation paradigm termed LightST that transfers spatial and temporal knowledge from a high-capacity teacher to a lightweight student. Specifically, we introduce a spatio-temporal knowledge distillation framework that helps student MLPs capture graph-structured global spatio-temporal patterns while alleviating the over-smoothing effect with adaptive knowledge distillation. Extensive experiments verify that LightST significantly speeds up traffic flow predictions by 5X to 40X compared to state-of-the-art spatio-temporal GNNs, all while maintaining superior accuracy.</p></details> | 9 pages |
| **[STGDPM:Vessel Trajectory Prediction with Spatio-Temporal Graph Diffusion Probabilistic Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08065v1)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vessel trajectory prediction is a critical component for ensuring maritime traffic safety and avoiding collisions. Due to the inherent uncertainty in vessel behavior, trajectory prediction systems must adopt a multimodal approach to accurately model potential future motion states. However, existing vessel trajectory prediction methods lack the ability to comprehensively model behavioral multi-modality. To better capture multimodal behavior in interactive scenarios, we propose modeling interactions as dynamic graphs, replacing traditional aggregation-based techniques that rely on vessel states. By leveraging the natural multimodal capabilities of diffusion models, we frame the trajectory prediction task as an inverse process of motion uncertainty diffusion, wherein uncertainties across potential navigational areas are progressively eliminated until the desired trajectories is produced. In summary, we pioneer the integration of Spatio-Temporal Graph (STG) with diffusion models in ship trajectory prediction. Extensive experiments on real Automatic Identification System (AIS) data validate the superiority of our approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been ACCEPTED as a FULL PAPER at DASFAA 2025</p></details> |
| **[A Transfer Framework for Enhancing Temporal Graph Learning in Data-Scarce Settings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00852v2)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dynamic interactions between entities are prevalent in domains like social platforms, financial systems, healthcare, and e-commerce. These interactions can be effectively represented as time-evolving graphs, where predicting future connections is a key task in applications such as recommendation systems. Temporal Graph Neural Networks (TGNNs) have achieved strong results for such predictive tasks but typically require extensive training data, which is often limited in real-world scenarios. One approach to mitigating data scarcity is leveraging pre-trained models from related datasets. However, direct knowledge transfer between TGNNs is challenging due to their reliance on node-specific memory structures, making them inherently difficult to adapt across datasets. To address this, we introduce a novel transfer approach that disentangles node representations from their associated features through a structured bipartite encoding mechanism. This decoupling enables more effective transfer of memory components and other learned inductive patterns from one dataset to another. Empirical evaluations on real-world benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly enhances TGNN performance in low-data regimes, outperforming non-transfer baselines by up to 56\% and surpassing existing transfer strategies by 36\%</p></details> |  |

Unlike previous approaches that process flattened local visual patches via direct discretization or adaptive query tokenization, SweetTok proposes a decoupling framework, compressing visual inputs through distinct spatial and temporal queries via \textbf{D}ecoupled \textbf{Q}uery \textbf{A}uto\textbf{E}ncoder (DQAE). This design allows SweetTok to efficiently compress video token count while achieving superior fidelity by capturing essential information across spatial and temporal dimensions. Furthermore, we design a \textbf{M}otion-enhanced \textbf{L}anguage \textbf{C}odebook (MLC) tailored for spatial and temporal compression to address the differences in semantic representation between appearance and motion information. SweetTok significantly improves video reconstruction results by \textbf{42.8\%} w.r.t rFVD on UCF-101 dataset. With a better token compression strategy, it also boosts downstream video generation results by \textbf{15.1\%} w.r.t gFVD. Additionally, the compressed decoupled tokens are imbued with semantic information, enabling few-shot recognition capabilities powered by LLMs in downstream applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[STEAD: Spatio-Temporal Efficient Anomaly Detection for Time and Compute Sensitive Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07942v1)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a new method for anomaly detection in automated systems with time and compute sensitive requirements, such as autonomous driving, with unparalleled efficiency. As systems like autonomous driving become increasingly popular, ensuring their safety has become more important than ever. Therefore, this paper focuses on how to quickly and effectively detect various anomalies in the aforementioned systems, with the goal of making them safer and more effective. Many detection systems have been developed with great success under spatial contexts; however, there is still significant room for improvement when it comes to temporal context. While there is substantial work regarding this task, there is minimal work done regarding the efficiency of models and their ability to be applied to scenarios that require real-time inference, i.e., autonomous driving where anomalies need to be detected the moment they are within view. To address this gap, we propose STEAD (Spatio-Temporal Efficient Anomaly Detection), whose backbone is developed using (2+1)D Convolutions and Performer Linear Attention, which ensures computational efficiency without sacrificing performance. When tested on the UCF-Crime benchmark, our base model achieves an AUC of 91.34%, outperforming the previous state-of-the-art, and our fast version achieves an AUC of 88.87%, while having 99.70% less parameters and outperforming the previous state-of-the-art as well.

We develop a modular approach, where a large language model (LLM) translates the natural language instructions into a linear temporal logic (LTL) formula with propositions defined by object classes in a semantic occupancy map. The LTL formula and the semantic occupancy map are provided to a motion planning algorithm to generate a collision-free robot path that satisfies the natural language instructions. Our main contribution is LTLCodeGen, a method to translate natural language to syntactically correct LTL using code generation. We demonstrate the complete task planning method in real-world experiments involving human speech to provide navigation instructions to a mobile robot. We also thoroughly evaluate our approach in simulated and real-world experiments in comparison to end-to-end LLM task planning and state-of-the-art LLM-to-LTL translation methods.</p></details> |  |

The key to our framework is a Fusion Block that facilitates bidirectional information exchange between video and audio diffusion models through temporally-aligned self attention operations. Unlike prior work that uses dedicated models for A2V and V2A tasks and relies on pretrained feature extractors, AV-Link achieves both tasks in a single self-contained framework, directly leveraging features obtained by the complementary modality (i.e. video features to generate audio, or audio features to generate video). Extensive automatic and subjective evaluations demonstrate that our method achieves a substantial improvement in audio-video synchronization, outperforming more expensive baselines such as the MovieGen video-to-audio model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: snap-research.github.io/AVLink/</p></details> |

However, existing methods often suffer from temporal inconsistencies, manifesting as flickering effects that compromise visual experience and adversely affect decision-making. While recent approaches have incorporated historical data to mitigate the issue, they often incur high computational costs and introduce noisy information that interferes with object detection. We propose OccLinker, a novel plugin framework designed to seamlessly integrate with existing VONs for boosting performance. Our method employs a three-stage architecture that consolidates historical static and motion cues, correlates them with current features through a Motion-Static Integration (MSI) mechanism, and generates correction occupancy to refine base network predictions. Extensive experiments on two benchmarks demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our method, outperforming the latest baseline models.

| **[Temporal Triplane Transformers as Occupancy World Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07338v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent years have seen significant advances in world models, which primarily focus on learning fine-grained correlations between an agent's motion trajectory and the resulting changes in its surrounding environment. However, existing methods often struggle to capture such fine-grained correlations and achieve real-time predictions. To address this, we propose a new 4D occupancy world model for autonomous driving, termed T$^3$Former. T$^3$Former begins by pre-training a compact triplane representation that efficiently compresses the 3D semantically occupied environment. Next, T$^3$Former extracts multi-scale temporal motion features from the historical triplane and employs an autoregressive approach to iteratively predict the next triplane changes. Finally, T$^3$Former combines the triplane changes with the previous ones to decode them into future occupancy results and ego-motion trajectories. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of T$^3$Former, achieving 1.44$\times$ faster inference speed (26 FPS), while improving the mean IoU to 36.09 and reducing the mean absolute planning error to 1.0 meters.</p></details> |  |

Deep Learning (DL), particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs), have revolutionized this field by enhancing the accuracy of classification tasks. In this work, a novel approach combining a transformer-based Swin-Unet architecture with seasonal synthesized spatio-temporal images has been employed to classify LC types using spatio-temporal features extracted from Sentinel-1 (S1) Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data, organized into seasonal clusters. The study focuses on three distinct regions - Amazonia, Africa, and Siberia - and evaluates the model performance across diverse ecoregions within these areas. By utilizing seasonal feature sequences instead of dense temporal sequences, notable performance improvements have been achieved, especially in regions with temporal data gaps like Siberia, where S1 data distribution is uneven and non-uniform. The results demonstrate the effectiveness and the generalization capabilities of the proposed methodology in achieving high overall accuracy (O.A.) values, even in regions with limited training data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing</p></details> |
| **[Temporal Overlapping Prediction: A Self-supervised Pre-training Method for LiDAR Moving Object Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07167v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Moving object segmentation (MOS) on LiDAR point clouds is crucial for autonomous systems like self-driving vehicles. Previous supervised approaches rely heavily on costly manual annotations, while LiDAR sequences naturally capture temporal motion cues that can be leveraged for self-supervised learning. In this paper, we propose \textbf{T}emporal \textbf{O}verlapping \textbf{P}rediction (\textbf{TOP}), a self-supervised pre-training method that alleviate the labeling burden for MOS. \textbf{TOP} explores the temporal overlapping points that commonly observed by current and adjacent scans, and learns spatiotemporal representations by predicting the occupancy states of temporal overlapping points. Moreover, we utilize current occupancy reconstruction as an auxiliary pre-training objective, which enhances the current structural awareness of the model. We conduct extensive experiments and observe that the conventional metric Intersection-over-Union (IoU) shows strong bias to objects with more scanned points, which might neglect small or distant objects. To compensate for this bias, we introduce an additional metric called $\text{mIoU}_{\text{obj}}$ to evaluate object-level performance. Experiments on nuScenes and SemanticKITTI show that \textbf{TOP} outperforms both supervised training-from-scratch baseline and other self-supervised pre-training baselines by up to 28.77\% relative improvement, demonstrating strong transferability across LiDAR setups and generalization to other tasks. Code and pre-trained models will be publicly available upon publication.</p></details> |  |

To bridge this gap, we introduce TIDE (Temporal-aware Sparse Autoencoders for Interpretable Diffusion transformErs), a novel framework that enhances temporal reconstruction within DiT activation layers across denoising steps. TIDE employs Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) with a sparse bottleneck layer to extract interpretable and hierarchical features, revealing that diffusion models inherently learn hierarchical features at multiple levels (e.g., 3D, semantic, class) during generative pre-training. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction performance, with a mean squared error (MSE) of 1e-3 and a cosine similarity of 0.97, demonstrating superior accuracy in capturing activation dynamics along the denoising trajectory. Beyond interpretability, we showcase TIDE's potential in downstream applications such as sparse activation-guided image editing and style transfer, enabling improved controllability for generative systems. By providing a comprehensive training and evaluation protocol tailored for DiTs, TIDE contributes to developing more interpretable, transparent, and trustworthy generative models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Temporal Reversal Regularization for Spiking Neural Networks: Hybrid Spatio-Temporal Invariance for Generalization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09108v3)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have received widespread attention as an ultra-low power computing paradigm. Recent studies have shown that SNNs suffer from severe overfitting, which limits their generalization performance. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective Temporal Reversal Regularization (TRR) to mitigate overfitting during training and facilitate generalization of SNNs. We exploit the inherent temporal properties of SNNs to perform input/feature temporal reversal perturbations, prompting the SNN to produce original-reversed consistent outputs and learn perturbation-invariant representations. To further enhance generalization, we utilize the lightweight ``star operation" (Hadamard product) for feature hybridization of original and temporally reversed spike firing rates, which expands the implicit dimensionality and acts as a spatio-temporal regularizer. We show theoretically that our method is able to tighten the upper bound of the generalization error, and extensive experiments on static/neuromorphic recognition as well as 3D point cloud classification tasks demonstrate its effectiveness, versatility, and adversarial robustness. In particular, our regularization significantly improves the recognition accuracy of low-latency SNN for neuromorphic objects, contributing to the real-world deployment of neuromorphic computational software-hardware integration.</p></details> | 17 pages, 9 figures |

However, prior attempts to define such temporal distances in stochastic settings have been stymied by an important limitation: these prior approaches do not satisfy the triangle inequality. This is not merely a definitional concern, but translates to an inability to generalize and find shortest paths. In this paper, we build on prior work in contrastive learning and quasimetrics to show how successor features learned by contrastive learning (after a change of variables) form a temporal distance that does satisfy the triangle inequality, even in stochastic settings. Importantly, this temporal distance is computationally efficient to estimate, even in high-dimensional and stochastic settings. Experiments in controlled settings and benchmark suites demonstrate that an RL algorithm based on these new temporal distances exhibits combinatorial generalization (i.e., "stitching") and can sometimes learn more quickly than prior methods, including those based on quasimetrics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proce...</summary><p>Proceedings of the 41st International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2024)</p></details> |

However, the spatial and temporal misalignment between foot-end motion derived from forward kinematics and foot IMU measurements can introduce inconsistent constraints, resulting in odometry drift. Therefore, accurate spatial-temporal calibration is crucial for the multi-IMU systems. Although existing multi-IMU calibration methods have addressed passive single-rigid-body sensor calibration, they are inadequate for legged systems. This is due to the insufficient excitation from traditional gaits for calibration, and enlarged sensitivity to IMU noise during kinematic chain transformations. To address these challenges, we propose A$^2$I-Calib, an anti-noise active multi-IMU calibration framework enabling autonomous spatial-temporal calibration for arbitrary foot-mounted IMUs. Our A$^2$I-Calib includes: 1) an anti-noise trajectory generator leveraging a proposed basis function selection theorem to minimize the condition number in correlation analysis, thus reducing noise sensitivity, and 2) a reinforcement learning (RL)-based controller that ensures robust execution of calibration motions. Furthermore, A$^2$I-Calib is validated on simulation and real-world quadruped robot platforms with various multi-IMU settings, which demonstrates a significant reduction in noise sensitivity and calibration errors, thereby improving the overall multi-IMU odometry performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Analyzing the temporal dynamics of linguistic features contained in misinformation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04786v2)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Consumption of misinformation can lead to negative consequences that impact the individual and society. To help mitigate the influence of misinformation on human beliefs, algorithmic labels providing context about content accuracy and source reliability have been developed. Since the linguistic features used by algorithms to estimate information accuracy can change across time, it is important to understand their temporal dynamics. As a result, this study uses natural language processing to analyze PolitiFact statements spanning between 2010 and 2024 to quantify how the sources and linguistic features of misinformation change between five-year time periods. The results show that statement sentiment has decreased significantly over time, reflecting a generally more negative tone in PolitiFact statements. Moreover, statements associated with misinformation realize significantly lower sentiment than accurate information. Additional analysis shows that recent time periods are dominated by sources from online social networks and other digital forums, such as blogs and viral images, that contain high levels of misinformation containing negative sentiment. In contrast, most statements during early time periods are attributed to individual sources (i.e., politicians) that are relatively balanced in accuracy ratings and contain statements with neutral or positive sentiment. Named-entity recognition was used to identify that presidential incumbents and candidates are relatively more prevalent in statements containing misinformation, while US states tend to be present in accurate information. Finally, entity labels associated with people and organizations are more common in misinformation, while accurate statements are more likely to contain numeric entity labels, such as percentages and dates.</p></details> |  |
| **[Temporal Feature Matters: A Framework for Diffusion Model Quantization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19547v3)** | 2025-03-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Diffusion models, widely used for image generation, face significant challenges related to their broad applicability due to prolonged inference times and high memory demands. Efficient Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) is crucial to address these issues. However, unlike traditional models, diffusion models critically rely on the time-step for the multi-round denoising. Typically, each time-step is encoded into a hypersensitive temporal feature by several modules. Despite this, existing PTQ methods do not optimize these modules individually. Instead, they employ unsuitable reconstruction objectives and complex calibration methods, leading to significant disturbances in the temporal feature and denoising trajectory, as well as reduced compression efficiency. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel quantization framework that includes three strategies: 1) TIB-based Maintenance: Based on our innovative Temporal Information Block (TIB) definition, Temporal Information-aware Reconstruction (TIAR) and Finite Set Calibration (FSC) are developed to efficiently align original temporal features. 2) Cache-based Maintenance: Instead of indirect and complex optimization for the related modules, pre-computing and caching quantized counterparts of temporal features are developed to minimize errors. 3) Disturbance-aware Selection: Employ temporal feature errors to guide a fine-grained selection between the two maintenance strategies for further disturbance reduction. This framework preserves most of the temporal information and ensures high-quality end-to-end generation.

Although many previous studies have highlighted the critical role of temporal features, such as inter-packet arrival time and flow length/duration, in NIDS, the currently available NetFlow datasets for NIDS lack these temporal features. This study addresses this gap by creating and making publicly available a set of NetFlow datasets that incorporate these temporal features [1]. With these temporal features, we provide a comprehensive temporal analysis of NetFlow datasets by examining the distribution of various features over time and presenting time-series representations of NetFlow features. This temporal analysis has not been previously provided in the existing literature. We also borrowed an idea from signal processing, time frequency analysis, and tested it to see how different the time frequency signal presentations (TFSPs) are for various attacks. The results indicate that many attacks have unique patterns, which could help ML models to identify them more easily.</p></details> |  |
| **[Video LLMs for Temporal Reasoning in Long Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02930v2)** | 2025-03-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces TemporalVLM, a video large language model (video LLM) capable of effective temporal reasoning and fine-grained understanding in long videos. At the core, our approach includes a visual encoder for mapping a long-term input video into features which are time-aware and contain both local and global cues. In particular, it first divides the input video into short-term clips, which are jointly encoded with their timestamps into time-sensitive local features. Next, the local features are passed through a bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) module for global feature aggregation. The extracted time-aware and multi-level features are important for accurate temporal reasoning and fine-grained understanding in long videos. Moreover, to facilitate the evaluation of TemporalVLM, we present a large-scale long video dataset of industry assembly processes, namely IndustryASM, which consists of videos recorded on factory floors with actions and timestamps annotated by industrial engineers for time and motion studies and temporal action segmentation evaluation. Finally, extensive experiments on datasets of long videos, including TimeIT and IndustryASM, show that TemporalVLM achieves superior performance than previous methods across temporal reasoning and fine-grained understanding tasks, namely dense video captioning, temporal video grounding, video highlight detection, and temporal action segmentation. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to incorporate LSTMs into video LLMs.</p></details> |  |

Existing interpretation methods are limited by focusing mostly on classification tasks, evaluating using custom baseline models instead of the latest time series models, using simple synthetic datasets, and requiring training another model. We introduce a novel interpretation method, \textit{Windowed Temporal Saliency Rescaling (WinTSR)} addressing these limitations. WinTSR explicitly captures temporal dependencies among the past time steps and efficiently scales the feature importance with this time importance. We benchmark WinTSR against 10 recent interpretation techniques with 5 state-of-the-art deep-learning models of different architectures, including a time series foundation model. We use 3 real-world datasets for both time-series classification and regression. Our comprehensive analysis shows that WinTSR significantly outperforms other local interpretation methods in overall performance. Finally, we provide a novel, open-source framework to interpret the latest time series transformers and foundation models.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 14 figures, GitHub https://github.com/khairulislam/Timeseries-Explained</p></details> |

| **[Leveraging Consistent Spatio-Temporal Correspondence for Robust Visual Odometry](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16923v4)** | 2025-03-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent approaches to VO have significantly improved performance by using deep networks to predict optical flow between video frames. However, existing methods still suffer from noisy and inconsistent flow matching, making it difficult to handle challenging scenarios and long-sequence estimation. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Spatio-Temporal Visual Odometry (STVO), a novel deep network architecture that effectively leverages inherent spatio-temporal cues to enhance the accuracy and consistency of multi-frame flow matching. With more accurate and consistent flow matching, STVO can achieve better pose estimation through the bundle adjustment (BA). Specifically, STVO introduces two innovative components: 1) the Temporal Propagation Module that utilizes multi-frame information to extract and propagate temporal cues across adjacent frames, maintaining temporal consistency; 2) the Spatial Activation Module that utilizes geometric priors from the depth maps to enhance spatial consistency while filtering out excessive noise and incorrect matches. Our STVO achieves state-of-the-art performance on TUM-RGBD, EuRoc MAV, ETH3D and KITTI Odometry benchmarks. Notably, it improves accuracy by 77.8% on ETH3D benchmark and 38.9% on KITTI Odometry benchmark over the previous best methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[DropletVideo: A Dataset and Approach to Explore Integral Spatio-Temporal Consistent Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06053v1)** | 2025-03-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal consistency is a critical research topic in video generation. A qualified generated video segment must ensure plot plausibility and coherence while maintaining visual consistency of objects and scenes across varying viewpoints. Prior research, especially in open-source projects, primarily focuses on either temporal or spatial consistency, or their basic combination, such as appending a description of a camera movement after a prompt without constraining the outcomes of this movement. However, camera movement may introduce new objects to the scene or eliminate existing ones, thereby overlaying and affecting the preceding narrative. Especially in videos with numerous camera movements, the interplay between multiple plots becomes increasingly complex. This paper introduces and examines integral spatio-temporal consistency, considering the synergy between plot progression and camera techniques, and the long-term impact of prior content on subsequent generation. Our research encompasses dataset construction through to the development of the model. Initially, we constructed a DropletVideo-10M dataset, which comprises 10 million videos featuring dynamic camera motion and object actions. Each video is annotated with an average caption of 206 words, detailing various camera movements and plot developments. Following this, we developed and trained the DropletVideo model, which excels in preserving spatio-temporal coherence during video generation. The DropletVideo dataset and model are accessible at https://dropletx.github.io.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mind the Time: Temporally-Controlled Multi-Event Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05263v2)** | 2025-03-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world videos consist of sequences of events. Generating such sequences with precise temporal control is infeasible with existing video generators that rely on a single paragraph of text as input. When tasked with generating multiple events described using a single prompt, such methods often ignore some of the events or fail to arrange them in the correct order. To address this limitation, we present MinT, a multi-event video generator with temporal control. Our key insight is to bind each event to a specific period in the generated video, which allows the model to focus on one event at a time. To enable time-aware interactions between event captions and video tokens, we design a time-based positional encoding method, dubbed ReRoPE. This encoding helps to guide the cross-attention operation. By fine-tuning a pre-trained video diffusion transformer on temporally grounded data, our approach produces coherent videos with smoothly connected events. For the first time in the literature, our model offers control over the timing of events in generated videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MinT outperforms existing commercial and open-source models by a large margin.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025.

| **[GestureLSM: Latent Shortcut based Co-Speech Gesture Generation with Spatial-Temporal Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18898v2)** | 2025-03-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating full-body human gestures based on speech signals remains challenges on quality and speed. Existing approaches model different body regions such as body, legs and hands separately, which fail to capture the spatial interactions between them and result in unnatural and disjointed movements. Additionally, their autoregressive/diffusion-based pipelines show slow generation speed due to dozens of inference steps. To address these two challenges, we propose GestureLSM, a flow-matching-based approach for Co-Speech Gesture Generation with spatial-temporal modeling. Our method i) explicitly model the interaction of tokenized body regions through spatial and temporal attention, for generating coherent full-body gestures. ii) introduce the flow matching to enable more efficient sampling by explicitly modeling the latent velocity space. To overcome the suboptimal performance of flow matching baseline, we propose latent shortcut learning and beta distribution time stamp sampling during training to enhance gesture synthesis quality and accelerate inference. Combining the spatial-temporal modeling and improved flow matching-based framework, GestureLSM achieves state-of-the-art performance on BEAT2 while significantly reducing inference time compared to existing methods, highlighting its potential for enhancing digital humans and embodied agents in real-world applications.

| **[Stereo Any Video: Temporally Consistent Stereo Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05549v1)** | 2025-03-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces Stereo Any Video, a powerful framework for video stereo matching. It can estimate spatially accurate and temporally consistent disparities without relying on auxiliary information such as camera poses or optical flow. The strong capability is driven by rich priors from monocular video depth models, which are integrated with convolutional features to produce stable representations. To further enhance performance, key architectural innovations are introduced: all-to-all-pairs correlation, which constructs smooth and robust matching cost volumes, and temporal convex upsampling, which improves temporal coherence. These components collectively ensure robustness, accuracy, and temporal consistency, setting a new standard in video stereo matching. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple datasets both qualitatively and quantitatively in zero-shot settings, as well as strong generalization to real-world indoor and outdoor scenarios.</p></details> |  |

By embedding more modalities into end-to-end networks, the system's understanding of both static and dynamic aspects of the driving environment is enhanced, thereby improving the safety of autonomous driving. In this paper, we introduce METDrive, an end-to-end system that leverages temporal guidance from the embedded time series features of ego states, including rotation angles, steering, throttle signals, and waypoint vectors. The geometric features derived from perception sensor data and the time series features of ego state data jointly guide the waypoint prediction with the proposed temporal guidance loss function. We evaluated METDrive on the CARLA leaderboard benchmarks, achieving a driving score of 70%, a route completion score of 94%, and an infraction score of 0.78.</p></details> | Accepted by ICRA |
| **[Ticktack : Long Span Temporal Alignment of Large Language Models Leveraging Sexagenary Cycle Time Expression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04150v2)** | 2025-03-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) suffer from temporal misalignment issues especially across long span of time. The issue arises from knowing that LLMs are trained on large amounts of data where temporal information is rather sparse over long times, such as thousands of years, resulting in insufficient learning or catastrophic forgetting by the LLMs. This paper proposes a methodology named "Ticktack" for addressing the LLM's long-time span misalignment in a yearly setting. Specifically, we first propose to utilize the sexagenary year expression instead of the Gregorian year expression employed by LLMs, achieving a more uniform distribution in yearly granularity. Then, we employ polar coordinates to model the sexagenary cycle of 60 terms and the year order within each term, with additional temporal encoding to ensure LLMs understand them. Finally, we present a temporal representational alignment approach for post-training LLMs that effectively distinguishes time points with relevant knowledge, hence improving performance on time-related tasks, particularly over a long period. We also create a long time span benchmark for evaluation. Experimental results prove the effectiveness of our proposal.</p></details> |  |
| **[VidHal: Benchmarking Temporal Hallucinations in Vision LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16771v2)** | 2025-03-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision Large Language Models (VLLMs) are widely acknowledged to be prone to hallucinations. Existing research addressing this problem has primarily been confined to image inputs, with limited exploration of video-based hallucinations. Furthermore, current evaluation methods fail to capture nuanced errors in generated responses, which are often exacerbated by the rich spatiotemporal dynamics of videos. To address this, we introduce VidHal, a benchmark specially designed to evaluate video-based hallucinations in VLLMs. VidHal is constructed by bootstrapping video instances across a wide range of common temporal aspects. A defining feature of our benchmark lies in the careful creation of captions which represent varying levels of hallucination associated with each video. To enable fine-grained evaluation, we propose a novel caption ordering task requiring VLLMs to rank captions by hallucinatory extent. We conduct extensive experiments on VidHal and comprehensively evaluate a broad selection of models. Our results uncover significant limitations in existing VLLMs regarding hallucination generation. Through our benchmark, we aim to inspire further research on 1) holistic understanding of VLLM capabilities, particularly regarding hallucination, and 2) extensive development of advanced VLLMs to alleviate this problem.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 10 figures.

Built from heterologous data of NASDAQ 100 companies, FinTMMBench offers three significant advantages. 1) Multi-modal Corpus: It encompasses a hybrid of financial tables, news articles, daily stock prices, and visual technical charts as the corpus. 2) Temporal-aware Questions: Each question requires the retrieval and interpretation of its relevant data over a specific time period, including daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, and annual periods. 3) Diverse Financial Analysis Tasks: The questions involve 10 different tasks, including information extraction, trend analysis, sentiment analysis and event detection, etc. We further propose a novel TMMHybridRAG method, which first leverages LLMs to convert data from other modalities (e.g., tabular, visual and time-series data) into textual format and then incorporates temporal information in each node when constructing graphs and dense indexes. Its effectiveness has been validated in extensive experiments, but notable gaps remain, highlighting the challenges presented by our FinTMMBench.</p></details> | Under review |

Unlike traditional synchronous estimators that rely on constant-frequency (zero-order) triggers, event-based visual odometry can actively accumulate information to generate temporally high-order estimation triggers. However, existing methods primarily focus on adaptive event representation after estimation triggers, neglecting the decision-making process for efficient temporal triggering itself. This oversight leads to the computational redundancy and noise accumulation. In this paper, we introduce a temporally high-order event-based visual odometry with spiking event accumulation networks (THE-SEAN). To the best of our knowledge, it is the first event-based visual odometry capable of dynamically adjusting its estimation trigger decision in response to motion and environmental changes. Inspired by biological systems that regulate hormone secretion to modulate heart rate, a self-supervised spiking neural network is designed to generate estimation triggers. This spiking network extracts temporal features to produce triggers, with rewards based on block matching points and Fisher information matrix (FIM) trace acquired from the estimator itself. Finally, THE-SEAN is evaluated across several open datasets, thereby demonstrating average improvements of 13\% in estimation accuracy, 9\% in smoothness, and 38\% in triggering efficiency compared to the state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[TS-LIF: A Temporal Segment Spiking Neuron Network for Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05108v1)** | 2025-03-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer a promising, biologically inspired approach for processing spatiotemporal data, particularly for time series forecasting. However, conventional neuron models like the Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) struggle to capture long-term dependencies and effectively process multi-scale temporal dynamics. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the Temporal Segment Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (TS-LIF) model, featuring a novel dual-compartment architecture. The dendritic and somatic compartments specialize in capturing distinct frequency components, providing functional heterogeneity that enhances the neuron's ability to process both low- and high-frequency information. Furthermore, the newly introduced direct somatic current injection reduces information loss during intra-neuronal transmission, while dendritic spike generation improves multi-scale information extraction. We provide a theoretical stability analysis of the TS-LIF model and explain how each compartment contributes to distinct frequency response characteristics. Experimental results show that TS-LIF outperforms traditional SNNs in time series forecasting, demonstrating better accuracy and robustness, even with missing data. TS-LIF advances the application of SNNs in time-series forecasting, providing a biologically inspired approach that captures complex temporal dynamics and offers potential for practical implementation in diverse forecasting scenarios.

| **[Risk-Aware Autonomous Driving with Linear Temporal Logic Specifications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09769v2)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Humans naturally balance the risks of different concerns while driving, including traffic rule violations, minor accidents, and fatalities. However, achieving the same behavior in autonomous systems remains an open problem. This paper extends a risk metric that has been verified in human-like driving studies to encompass more complex driving scenarios specified by linear temporal logic (LTL) that go beyond just collision risks. This extension incorporates the timing and severity of events into LTL specifications, thereby reflecting a human-like risk awareness. Without sacrificing expressivity for traffic rules, we adopt LTL specifications composed of safety and co-safety formulas, allowing the control synthesis problem to be reformulated as a reachability problem. By leveraging occupation measures, we formulate a linear programming (LP) problem for this LTL-based risk metric. Consequently, the synthesized policy balances different types of risks, including not only collision risks but also traffic rule violations. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated by three typical traffic scenarios in the Carla simulator.</p></details> |  |

While existing normalization layers, Batch-Norm, LayerNorm and InstanceNorm, help address distribution shifts, they fail to capture the temporal dependencies inherent in temporal signals. In this paper, we propose PSDNorm, a layer that leverages Monge mapping and temporal context to normalize feature maps in deep learning models. Notably, the proposed method operates as a test-time domain adaptation technique, addressing distribution shifts without additional training. Evaluations on 10 sleep staging datasets using the U-Time model demonstrate that PSDNorm achieves state-of-the-art performance at test time on datasets not seen during training while being 4x more data-efficient than the best baseline. Additionally, PSDNorm provides a significant improvement in robustness, achieving markedly higher F1 scores for the 20% hardest subjects.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Neural Networks for Virtual Sensing in Complex Systems: Addressing Heterogeneous Temporal Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18691v2)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-time condition monitoring is crucial for the reliable and efficient operation of complex systems. However, relying solely on physical sensors can be limited due to their cost, placement constraints, or inability to directly measure certain critical parameters. Virtual sensing addresses these limitations by leveraging readily available sensor data and system knowledge to estimate inaccessible parameters or infer system states. The increasing complexity of industrial systems necessitates deployments of sensors with diverse modalities to provide a comprehensive understanding of system states. These sensors capture data at varying frequencies to monitor both rapid and slowly varying system dynamics, as well as local and global state evolutions of the systems. This leads to heterogeneous temporal dynamics, which, particularly under varying operational end environmental conditions, pose a significant challenge for accurate virtual sensing. To address this, we propose a Heterogeneous Temporal Graph Neural Network (HTGNN) framework. HTGNN explicitly models signals from diverse sensors and integrates operating conditions into the model architecture. We evaluate HTGNN using two newly released datasets: a bearing dataset with diverse load conditions for bearing load prediction and a year-long simulated dataset for predicting bridge live loads. Our results demonstrate that HTGNN significantly outperforms established baseline methods in both tasks, particularly under highly varying operating conditions. These results highlight HTGNN's potential as a robust and accurate virtual sensing approach for complex systems, paving the way for improved monitoring, predictive maintenance, and enhanced system performance.

However, understanding the predictions from a model is crucial to ensure reliability and trustworthiness, particularly for high-risk applications, such as healthcare and transport. Few existing methods are able to generate explanations for models trained on continuous-time dynamic graph data and, of these, the computational complexity and lack of suitable explanation objectives pose challenges. In this paper, we propose $\textbf{S}$patio-$\textbf{T}$emporal E$\textbf{X}$planation $\textbf{Search}$ (STX-Search), a novel method for generating instance-level explanations that is applicable to static and dynamic temporal graph structures. We introduce a novel search strategy and objective function, to find explanations that are highly faithful and interpretable. When compared with existing methods, STX-Search produces explanations of higher fidelity whilst optimising explanation size to maintain interpretability.</p></details> |  |

Despite this, a critical challenge known as hallucination occurs when models overconfidently describe objects or attributes absent from the image, a problem exacerbated by the tendency of VLMs to rely on linguistic priors. This limitation reduces model reliability in high-stakes applications. In this work, we have observed the characteristic of logits' continuity consistency enhancement and introduced a straightforward and efficient method, Cross-Temporal Prediction Connection (TPC), designed to enhance the semantic consistency of logits by connecting them temporally across timesteps. TPC amplifies information flow and improves coherence, effectively reducing hallucination. Extensive experiments show that TPC surpasses existing representatives, delivering superior performance in both accuracy and efficiency while maintaining robustness in open-ended text generation tasks.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, with exploring YouTube's multilingual and multi-modal content, we construct a new social media temporal popularity prediction benchmark, namely SMTPD, and suggest a baseline framework for temporal popularity prediction. Through data analysis and experiments, we verify that temporal alignment and early popularity play crucial roles in social media popularity prediction for not only deepening the understanding of temporal dynamics of popularity in social media but also offering a suggestion about developing more effective prediction models in this field.

| **[Tracking Control of Euler-Lagrangian Systems with Prescribed State, Input, and Temporal Constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01866v2)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The synthesis of a smooth tracking control policy for Euler-Lagrangian (EL) systems with stringent regions of operation induced by state, input and temporal (SIT) constraints is a very challenging task. In contrast with existing methods that utilize prior knowledge of EL model parameters and uncertainty bounds, this study proposes an approximation-free adaptive barrier function-based control policy to ensure local prescribed time convergence of tracking error under state and input constraints. The proposed control policy accomplishes this by utilizing smooth time-based generator functions embedded in the filtered tracking error, which is combined with a saturation function that limits control action and confines states within the prescribed limits by enforcing the time-varying bounds on the filtered tracking error. Importantly, corresponding feasibility conditions pertaining to the minimum control authority, maximum disturbance rejection capability of the control policy, and the viable set of initial conditions are derived, illuminating the narrow operating domain of the EL systems arising from the interplay of SIT constraints. Numerical validation studies with three different robotic manipulators are employed to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed scheme. A detailed performance comparison study with leading alternative designs is also undertaken to illustrate the superior performance of the proposed scheme.</p></details> |  |

Each 3D Gaussian function represents a flexible region of interest and its semantic features, which are iteratively refined by the attention mechanism. In the experiment, it is found that the Gaussian function required by this method is larger than the query resolution of the original dense grid network, resulting in impaired performance. Therefore, we consider optimizing GaussianFormer by using unused temporal information. We learn the Spatial-Temporal Self-attention Mechanism from the previous grid-given occupation network and improve it to GaussianFormer. The experiment was conducted with the NuScenes dataset, and the experiment is currently underway.</p></details> |  |

Web search is frequently adopted as grounding for agent knowledge, yet its inappropriate configuration affects the quality of agent responses. Here, we construct a tool-based out-of-sample testing framework to measure the knowledge variability of large language model (LLM) agents from distinct date-controlled tools (DCTs). We demonstrate the temporal effects of an LLM agent as a writing assistant, which can use web search to help complete scientific publication abstracts. We show that temporal effects of the search engine translates into tool-dependent agent performance but can be alleviated with base model choice and explicit reasoning instructions such as chain-of-thought prompting. Our results indicate that agent evaluation should take a dynamical view and account for the temporal influence of tools and the updates of external resources.</p></details> | comments welcome |

While LLMs' capabilities to perform medical tasks continue to improve, their ability to reason over temporal dependencies across multiple patient visits and time frames remains unexplored. We introduce TIMER (Temporal Instruction Modeling and Evaluation for Longitudinal Clinical Records), a framework that incorporate instruction-response pairs grounding to different parts of a patient's record as a critical dimension in both instruction evaluation and tuning for longitudinal clinical records. We develop TIMER-Bench, the first time-aware benchmark that evaluates temporal reasoning capabilities over longitudinal EHRs, as well as TIMER-Instruct, an instruction-tuning methodology for LLMs to learn reasoning over time. We demonstrate that models fine-tuned with TIMER-Instruct improve performance by 7.3% on human-generated benchmarks and 9.2% on TIMER-Bench, indicating that temporal instruction-tuning improves model performance for reasoning over EHR.</p></details> | Preprint |

In this paper, we propose a novel spatial-temporal traversability assessment method, which aims to enable autonomous robots to effectively navigate through complex terrains. Our approach utilizes sparse Gaussian processes (SGP) to extract geometric features (curvature, gradient, elevation, etc.) directly from point cloud scans. These features are then used to construct a high-resolution local traversability map. Then, we design a spatial-temporal Bayesian Gaussian kernel (BGK) inference method to dynamically evaluate traversability scores, integrating historical and real-time data while considering factors such as slope, flatness, gradient, and uncertainty metrics. GPU acceleration is applied in the feature extraction step, and the system achieves real-time performance. Extensive simulation experiments across diverse terrain scenarios demonstrate that our method outperforms SOTA approaches in both accuracy and computational efficiency.

| **[From Pixels to Trajectory: Universal Adversarial Example Detection via Temporal Imprints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04853v1)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For the first time, we unveil discernible temporal (or historical) trajectory imprints resulting from adversarial example (AE) attacks. Standing in contrast to existing studies all focusing on spatial (or static) imprints within the targeted underlying victim models, we present a fresh temporal paradigm for understanding these attacks. Of paramount discovery is that these imprints are encapsulated within a single loss metric, spanning universally across diverse tasks such as classification and regression, and modalities including image, text, and audio. Recognizing the distinct nature of loss between adversarial and clean examples, we exploit this temporal imprint for AE detection by proposing TRAIT (TRaceable Adversarial temporal trajectory ImprinTs). TRAIT operates under minimal assumptions without prior knowledge of attacks, thereby framing the detection challenge as a one-class classification problem. However, detecting AEs is still challenged by significant overlaps between the constructed synthetic losses of adversarial and clean examples due to the absence of ground truth for incoming inputs. TRAIT addresses this challenge by converting the synthetic loss into a spectrum signature, using the technique of Fast Fourier Transform to highlight the discrepancies, drawing inspiration from the temporal nature of the imprints, analogous to time-series signals. Across 12 AE attacks including SMACK (USENIX Sec'2023), TRAIT demonstrates consistent outstanding performance across comprehensively evaluated modalities, tasks, datasets, and model architectures. In all scenarios, TRAIT achieves an AE detection accuracy exceeding 97%, often around 99%, while maintaining a false rejection rate of 1%. TRAIT remains effective under the formulated strong adaptive attacks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatial-Temporal Perception with Causal Inference for Naturalistic Driving Action Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04078v1)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Naturalistic driving action recognition is essential for vehicle cabin monitoring systems. However, the complexity of real-world backgrounds presents significant challenges for this task, and previous approaches have struggled with practical implementation due to their limited ability to observe subtle behavioral differences and effectively learn inter-frame features from video. In this paper, we propose a novel Spatial-Temporal Perception (STP) architecture that emphasizes both temporal information and spatial relationships between key objects, incorporating a causal decoder to perform behavior recognition and temporal action localization. Without requiring multimodal input, STP directly extracts temporal and spatial distance features from RGB video clips. Subsequently, these dual features are jointly encoded by maximizing the expected likelihood across all possible permutations of the factorization order. By integrating temporal and spatial features at different scales, STP can perceive subtle behavioral changes in challenging scenarios. Additionally, we introduce a causal-aware module to explore relationships between video frame features, significantly enhancing detection efficiency and performance. We validate the effectiveness of our approach using two publicly available driver distraction detection benchmarks. The results demonstrate that our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  |

Unlike previous studies that focus primarily on spatial super-resolution of MDI magnetograms, our approach can perform temporal super-resolution, which generates and inserts synthetic data between observed MDI magnetograms, thus providing finer temporal structure and enhanced details in the LOS data. The GenMDI model employs a conditional diffusion process, which synthesizes images by considering both preceding and subsequent magnetograms, ensuring that the generated images are not only of high-quality, but also temporally coherent with the surrounding data. Experimental results show that the GenMDI model performs better than the traditional linear interpolation method, especially in ARs with dynamic evolution in magnetic fields.</p></details> | 11 pages, 7 figures |

However, existing work treats the online mapping task as a local range perception task, overlooking the spatial scalability required for map construction. We propose IC-Mapper, an instance-centric online mapping framework, which comprises two primary components: 1) Instance-centric temporal association module: For the detection queries of adjacent frames, we measure them in both feature and geometric dimensions to obtain the matching correspondence between instances across frames. 2) Instance-centric spatial fusion module: We perform point sampling on the historical global map from a spatial dimension and integrate it with the detection results of instances corresponding to the current frame to achieve real-time expansion and update of the map. Based on the nuScenes dataset, we evaluate our approach on detection, tracking, and global mapping metrics. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of IC-Mapper against other state-of-the-art methods. Code will be released on https://github.com/Brickzhuantou/IC-Mapper.</p></details> |  |
| **[Controller Synthesis of Collaborative Signal Temporal Logic Tasks for Multi-Agent Systems via Assume-Guarantee Contracts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13499v2)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper considers the problem of controller synthesis of signal temporal logic (STL) specifications for large-scale multi-agent systems, where the agents are dynamically coupled and subject to collaborative tasks. A compositional framework based on continuous-time assume-guarantee contracts is developed to break the complex and large synthesis problem into subproblems of manageable sizes. We first show how to formulate the collaborative STL tasks as assume-guarantee contracts by leveraging the idea of funnel-based control. The concept of contracts is used to establish our compositionality result, which allows us to guarantee the satisfaction of a global contract by the multi-agent system when all agents satisfy their local contracts. Then, a closed-form continuous-time feedback controller is designed to enforce local contracts over the agents in a distributed manner, which further guarantees the global task satisfaction based on the compositionality result. Finally, the effectiveness of our results is demonstrated by two numerical examples.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2203.10041</p></details> |

Traditional pre-trained language models like BERT, which rely on synchronic document collections such as BookCorpus and Wikipedia, often fall short in effectively capturing and leveraging temporal information. To address this limitation, we introduce BiTimeBERT 2.0, a novel time-aware language model pre-trained on a temporal news article collection. BiTimeBERT 2.0 incorporates temporal information through three innovative pre-training objectives: Extended Time-Aware Masked Language Modeling (ETAMLM), Document Dating (DD), and Time-Sensitive Entity Replacement (TSER). Each objective is specifically designed to target a distinct dimension of temporal information: ETAMLM enhances the model's understanding of temporal contexts and relations, DD integrates document timestamps as explicit chronological markers, and TSER focuses on the temporal dynamics of "Person" entities. Moreover, our refined corpus preprocessing strategy reduces training time by nearly 53\%, making BiTimeBERT 2.0 significantly more efficient while maintaining high performance. Experimental results show that BiTimeBERT 2.0 achieves substantial improvements across a broad range of time-related tasks and excels on datasets spanning extensive temporal ranges. These findings underscore BiTimeBERT 2.0's potential as a powerful tool for advancing temporal reasoning in NLP.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted for publication in ACM Transactions on the Web.

The goal is to remove the minimum number of vertices (temporal edges, respectively) in order to delete all the temporal paths that have time travel at most l between a source vertex s and target vertex z. First, we solve an open problem in the literature showing that (s,z,l)-Temporal Separator is NP-complete even when the underlying graph has pathwidth bounded by four. We complement this result showing that (s,z,l)-Temporal Separator can be solved in polynomial time for graphs of pathwidth bounded by three. Then we consider the approximability of (s,z,l)-Temporal Separator and we show that it cannot be approximated within factor$2^{\Omega(\log^{1-\varepsilon}|V|)}$ for any constant $\varepsilon> 0$, unless $NP \subseteq ZPP$ (V is the vertex set of the input temporal graph) and that the strict version is approximable within factor l - 1 (we show also that it is unliklely that this factor can be improved). Then we consider the (s,z,l)-Temporal Cut problem, we show that it is APX-hard and we present a $2 \log_2(2\ell)$ approximation algorithm.</p></details> |  |
| **[Handling Spatial-Temporal Data Heterogeneity for Federated Continual Learning via Tail Anchor](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18355v2)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated continual learning (FCL) allows each client to continually update its knowledge from task streams, enhancing the applicability of federated learning in real-world scenarios. However, FCL needs to address not only spatial data heterogeneity between clients but also temporal data heterogeneity between tasks. In this paper, empirical experiments demonstrate that such input-level heterogeneity significantly affects the model's internal parameters and outputs, leading to severe spatial-temporal catastrophic forgetting of local and previous knowledge. To this end, we propose Federated Tail Anchor (FedTA) to mix trainable Tail Anchor with the frozen output features to adjust their position in the feature space, thereby overcoming parameter-forgetting and output-forgetting. Three novel components are also included: Input Enhancement for improving the performance of pre-trained models on downstream tasks; Selective Input Knowledge Fusion for fusion of heterogeneous local knowledge on the server; and Best Global Prototype Selection for finding the best anchor point for each class in the feature space. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FedTA not only outperforms existing FCL methods but also effectively preserves the relative positions of features.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted by CVPR 2025</p></details> |

Traditional approaches have relied on separate models tailored to either grid-based data, representing cities as uniform cells, or graph-based data, modeling cities as networks of nodes and edges. In this paper, we build UniFlow, a foundational model for general urban flow prediction that unifies both grid-based and graphbased data. We first design a multi-view spatio-temporal patching mechanism to standardize different data into a consistent sequential format and then introduce a spatio-temporal transformer architecture to capture complex correlations and dynamics. To leverage shared spatio-temporal patterns across different data types and facilitate effective cross-learning, we propose SpatioTemporal Memory Retrieval Augmentation (ST-MRA). By creating structured memory modules to store shared spatio-temporal patterns, ST-MRA enhances predictions through adaptive memory retrieval. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniFlow outperforms existing models in both grid-based and graph-based flow prediction, excelling particularly in scenarios with limited data availability, showcasing its superior performance and broad applicability. The datasets and code implementation have been released on https://github.com/YuanYuan98/UniFlow.</p></details> |  |
| **[Distributed Optimization by Network Flows with Spatio-Temporal Compression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00002v3)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Several data compressors have been proposed in distributed optimization frameworks of network systems to reduce communication overhead in large-scale applications. In this paper, we demonstrate that effective information compression may occur over time or space during sequences of node communications in distributed algorithms, leading to the concept of spatio-temporal compressors. This abstraction classifies existing compressors as spatio-temporal compressors, with their effectiveness described by constructive stability criteria from nonlinear system theory. Subsequently, we apply these spatio-temporal compressors to standard continuous-time consensus flows and distributed prime-dual flows, establishing conditions ensuring convergence. Additionally, we introduce a novel observer-based distributed primal-dual continuous flow integrated with spatio-temporal compressors, which provides broader convergence conditions. These continuous flows achieve exponential convergence to the global optimum when the objective function is strongly convex and can be discretized using Euler approximations. Finally, numerical simulations illustrate the versatility of the proposed spatio-temporal compressors and verify the convergence of algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2408.02332</p></details> |

Current advanced optical flow methods for event cameras largely adopt established image-based frameworks. However, the spatial sparsity of event data limits their performance. In this paper, we present BAT, an innovative framework that estimates event-based optical flow using bidirectional adaptive temporal correlation. BAT includes three novel designs: 1) a bidirectional temporal correlation that transforms bidirectional temporally dense motion cues into spatially dense ones, enabling accurate and spatially dense optical flow estimation; 2) an adaptive temporal sampling strategy for maintaining temporal consistency in correlation; 3) spatially adaptive temporal motion aggregation to efficiently and adaptively aggregate consistent target motion features into adjacent motion features while suppressing inconsistent ones. Our results rank $1^{st}$ on the DSEC-Flow benchmark, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods by a large margin while also exhibiting sharp edges and high-quality details. Notably, our BAT can accurately predict future optical flow using only past events, significantly outperforming E-RAFT's warm-start approach.

Currently, the inherent trade-off between constraint compliance and computational efficiency enhancement in UAV trajectory optimization problems has not been sufficiently addressed. To enhance the performance of UAV trajectory optimization, we propose a spatial-temporal iterative optimization framework. Firstly, B-splines are utilized to represent UAV trajectories, with rigorous safety assurance achieved through strict enforcement of constraints on control points. Subsequently, a set of QP-LP subproblems via spatial-temporal decoupling and constraint linearization is derived. Finally, an iterative optimization strategy incorporating guidance gradients is employed to obtain high-performance UAV trajectories in different scenarios. Both simulation and real-world experimental results validate the efficiency and high-performance of the proposed optimization framework in generating safe and fast trajectories.

| **[TimeRefine: Temporal Grounding with Time Refining Video LLM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09601v2)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video temporal grounding aims to localize relevant temporal boundaries in a video given a textual prompt. Recent work has focused on enabling Video LLMs to perform video temporal grounding via next-token prediction of temporal timestamps. However, accurately localizing timestamps in videos remains challenging for Video LLMs when relying solely on temporal token prediction. Our proposed TimeRefine addresses this challenge in two ways. First, instead of directly predicting the start and end timestamps, we reformulate the temporal grounding task as a temporal refining task: the model first makes rough predictions and then refines them by predicting offsets to the target segment. This refining process is repeated multiple times, through which the model progressively self-improves its temporal localization accuracy. Second, to enhance the model's temporal perception capabilities, we incorporate an auxiliary prediction head that penalizes the model more if a predicted segment deviates further from the ground truth, thus encouraging the model to make closer and more accurate predictions. Our plug-and-play method can be integrated into most LLM-based temporal grounding approaches. The experimental results demonstrate that TimeRefine achieves 3.6% and 5.0% mIoU improvements on the ActivityNet and Charades-STA datasets, respectively. Code and pretrained models will be released.</p></details> |  |

State-of-the-art association methods in agriculture are dedicated towards matching larger crops using either high-resolution point clouds or temporally stable features, which are both difficult to obtain for smaller fruit in the field. To address these challenges, we propose a transformer-based architecture that encodes the shape and position of each fruitlet, and propagates and refines these features through a series of transformer encoder layers with alternating self and cross-attention. We demonstrate that our method is able to achieve an F1-score of 92.4% on data collected in a commercial apple orchard and outperforms all baselines and ablations.</p></details> |  |
| **[STAA-SNN: Spatial-Temporal Attention Aggregator for Spiking Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02689v2)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have gained significant attention due to their biological plausibility and energy efficiency, making them promising alternatives to Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). However, the performance gap between SNNs and ANNs remains a substantial challenge hindering the widespread adoption of SNNs. In this paper, we propose a Spatial-Temporal Attention Aggregator SNN (STAA-SNN) framework, which dynamically focuses on and captures both spatial and temporal dependencies. First, we introduce a spike-driven self-attention mechanism specifically designed for SNNs. Additionally, we pioneeringly incorporate position encoding to integrate latent temporal relationships into the incoming features. For spatial-temporal information aggregation, we employ step attention to selectively amplify relevant features at different steps. Finally, we implement a time-step random dropout strategy to avoid local optima. As a result, STAA-SNN effectively captures both spatial and temporal dependencies, enabling the model to analyze complex patterns and make accurate predictions. The framework demonstrates exceptional performance across diverse datasets and exhibits strong generalization capabilities. Notably, STAA-SNN achieves state-of-the-art results on neuromorphic datasets CIFAR10-DVS, with remarkable performances of 97.14%, 82.05% and 70.40% on the static datasets CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet, respectively. Furthermore, our model exhibits improved performance ranging from 0.33\% to 2.80\% with fewer time steps.

Despite their potential to reduce inference energy consumption, a performance gap persists between SNNs and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), primarily due to current training methods and inherent model limitations. While recent research has aimed to enhance SNN learning by employing knowledge distillation (KD) from ANN teacher networks, traditional distillation techniques often overlook the distinctive spatiotemporal properties of SNNs, thus failing to fully leverage their advantages. To overcome these challenge, we propose a novel logit distillation method characterized by temporal separation and entropy regularization. This approach improves existing SNN distillation techniques by performing distillation learning on logits across different time steps, rather than merely on aggregated output features. Furthermore, the integration of entropy regularization stabilizes model optimization and further boosts the performance. Extensive experimental results indicate that our method surpasses prior SNN distillation strategies, whether based on logit distillation, feature distillation, or a combination of both. The code will be available on GitHub.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2025</p></details> |

However, driving simulators nowadays still have difficulty in generating controllable, diverse, and rule-compliant behaviors for road participants: Rule-based models cannot produce diverse behaviors and require careful tuning, whereas learning-based methods imitate the policy from data but are not designed to follow the rules explicitly. Besides, the real-world datasets are by nature "single-outcome", making the learning method hard to generate diverse behaviors. In this paper, we leverage Signal Temporal Logic (STL) and Diffusion Models to learn controllable, diverse, and rule-aware policy. We first calibrate the STL on the real-world data, then generate diverse synthetic data using trajectory optimization, and finally learn the rectified diffusion policy on the augmented dataset. We test on the NuScenes dataset and our approach can achieve the most diverse rule-compliant trajectories compared to other baselines, with a runtime 1/17X to the second-best approach. In the closed-loop testing, our approach reaches the highest diversity, rule satisfaction rate, and the least collision rate. Our method can generate varied characteristics conditional on different STL parameters in testing. A case study on human-robot encounter scenarios shows our approach can generate diverse and closed-to-oracle trajectories.

However, the complexity of the allowed tasks for these planners is limited. On the other hand, signal temporal logic (STL) can specify complex requirements, but STL-based motion planning and control algorithms often face scalability issues, especially in large multi-robot systems with complex dynamics. In this paper, we propose an algorithm that leverages the best of the two worlds. We first use a single-robot motion planner to efficiently generate a set of alternative reference paths for each robot. Then coordination requirements are specified using STL, which is defined over the assignment of paths and robots' progress along those paths. We use a Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP) to compute task assignments and robot progress targets over time such that the STL specification is satisfied. Finally, a local controller is used to track the target progress. Simulations demonstrate that our method can handle tasks with complex constraints and scales to large multi-robot teams and intricate task allocation scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICRA 2025</p></details> |

We extend these concepts to temporal graph theory, resulting in multiple interesting definitions of a "temporal cycle". For each of these, we consider the problems of Cycle Detection and Acyclic Temporization. For the former, we are given an input temporal digraph, and we want to decide whether it contains a temporal cycle. Regarding the latter, for a given input (static) digraph, we want to time the arcs such that no temporal cycle exists in the resulting temporal digraph. We're also interested in Acyclic Temporization where we bound the lifetime of the resulting temporal digraph. Multiple results are presented, including polynomial and fixed-parameter tractable search algorithms, polynomial-time reductions from 3-SAT and Not All Equal 3-SAT, and temporizations resulting from arbitrary vertex orderings which cover (almost) all cases.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 9 figures, preprint version</p></details> |

The meaning of words and phrases changes over time, and the context in which they are used is constantly evolving. This is not just true for social media data, where the language used is rapidly influenced by current events, memes and trends, but also for journalistic, economic or political text data. Most NLP techniques however consider the corpus at hand to be homogenous in regard to time. This is a simplification that can lead to biased results, as the meaning of words and phrases can change over time. For instance, running a classic Latent Dirichlet Allocation on a corpus that spans several years is not enough to capture changes in the topics over time, but only portraits an "average" topic distribution over the whole time span. Researchers have developed a number of tools for analyzing text data over time. However, these tools are often scattered across different packages and libraries, making it difficult for researchers to use them in a consistent and reproducible way. The ttta package is supposed to serve as a collection of tools for analyzing text data over time.</p></details> | 4 pages, 2 figures |

We further demonstrate how this Approximate Dynamic Programming approach can be implemented as a particular variant of the Temporal Difference learning algorithm, adapted for handling perturbations. To validate our theoretical findings, we provide a numerical example using a Markov Decision Process corresponding to a resource allocation problem.</p></details> |  |

Nevertheless, the majority of current BEV map generation studies focusing on visual map generation lack depth-aware reasoning capabilities. They exhibit limited efficacy in managing occlusions and handling complex environments, with a notable decline in perceptual performance under adverse weather conditions or low-light scenarios. Therefore, this paper proposes TS-CGNet, which leverages Temporal-Spatial fusion with Centerline-Guided diffusion. This visual framework, grounded in prior knowledge, is designed for integration into any existing network for building BEV maps. Specifically, this framework is decoupled into three parts: Local mapping system involves the initial generation of semantic maps using purely visual information; The Temporal-Spatial Aligner Module (TSAM) integrates historical information into mapping generation by applying transformation matrices; The Centerline-Guided Diffusion Model (CGDM) is a prediction module based on the diffusion model. CGDM incorporates centerline information through spatial-attention mechanisms to enhance semantic segmentation reconstruction. We construct BEV semantic segmentation maps by our methods on the public nuScenes and the robustness benchmarks under various corruptions. Our method improves 1.90%, 1.73%, and 2.87% for perceived ranges of 60x30m, 120x60m, and 240x60m in the task of BEV HD mapping. TS-CGNet attains an improvement of 1.92% for perceived ranges of 100x100m in the task of BEV semantic mapping. Moreover, TS-CGNet achieves an average improvement of 2.92% in detection accuracy under varying weather conditions and sensor interferences in the perception range of 240x60m.

Conventional ego-motion sensors, such as cameras and LiDARs, may be compromised in adverse environmental conditions, such as fog, heavy rain, or dust. Automotive radars, known for their robustness to such conditions, present themselves as complementary sensors or a promising alternative within the ego-motion estimation frameworks. In this paper we propose a novel Radar-Inertial Odometry (RIO) system that integrates an automotive radar and an inertial measurement unit. The key contribution is the integration of online temporal delay calibration within the factor graph optimization framework that compensates for potential time offsets between radar and IMU measurements. To validate the proposed approach we have conducted thorough experimental analysis on real-world radar and IMU data. The results show that, even without scan matching or target tracking, integration of online temporal calibration significantly reduces localization error compared to systems that disregard time synchronization, thus highlighting the important role of, often neglected, accurate temporal alignment in radar-based sensor fusion systems for autonomous navigation.</p></details> |  |

This paper proposes to resolve the above issues from a spatial-temporal modeling perspective. First, we propose a novel Temporally-smooth Procrustean Alignment module that estimates 3D deforming shapes and adjusts the camera motion by aligning the 3D shape sequence consecutively. Our new alignment module remedies the requirement of complex reference 3D shape during alignment, which is more conductive to non-isotropic deformation modeling.

However, many works focus on tweaking existing 2D backbones due to the reliance of ImageNet pretraining, which restrains the models from achieving higher efficiency for video recognition. In this work we introduce a simple and very efficient 3D convolutional neural network for video action recognition. The design of the building block consists of a channel-wise convolution, followed by a spatial group convolution, and finally a temporal convolution. We evaluate the performance and efficiency of our proposed network on several video action recognition datasets by directly training on the target dataset without relying on pertaining. On Something-Something-V1&V2, Kinetics-400 and Multi-Moments in Time, our network can match or even surpass the performance of other models which are several times larger. On the fine-grained action recognition dataset FineGym, we beat the previous state-of-the-art accuracy achieved with 2-stream methods by more than 5% using only RGB input.</p></details> |  |
| **[Accelerating Multi-Task Temporal Difference Learning under Low-Rank Representation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02030v1)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study policy evaluation problems in multi-task reinforcement learning (RL) under a low-rank representation setting. In this setting, we are given $N$ learning tasks where the corresponding value function of these tasks lie in an $r$-dimensional subspace, with $r<N$. One can apply the classic temporal-difference (TD) learning method for solving these problems where this method learns the value function of each task independently. In this paper, we are interested in understanding whether one can exploit the low-rank structure of the multi-task setting to accelerate the performance of TD learning. To answer this question, we propose a new variant of TD learning method, where we integrate the so-called truncated singular value decomposition step into the update of TD learning. This additional step will enable TD learning to exploit the dominant directions due to the low rank structure to update the iterates, therefore, improving its performance. Our empirical results show that the proposed method significantly outperforms the classic TD learning, where the performance gap increases as the rank $r$ decreases. From the theoretical point of view, introducing the truncated singular value decomposition step into TD learning might cause an instability on the updates. We provide a theoretical result showing that the instability does not happen. Specifically, we prove that the proposed method converges at a rate $\mathcal{O}(\frac{\ln(t)}{t})$, where $t$ is the number of iterations. This rate matches that of the standard TD learning.</p></details> | 13 pages, 3 figures |

Diseases evolve dynamically over time, and studying longitudinal observations of specific biomarkers can help to understand patients response to treatment and predict disease progression. We propose a novel iterative regression-based method to estimate changes in patients status within a cohort that includes censored patients, and illustrate it on clinical data from myeloma cases. We formulate the relapse time estimation problem in the framework of Piecewise Deterministic Markov processes (PDMP), where the Euclidean component is a surrogate biomarker for patient state. This approach enables continuous-time estimation of the status-change dates, which in turn allows for accurate inference of the relapse time distribution. A key challenge lies in the partial observability of the process, a complexity that has been rarely addressed in previous studies. . We evaluate the performance of our procedure through a simulation study and compare it with different approaches. This work is a proof of concept on biomarker trajectories with simple behaviour, but our method can easily be extended to more complex dynamics.</p></details> |  |

While generative models have shown promise in synthesizing feasible trajectories, they often fail to capture the nuanced variability of human driving styles due to dataset biases and distributional shifts. To address this, we introduce TrajHF, a human feedback-driven finetuning framework for generative trajectory models, designed to align motion planning with diverse driving preferences. TrajHF incorporates multi-conditional denoiser and reinforcement learning with human feedback to refine multi-modal trajectory generation beyond conventional imitation learning. This enables better alignment with human driving preferences while maintaining safety and feasibility constraints. TrajHF achieves PDMS of 93.95 on NavSim benchmark, significantly exceeding other methods. TrajHF sets a new paradigm for personalized and adaptable trajectory generation in autonomous driving.</p></details> | 10 pages, 5 figures |
| **[GoalFlow: Goal-Driven Flow Matching for Multimodal Trajectories Generation in End-to-End Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05689v3)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose GoalFlow, an end-to-end autonomous driving method for generating high-quality multimodal trajectories. In autonomous driving scenarios, there is rarely a single suitable trajectory. Recent methods have increasingly focused on modeling multimodal trajectory distributions. However, they suffer from trajectory selection complexity and reduced trajectory quality due to high trajectory divergence and inconsistencies between guidance and scene information. To address these issues, we introduce GoalFlow, a novel method that effectively constrains the generative process to produce high-quality, multimodal trajectories. To resolve the trajectory divergence problem inherent in diffusion-based methods, GoalFlow constrains the generated trajectories by introducing a goal point. GoalFlow establishes a novel scoring mechanism that selects the most appropriate goal point from the candidate points based on scene information. Furthermore, GoalFlow employs an efficient generative method, Flow Matching, to generate multimodal trajectories, and incorporates a refined scoring mechanism to select the optimal trajectory from the candidates. Our experimental results, validated on the Navsim\cite{Dauner2024_navsim}, demonstrate that GoalFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance, delivering robust multimodal trajectories for autonomous driving. GoalFlow achieved PDMS of 90.3, significantly surpassing other methods. Compared with other diffusion-policy-based methods, our approach requires only a single denoising step to obtain excellent performance.

Key operations such as conflict detection and resolution, aircraft anomaly monitoring, and the management of congested flight paths are increasingly reliant on this foundational technology, underscoring the urgent demand for intelligent solutions. The dynamics in airport terminal zones and crowded airspaces are intricate and ever-changing; however, current methodologies do not sufficiently account for the interactions among aircraft. To tackle these challenges, we propose DA-STGCN, an innovative spatiotemporal graph convolutional network that integrates a dual attention mechanism. Our model reconstructs the adjacency matrix through a self-attention approach, enhancing the capture of node correlations, and employs graph attention to distill spatiotemporal characteristics, thereby generating a probabilistic distribution of predicted trajectories. This novel adjacency matrix, reconstructed with the self-attention mechanism, is dynamically optimized throughout the network's training process, offering a more nuanced reflection of the inter-node relationships compared to traditional algorithms. The performance of the model is validated on two ADS-B datasets, one near the airport terminal area and the other in dense airspace. Experimental results demonstrate a notable improvement over current 4D trajectory prediction methods, achieving a 20% and 30% reduction in the Average Displacement Error (ADE) and Final Displacement Error (FDE), respectively. The incorporation of a Dual-Attention module has been shown to significantly enhance the extraction of node correlations, as verified by ablation experiments.</p></details> |  |
| **[MoFlow: One-Step Flow Matching for Human Trajectory Forecasting via Implicit Maximum Likelihood Estimation based Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09950v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we address the problem of human trajectory forecasting, which aims to predict the inherently multi-modal future movements of humans based on their past trajectories and other contextual cues. We propose a novel motion prediction conditional flow matching model, termed MoFlow, to predict K-shot future trajectories for all agents in a given scene. We design a novel flow matching loss function that not only ensures at least one of the $K$ sets of future trajectories is accurate but also encourages all $K$ sets of future trajectories to be diverse and plausible. Furthermore, by leveraging the implicit maximum likelihood estimation (IMLE), we propose a novel distillation method for flow models that only requires samples from the teacher model. Extensive experiments on the real-world datasets, including SportVU NBA games, ETH-UCY, and SDD, demonstrate that both our teacher flow model and the IMLE-distilled student model achieve state-of-the-art performance. These models can generate diverse trajectories that are physically and socially plausible. Moreover, our one-step student model is $\textbf{100}$ times faster than the teacher flow model during sampling.

| **[Finding the Muses: Identifying Coresets through Loss Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09721v1)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning models achieve state-of-the-art performance across domains but face scalability challenges in real-time or resource-constrained scenarios. To address this, we propose Loss Trajectory Correlation (LTC), a novel metric for coreset selection that identifies critical training samples driving generalization. $LTC$ quantifies the alignment between training sample loss trajectories and validation set loss trajectories, enabling the construction of compact, representative subsets. Unlike traditional methods with computational and storage overheads that are infeasible to scale to large datasets, $LTC$ achieves superior efficiency as it can be computed as a byproduct of training. Our results on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-1k show that $LTC$ consistently achieves accuracy on par with or surpassing state-of-the-art coreset selection methods, with any differences remaining under 1%. LTC also effectively transfers across various architectures, including ResNet, VGG, DenseNet, and Swin Transformer, with minimal performance degradation (<2%). Additionally, LTC offers insights into training dynamics, such as identifying aligned and conflicting sample behaviors, at a fraction of the computational cost of traditional methods. This framework paves the way for scalable coreset selection and efficient dataset optimization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Post-interactive Multimodal Trajectory Prediction for Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09366v1)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modeling the interactions among agents for trajectory prediction of autonomous driving has been challenging due to the inherent uncertainty in agents' behavior. The interactions involved in the predicted trajectories of agents, also called post-interactions, have rarely been considered in trajectory prediction models. To this end, we propose a coarse-to-fine Transformer for multimodal trajectory prediction, i.e., Pioformer, which explicitly extracts the post-interaction features to enhance the prediction accuracy. Specifically, we first build a Coarse Trajectory Network to generate coarse trajectories based on the observed trajectories and lane segments, in which the low-order interaction features are extracted with the graph neural networks. Next, we build a hypergraph neural network-based Trajectory Proposal Network to generate trajectory proposals, where the high-order interaction features are learned by the hypergraphs. Finally, the trajectory proposals are sent to the Proposal Refinement Network for further refinement. The observed trajectories and trajectory proposals are concatenated together as the inputs of the Proposal Refinement Network, in which the post-interaction features are learned by combining the previous interaction features and trajectory consistency features. Moreover, we propose a three-stage training scheme to facilitate the learning process. Extensive experiments on the Argoverse 1 dataset demonstrate the superiority of our method. Compared with the baseline HiVT-64, our model has reduced the prediction errors by 4.4%, 8.4%, 14.4%, 5.7% regarding metrics minADE6, minFDE6, MR6, and brier-minFDE6, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robust Fault-Tolerant Control and Agile Trajectory Planning for Modular Aerial Robotic Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09351v1)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modular Aerial Robotic Systems (MARS) consist of multiple drone units that can self-reconfigure to adapt to various mission requirements and fault conditions. However, existing fault-tolerant control methods exhibit significant oscillations during docking and separation, impacting system stability. To address this issue, we propose a novel fault-tolerant control reallocation method that adapts to arbitrary number of modular robots and their assembly formations. The algorithm redistributes the expected collective force and torque required for MARS to individual unit according to their moment arm relative to the center of MARS mass. Furthermore, We propose an agile trajectory planning method for MARS of arbitrary configurations, which is collision-avoiding and dynamically feasible. Our work represents the first comprehensive approach to enable fault-tolerant and collision avoidance flight for MARS. We validate our method through extensive simulations, demonstrating improved fault tolerance, enhanced trajectory tracking accuracy, and greater robustness in cluttered environments.

| **[Learning Few-Step Diffusion Models by Trajectory Distribution Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06674v2)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accelerating diffusion model sampling is crucial for efficient AIGC deployment. While diffusion distillation methods -- based on distribution matching and trajectory matching -- reduce sampling to as few as one step, they fall short on complex tasks like text-to-image generation. Few-step generation offers a better balance between speed and quality, but existing approaches face a persistent trade-off: distribution matching lacks flexibility for multi-step sampling, while trajectory matching often yields suboptimal image quality. To bridge this gap, we propose learning few-step diffusion models by Trajectory Distribution Matching (TDM), a unified distillation paradigm that combines the strengths of distribution and trajectory matching. Our method introduces a data-free score distillation objective, aligning the student's trajectory with the teacher's at the distribution level. Further, we develop a sampling-steps-aware objective that decouples learning targets across different steps, enabling more adjustable sampling. This approach supports both deterministic sampling for superior image quality and flexible multi-step adaptation, achieving state-of-the-art performance with remarkable efficiency. Our model, TDM, outperforms existing methods on various backbones, such as SDXL and PixArt-$\alpha$, delivering superior quality and significantly reduced training costs. In particular, our method distills PixArt-$\alpha$ into a 4-step generator that outperforms its teacher on real user preference at 1024 resolution. This is accomplished with 500 iterations and 2 A800 hours -- a mere 0.01% of the teacher's training cost. In addition, our proposed TDM can be extended to accelerate text-to-video diffusion. Notably, TDM can outperform its teacher model (CogVideoX-2B) by using only 4 NFE on VBench, improving the total score from 80.91 to 81.65.

The world model that can foresee the outcome of the trajectory has been used to evaluate the end-to-end autonomous driving system. However, existing world models predominantly emphasize the trajectory of the ego vehicle and leave other vehicles uncontrollable. This limitation hinders their ability to realistically simulate the interaction between the ego vehicle and the driving scenario. In addition, it remains a challenge to match multiple trajectories with each vehicle in the video to control the video generation. To address above issues, a driving \textbf{W}orld \textbf{M}odel named EOT-WM is proposed in this paper, unifying \textbf{E}go-\textbf{O}ther vehicle \textbf{T}rajectories in videos. Specifically, we first project ego and other vehicle trajectories in the BEV space into the image coordinate to match each trajectory with its corresponding vehicle in the video. Then, trajectory videos are encoded by the Spatial-Temporal Variational Auto Encoder to align with driving video latents spatially and temporally in the unified visual space. A trajectory-injected diffusion Transformer is further designed to denoise the noisy video latents for video generation with the guidance of ego-other vehicle trajectories. In addition, we propose a metric based on control latent similarity to evaluate the controllability of trajectories. Extensive experiments are conducted on the nuScenes dataset, and the proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art method by 30\% in FID and 55\% in FVD. The model can also predict unseen driving scenes with self-produced trajectories.</p></details> | 8 pages, 7 figures |

While prior work established the worst case optimality of standard flow matching under Wasserstein distances, the theoretical guarantees for higher-order flow matching - which incorporates acceleration terms to refine sample trajectories - remain unexplored. In this paper, we bridge this gap by proving that higher-order flow matching preserves worst case optimality as a distribution estimator. We derive upper bounds on the estimation error for second-order flow matching, demonstrating that the convergence rates depend polynomially on the smoothness of the target distribution (quantified via Besov spaces) and key parameters of the ODE dynamics. Our analysis employs neural network approximations with carefully controlled depth, width, and sparsity to bound acceleration errors across both small and large time intervals, ultimately unifying these results into a general worst case optimal bound for all time steps.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2410.11261</p></details> |

In this paper, we present a novel framework for simultaneously designing trajectories of robots, objects, and contacts efficiently for contact-rich manipulation. We propose a hierarchical optimization framework where Mixed-Integer Linear Program (MILP) selects optimal contacts between robot \& object using approximate dynamical constraints, and then a NonLinear Program (NLP) optimizes trajectory of the robot(s) and object considering full nonlinear constraints. We present a convex relaxation of bilinear constraints using binary encoding technique such that MILP can provide tighter solutions with better computational complexity. The proposed framework is evaluated on various manipulation tasks where it can reason about complex multi-contact interactions while providing computational advantages.

Both these tasks are crucial for automation and assistance in endoscopy surgery. Given the safety-critical nature of these tasks, reliable uncertainty quantification is essential. Conformal prediction is a fast-growing and widely recognized framework for uncertainty estimation in machine learning and computer vision, offering distribution-free, theoretically valid prediction intervals. In this work, we explore the application of standard conformal prediction and conformalized quantile regression to estimate uncertainty in forecasting surgical instrument motion, i.e., predicting direction and magnitude of surgical instruments' future motion. We analyze and compare their coverage and interval sizes, assessing the impact of multiple hypothesis testing and correction methods. Additionally, we show how these techniques can be employed to produce useful uncertainty heatmaps. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study applying conformal prediction to surgical guidance, marking an initial step toward constructing principled prediction intervals with formal coverage guarantees in this domain.</p></details> |  |

This sampling method yields trajectory samples that are tightly clustered around a mean trajectory. This clustering behavior in turn, limits the exploration capability of the controller and reduces the likelihood of finding feasible solutions in complex environments. Recent work has attempted to address this problem by either reshaping the resulting trajectory distribution or increasing the sample entropy to enhance diversity and promote exploration. In our recent work, we introduced the concept of C-Uniform trajectory generation [1] which allows the computation of control input probabilities to generate trajectories that sample the configuration space uniformly. In this work, we first address the main limitation of this method: lack of scalability due to computational complexity. We introduce Neural C-Uniform, an unsupervised C-Uniform trajectory sampler that mitigates scalability issues by computing control input probabilities without relying on a discretized configuration space. Experiments show that Neural C-Uniform achieves a similar uniformity ratio to the original C-Uniform approach and generates trajectories over a longer time horizon while preserving uniformity. Next, we present CU-MPPI, which integrates Neural C-Uniform sampling into existing MPPI variants. We analyze the performance of CU-MPPI in simulation and real-world experiments. Our results indicate that in settings where the optimal solution has high curvature, CU-MPPI leads to drastic improvements in performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IROS2025</p></details> |

While learning-based prediction models have shown success in generating likely human trajectory predictions, integrating these stochastic models into a robot controller presents several challenges. The controller needs to account for interactive coupling between planned robot motion and human predictions while ensuring both predictions and robot actions are safe (i.e. collision-free). To address these challenges, we present a receding horizon crowd navigation method for single-robot multi-human environments. We first propose a diffusion model to generate joint trajectory predictions for all humans in the scene. We then incorporate these multi-modal predictions into a SICNav Bilevel MPC problem that simultaneously solves for a robot plan (upper-level) and acts as a safety filter to refine the predictions for non-collision (lower-level). Combining planning and prediction refinement into one bilevel problem ensures that the robot plan and human predictions are coupled. We validate the open-loop trajectory prediction performance of our diffusion model on the commonly used ETH/UCY benchmark and evaluate the closed-loop performance of our robot navigation method in simulation and extensive real-robot experiments demonstrating safe, efficient, and reactive robot motion.</p></details> |  |

With the rapid advancement in connected technologies, such as vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication, valuable information from alternate views becomes accessible via wireless networks. The integration of information from alternative views has the potential to overcome the inherent limitations associated with a single viewpoint, such as occlusions and limited field of view. In this work, we introduce V2INet, a novel trajectory prediction framework designed to model multi-view data by extending existing single-view models. Unlike previous approaches where the multi-view data is manually fused or formulated as a separate training stage, our model supports end-to-end training, enhancing both flexibility and performance. Moreover, the predicted multimodal trajectories are calibrated by a post-hoc conformal prediction module to get valid and efficient confidence regions. We evaluated the entire framework using the real-world V2I dataset V2X-Seq. Our results demonstrate superior performance in terms of Final Displacement Error (FDE) and Miss Rate (MR) using a single GPU.

Current evaluation tasks like VQA and visual grounding remain too coarse to assess fine-grained pixel comprehension accurately. Though segmentation is foundational for pixel-level understanding, existing methods often require MLLMs to generate implicit tokens, decoded through external pixel decoders. This approach disrupts the MLLM's text output space, potentially compromising language capabilities and reducing flexibility and extensibility, while failing to reflect the model's intrinsic pixel-level understanding. Thus, we introduce the Human-Like Mask Annotation Task (HLMAT), a new paradigm where MLLMs mimic human annotators using interactive segmentation tools. Modeling segmentation as a multi-step Markov Decision Process, HLMAT enables MLLMs to iteratively generate text-based click points, achieving high-quality masks without architectural changes or implicit tokens. Through this setup, we develop SegAgent, a model fine-tuned on human-like annotation trajectories, which achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods and supports additional tasks like mask refinement and annotation filtering. HLMAT provides a protocol for assessing fine-grained pixel understanding in MLLMs and introduces a vision-centric, multi-step decision-making task that facilitates exploration of MLLMs' visual reasoning abilities. Our adaptations of policy improvement method StaR and PRM-guided tree search further enhance model robustness in complex segmentation tasks, laying a foundation for future advancements in fine-grained visual perception and multi-step decision-making for MLLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR2...</summary><p>CVPR2025;Code will be released at \url{https://github.com/aim-uofa/SegAgent}</p></details> |

In order to handle these challenges, this work first proposes a novel concept, collaborative uncertainty (CU), which models the uncertainty resulting from interaction modules. Then we build a general CU-aware regression framework with an original permutation-equivariant uncertainty estimator to do both tasks of regression and uncertainty estimation. Further, we apply the proposed framework to current SOTA multi-agent multi-modal forecasting systems as a plugin module, which enables the SOTA systems to 1) estimate the uncertainty in the multi-agent multi-modal trajectory forecasting task; 2) rank the multiple predictions and select the optimal one based on the estimated uncertainty. We conduct extensive experiments on a synthetic dataset and two public large-scale multi-agent trajectory forecasting benchmarks. Experiments show that: 1) on the synthetic dataset, the CU-aware regression framework allows the model to appropriately approximate the ground-truth Laplace distribution; 2) on the multi-agent trajectory forecasting benchmarks, the CU-aware regression framework steadily helps SOTA systems improve their performances. Specially, the proposed framework helps VectorNet improve by 262 cm regarding the Final Displacement Error of the chosen optimal prediction on the nuScenes dataset; 3) for multi-agent multi-modal trajectory forecasting systems, prediction uncertainty is positively correlated with future stochasticity; and 4) the estimated CU values are highly related to the interactive information among agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2110.13947</p></details> |

In contrast, simple robotic grippers have low dexterity and fail to handle small objects effectively. This is why many automation tasks remain unsolved by robots. This paper presents an optimization-based framework for in-hand manipulation with a robotic hand equipped with compact Magnetic Tactile Sensors (MTSs). The small form factor of the robotic hand from Shadow Robot introduces challenges in estimating the state of the object while satisfying contact constraints. To address this, we formulate a trajectory optimization problem using Nonlinear Programming (NLP) for finger movements while ensuring contact points to change along the geometry of the fingers. Using the optimized trajectory from the solver, we implement and test an open-loop controller for rolling motion. To further enhance robustness and accuracy, we introduce a force controller for the fingers and a state estimator for the object utilizing MTSs. The proposed framework is validated through comparative experiments, showing that incorporating the force control with compliance consideration improves the accuracy and robustness of the rolling motion. Rolling an object with the force controller is 30\% more likely to succeed than running an open-loop controller.

Current OV-MOT methods typically rely primarily on instance-level detection and association, often overlooking trajectory information that is unique and essential for object tracking tasks. Utilizing trajectory information can enhance association stability and classification accuracy, especially in cases of occlusion and category ambiguity, thereby improving adaptability to novel classes. Thus motivated, in this paper we propose \textbf{TRACT}, an open-vocabulary tracker that leverages trajectory information to improve both object association and classification in OV-MOT. Specifically, we introduce a \textit{Trajectory Consistency Reinforcement} (\textbf{TCR}) strategy, that benefits tracking performance by improving target identity and category consistency. In addition, we present \textbf{TraCLIP}, a plug-and-play trajectory classification module. It integrates \textit{Trajectory Feature Aggregation} (\textbf{TFA}) and \textit{Trajectory Semantic Enrichment} (\textbf{TSE}) strategies to fully leverage trajectory information from visual and language perspectives for enhancing the classification results. Extensive experiments on OV-TAO show that our TRACT significantly improves tracking performance, highlighting trajectory information as a valuable asset for OV-MOT. Code will be released.</p></details> |  |

TRUST is a Python-based web application featuring an intuitive, reactive graphic user interface (GUI) built with web technologies. It can be accessed at https://trust.tgo.dev or installed locally, and supports both manual data entry and data file uploads. Leveraging the power of the Python backend and a JavaScript frontend, TRUST is designed to be highly user-friendly and accessible across desktop, laptop, tablet, and mobile devices. We apply TRUST to a set of physical benchmarks with unknown dynamics, ensuring either stability or safety properties across the four supported classes of models.</p></details> |  |

While motion capabilities and accurate localization for automated robots have rapidly developed, the challenge remains to generate efficient, smooth, comprehensive, and high-quality trajectories in these areas. In this paper, we propose a novel efficient planner for ground robots to autonomously navigate in large complex multi-layered architectural spaces. Considering that traversable regions typically include ground, slopes, and stairs, which are planar or nearly planar structures, we simplify the problem to navigation within and between complex intersecting planes. We first extract traversable planes from 3D point clouds through segmenting, merging, classifying, and connecting to build a plane-graph, which is lightweight but fully represents the traversable regions. We then build a trajectory optimization based on motion state trajectory and fully consider special constraints when crossing multi-layer planes to maximize the robot's maneuverability. We conduct experiments in simulated environments and test on a CubeTrack robot in real-world scenarios, validating the method's effectiveness and practicality.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 8 figures, 2tables.

Due to the inherent uncertainty in vessel behavior, trajectory prediction systems must adopt a multimodal approach to accurately model potential future motion states. However, existing vessel trajectory prediction methods lack the ability to comprehensively model behavioral multi-modality. To better capture multimodal behavior in interactive scenarios, we propose modeling interactions as dynamic graphs, replacing traditional aggregation-based techniques that rely on vessel states. By leveraging the natural multimodal capabilities of diffusion models, we frame the trajectory prediction task as an inverse process of motion uncertainty diffusion, wherein uncertainties across potential navigational areas are progressively eliminated until the desired trajectories is produced. In summary, we pioneer the integration of Spatio-Temporal Graph (STG) with diffusion models in ship trajectory prediction. Extensive experiments on real Automatic Identification System (AIS) data validate the superiority of our approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been ACCEPTED as a FULL PAPER at DASFAA 2025</p></details> |

Trajectory inference deals with the challenge of reconstructing continuous processes from such observations. In this work, we propose methods for B-spline approximation and interpolation of point clouds through consecutive averaging that is intrinsic to the Wasserstein space. Combining subdivision schemes with optimal transport-based geodesic, our methods carry out trajectory inference at a chosen level of precision and smoothness, and can automatically handle scenarios where particles undergo division over time. We prove linear convergence rates and rigorously evaluate our method on cell data characterized by bifurcations, merges, and trajectory splitting scenarios like $supercells$, comparing its performance against state-of-the-art trajectory inference and interpolation methods. The results not only underscore the effectiveness of our method in inferring trajectories but also highlight the benefit of performing interpolation and approximation that respect the inherent geometric properties of the data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Inter...</summary><p>International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Statistics (AISTATS 2025)</p></details> |

Ergodic trajectory optimization is an effective approach that generates coverage paths for problems related to robotic inspection, information gathering problems, and search and rescue. These optimization schemes compel the robot to spend time in a region proportional to the expected utility of visiting that region. Current methods for ergodic trajectory optimization rely on domain-specific knowledge, e.g., a defined utility map, and well-defined spatial basis functions to produce ergodic trajectories. Here, we present a generalization of ergodic trajectory optimization based on maximum mean discrepancy that requires only samples from the search domain. We demonstrate the ability of our approach to produce coverage trajectories on a variety of problem domains including robotic inspection of objects with differential kinematics constraints and on Lie groups without having access to domain specific knowledge. Furthermore, we show favorable computational scaling compared to existing state-of-the-art methods for ergodic trajectory optimization with a trade-off between domain specific knowledge and computational scaling, thus extending the versatility of ergodic coverage on a wider application domain.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages (excluding references), 1 table, 8 figures, submitted to ICRA 2025</p></details> |

Previous methods often struggle with content leakage and style misalignment, particularly when using image-driven approaches that aim to transfer precise styles. In this work, we introduce Trajectory Reset Attention Control (TRAC), a novel method that allows for high-quality style transfer while preserving content integrity. TRAC operates by resetting the denoising trajectory and enforcing attention control, thus enhancing content consistency while significantly reducing the computational costs against inversion-based methods. Additionally, a concept termed Style Medium is introduced to bridge the gap between content and style, enabling a more precise and harmonious transfer of stylistic elements. Building upon these concepts, we present a tuning-free framework that offers a stable, flexible, and efficient solution for both image and video style transfer. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed framework accommodates a wide range of stylized outputs, from precise content preservation to the production of visually striking results with vibrant and expressive styles.</p></details> |  |

To address these challenges, we propose Goal-driven and User-Informed Dynamic Estimation for pedestrian trajectory using Chain-of-Thought (GUIDE-CoT). Our approach integrates two innovative modules: (1) a goal-oriented visual prompt, which enhances goal prediction accuracy combining visual prompts with a pretrained visual encoder, and (2) a chain-of-thought (CoT) LLM for trajectory generation, which generates realistic trajectories toward the predicted goal. Moreover, our method introduces controllable trajectory generation, allowing for flexible and user-guided modifications to the predicted paths.

However, it remains a challenge to accurately account for agents' intentions and social behaviors when forecasting, and in particular, to simulate the unique randomness within each of those components in an explainable and decoupled way. Inspired by vibration systems and their resonance properties, we propose the Resonance (short for Re) model to encode and forecast pedestrian trajectories in the form of ``co-vibrations''. It decomposes trajectory modifications and randomnesses into multiple vibration portions to simulate agents' reactions to each single cause, and forecasts trajectories as the superposition of these independent vibrations separately. Also, benefiting from such vibrations and their spectral properties, representations of social interactions can be learned by emulating the resonance phenomena, further enhancing its explainability. Experiments on multiple datasets have verified its usefulness both quantitatively and qualitatively.</p></details> |  |

However, current research often overlooks the joint reasoning of scenario agents and lacks explainability in trajectory prediction models, limiting their practical use in real-world situations. To address this, we introduce the Explainable Conditional Diffusion-based Multimodal Trajectory Prediction (DMTP) model, which is designed to elucidate the environmental factors influencing predictions and reveal the underlying mechanisms. Our model integrates a modified conditional diffusion approach to capture multimodal trajectory patterns and employs a revised Shapley Value model to assess the significance of global and scenario-specific features. Experiments using the Waymo Open Motion Dataset demonstrate that our explainable model excels in identifying critical inputs and significantly outperforms baseline models in accuracy. Moreover, the factors identified align with the human driving experience, underscoring the model's effectiveness in learning accurate predictions.

When the GMM moments are estimated via finite samples, we develop a tight concentration bound to ensure the chance constraint with a desired confidence. Moreover, to limit the amount of constraint violation, we develop a Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) approach corresponding to the chance constraints and derive a tractable approximation for known and estimated GMM moments.

We propose a novel framework, RealTraj, that enhances the real-world applicability of trajectory forecasting. Our approach includes two training phases -- self-supervised pretraining on synthetic data and weakly-supervised fine-tuning with limited real-world data -- to minimize data collection efforts. To improve robustness to real-world errors, we focus on both model design and training objectives. Specifically, we present Det2TrajFormer, a trajectory forecasting model that remains invariant to tracking noise by using past detections as inputs. Additionally, we pretrain the model using multiple pretext tasks, which enhance robustness and improve forecasting performance based solely on detection data. Unlike previous trajectory forecasting methods, our approach fine-tunes the model using only ground-truth detections, reducing the need for costly person ID annotations. In the experiments, we comprehensively verify the effectiveness of the proposed method against the limitations, and the method outperforms state-of-the-art trajectory forecasting methods on multiple datasets.

Most ZS-ICL methods use large language models (LLMs) to generate (input, label) pairs as pseudo-demonstrations and leverage historical pseudo-demonstrations to help solve the current problem. They assume that problems are from the same task and traverse them in a random order. However, in real-world scenarios, problems usually come from diverse tasks, and only a few belong to the same task. The random traversing order may generate unreliable pseudo-demonstrations and lead to error accumulation. To address this problem, we reformulate ZS-ICL as a planning problem and propose a Demonstration-aware Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) approach (DAWN-ICL), which leverages MCTS to strategically plan the problem-solving trajectories for ZS-ICL. In addition, to achieve effective and efficient Q value estimation, we propose a novel demonstration-aware Q-value function and use it to enhance the selection phase and accelerate the expansion and simulation phases in MCTS. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of DAWN-ICL on in-domain and cross-domain scenarios, and it even outperforms ICL using human-annotated labels.

This work proposes the Fast and Safe Data-Driven Planner to address this challenge. Sparse Gaussian predictions are introduced to improve both the computational efficiency and accuracy of opponent predictions. Furthermore, the proposed approach employs a bi-level quadratic programming framework to generate an overtaking trajectory leveraging the opponent predictions. The first level uses polynomial fitting to generate a rough trajectory, from which reference states and control inputs are derived for the second level. The second level formulates a model predictive control optimization problem in the Frenet frame, generating a trajectory that satisfies both kinematic feasibility and safety. Experimental results on the F1TENTH platform show that our method outperforms the State-of-the-Art, achieving an 8.93% higher overtaking success rate, allowing the maximum opponent speed, ensuring a smoother ego trajectory, and reducing 74.04% computational time compared to the Predictive Spliner method.

Map-matching aligns noisy, sparsely sampled GPS trajectories with digital road maps to reconstruct accurate vehicle paths. Traditional methods rely on geometric proximity, topology, and shortest-path heuristics, but they overlook two key factors: (1) drivers may prefer routes based on local road characteristics rather than shortest paths, revealing learnable shared preferences, and (2) GPS noise varies spatially due to multipath effects. These factors can reduce the effectiveness of conventional methods in complex scenarios and increase the effort required for heuristic-based implementations. This study introduces a data-driven, deep learning-based map-matching framework, formulating the task as machine translation, inspired by NLP. Specifically, a transformer-based encoder-decoder model learns contextual representations of noisy GPS points to infer trajectory behavior and road structures in an end-to-end manner. Trained on large-scale trajectory data, the method improves path estimation accuracy. Experiments on synthetic trajectories show that this approach outperforms conventional methods by integrating contextual awareness. Evaluation on real-world GPS traces from Manhattan, New York, achieves 75% accuracy in reconstructing navigated routes. These results highlight the effectiveness of transformers in capturing drivers' trajectory behaviors, spatial dependencies, and noise patterns, offering a scalable, robust solution for map-matching. This work contributes to advancing trajectory-driven foundation models for geospatial modeling and urban mobility applications.</p></details> | 15 pages, 10 figures |

| **[Offline Safe Reinforcement Learning Using Trajectory Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15429v3)** | 2025-03-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Offline safe reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising approach for learning safe behaviors without engaging in risky online interactions with the environment. Most existing methods in offline safe RL rely on cost constraints at each time step (derived from global cost constraints) and this can result in either overly conservative policies or violation of safety constraints. In this paper, we propose to learn a policy that generates desirable trajectories and avoids undesirable trajectories. To be specific, we first partition the pre-collected dataset of state-action trajectories into desirable and undesirable subsets. Intuitively, the desirable set contains high reward and safe trajectories, and undesirable set contains unsafe trajectories and low-reward safe trajectories. Second, we learn a policy that generates desirable trajectories and avoids undesirable trajectories, where (un)desirability scores are provided by a classifier learnt from the dataset of desirable and undesirable trajectories. This approach bypasses the computational complexity and stability issues of a min-max objective that is employed in existing methods. Theoretically, we also show our approach's strong connections to existing learning paradigms involving human feedback. Finally, we extensively evaluate our method using the DSRL benchmark for offline safe RL. Empirically, our method outperforms competitive baselines, achieving higher rewards and better constraint satisfaction across a wide variety of benchmark tasks.</p></details> | AAAI 2025 |

While multi-modal trajectory prediction models generate multiple plausible future paths with associated probabilities, effectively quantifying uncertainty remains an open problem. In this work, we propose a novel multi-modal trajectory prediction approach based on evidential deep learning that estimates both positional and mode probability uncertainty in real time. Our approach leverages a Normal Inverse Gamma distribution for positional uncertainty and a Dirichlet distribution for mode uncertainty. Unlike sampling-based methods, it infers both types of uncertainty in a single forward pass, significantly improving efficiency. Additionally, we experimented with uncertainty-driven importance sampling to improve training efficiency by prioritizing underrepresented high-uncertainty samples over redundant ones. We perform extensive evaluations of our method on the Argoverse 1 and Argoverse 2 datasets, demonstrating that it provides reliable uncertainty estimates while maintaining high trajectory prediction accuracy.</p></details> |  |

Such perturbations can lead to incorrect predictions of other agents' trajectories, potentially compromising the safety and efficiency of the ego-vehicle's decision-making process. Motivated by this challenge, we propose $\textit{Causal tRajecTory predICtion}$ $\textbf{(CRiTIC)}$, a novel model that utilizes a $\textit{Causal Discovery Network}$ to identify inter-agent causal relations over a window of past time steps. To incorporate discovered causal relationships, we propose a novel $\textit{Causal Attention Gating}$ mechanism to selectively filter information in the proposed Transformer-based architecture. We conduct extensive experiments on two autonomous driving benchmark datasets to evaluate the robustness of our model against non-causal perturbations and its generalization capacity. Our results indicate that the robustness of predictions can be improved by up to $\textbf{54%}$ without a significant detriment to prediction accuracy. Lastly, we demonstrate the superior domain generalizability of the proposed model, which achieves up to $\textbf{29%}$ improvement in cross-domain performance. These results underscore the potential of our model to enhance both robustness and generalization capacity for trajectory prediction in diverse autonomous driving domains.

| **[Quantifying and Modeling Driving Styles in Trajectory Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04994v1)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory forecasting has become a popular deep learning task due to its relevance for scenario simulation for autonomous driving. Specifically, trajectory forecasting predicts the trajectory of a short-horizon future for specific human drivers in a particular traffic scenario. Robust and accurate future predictions can enable autonomous driving planners to optimize for low-risk and predictable outcomes for human drivers around them. Although some work has been done to model driving style in planning and personalized autonomous polices, a gap exists in explicitly modeling human driving styles for trajectory forecasting of human behavior. Human driving style is most certainly a correlating factor to decision making, especially in edge-case scenarios where risk is nontrivial, as justified by the large amount of traffic psychology literature on risky driving. So far, the current real-world datasets for trajectory forecasting lack insight on the variety of represented driving styles. While the datasets may represent real-world distributions of driving styles, we posit that fringe driving style types may also be correlated with edge-case safety scenarios. In this work, we conduct analyses on existing real-world trajectory datasets for driving and dissect these works from the lens of driving styles, which is often intangible and non-standardized.</p></details> |  |

Recent research highlights the importance of environmental contexts (e.g., maps) and the "multi-modality" of trajectories, leading to increasingly complex model structures. However, real-world deployments require lightweight models that can quickly migrate and adapt to new environments. Additionally, the core motivations of road agents, referred to as their intentions, deserves further exploration. In this study, we advocate that understanding and reasoning road agents' intention plays a key role in trajectory prediction tasks, and the main challenge is that the concept of intention is fuzzy and abstract. To this end, we present INTENT, an efficient intention-guided trajectory prediction model that relies solely on information contained in the road agent's trajectory. Our model distinguishes itself from existing models in several key aspects: (i) We explicitly model road agents' intentions through contrastive clustering, accommodating the fuzziness and abstraction of human intention in their trajectories. (ii) The proposed INTENT is based solely on multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs), resulting in reduced training and inference time, making it very efficient and more suitable for real-world deployment. (iii) By leveraging estimated intentions and an innovative algorithm for transforming trajectory observations, we obtain more robust trajectory representations that lead to superior prediction accuracy. Extensive experiments on real-world trajectory datasets for pedestrians and autonomous vehicles demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of INTENT.</p></details> |  |

| **[A Data-Driven Aggressive Autonomous Racing Framework Utilizing Local Trajectory Planning with Velocity Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11570v3)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The development of autonomous driving has boosted the research on autonomous racing. However, existing local trajectory planning methods have difficulty planning trajectories with optimal velocity profiles at racetracks with sharp corners, thus weakening the performance of autonomous racing. To address this problem, we propose a local trajectory planning method that integrates Velocity Prediction based on Model Predictive Contouring Control (VPMPCC). The optimal parameters of VPMPCC are learned through Bayesian Optimization (BO) based on a proposed novel Objective Function adapted to Racing (OFR). Specifically, VPMPCC achieves velocity prediction by encoding the racetrack as a reference velocity profile and incorporating it into the optimization problem. This method optimizes the velocity profile of local trajectories, especially at corners with significant curvature. The proposed OFR balances racing performance with vehicle safety, ensuring safe and efficient BO training. In the simulation, the number of training iterations for OFR-based BO is reduced by 42.86% compared to the state-of-the-art method. The optimal simulation-trained parameters are then applied to a real-world F1TENTH vehicle without retraining.

| **[Pitch Plane Trajectory Tracking Control for Sounding Rockets via Adaptive Feedback Linearization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05285v2)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes a pitch plane trajectory tacking control solution for suborbital launch vehicles relying on adaptive feedback linearization. Initially, the 2D dynamics and kinematics for a single-engine, thrust-vector-controlled sounding rocket are obtained for control design purposes. Then, an inner-outer control strategy, which simultaneously tackles attitude and position control, is adopted, with the inner-loop comprising the altitude and pitch control and the outer-loop addressing the horizontal (downrange) position control. Feedback linearization is used to cancel out the non-linearities in both the inner and outer dynamics. Making use of Lyapunov stability theory, an adaptation law, which provides online estimates on the inner-loop aerodynamic uncertainty, is jointly designed with the output tracking controller via adaptive backstepping, ensuring global reference tracking in the region where the feedback linearization is well-defined. The zero dynamics of the inner-stabilized system are then exploited to obtain the outerloop dynamics and derive a Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) with integral action, which can stabilize them as well as reject external disturbances. In the outermost loop, the estimate on the correspondent aerodynamic uncertainty is indirectly obtained by using the inner loop estimates together with known aerodynamics relations. The resulting inner-outer position control solution is proven to be asymptotically stable in the region of interest. Using a single-stage sounding rocket, propelled by a liquid engine, as reference vehicle, different mission scenarios are tested in a simulation environment to verify the adaptability of the proposed control strategy. The system is able to track the requested trajectories while rejecting external wind disturbances. Furthermore, the need to re-tune the control gains in between different mission scenarios is minimal to none.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper presented at the IEEE Aerospace Conference 2025.

| **[Simulation-based Analysis Of Highway Trajectory Planning Using High-Order Polynomial For Highly Automated Driving Function](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04159v1)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One of the fundamental tasks of autonomous driving is safe trajectory planning, the task of deciding where the vehicle needs to drive, while avoiding obstacles, obeying safety rules, and respecting the fundamental limits of road. Real-world application of such a method involves consideration of surrounding environment conditions and movements such as Lane Change, collision avoidance, and lane merge. The focus of the paper is to develop and implement safe collision free highway Lane Change trajectory using high order polynomial for Highly Automated Driving Function (HADF). Planning is often considered as a higher-level process than control. Behavior Planning Module (BPM) is designed that plans the high-level driving actions like Lane Change maneuver to safely achieve the functionality of transverse guidance ensuring safety of the vehicle using motion planning in a scenario including environmental situation. Based on the recommendation received from the (BPM), the function will generate a desire corresponding trajectory. The proposed planning system is situation specific with polynomial based algorithm for same direction two lane highway scenario. To support the trajectory system polynomial curve can be used to reduces overall complexity and thereby allows rapid computation. The proposed Lane Change scenario is modeled, and results has been analyzed (verified and validate) through the MATLAB simulation environment. The method proposed in this paper has achieved a significant improvement in safety and stability of Lane Changing maneuver.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Pixels to Trajectory: Universal Adversarial Example Detection via Temporal Imprints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04853v1)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For the first time, we unveil discernible temporal (or historical) trajectory imprints resulting from adversarial example (AE) attacks. Standing in contrast to existing studies all focusing on spatial (or static) imprints within the targeted underlying victim models, we present a fresh temporal paradigm for understanding these attacks. Of paramount discovery is that these imprints are encapsulated within a single loss metric, spanning universally across diverse tasks such as classification and regression, and modalities including image, text, and audio. Recognizing the distinct nature of loss between adversarial and clean examples, we exploit this temporal imprint for AE detection by proposing TRAIT (TRaceable Adversarial temporal trajectory ImprinTs). TRAIT operates under minimal assumptions without prior knowledge of attacks, thereby framing the detection challenge as a one-class classification problem. However, detecting AEs is still challenged by significant overlaps between the constructed synthetic losses of adversarial and clean examples due to the absence of ground truth for incoming inputs. TRAIT addresses this challenge by converting the synthetic loss into a spectrum signature, using the technique of Fast Fourier Transform to highlight the discrepancies, drawing inspiration from the temporal nature of the imprints, analogous to time-series signals. Across 12 AE attacks including SMACK (USENIX Sec'2023), TRAIT demonstrates consistent outstanding performance across comprehensively evaluated modalities, tasks, datasets, and model architectures. In all scenarios, TRAIT achieves an AE detection accuracy exceeding 97%, often around 99%, while maintaining a false rejection rate of 1%. TRAIT remains effective under the formulated strong adaptive attacks.</p></details> |  |

As the scale of DRL training increases, treating DRL policy network weights as a new data modality and exploring the potential becomes appealing and possible. In this work, we focus on the policy learning path in deep RL, represented by the trajectory of network weights of historical policies, which reflects the evolvement of the policy learning process. Taking the idea of trajectory modeling with Transformer, we propose Transformer as Implicit Policy Learner (TIPL), which processes policy network weights in an autoregressive manner. We collect the policy learning path data by running independent RL training trials, with which we then train our TIPL model. In the experiments, we demonstrate that TIPL is able to fit the implicit dynamics of policy learning and perform the optimization of policy network by inference.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as an extended abstract to ICLR 2025 Workshop on Weight Space Learning (WSL)</p></details> |
| **[Poisoning Attacks to Local Differential Privacy Protocols for Trajectory Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07483v1)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory data, which tracks movements through geographic locations, is crucial for improving real-world applications. However, collecting such sensitive data raises considerable privacy concerns. Local differential privacy (LDP) offers a solution by allowing individuals to locally perturb their trajectory data before sharing it. Despite its privacy benefits, LDP protocols are vulnerable to data poisoning attacks, where attackers inject fake data to manipulate aggregated results. In this work, we make the first attempt to analyze vulnerabilities in several representative LDP trajectory protocols. We propose \textsc{TraP}, a heuristic algorithm for data \underline{P}oisoning attacks using a prefix-suffix method to optimize fake \underline{Tra}jectory selection, significantly reducing computational complexity. Our experimental results demonstrate that our attack can substantially increase target pattern occurrences in the perturbed trajectory dataset with few fake users. This study underscores the urgent need for robust defenses and better protocol designs to safeguard LDP trajectory data against malicious manipulation.</p></details> |  |
| **[TR-LLM: Integrating Trajectory Data for Scene-Aware LLM-Based Human Action Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03993v3)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate prediction of human behavior is crucial for AI systems to effectively support real-world applications, such as autonomous robots anticipating and assisting with human tasks. Real-world scenarios frequently present challenges such as occlusions and incomplete scene observations, which can compromise predictive accuracy. Thus, traditional video-based methods often struggle due to limited temporal and spatial perspectives. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising alternative. Having been trained on a large text corpus describing human behaviors, LLMs likely encode plausible sequences of human actions in a home environment. However, LLMs, trained primarily on text data, lack inherent spatial awareness and real-time environmental perception. They struggle with understanding physical constraints and spatial geometry. Therefore, to be effective in a real-world spatial scenario, we propose a multimodal prediction framework that enhances LLM-based action prediction by integrating physical constraints derived from human trajectories. Our experiments demonstrate that combining LLM predictions with trajectory data significantly improves overall prediction performance. This enhancement is particularly notable in situations where the LLM receives limited scene information, highlighting the complementary nature of linguistic knowledge and physical constraints in understanding and anticipating human behavior.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reusing Historical Trajectories in Natural Policy Gradient via Importance Sampling: Convergence and Convergence Rate](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00675v2)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning provides a mathematical framework for learning-based control, whose success largely depends on the amount of data it can utilize. The efficient utilization of historical trajectories obtained from previous policies is essential for expediting policy optimization. Empirical evidence has shown that policy gradient methods based on importance sampling work well. However, existing literature often neglect the interdependence between trajectories from different iterations, and the good empirical performance lacks a rigorous theoretical justification. In this paper, we study a variant of the natural policy gradient method with reusing historical trajectories via importance sampling. We show that the bias of the proposed estimator of the gradient is asymptotically negligible, the resultant algorithm is convergent, and reusing past trajectories helps improve the convergence rate. We further apply the proposed estimator to popular policy optimization algorithms such as trust region policy optimization. Our theoretical results are verified on classical benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

The proposed method uses a Dynamic Buffered Voronoi Cell (DBVC) and a Dynamic Inter-Visibility Cell (DIVC) to formulate the distributed trajectory generation. Specifically, the DBVC and the DIVC are time-variant spaces that prevent mutual collisions and occlusions among agents, while enabling them to maintain suitable distances from the moving target. We combine the DBVC and the DIVC with an efficient Bernstein polynomial motion primitive-based tracking generation method, which has been refined into a less conservative approach than in our previous work. The proposed algorithm can compute each agent's trajectory within several milliseconds on an Intel i7 desktop. We validate the tracking performance in challenging scenarios, including environments with dozens of obstacles.</p></details> | 8 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Unified Human Localization and Trajectory Prediction with Monocular Vision](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03535v1)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conventional human trajectory prediction models rely on clean curated data, requiring specialized equipment or manual labeling, which is often impractical for robotic applications. The existing predictors tend to overfit to clean observation affecting their robustness when used with noisy inputs. In this work, we propose MonoTransmotion (MT), a Transformer-based framework that uses only a monocular camera to jointly solve localization and prediction tasks. Our framework has two main modules: Bird's Eye View (BEV) localization and trajectory prediction. The BEV localization module estimates the position of a person using 2D human poses, enhanced by a novel directional loss for smoother sequential localizations. The trajectory prediction module predicts future motion from these estimates. We show that by jointly training both tasks with our unified framework, our method is more robust in real-world scenarios made of noisy inputs. We validate our MT network on both curated and non-curated datasets. On the curated dataset, MT achieves around 12% improvement over baseline models on BEV localization and trajectory prediction. On real-world non-curated dataset, experimental results indicate that MT maintains similar performance levels, highlighting its robustness and generalization capability.

| **[Coordinated Trajectories for Non-stop Flying Carriers Holding a Cable-Suspended Load](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03481v1)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multirotor UAVs have been typically considered for aerial manipulation, but their scarce endurance prevents long-lasting manipulation tasks. This work demonstrates that the non-stop flights of three or more carriers are compatible with holding a constant pose of a cable-suspended load, thus potentially enabling aerial manipulation with energy-efficient non-stop carriers. It also presents an algorithm for generating the coordinated non-stop trajectories. The proposed method builds upon two pillars: (1)~the choice of $n$ special linearly independent directions of internal forces within the $3n-6$-dimensional nullspace of the grasp matrix of the load, chosen as the edges of a Hamiltonian cycle on the graph that connects the cable attachment points on the load. Adjacent pairs of directions are used to generate $n$ forces evolving on distinct 2D affine subspaces, despite the attachment points being generically in 3D; (2)~the construction of elliptical trajectories within these subspaces by mapping, through appropriate graph coloring, each edge of the Hamiltonian cycle to a periodic coordinate while ensuring that no adjacent coordinates exhibit simultaneous zero derivatives. Combined with conditions for load statics and attachment point positions, these choices ensure that each of the $n$ force trajectories projects onto the corresponding cable constraint sphere with non-zero tangential velocity, enabling perpetual motion of the carriers while the load is still. The theoretical findings are validated through simulations and laboratory experiments with non-stopping multirotor UAVs.</p></details> |  |

For the overall system dynamics, a two-degrees-of-freedom (2-DOF) vehicle model is established and a two-point preview driver model is adopted. A dynamic authority allocation strategy based on cooperation level is proposed to combine the steering input of the human driver and the automatic controller. To make further improvements in the controller design, three main contributions are put forward. Firstly, the CNF controller is designed for trajectory tracking control with refined transient performance. Besides, the self-triggered rule is applied such that the system will update in discrete times to save computing resources and increase efficiency. Moreover, by introducing the data-based ADP algorithm, the optimal control problem can be solved through iteration using system input and output information, reducing the need for accurate knowledge of system dynamics. The effectiveness of the proposed control method is validated through Carsim-Simulink co-simulations in diverse driving scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics (12 pages)</p></details> |

The Volterra kernel is singular and given by $K(u)=c u^{\alpha-1/2} \mathbb{1}_{u>0}$ with $\alpha \in (0,1/2)$. It is assumed that the diffusion coefficient is proportional to $\varepsilon \to 0$. From an observation of the path $(X^\varepsilon_s)_{s\in[0,T]}$, we construct a Trajectory Fitting Estimator, which is shown to be consistent and asymptotically normal. We also specify identifiability conditions insuring the $L^p$ convergence of the estimator.</p></details> |  |
| **[SEAL: Safety Enhanced Trajectory Planning and Control Framework for Quadrotor Flight in Complex Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03346v1)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For quadrotors, achieving safe and autonomous flight in complex environments with wind disturbances and dynamic obstacles still faces significant challenges. Most existing methods address wind disturbances in either trajectory planning or control, which may lead to hazardous situations during flight. The emergence of dynamic obstacles would further worsen the situation. Therefore, we propose an efficient and reliable framework for quadrotors that incorporates wind disturbance estimations during both the planning and control phases via a generalized proportional integral observer. First, we develop a real-time adaptive spatial-temporal trajectory planner that utilizes Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability analysis for error dynamics resulting from wind disturbances. By considering the forward reachability sets propagation on an Euclidean Signed Distance Field (ESDF) map, safety is guaranteed. Additionally, a Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) controller considering wind disturbance compensation is implemented for robust trajectory tracking. Simulation and real-world experiments verify the effectiveness of our framework. The video and supplementary material will be available at https://github.com/Ma29-HIT/SEAL/.</p></details> |  |

To guarantee safety and prevent collisions, autonomous vehicles must be capable of accurately predicting the trajectories of surrounding traffic agents. Over the past decade, significant efforts from both academia and industry have been dedicated to designing solutions for precise trajectory forecasting. These efforts have produced a diverse range of approaches, raising questions about the differences between these methods and whether trajectory prediction challenges have been fully addressed. This paper reviews a substantial portion of recent trajectory prediction methods and devises a taxonomy to classify existing solutions. A general overview of the prediction pipeline is also provided, covering input and output modalities, modeling features, and prediction paradigms discussed in the literature. In addition, the paper discusses active research areas within trajectory prediction, addresses the posed research questions, and highlights the remaining research gaps and challenges.</p></details> |  |

Currently, the inherent trade-off between constraint compliance and computational efficiency enhancement in UAV trajectory optimization problems has not been sufficiently addressed. To enhance the performance of UAV trajectory optimization, we propose a spatial-temporal iterative optimization framework. Firstly, B-splines are utilized to represent UAV trajectories, with rigorous safety assurance achieved through strict enforcement of constraints on control points. Subsequently, a set of QP-LP subproblems via spatial-temporal decoupling and constraint linearization is derived. Finally, an iterative optimization strategy incorporating guidance gradients is employed to obtain high-performance UAV trajectories in different scenarios. Both simulation and real-world experimental results validate the efficiency and high-performance of the proposed optimization framework in generating safe and fast trajectories.

While recent learning-based methods, particularly reinforcement learning (RL), have shown promise in specific scenarios, RL planners struggle with training inefficiencies and managing large-scale, real-world driving scenarios. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{CarPlanner}, a \textbf{C}onsistent \textbf{a}uto-\textbf{r}egressive \textbf{Planner} that uses RL to generate multi-modal trajectories. The auto-regressive structure enables efficient large-scale RL training, while the incorporation of consistency ensures stable policy learning by maintaining coherent temporal consistency across time steps. Moreover, CarPlanner employs a generation-selection framework with an expert-guided reward function and an invariant-view module, simplifying RL training and enhancing policy performance. Extensive analysis demonstrates that our proposed RL framework effectively addresses the challenges of training efficiency and performance enhancement, positioning CarPlanner as a promising solution for trajectory planning in autonomous driving. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to demonstrate that the RL-based planner can surpass both IL- and rule-based state-of-the-arts (SOTAs) on the challenging large-scale real-world dataset nuPlan. Our proposed CarPlanner surpasses RL-, IL-, and rule-based SOTA approaches within this demanding dataset.</p></details> | CVPR 2025 |

Existing approaches either rely on heuristics for instantaneous foothold selection--compromising safety and versatility--or solve expensive trajectory optimization problems with complex terrain features and long time horizons. In contrast, our framework leverages reactive synthesis to generate correct-by-construction controllers at the symbolic level, and mixed-integer convex programming (MICP) for dynamic and physically feasible footstep planning for each symbolic transition. We use a high-level manager to reduce the large state space in synthesis by incorporating local environment information, improving synthesis scalability. To handle specifications that cannot be met due to dynamic infeasibility, and to minimize costly MICP solves, we leverage a symbolic repair process to generate only necessary symbolic transitions. During online execution, re-running the MICP with real-world terrain data, along with runtime symbolic repair, bridges the gap between offline synthesis and online execution. We demonstrate, in simulation, our framework's capabilities to discover missing locomotion skills and react promptly in safety-critical environments, such as scattered stepping stones and rebars.</p></details> |  |

The neural representation of a set is used as the terminal set constraint for a model predictive control (MPC) local planner, resulting in improved recursive feasibility and safety. To achieve real-time performance and desired generalization properties, we employ the idea of hypernetworks. We use the Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability analysis as the source of supervision during the training process, allowing us to consider general nonlinear dynamics and arbitrary constraints. The proposed method is extensively evaluated against relevant baselines in simulations for different environments and robot dynamics. The results show a success rate increase of up to 52 \% compared to the best baseline while maintaining comparable execution speed. Additionally, we deploy our proposed method, NTC-MPC, on a physical robot and demonstrate its ability to safely avoid obstacles in scenarios where the baselines fail.</p></details> |  |

Numerical models, such as MEDSLIK-II, simulate advection, dispersion, and transformation processes of oil particles. However, simulations heavily rely on accurate parameter tuning, still based on expert knowledge and manual calibration. To overcome these limitations, we integrate the MEDSLIK-II numerical oil spill model with a Bayesian optimization framework to iteratively estimate the best physical parameter configuration that yields simulation closer to satellite observations of the slick. We focus on key parameters, such as horizontal diffusivity and drift factor, maximizing the Fraction Skill Score (FSS) as a measure of spatio-temporal overlap between simulated and observed oil distributions. We validate the framework for the Baniyas oil incident that occurred in Syria between August 23 and September 4, 2021, which released over 12,000 $m^3$ of oil. We show that, on average, the proposed approach systematically improves the FSS from 5.82% to 11.07% compared to control simulations initialized with default parameters. The optimization results in consistent improvement across multiple time steps, particularly during periods of increased drift variability, demonstrating the robustness of our method in dynamic environmental conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 10 figures, 3 tables, research paper</p></details> |

Trajectory optimization is a powerful and widely used algorithm in control, parameterized by a cost and a dynamics function. The key to our approach is to leverage the recent progress in differentiable trajectory optimization, which enables computing the gradients of the loss with respect to the parameters of trajectory optimization. As a result, the cost and dynamics functions of trajectory optimization can be learned end-to-end. DiffTORI addresses the ``objective mismatch'' issue of prior model-based RL algorithms, as the dynamics model in DiffTORI is learned to directly maximize task performance by differentiating the policy gradient loss through the trajectory optimization process. We further benchmark DiffTORI for imitation learning on standard robotic manipulation task suites with high-dimensional sensory observations and compare our method to feed-forward policy classes as well as Energy-Based Models (EBM) and Diffusion. Across 15 model-based RL tasks and 35 imitation learning tasks with high-dimensional image and point cloud inputs, DiffTORI outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods in both domains.

| **[Quantifying Point Contributions: A Lightweight Framework for Efficient and Effective Query-Driven Trajectory Simplification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02047v1)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As large volumes of trajectory data accumulate, simplifying trajectories to reduce storage and querying costs is increasingly studied. Existing proposals face three main problems. First, they require numerous iterations to decide which GPS points to delete. Second, they focus only on the relationships between neighboring points (local information) while neglecting the overall structure (global information), reducing the global similarity between the simplified and original trajectories and making it difficult to maintain consistency in query results, especially for similarity-based queries. Finally, they fail to differentiate the importance of points with similar features, leading to suboptimal selection of points to retain the original trajectory information. We propose MLSimp, a novel Mutual Learning query-driven trajectory simplification framework that integrates two distinct models: GNN-TS, based on graph neural networks, and Diff-TS, based on diffusion models. GNN-TS evaluates the importance of a point according to its globality, capturing its correlation with the entire trajectory, and its uniqueness, capturing its differences from neighboring points. It also incorporates attention mechanisms in the GNN layers, enabling simultaneous data integration from all points within the same trajectory and refining representations, thus avoiding iterative processes. Diff-TS generates amplified signals to enable the retention of the most important points at low compression rates. Experiments involving eight baselines on three databases show that MLSimp reduces the simplification time by 42%--70% and improves query accuracy over simplified trajectories by up to 34.6%.</p></details> | Accepted by VLDB2025 |
| **[Density estimation with LLMs: a geometric investigation of in-context learning trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05218v3)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable emergent abilities to perform in-context learning across various tasks, including time series forecasting. This work investigates LLMs' ability to estimate probability density functions (PDFs) from data observed in-context; such density estimation (DE) is a fundamental task underlying many probabilistic modeling problems. We leverage the Intensive Principal Component Analysis (InPCA) to visualize and analyze the in-context learning dynamics of LLaMA-2 models. Our main finding is that these LLMs all follow similar learning trajectories in a low-dimensional InPCA space, which are distinct from those of traditional density estimation methods like histograms and Gaussian kernel density estimation (KDE). We interpret the LLaMA in-context DE process as a KDE with an adaptive kernel width and shape. This custom kernel model captures a significant portion of LLaMA's behavior despite having only two parameters. We further speculate on why LLaMA's kernel width and shape differs from classical algorithms, providing insights into the mechanism of in-context probabilistic reasoning in LLMs. Our codebase, along with a 3D visualization of an LLM's in-context learning trajectory, is publicly available at https://github.com/AntonioLiu97/LLMICL_inPCA</p></details> |  |
| **[AgentTrek: Agent Trajectory Synthesis via Guiding Replay with Web Tutorials](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09605v2)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents can automate complex tasks across digital environments, but their development is hindered by the scarcity of high-quality trajectory data for training. Existing approaches rely on expensive human annotation, making them unsustainable at scale. We propose AgentTrek, a scalable data synthesis pipeline that generates web agent trajectories by leveraging publicly available tutorials. Our three-stage method: (1) automatically harvests and filters tutorial-like texts from the internet using a specialized classification model, (2) transforms these texts into structured task specifications with step-by-step instructions, and (3) employs a visual-language model (VLM) agent to execute these instructions in real environments, while a VLM-based evaluator verifies trajectory correctness. The synthesized trajectories encompass multiple modalities, including text-based HTML observations with function-calling API actions, and vision-based screenshot observations with pixel-level actions. This multimodal data, enriched with chain-of-thought reasoning, enables agents to achieve state-of-the-art performance on both textual web browsing benchmarks (e.g., WebArena) and visual web grounding and browsing benchmarks (e.g., ScreenSpot Web and Multimodal Mind2Web). Furthermore, our fully automated approach significantly reduces data collection costs, achieving a cost of just $0.55 per high-quality trajectory without human annotators. Our work demonstrates that guided replay using web tutorials is a practical and scalable strategy for training advanced GUI agents, paving the way for more capable and autonomous digital assistants.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR2...</summary><p>ICLR2025 Spotlight https://agenttrek.github.io</p></details> |
| **[Identifying User Goals from UI Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14314v3)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Identifying underlying user goals and intents has been recognized as valuable in various personalization-oriented settings, such as personalized agents, improved search responses, advertising, user analytics, and more. In this paper, we propose a new task goal identification from observed UI trajectories aiming to infer the user's detailed intentions when performing a task within UI environments. To support this task, we also introduce a novel evaluation methodology designed to assess whether two intent descriptions can be considered paraphrases within a specific UI environment. Furthermore, we demonstrate how this task can leverage datasets designed for the inverse problem of UI automation, utilizing Android and web datasets for our experiments. To benchmark this task, we compare the performance of humans and state-of-the-art models, specifically GPT-4 and Gemini-1.5 Pro, using our proposed metric. The results reveal that both Gemini and GPT underperform relative to human performance, underscoring the challenge of the proposed task and the significant room for improvement. This work highlights the importance of goal identification within UI trajectories, providing a foundation for further exploration and advancement in this area.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory-Class-Aware Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01440v1)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the context of multi-agent reinforcement learning, generalization is a challenge to solve various tasks that may require different joint policies or coordination without relying on policies specialized for each task. We refer to this type of problem as a multi-task, and we train agents to be versatile in this multi-task setting through a single training process. To address this challenge, we introduce TRajectory-class-Aware Multi-Agent reinforcement learning (TRAMA). In TRAMA, agents recognize a task type by identifying the class of trajectories they are experiencing through partial observations, and the agents use this trajectory awareness or prediction as additional information for action policy. To this end, we introduce three primary objectives in TRAMA: (a) constructing a quantized latent space to generate trajectory embeddings that reflect key similarities among them; (b) conducting trajectory clustering using these trajectory embeddings; and (c) building a trajectory-class-aware policy. Specifically for (c), we introduce a trajectory-class predictor that performs agent-wise predictions on the trajectory class; and we design a trajectory-class representation model for each trajectory class. Each agent takes actions based on this trajectory-class representation along with its partial observation for task-aware execution. The proposed method is evaluated on various tasks, including multi-task problems built upon StarCraft II. Empirical results show further performance improvements over state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICLR 2025</p></details> |
| **[GDTS: Goal-Guided Diffusion Model with Tree Sampling for Multi-Modal Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14922v3)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate prediction of pedestrian trajectories is crucial for improving the safety of autonomous driving. However, this task is generally nontrivial due to the inherent stochasticity of human motion, which naturally requires the predictor to generate multi-modal prediction. Previous works leverage various generative methods, such as GAN and VAE, for pedestrian trajectory prediction. Nevertheless, these methods may suffer from mode collapse and relatively low-quality results. The denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) has recently been applied to trajectory prediction due to its simple training process and powerful reconstruction ability. However, current diffusion-based methods do not fully utilize input information and usually require many denoising iterations that lead to a long inference time or an additional network for initialization. To address these challenges and facilitate the use of diffusion models in multi-modal trajectory prediction, we propose GDTS, a novel Goal-Guided Diffusion Model with Tree Sampling for multi-modal trajectory prediction. Considering the "goal-driven" characteristics of human motion, GDTS leverages goal estimation to guide the generation of the diffusion network. A two-stage tree sampling algorithm is presented, which leverages common features to reduce the inference time and improve accuracy for multi-modal prediction. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed framework achieves comparable state-of-the-art performance with real-time inference speed in public datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning to Learn Weight Generation via Trajectory Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01117v2)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion-based algorithms have emerged as promising techniques for weight generation, particularly in scenarios like multi-task learning that require frequent weight updates. However, existing solutions suffer from limited cross-task transferability. In addition, they only utilize optimal weights as training samples, ignoring the value of other weights in the optimization process. To address these issues, we propose Lt-Di, which integrates the diffusion algorithm with meta-learning to generate weights for unseen tasks. Furthermore, we extend the vanilla diffusion algorithm into a trajectory diffusion algorithm to utilize other weights along the optimization trajectory. Trajectory diffusion decomposes the entire diffusion chain into multiple shorter ones, improving training and inference efficiency. We analyze the convergence properties of the weight generation paradigm and improve convergence efficiency without additional time overhead. Our experiments demonstrate Lt-Di's higher accuracy while reducing computational overhead across various tasks, including zero-shot and few-shot learning, multi-domain generalization, and large-scale language model fine-tuning.Our code is released at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Lt-Di-0E51.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fast Finite-Time Sliding Mode Control for Chattering-Free Trajectory Tracking of Robotic Manipulators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16867v2)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Achieving precise and efficient trajectory tracking in robotic arms remains a key challenge due to system uncertainties and chattering effects in conventional sliding mode control (SMC). This paper presents a chattering-free fast terminal sliding mode control (FTSMC) strategy for a three-degree-of-freedom (3-DOF) robotic arm, designed to enhance tracking accuracy and robustness while ensuring finite-time convergence. The control framework is developed using Newton-Euler dynamics, followed by a state-space representation that captures the system's angular position and velocity. By incorporating an improved sliding surface and a Lyapunov-based stability analysis, the proposed FTSMC effectively mitigates chattering while preserving the advantages of SMC, such as fast response and strong disturbance rejection. The controller's performance is rigorously evaluated through comparisons with conventional PD sliding mode control (PDSMC) and terminal sliding mode control (TSMC). Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves superior trajectory tracking performance, faster convergence, and enhanced stability compared to existing methods, making it a promising solution for high-precision robotic applications.</p></details> |  |

However, extensive demonstrations are required for policy robustness and generalization. To reduce the demonstration reliance, we leverage spatial symmetry and propose ET-SEED, an efficient trajectory-level SE(3) equivariant diffusion model for generating action sequences in complex robot manipulation tasks. Further, previous equivariant diffusion models require the per-step equivariance in the Markov process, making it difficult to learn policy under such strong constraints. We theoretically extend equivariant Markov kernels and simplify the condition of equivariant diffusion process, thereby significantly improving training efficiency for trajectory-level SE(3) equivariant diffusion policy in an end-to-end manner. We evaluate ET-SEED on representative robotic manipulation tasks, involving rigid body, articulated and deformable object. Experiments demonstrate superior data efficiency and manipulation proficiency of our proposed method, as well as its ability to generalize to unseen configurations with only a few demonstrations.

Our proposal generalizes prior work by allowing the reference process in the Schr\"odinger Bridge problem to be a smooth Gaussian process, leading to more regular and interpretable trajectories in applications. Though na\"ively smoothing the reference process leads to a computationally intractable problem, we identify a class of processes (including the Mat\'ern processes) for which the resulting Smooth Schr\"odinger Bridge problem can be lifted to a simpler problem on phase space, which can be solved in polynomial time. We develop a practical approximation of this algorithm that outperforms existing methods on numerous simulated and real single-cell RNAseq datasets.

To further enhance temporal features, we introduce a Temporal Feature Enhancement Module, which integrates spectral features into temporal data using residual cross-attention. This enhanced temporal information is then employed for precise 3D trajectory estimation and classification.

In this paper, we present a solution for this problem using a novel drag-aware model formulation which is coupled with MPC, and therefore, enables tracking and landing during high-speed curvilinear trajectories of an USV without any communication. Compared to the state-of-the-art, our approach yields 40% decrease in prediction errors, and provides a 3-fold increase in certainty of predictions. Consequently, this leads to a 30% improvement in tracking performance and 40% higher success in landing on a moving USV even during aggressive turns that are unfeasible for conventional marine missions. We test our approach in two different real-world scenarios with marine vessels of two different sizes and further solidify our results through statistical analysis in simulation to demonstrate the robustness of our method.</p></details> |  |

To ensure safety, planners require reliable uncertainty estimates of the predicted behavior of surrounding agents, yet this aspect has received limited attention. In particular, decomposing uncertainty into its aleatoric and epistemic components is essential for distinguishing between inherent environmental randomness and model uncertainty, thereby enabling more robust and informed decision-making. This paper addresses the challenge of uncertainty modeling in trajectory prediction with a holistic approach that emphasizes uncertainty quantification, decomposition, and the impact of model composition. Our method, grounded in information theory, provides a theoretically principled way to measure uncertainty and decompose it into aleatoric and epistemic components. Unlike prior work, our approach is compatible with state-of-the-art motion predictors, allowing for broader applicability. We demonstrate its utility by conducting extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset, which shows how different architectures and configurations influence uncertainty quantification and model robustness.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures, submitted to International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS 2025)</p></details> |

Supervised deep learning methods provide accurate road segmentation in the domain of their training data but cannot be trusted in out-of-distribution scenarios. Including the whole distribution in the trainset is challenging as each sample must be labeled by hand. Trajectory-based self-supervised methods offer a potential solution as they can learn from the traversed route without manual labels. However, existing trajectory-based methods use learning schemes that rely only on the camera or only on the lidar. In this paper, trajectory-based learning is implemented jointly with lidar and camera for increased performance. Our method outperforms recent standalone camera- and lidar-based methods when evaluated with a challenging winter driving dataset including countryside and suburb driving scenes.

Previous studies aim to predict gaze trajectories when humans are free-viewing an image, searching for required targets, or looking for clues to answer questions in an image. While these tasks focus on visual-centric scenarios, humans move their gaze also along with audio signal inputs in more common scenarios. To fill this gap, we introduce a new task that predicts human gaze trajectories in a visual scene with synchronized audio inputs and provide a new dataset containing 20k gaze points from 8 subjects. To effectively integrate audio information and simulate the dynamic process of human gaze motion, we propose a novel learning framework called EyEar (Eye moving while Ear listening) based on physics-informed dynamics, which considers three key factors to predict gazes: eye inherent motion tendency, vision salient attraction, and audio semantic attraction. We also propose a probability density score to overcome the high individual variability of gaze trajectories, thereby improving the stabilization of optimization and the reliability of the evaluation. Experimental results show that EyEar outperforms all the baselines in the context of all evaluation metrics, thanks to the proposed components in the learning model.</p></details> |  |

Starting with a small number of embodiment-flexible human demonstrations collected in a virtual reality simulation environment, the pipeline refines these demonstrations using optimization-based kinematic retargeting and trajectory optimization to adapt them across various robot embodiments and physical parameters. This process yields a diverse, physically consistent dataset that enables cross-embodiment data transfer, and offers the potential to reuse legacy datasets collected under different hardware configurations or physical parameters. We validate the pipeline's effectiveness by training diffusion policies from the generated datasets for challenging contact-rich manipulation tasks across multiple robot embodiments, including a floating Allegro hand and bimanual robot arms. The trained policies are deployed zero-shot on hardware for bimanual iiwa arms, achieving high success rates with minimal human input.

This paper introduces the Trajectory-to-Action Pipeline (TAP), a scalable and automated method for extracting SDL labels from large trajectory datasets. TAP applies a rules-based cross-entropy optimization approach to learn parameters directly from data, enhancing generalization across diverse driving contexts. Using the Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD), TAP achieves 30% greater precision than Average Displacement Error (ADE) and 24% over Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) in identifying behaviorally similar trajectories. Additionally, TAP enables automated detection of unique driving behaviors, streamlining safety evaluation processes for AV testing.

However, the inherently dynamic nature of the heart imposes strict limits on acquisition times, making high-resolution T1 mapping a persistent challenge. Compressed sensing (CS) approaches have reduced scan durations by undersampling k-space and reconstructing images from partial data, and recent studies show that jointly optimizing the undersampling patterns with the reconstruction network can substantially improve performance. Still, most current T1 mapping pipelines rely on static, hand-crafted masks that do not exploit the full acceleration and accuracy potential. In this work, we introduce T1-PILOT: an end-to-end method that explicitly incorporates the T1 signal relaxation model into the sampling-reconstruction framework to guide the learning of non-Cartesian trajectories, crossframe alignment, and T1 decay estimation. Through extensive experiments on the CMRxRecon dataset, T1-PILOT significantly outperforms several baseline strategies (including learned single-mask and fixed radial or golden-angle sampling schemes), achieving higher T1 map fidelity at greater acceleration factors. In particular, we observe consistent gains in PSNR and VIF relative to existing methods, along with marked improvements in delineating finer myocardial structures. Our results highlight that optimizing sampling trajectories in tandem with the physical relaxation model leads to both enhanced quantitative accuracy and reduced acquisition times. Code for reproducing all results will be made publicly available upon publication.</p></details> |  |

Diseases evolve dynamically over time, and studying longitudinal observations of specific biomarkers can help to understand patients response to treatment and predict disease progression. We propose a novel iterative regression-based method to estimate changes in patients status within a cohort that includes censored patients, and illustrate it on clinical data from myeloma cases. We formulate the relapse time estimation problem in the framework of Piecewise Deterministic Markov processes (PDMP), where the Euclidean component is a surrogate biomarker for patient state. This approach enables continuous-time estimation of the status-change dates, which in turn allows for accurate inference of the relapse time distribution. A key challenge lies in the partial observability of the process, a complexity that has been rarely addressed in previous studies. . We evaluate the performance of our procedure through a simulation study and compare it with different approaches. This work is a proof of concept on biomarker trajectories with simple behaviour, but our method can easily be extended to more complex dynamics.</p></details> |  |

While generative models have shown promise in synthesizing feasible trajectories, they often fail to capture the nuanced variability of human driving styles due to dataset biases and distributional shifts. To address this, we introduce TrajHF, a human feedback-driven finetuning framework for generative trajectory models, designed to align motion planning with diverse driving preferences. TrajHF incorporates multi-conditional denoiser and reinforcement learning with human feedback to refine multi-modal trajectory generation beyond conventional imitation learning. This enables better alignment with human driving preferences while maintaining safety and feasibility constraints. TrajHF achieves PDMS of 93.95 on NavSim benchmark, significantly exceeding other methods. TrajHF sets a new paradigm for personalized and adaptable trajectory generation in autonomous driving.</p></details> | 10 pages, 5 figures |

In autonomous driving scenarios, there is rarely a single suitable trajectory. Recent methods have increasingly focused on modeling multimodal trajectory distributions. However, they suffer from trajectory selection complexity and reduced trajectory quality due to high trajectory divergence and inconsistencies between guidance and scene information. To address these issues, we introduce GoalFlow, a novel method that effectively constrains the generative process to produce high-quality, multimodal trajectories. To resolve the trajectory divergence problem inherent in diffusion-based methods, GoalFlow constrains the generated trajectories by introducing a goal point. GoalFlow establishes a novel scoring mechanism that selects the most appropriate goal point from the candidate points based on scene information. Furthermore, GoalFlow employs an efficient generative method, Flow Matching, to generate multimodal trajectories, and incorporates a refined scoring mechanism to select the optimal trajectory from the candidates. Our experimental results, validated on the Navsim\cite{Dauner2024_navsim}, demonstrate that GoalFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance, delivering robust multimodal trajectories for autonomous driving. GoalFlow achieved PDMS of 90.3, significantly surpassing other methods. Compared with other diffusion-policy-based methods, our approach requires only a single denoising step to obtain excellent performance.

Key operations such as conflict detection and resolution, aircraft anomaly monitoring, and the management of congested flight paths are increasingly reliant on this foundational technology, underscoring the urgent demand for intelligent solutions. The dynamics in airport terminal zones and crowded airspaces are intricate and ever-changing; however, current methodologies do not sufficiently account for the interactions among aircraft. To tackle these challenges, we propose DA-STGCN, an innovative spatiotemporal graph convolutional network that integrates a dual attention mechanism. Our model reconstructs the adjacency matrix through a self-attention approach, enhancing the capture of node correlations, and employs graph attention to distill spatiotemporal characteristics, thereby generating a probabilistic distribution of predicted trajectories. This novel adjacency matrix, reconstructed with the self-attention mechanism, is dynamically optimized throughout the network's training process, offering a more nuanced reflection of the inter-node relationships compared to traditional algorithms. The performance of the model is validated on two ADS-B datasets, one near the airport terminal area and the other in dense airspace. Experimental results demonstrate a notable improvement over current 4D trajectory prediction methods, achieving a 20% and 30% reduction in the Average Displacement Error (ADE) and Final Displacement Error (FDE), respectively. The incorporation of a Dual-Attention module has been shown to significantly enhance the extraction of node correlations, as verified by ablation experiments.</p></details> |  |

We propose a novel motion prediction conditional flow matching model, termed MoFlow, to predict K-shot future trajectories for all agents in a given scene. We design a novel flow matching loss function that not only ensures at least one of the $K$ sets of future trajectories is accurate but also encourages all $K$ sets of future trajectories to be diverse and plausible. Furthermore, by leveraging the implicit maximum likelihood estimation (IMLE), we propose a novel distillation method for flow models that only requires samples from the teacher model. Extensive experiments on the real-world datasets, including SportVU NBA games, ETH-UCY, and SDD, demonstrate that both our teacher flow model and the IMLE-distilled student model achieve state-of-the-art performance. These models can generate diverse trajectories that are physically and socially plausible. Moreover, our one-step student model is $\textbf{100}$ times faster than the teacher flow model during sampling.

To address this, we propose Loss Trajectory Correlation (LTC), a novel metric for coreset selection that identifies critical training samples driving generalization. $LTC$ quantifies the alignment between training sample loss trajectories and validation set loss trajectories, enabling the construction of compact, representative subsets. Unlike traditional methods with computational and storage overheads that are infeasible to scale to large datasets, $LTC$ achieves superior efficiency as it can be computed as a byproduct of training. Our results on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-1k show that $LTC$ consistently achieves accuracy on par with or surpassing state-of-the-art coreset selection methods, with any differences remaining under 1%. LTC also effectively transfers across various architectures, including ResNet, VGG, DenseNet, and Swin Transformer, with minimal performance degradation (<2%). Additionally, LTC offers insights into training dynamics, such as identifying aligned and conflicting sample behaviors, at a fraction of the computational cost of traditional methods. This framework paves the way for scalable coreset selection and efficient dataset optimization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Post-interactive Multimodal Trajectory Prediction for Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09366v1)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modeling the interactions among agents for trajectory prediction of autonomous driving has been challenging due to the inherent uncertainty in agents' behavior. The interactions involved in the predicted trajectories of agents, also called post-interactions, have rarely been considered in trajectory prediction models. To this end, we propose a coarse-to-fine Transformer for multimodal trajectory prediction, i.e., Pioformer, which explicitly extracts the post-interaction features to enhance the prediction accuracy. Specifically, we first build a Coarse Trajectory Network to generate coarse trajectories based on the observed trajectories and lane segments, in which the low-order interaction features are extracted with the graph neural networks. Next, we build a hypergraph neural network-based Trajectory Proposal Network to generate trajectory proposals, where the high-order interaction features are learned by the hypergraphs. Finally, the trajectory proposals are sent to the Proposal Refinement Network for further refinement. The observed trajectories and trajectory proposals are concatenated together as the inputs of the Proposal Refinement Network, in which the post-interaction features are learned by combining the previous interaction features and trajectory consistency features. Moreover, we propose a three-stage training scheme to facilitate the learning process. Extensive experiments on the Argoverse 1 dataset demonstrate the superiority of our method. Compared with the baseline HiVT-64, our model has reduced the prediction errors by 4.4%, 8.4%, 14.4%, 5.7% regarding metrics minADE6, minFDE6, MR6, and brier-minFDE6, respectively.</p></details> |  |

However, existing fault-tolerant control methods exhibit significant oscillations during docking and separation, impacting system stability. To address this issue, we propose a novel fault-tolerant control reallocation method that adapts to arbitrary number of modular robots and their assembly formations. The algorithm redistributes the expected collective force and torque required for MARS to individual unit according to their moment arm relative to the center of MARS mass. Furthermore, We propose an agile trajectory planning method for MARS of arbitrary configurations, which is collision-avoiding and dynamically feasible. Our work represents the first comprehensive approach to enable fault-tolerant and collision avoidance flight for MARS. We validate our method through extensive simulations, demonstrating improved fault tolerance, enhanced trajectory tracking accuracy, and greater robustness in cluttered environments.

| **[Learning Few-Step Diffusion Models by Trajectory Distribution Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06674v2)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accelerating diffusion model sampling is crucial for efficient AIGC deployment. While diffusion distillation methods -- based on distribution matching and trajectory matching -- reduce sampling to as few as one step, they fall short on complex tasks like text-to-image generation. Few-step generation offers a better balance between speed and quality, but existing approaches face a persistent trade-off: distribution matching lacks flexibility for multi-step sampling, while trajectory matching often yields suboptimal image quality. To bridge this gap, we propose learning few-step diffusion models by Trajectory Distribution Matching (TDM), a unified distillation paradigm that combines the strengths of distribution and trajectory matching. Our method introduces a data-free score distillation objective, aligning the student's trajectory with the teacher's at the distribution level. Further, we develop a sampling-steps-aware objective that decouples learning targets across different steps, enabling more adjustable sampling. This approach supports both deterministic sampling for superior image quality and flexible multi-step adaptation, achieving state-of-the-art performance with remarkable efficiency. Our model, TDM, outperforms existing methods on various backbones, such as SDXL and PixArt-$\alpha$, delivering superior quality and significantly reduced training costs. In particular, our method distills PixArt-$\alpha$ into a 4-step generator that outperforms its teacher on real user preference at 1024 resolution. This is accomplished with 500 iterations and 2 A800 hours -- a mere 0.01% of the teacher's training cost. In addition, our proposed TDM can be extended to accelerate text-to-video diffusion. Notably, TDM can outperform its teacher model (CogVideoX-2B) by using only 4 NFE on VBench, improving the total score from 80.91 to 81.65.

The world model that can foresee the outcome of the trajectory has been used to evaluate the end-to-end autonomous driving system. However, existing world models predominantly emphasize the trajectory of the ego vehicle and leave other vehicles uncontrollable. This limitation hinders their ability to realistically simulate the interaction between the ego vehicle and the driving scenario. In addition, it remains a challenge to match multiple trajectories with each vehicle in the video to control the video generation. To address above issues, a driving \textbf{W}orld \textbf{M}odel named EOT-WM is proposed in this paper, unifying \textbf{E}go-\textbf{O}ther vehicle \textbf{T}rajectories in videos. Specifically, we first project ego and other vehicle trajectories in the BEV space into the image coordinate to match each trajectory with its corresponding vehicle in the video. Then, trajectory videos are encoded by the Spatial-Temporal Variational Auto Encoder to align with driving video latents spatially and temporally in the unified visual space. A trajectory-injected diffusion Transformer is further designed to denoise the noisy video latents for video generation with the guidance of ego-other vehicle trajectories. In addition, we propose a metric based on control latent similarity to evaluate the controllability of trajectories. Extensive experiments are conducted on the nuScenes dataset, and the proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art method by 30\% in FID and 55\% in FVD. The model can also predict unseen driving scenes with self-produced trajectories.</p></details> | 8 pages, 7 figures |

While prior work established the worst case optimality of standard flow matching under Wasserstein distances, the theoretical guarantees for higher-order flow matching - which incorporates acceleration terms to refine sample trajectories - remain unexplored. In this paper, we bridge this gap by proving that higher-order flow matching preserves worst case optimality as a distribution estimator. We derive upper bounds on the estimation error for second-order flow matching, demonstrating that the convergence rates depend polynomially on the smoothness of the target distribution (quantified via Besov spaces) and key parameters of the ODE dynamics. Our analysis employs neural network approximations with carefully controlled depth, width, and sparsity to bound acceleration errors across both small and large time intervals, ultimately unifying these results into a general worst case optimal bound for all time steps.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2410.11261</p></details> |

In this paper, we present a novel framework for simultaneously designing trajectories of robots, objects, and contacts efficiently for contact-rich manipulation. We propose a hierarchical optimization framework where Mixed-Integer Linear Program (MILP) selects optimal contacts between robot \& object using approximate dynamical constraints, and then a NonLinear Program (NLP) optimizes trajectory of the robot(s) and object considering full nonlinear constraints. We present a convex relaxation of bilinear constraints using binary encoding technique such that MILP can provide tighter solutions with better computational complexity. The proposed framework is evaluated on various manipulation tasks where it can reason about complex multi-contact interactions while providing computational advantages.

Both these tasks are crucial for automation and assistance in endoscopy surgery. Given the safety-critical nature of these tasks, reliable uncertainty quantification is essential. Conformal prediction is a fast-growing and widely recognized framework for uncertainty estimation in machine learning and computer vision, offering distribution-free, theoretically valid prediction intervals. In this work, we explore the application of standard conformal prediction and conformalized quantile regression to estimate uncertainty in forecasting surgical instrument motion, i.e., predicting direction and magnitude of surgical instruments' future motion. We analyze and compare their coverage and interval sizes, assessing the impact of multiple hypothesis testing and correction methods. Additionally, we show how these techniques can be employed to produce useful uncertainty heatmaps. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study applying conformal prediction to surgical guidance, marking an initial step toward constructing principled prediction intervals with formal coverage guarantees in this domain.</p></details> |  |

This sampling method yields trajectory samples that are tightly clustered around a mean trajectory. This clustering behavior in turn, limits the exploration capability of the controller and reduces the likelihood of finding feasible solutions in complex environments. Recent work has attempted to address this problem by either reshaping the resulting trajectory distribution or increasing the sample entropy to enhance diversity and promote exploration. In our recent work, we introduced the concept of C-Uniform trajectory generation [1] which allows the computation of control input probabilities to generate trajectories that sample the configuration space uniformly. In this work, we first address the main limitation of this method: lack of scalability due to computational complexity. We introduce Neural C-Uniform, an unsupervised C-Uniform trajectory sampler that mitigates scalability issues by computing control input probabilities without relying on a discretized configuration space. Experiments show that Neural C-Uniform achieves a similar uniformity ratio to the original C-Uniform approach and generates trajectories over a longer time horizon while preserving uniformity. Next, we present CU-MPPI, which integrates Neural C-Uniform sampling into existing MPPI variants. We analyze the performance of CU-MPPI in simulation and real-world experiments. Our results indicate that in settings where the optimal solution has high curvature, CU-MPPI leads to drastic improvements in performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IROS2025</p></details> |

While learning-based prediction models have shown success in generating likely human trajectory predictions, integrating these stochastic models into a robot controller presents several challenges. The controller needs to account for interactive coupling between planned robot motion and human predictions while ensuring both predictions and robot actions are safe (i.e. collision-free). To address these challenges, we present a receding horizon crowd navigation method for single-robot multi-human environments. We first propose a diffusion model to generate joint trajectory predictions for all humans in the scene. We then incorporate these multi-modal predictions into a SICNav Bilevel MPC problem that simultaneously solves for a robot plan (upper-level) and acts as a safety filter to refine the predictions for non-collision (lower-level). Combining planning and prediction refinement into one bilevel problem ensures that the robot plan and human predictions are coupled. We validate the open-loop trajectory prediction performance of our diffusion model on the commonly used ETH/UCY benchmark and evaluate the closed-loop performance of our robot navigation method in simulation and extensive real-robot experiments demonstrating safe, efficient, and reactive robot motion.</p></details> |  |

With the rapid advancement in connected technologies, such as vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication, valuable information from alternate views becomes accessible via wireless networks. The integration of information from alternative views has the potential to overcome the inherent limitations associated with a single viewpoint, such as occlusions and limited field of view. In this work, we introduce V2INet, a novel trajectory prediction framework designed to model multi-view data by extending existing single-view models. Unlike previous approaches where the multi-view data is manually fused or formulated as a separate training stage, our model supports end-to-end training, enhancing both flexibility and performance. Moreover, the predicted multimodal trajectories are calibrated by a post-hoc conformal prediction module to get valid and efficient confidence regions. We evaluated the entire framework using the real-world V2I dataset V2X-Seq. Our results demonstrate superior performance in terms of Final Displacement Error (FDE) and Miss Rate (MR) using a single GPU.

Current evaluation tasks like VQA and visual grounding remain too coarse to assess fine-grained pixel comprehension accurately. Though segmentation is foundational for pixel-level understanding, existing methods often require MLLMs to generate implicit tokens, decoded through external pixel decoders. This approach disrupts the MLLM's text output space, potentially compromising language capabilities and reducing flexibility and extensibility, while failing to reflect the model's intrinsic pixel-level understanding. Thus, we introduce the Human-Like Mask Annotation Task (HLMAT), a new paradigm where MLLMs mimic human annotators using interactive segmentation tools. Modeling segmentation as a multi-step Markov Decision Process, HLMAT enables MLLMs to iteratively generate text-based click points, achieving high-quality masks without architectural changes or implicit tokens. Through this setup, we develop SegAgent, a model fine-tuned on human-like annotation trajectories, which achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods and supports additional tasks like mask refinement and annotation filtering. HLMAT provides a protocol for assessing fine-grained pixel understanding in MLLMs and introduces a vision-centric, multi-step decision-making task that facilitates exploration of MLLMs' visual reasoning abilities. Our adaptations of policy improvement method StaR and PRM-guided tree search further enhance model robustness in complex segmentation tasks, laying a foundation for future advancements in fine-grained visual perception and multi-step decision-making for MLLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR2...</summary><p>CVPR2025;Code will be released at \url{https://github.com/aim-uofa/SegAgent}</p></details> |
| **[Collaborative Uncertainty Benefits Multi-Agent Multi-Modal Trajectory Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.05195v2)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In multi-modal multi-agent trajectory forecasting, two major challenges have not been fully tackled: 1) how to measure the uncertainty brought by the interaction module that causes correlations among the predicted trajectories of multiple agents; 2) how to rank the multiple predictions and select the optimal predicted trajectory. In order to handle these challenges, this work first proposes a novel concept, collaborative uncertainty (CU), which models the uncertainty resulting from interaction modules. Then we build a general CU-aware regression framework with an original permutation-equivariant uncertainty estimator to do both tasks of regression and uncertainty estimation. Further, we apply the proposed framework to current SOTA multi-agent multi-modal forecasting systems as a plugin module, which enables the SOTA systems to 1) estimate the uncertainty in the multi-agent multi-modal trajectory forecasting task; 2) rank the multiple predictions and select the optimal one based on the estimated uncertainty. We conduct extensive experiments on a synthetic dataset and two public large-scale multi-agent trajectory forecasting benchmarks. Experiments show that: 1) on the synthetic dataset, the CU-aware regression framework allows the model to appropriately approximate the ground-truth Laplace distribution; 2) on the multi-agent trajectory forecasting benchmarks, the CU-aware regression framework steadily helps SOTA systems improve their performances. Specially, the proposed framework helps VectorNet improve by 262 cm regarding the Final Displacement Error of the chosen optimal prediction on the nuScenes dataset; 3) for multi-agent multi-modal trajectory forecasting systems, prediction uncertainty is positively correlated with future stochasticity; and 4) the estimated CU values are highly related to the interactive information among agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2110.13947</p></details> |

The deformability of garments leads to a vast state space and complex dynamics, which complicates precise and fine-grained manipulation.

In contrast, simple robotic grippers have low dexterity and fail to handle small objects effectively. This is why many automation tasks remain unsolved by robots. This paper presents an optimization-based framework for in-hand manipulation with a robotic hand equipped with compact Magnetic Tactile Sensors (MTSs). The small form factor of the robotic hand from Shadow Robot introduces challenges in estimating the state of the object while satisfying contact constraints. To address this, we formulate a trajectory optimization problem using Nonlinear Programming (NLP) for finger movements while ensuring contact points to change along the geometry of the fingers. Using the optimized trajectory from the solver, we implement and test an open-loop controller for rolling motion. To further enhance robustness and accuracy, we introduce a force controller for the fingers and a state estimator for the object utilizing MTSs. The proposed framework is validated through comparative experiments, showing that incorporating the force control with compliance consideration improves the accuracy and robustness of the rolling motion. Rolling an object with the force controller is 30\% more likely to succeed than running an open-loop controller.

Current OV-MOT methods typically rely primarily on instance-level detection and association, often overlooking trajectory information that is unique and essential for object tracking tasks. Utilizing trajectory information can enhance association stability and classification accuracy, especially in cases of occlusion and category ambiguity, thereby improving adaptability to novel classes. Thus motivated, in this paper we propose \textbf{TRACT}, an open-vocabulary tracker that leverages trajectory information to improve both object association and classification in OV-MOT. Specifically, we introduce a \textit{Trajectory Consistency Reinforcement} (\textbf{TCR}) strategy, that benefits tracking performance by improving target identity and category consistency. In addition, we present \textbf{TraCLIP}, a plug-and-play trajectory classification module. It integrates \textit{Trajectory Feature Aggregation} (\textbf{TFA}) and \textit{Trajectory Semantic Enrichment} (\textbf{TSE}) strategies to fully leverage trajectory information from visual and language perspectives for enhancing the classification results. Extensive experiments on OV-TAO show that our TRACT significantly improves tracking performance, highlighting trajectory information as a valuable asset for OV-MOT.

By collecting only a single input-state trajectory from the unknown system and satisfying a rank condition that ensures the system is persistently excited according to the Willems et al.'s fundamental lemma, TRUST aims to design either control Lyapunov functions (CLF) or control barrier certificates (CBC), along with their corresponding stability or safety controllers. The tool implements sum-of-squares (SOS) optimization programs solely based on data to enforce stability or safety properties across four system classes: (i) continuous-time nonlinear polynomial systems, (ii) continuous-time linear systems, (iii) discrete-time nonlinear polynomial systems, and (iv) discrete-time linear systems. TRUST is a Python-based web application featuring an intuitive, reactive graphic user interface (GUI) built with web technologies.

While motion capabilities and accurate localization for automated robots have rapidly developed, the challenge remains to generate efficient, smooth, comprehensive, and high-quality trajectories in these areas. In this paper, we propose a novel efficient planner for ground robots to autonomously navigate in large complex multi-layered architectural spaces. Considering that traversable regions typically include ground, slopes, and stairs, which are planar or nearly planar structures, we simplify the problem to navigation within and between complex intersecting planes. We first extract traversable planes from 3D point clouds through segmenting, merging, classifying, and connecting to build a plane-graph, which is lightweight but fully represents the traversable regions. We then build a trajectory optimization based on motion state trajectory and fully consider special constraints when crossing multi-layer planes to maximize the robot's maneuverability. We conduct experiments in simulated environments and test on a CubeTrack robot in real-world scenarios, validating the method's effectiveness and practicality.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 8 figures, 2tables.

Due to the inherent uncertainty in vessel behavior, trajectory prediction systems must adopt a multimodal approach to accurately model potential future motion states. However, existing vessel trajectory prediction methods lack the ability to comprehensively model behavioral multi-modality. To better capture multimodal behavior in interactive scenarios, we propose modeling interactions as dynamic graphs, replacing traditional aggregation-based techniques that rely on vessel states. By leveraging the natural multimodal capabilities of diffusion models, we frame the trajectory prediction task as an inverse process of motion uncertainty diffusion, wherein uncertainties across potential navigational areas are progressively eliminated until the desired trajectories is produced. In summary, we pioneer the integration of Spatio-Temporal Graph (STG) with diffusion models in ship trajectory prediction.

Ergodic trajectory optimization is an effective approach that generates coverage paths for problems related to robotic inspection, information gathering problems, and search and rescue. These optimization schemes compel the robot to spend time in a region proportional to the expected utility of visiting that region. Current methods for ergodic trajectory optimization rely on domain-specific knowledge, e.g., a defined utility map, and well-defined spatial basis functions to produce ergodic trajectories. Here, we present a generalization of ergodic trajectory optimization based on maximum mean discrepancy that requires only samples from the search domain. We demonstrate the ability of our approach to produce coverage trajectories on a variety of problem domains including robotic inspection of objects with differential kinematics constraints and on Lie groups without having access to domain specific knowledge. Furthermore, we show favorable computational scaling compared to existing state-of-the-art methods for ergodic trajectory optimization with a trade-off between domain specific knowledge and computational scaling, thus extending the versatility of ergodic coverage on a wider application domain.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages (excluding references), 1 table, 8 figures, submitted to ICRA 2025</p></details> |

Previous methods often struggle with content leakage and style misalignment, particularly when using image-driven approaches that aim to transfer precise styles. In this work, we introduce Trajectory Reset Attention Control (TRAC), a novel method that allows for high-quality style transfer while preserving content integrity. TRAC operates by resetting the denoising trajectory and enforcing attention control, thus enhancing content consistency while significantly reducing the computational costs against inversion-based methods. Additionally, a concept termed Style Medium is introduced to bridge the gap between content and style, enabling a more precise and harmonious transfer of stylistic elements. Building upon these concepts, we present a tuning-free framework that offers a stable, flexible, and efficient solution for both image and video style transfer. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed framework accommodates a wide range of stylized outputs, from precise content preservation to the production of visually striking results with vibrant and expressive styles.</p></details> |  |

However, it remains a challenge to accurately account for agents' intentions and social behaviors when forecasting, and in particular, to simulate the unique randomness within each of those components in an explainable and decoupled way. Inspired by vibration systems and their resonance properties, we propose the Resonance (short for Re) model to encode and forecast pedestrian trajectories in the form of ``co-vibrations''. It decomposes trajectory modifications and randomnesses into multiple vibration portions to simulate agents' reactions to each single cause, and forecasts trajectories as the superposition of these independent vibrations separately. Also, benefiting from such vibrations and their spectral properties, representations of social interactions can be learned by emulating the resonance phenomena, further enhancing its explainability. Experiments on multiple datasets have verified its usefulness both quantitatively and qualitatively.</p></details> |  |

Our approach includes two training phases -- self-supervised pretraining on synthetic data and weakly-supervised fine-tuning with limited real-world data -- to minimize data collection efforts. To improve robustness to real-world errors, we focus on both model design and training objectives. Specifically, we present Det2TrajFormer, a trajectory forecasting model that remains invariant to tracking noise by using past detections as inputs. Additionally, we pretrain the model using multiple pretext tasks, which enhance robustness and improve forecasting performance based solely on detection data. Unlike previous trajectory forecasting methods, our approach fine-tunes the model using only ground-truth detections, reducing the need for costly person ID annotations. In the experiments, we comprehensively verify the effectiveness of the proposed method against the limitations, and the method outperforms state-of-the-art trajectory forecasting methods on multiple datasets. The code will be released at https://fujiry0.github.io/RealTraj-project-page.</p></details> |  |

Most ZS-ICL methods use large language models (LLMs) to generate (input, label) pairs as pseudo-demonstrations and leverage historical pseudo-demonstrations to help solve the current problem. They assume that problems are from the same task and traverse them in a random order. However, in real-world scenarios, problems usually come from diverse tasks, and only a few belong to the same task. The random traversing order may generate unreliable pseudo-demonstrations and lead to error accumulation. To address this problem, we reformulate ZS-ICL as a planning problem and propose a Demonstration-aware Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) approach (DAWN-ICL), which leverages MCTS to strategically plan the problem-solving trajectories for ZS-ICL. In addition, to achieve effective and efficient Q value estimation, we propose a novel demonstration-aware Q-value function and use it to enhance the selection phase and accelerate the expansion and simulation phases in MCTS. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of DAWN-ICL on in-domain and cross-domain scenarios, and it even outperforms ICL using human-annotated labels.

This work proposes the Fast and Safe Data-Driven Planner to address this challenge. Sparse Gaussian predictions are introduced to improve both the computational efficiency and accuracy of opponent predictions. Furthermore, the proposed approach employs a bi-level quadratic programming framework to generate an overtaking trajectory leveraging the opponent predictions. The first level uses polynomial fitting to generate a rough trajectory, from which reference states and control inputs are derived for the second level. The second level formulates a model predictive control optimization problem in the Frenet frame, generating a trajectory that satisfies both kinematic feasibility and safety. Experimental results on the F1TENTH platform show that our method outperforms the State-of-the-Art, achieving an 8.93% higher overtaking success rate, allowing the maximum opponent speed, ensuring a smoother ego trajectory, and reducing 74.04% computational time compared to the Predictive Spliner method.

Map-matching aligns noisy, sparsely sampled GPS trajectories with digital road maps to reconstruct accurate vehicle paths. Traditional methods rely on geometric proximity, topology, and shortest-path heuristics, but they overlook two key factors: (1) drivers may prefer routes based on local road characteristics rather than shortest paths, revealing learnable shared preferences, and (2) GPS noise varies spatially due to multipath effects. These factors can reduce the effectiveness of conventional methods in complex scenarios and increase the effort required for heuristic-based implementations. This study introduces a data-driven, deep learning-based map-matching framework, formulating the task as machine translation, inspired by NLP. Specifically, a transformer-based encoder-decoder model learns contextual representations of noisy GPS points to infer trajectory behavior and road structures in an end-to-end manner. Trained on large-scale trajectory data, the method improves path estimation accuracy. Experiments on synthetic trajectories show that this approach outperforms conventional methods by integrating contextual awareness. Evaluation on real-world GPS traces from Manhattan, New York, achieves 75% accuracy in reconstructing navigated routes. These results highlight the effectiveness of transformers in capturing drivers' trajectory behaviors, spatial dependencies, and noise patterns, offering a scalable, robust solution for map-matching. This work contributes to advancing trajectory-driven foundation models for geospatial modeling and urban mobility applications.</p></details> | 15 pages, 10 figures |

In this paper, inspired by topological planning, we propose a differentiable local homotopy invariant metric to model the interactions. By incorporating this topological metric as a constraint into multi-vehicle trajectory optimization, our framework is capable of generating multiple interactive trajectories from the same initial values, achieving controllable interactions as well as supporting user-designed interaction patterns. Extensive experiments demonstrate its superior optimality and efficiency over existing methods. We will release open-source code to advance relative research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Offline Safe Reinforcement Learning Using Trajectory Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15429v3)** | 2025-03-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Offline safe reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising approach for learning safe behaviors without engaging in risky online interactions with the environment. Most existing methods in offline safe RL rely on cost constraints at each time step (derived from global cost constraints) and this can result in either overly conservative policies or violation of safety constraints. In this paper, we propose to learn a policy that generates desirable trajectories and avoids undesirable trajectories. To be specific, we first partition the pre-collected dataset of state-action trajectories into desirable and undesirable subsets. Intuitively, the desirable set contains high reward and safe trajectories, and undesirable set contains unsafe trajectories and low-reward safe trajectories. Second, we learn a policy that generates desirable trajectories and avoids undesirable trajectories, where (un)desirability scores are provided by a classifier learnt from the dataset of desirable and undesirable trajectories. This approach bypasses the computational complexity and stability issues of a min-max objective that is employed in existing methods. Theoretically, we also show our approach's strong connections to existing learning paradigms involving human feedback. Finally, we extensively evaluate our method using the DSRL benchmark for offline safe RL. Empirically, our method outperforms competitive baselines, achieving higher rewards and better constraint satisfaction across a wide variety of benchmark tasks.</p></details> | AAAI 2025 |
| **[Evidential Uncertainty Estimation for Multi-Modal Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05274v1)** | 2025-03-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate trajectory prediction is crucial for autonomous driving, yet uncertainty in agent behavior and perception noise makes it inherently challenging. While multi-modal trajectory prediction models generate multiple plausible future paths with associated probabilities, effectively quantifying uncertainty remains an open problem. In this work, we propose a novel multi-modal trajectory prediction approach based on evidential deep learning that estimates both positional and mode probability uncertainty in real time. Our approach leverages a Normal Inverse Gamma distribution for positional uncertainty and a Dirichlet distribution for mode uncertainty. Unlike sampling-based methods, it infers both types of uncertainty in a single forward pass, significantly improving efficiency. Additionally, we experimented with uncertainty-driven importance sampling to improve training efficiency by prioritizing underrepresented high-uncertainty samples over redundant ones. We perform extensive evaluations of our method on the Argoverse 1 and Argoverse 2 datasets, demonstrating that it provides reliable uncertainty estimates while maintaining high trajectory prediction accuracy.</p></details> |  |

While diffusion models have shown promise in planning, they are limited to solving tasks similar to those seen in their training data. We propose CompDiffuser, a novel generative approach that can solve new tasks by learning to compositionally stitch together shorter trajectory chunks from previously seen tasks. Our key insight is modeling the trajectory distribution by subdividing it into overlapping chunks and learning their conditional relationships through a single bidirectional diffusion model. This allows information to propagate between segments during generation, ensuring physically consistent connections. We conduct experiments on benchmark tasks of various difficulties, covering different environment sizes, agent state dimension, trajectory types, training data quality, and show that CompDiffuser significantly outperforms existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://comp-diffuser.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[Curb Your Attention: Causal Attention Gating for Robust Trajectory Prediction in Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07191v2)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction models in autonomous driving are vulnerable to perturbations from non-causal agents whose actions should not affect the ego-agent's behavior. Such perturbations can lead to incorrect predictions of other agents' trajectories, potentially compromising the safety and efficiency of the ego-vehicle's decision-making process. Motivated by this challenge, we propose $\textit{Causal tRajecTory predICtion}$ $\textbf{(CRiTIC)}$, a novel model that utilizes a $\textit{Causal Discovery Network}$ to identify inter-agent causal relations over a window of past time steps. To incorporate discovered causal relationships, we propose a novel $\textit{Causal Attention Gating}$ mechanism to selectively filter information in the proposed Transformer-based architecture. We conduct extensive experiments on two autonomous driving benchmark datasets to evaluate the robustness of our model against non-causal perturbations and its generalization capacity. Our results indicate that the robustness of predictions can be improved by up to $\textbf{54%}$ without a significant detriment to prediction accuracy. Lastly, we demonstrate the superior domain generalizability of the proposed model, which achieves up to $\textbf{29%}$ improvement in cross-domain performance. These results underscore the potential of our model to enhance both robustness and generalization capacity for trajectory prediction in diverse autonomous driving domains.

| **[Quantifying and Modeling Driving Styles in Trajectory Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04994v1)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory forecasting has become a popular deep learning task due to its relevance for scenario simulation for autonomous driving. Specifically, trajectory forecasting predicts the trajectory of a short-horizon future for specific human drivers in a particular traffic scenario. Robust and accurate future predictions can enable autonomous driving planners to optimize for low-risk and predictable outcomes for human drivers around them. Although some work has been done to model driving style in planning and personalized autonomous polices, a gap exists in explicitly modeling human driving styles for trajectory forecasting of human behavior. Human driving style is most certainly a correlating factor to decision making, especially in edge-case scenarios where risk is nontrivial, as justified by the large amount of traffic psychology literature on risky driving. So far, the current real-world datasets for trajectory forecasting lack insight on the variety of represented driving styles. While the datasets may represent real-world distributions of driving styles, we posit that fringe driving style types may also be correlated with edge-case safety scenarios. In this work, we conduct analyses on existing real-world trajectory datasets for driving and dissect these works from the lens of driving styles, which is often intangible and non-standardized.</p></details> |  |

Recent research highlights the importance of environmental contexts (e.g., maps) and the "multi-modality" of trajectories, leading to increasingly complex model structures. However, real-world deployments require lightweight models that can quickly migrate and adapt to new environments. Additionally, the core motivations of road agents, referred to as their intentions, deserves further exploration. In this study, we advocate that understanding and reasoning road agents' intention plays a key role in trajectory prediction tasks, and the main challenge is that the concept of intention is fuzzy and abstract. To this end, we present INTENT, an efficient intention-guided trajectory prediction model that relies solely on information contained in the road agent's trajectory. Our model distinguishes itself from existing models in several key aspects: (i) We explicitly model road agents' intentions through contrastive clustering, accommodating the fuzziness and abstraction of human intention in their trajectories. (ii) The proposed INTENT is based solely on multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs), resulting in reduced training and inference time, making it very efficient and more suitable for real-world deployment. (iii) By leveraging estimated intentions and an innovative algorithm for transforming trajectory observations, we obtain more robust trajectory representations that lead to superior prediction accuracy. Extensive experiments on real-world trajectory datasets for pedestrians and autonomous vehicles demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of INTENT.</p></details> |  |
| **[Algorithmic Considerations for Effective Global Search of Robust Low-Thrust Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00297v2)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing interest in the cislunar domain over the past decade has led to an increasing demand for low-thrust missions to key orbits within this region. These low-thrust missions, typically characterized by long thrust arcs, are highly susceptible to operational disruptions such as unforeseen thruster outages or missed thrust events. Consequently, there is a critical need for efficient trajectory design frameworks which incorporate robustness against such anomalies. In this study, we utilize a robust trajectory design framework to explore the solution space for the Power and Propulsion Element (PPE) module to the Earth-Moon L2 Southern 9:2 Near Rectilinear Halo Orbit. We propose algorithmic enhancements to improve the global search for robust solutions, and present a comprehensive analysis of two approaches: a nonconditional approach which involves a purely random search for robust solutions versus a conditional approach which involves warm-starting the search for robust solutions using the non-robust solutions. Our results indicate that by using non-robust solutions as initial guesses for the robust solutions, it is possible to achieve significant improvements in both the rate of convergence and the robustness of the final solutions.</p></details> | <details><summary>An up...</summary><p>An update to the paper is available on arxiv as "Sinha, A., Beeson, R.

| **[A Data-Driven Aggressive Autonomous Racing Framework Utilizing Local Trajectory Planning with Velocity Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11570v3)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The development of autonomous driving has boosted the research on autonomous racing. However, existing local trajectory planning methods have difficulty planning trajectories with optimal velocity profiles at racetracks with sharp corners, thus weakening the performance of autonomous racing. To address this problem, we propose a local trajectory planning method that integrates Velocity Prediction based on Model Predictive Contouring Control (VPMPCC). The optimal parameters of VPMPCC are learned through Bayesian Optimization (BO) based on a proposed novel Objective Function adapted to Racing (OFR). Specifically, VPMPCC achieves velocity prediction by encoding the racetrack as a reference velocity profile and incorporating it into the optimization problem. This method optimizes the velocity profile of local trajectories, especially at corners with significant curvature. The proposed OFR balances racing performance with vehicle safety, ensuring safe and efficient BO training. In the simulation, the number of training iterations for OFR-based BO is reduced by 42.86% compared to the state-of-the-art method. The optimal simulation-trained parameters are then applied to a real-world F1TENTH vehicle without retraining. During prolonged racing on a custom-built racetrack featuring significant sharp corners, the mean projected velocity of VPMPCC reaches 93.18% of the vehicle's handling limits. The released code is available at https://github.com/zhouhengli/VPMPCC.</p></details> |  |
| **[Pitch Plane Trajectory Tracking Control for Sounding Rockets via Adaptive Feedback Linearization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05285v2)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes a pitch plane trajectory tacking control solution for suborbital launch vehicles relying on adaptive feedback linearization. Initially, the 2D dynamics and kinematics for a single-engine, thrust-vector-controlled sounding rocket are obtained for control design purposes. Then, an inner-outer control strategy, which simultaneously tackles attitude and position control, is adopted, with the inner-loop comprising the altitude and pitch control and the outer-loop addressing the horizontal (downrange) position control. Feedback linearization is used to cancel out the non-linearities in both the inner and outer dynamics. Making use of Lyapunov stability theory, an adaptation law, which provides online estimates on the inner-loop aerodynamic uncertainty, is jointly designed with the output tracking controller via adaptive backstepping, ensuring global reference tracking in the region where the feedback linearization is well-defined. The zero dynamics of the inner-stabilized system are then exploited to obtain the outerloop dynamics and derive a Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) with integral action, which can stabilize them as well as reject external disturbances. In the outermost loop, the estimate on the correspondent aerodynamic uncertainty is indirectly obtained by using the inner loop estimates together with known aerodynamics relations. The resulting inner-outer position control solution is proven to be asymptotically stable in the region of interest. Using a single-stage sounding rocket, propelled by a liquid engine, as reference vehicle, different mission scenarios are tested in a simulation environment to verify the adaptability of the proposed control strategy. The system is able to track the requested trajectories while rejecting external wind disturbances. Furthermore, the need to re-tune the control gains in between different mission scenarios is minimal to none.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper presented at the IEEE Aerospace Conference 2025.

| **[Simulation-based Analysis Of Highway Trajectory Planning Using High-Order Polynomial For Highly Automated Driving Function](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04159v1)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One of the fundamental tasks of autonomous driving is safe trajectory planning, the task of deciding where the vehicle needs to drive, while avoiding obstacles, obeying safety rules, and respecting the fundamental limits of road. Real-world application of such a method involves consideration of surrounding environment conditions and movements such as Lane Change, collision avoidance, and lane merge. The focus of the paper is to develop and implement safe collision free highway Lane Change trajectory using high order polynomial for Highly Automated Driving Function (HADF). Planning is often considered as a higher-level process than control. Behavior Planning Module (BPM) is designed that plans the high-level driving actions like Lane Change maneuver to safely achieve the functionality of transverse guidance ensuring safety of the vehicle using motion planning in a scenario including environmental situation. Based on the recommendation received from the (BPM), the function will generate a desire corresponding trajectory. The proposed planning system is situation specific with polynomial based algorithm for same direction two lane highway scenario. To support the trajectory system polynomial curve can be used to reduces overall complexity and thereby allows rapid computation. The proposed Lane Change scenario is modeled, and results has been analyzed (verified and validate) through the MATLAB simulation environment. The method proposed in this paper has achieved a significant improvement in safety and stability of Lane Changing maneuver.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Pixels to Trajectory: Universal Adversarial Example Detection via Temporal Imprints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04853v1)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For the first time, we unveil discernible temporal (or historical) trajectory imprints resulting from adversarial example (AE) attacks. Standing in contrast to existing studies all focusing on spatial (or static) imprints within the targeted underlying victim models, we present a fresh temporal paradigm for understanding these attacks. Of paramount discovery is that these imprints are encapsulated within a single loss metric, spanning universally across diverse tasks such as classification and regression, and modalities including image, text, and audio. Recognizing the distinct nature of loss between adversarial and clean examples, we exploit this temporal imprint for AE detection by proposing TRAIT (TRaceable Adversarial temporal trajectory ImprinTs). TRAIT operates under minimal assumptions without prior knowledge of attacks, thereby framing the detection challenge as a one-class classification problem. However, detecting AEs is still challenged by significant overlaps between the constructed synthetic losses of adversarial and clean examples due to the absence of ground truth for incoming inputs. TRAIT addresses this challenge by converting the synthetic loss into a spectrum signature, using the technique of Fast Fourier Transform to highlight the discrepancies, drawing inspiration from the temporal nature of the imprints, analogous to time-series signals. Across 12 AE attacks including SMACK (USENIX Sec'2023), TRAIT demonstrates consistent outstanding performance across comprehensively evaluated modalities, tasks, datasets, and model architectures. In all scenarios, TRAIT achieves an AE detection accuracy exceeding 97%, often around 99%, while maintaining a false rejection rate of 1%. TRAIT remains effective under the formulated strong adaptive attacks.</p></details> |  |

As the scale of DRL training increases, treating DRL policy network weights as a new data modality and exploring the potential becomes appealing and possible. In this work, we focus on the policy learning path in deep RL, represented by the trajectory of network weights of historical policies, which reflects the evolvement of the policy learning process. Taking the idea of trajectory modeling with Transformer, we propose Transformer as Implicit Policy Learner (TIPL), which processes policy network weights in an autoregressive manner. We collect the policy learning path data by running independent RL training trials, with which we then train our TIPL model. In the experiments, we demonstrate that TIPL is able to fit the implicit dynamics of policy learning and perform the optimization of policy network by inference.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as an extended abstract to ICLR 2025 Workshop on Weight Space Learning (WSL)</p></details> |

However, collecting such sensitive data raises considerable privacy concerns. Local differential privacy (LDP) offers a solution by allowing individuals to locally perturb their trajectory data before sharing it. Despite its privacy benefits, LDP protocols are vulnerable to data poisoning attacks, where attackers inject fake data to manipulate aggregated results. In this work, we make the first attempt to analyze vulnerabilities in several representative LDP trajectory protocols. We propose \textsc{TraP}, a heuristic algorithm for data \underline{P}oisoning attacks using a prefix-suffix method to optimize fake \underline{Tra}jectory selection, significantly reducing computational complexity. Our experimental results demonstrate that our attack can substantially increase target pattern occurrences in the perturbed trajectory dataset with few fake users. This study underscores the urgent need for robust defenses and better protocol designs to safeguard LDP trajectory data against malicious manipulation.</p></details> |  |
| **[TR-LLM: Integrating Trajectory Data for Scene-Aware LLM-Based Human Action Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03993v3)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate prediction of human behavior is crucial for AI systems to effectively support real-world applications, such as autonomous robots anticipating and assisting with human tasks. Real-world scenarios frequently present challenges such as occlusions and incomplete scene observations, which can compromise predictive accuracy. Thus, traditional video-based methods often struggle due to limited temporal and spatial perspectives. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising alternative. Having been trained on a large text corpus describing human behaviors, LLMs likely encode plausible sequences of human actions in a home environment. However, LLMs, trained primarily on text data, lack inherent spatial awareness and real-time environmental perception. They struggle with understanding physical constraints and spatial geometry. Therefore, to be effective in a real-world spatial scenario, we propose a multimodal prediction framework that enhances LLM-based action prediction by integrating physical constraints derived from human trajectories. Our experiments demonstrate that combining LLM predictions with trajectory data significantly improves overall prediction performance. This enhancement is particularly notable in situations where the LLM receives limited scene information, highlighting the complementary nature of linguistic knowledge and physical constraints in understanding and anticipating human behavior.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reusing Historical Trajectories in Natural Policy Gradient via Importance Sampling: Convergence and Convergence Rate](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00675v2)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning provides a mathematical framework for learning-based control, whose success largely depends on the amount of data it can utilize. The efficient utilization of historical trajectories obtained from previous policies is essential for expediting policy optimization. Empirical evidence has shown that policy gradient methods based on importance sampling work well. However, existing literature often neglect the interdependence between trajectories from different iterations, and the good empirical performance lacks a rigorous theoretical justification. In this paper, we study a variant of the natural policy gradient method with reusing historical trajectories via importance sampling. We show that the bias of the proposed estimator of the gradient is asymptotically negligible, the resultant algorithm is convergent, and reusing past trajectories helps improve the convergence rate. We further apply the proposed estimator to popular policy optimization algorithms such as trust region policy optimization. Our theoretical results are verified on classical benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

The proposed method uses a Dynamic Buffered Voronoi Cell (DBVC) and a Dynamic Inter-Visibility Cell (DIVC) to formulate the distributed trajectory generation. Specifically, the DBVC and the DIVC are time-variant spaces that prevent mutual collisions and occlusions among agents, while enabling them to maintain suitable distances from the moving target. We combine the DBVC and the DIVC with an efficient Bernstein polynomial motion primitive-based tracking generation method, which has been refined into a less conservative approach than in our previous work. The proposed algorithm can compute each agent's trajectory within several milliseconds on an Intel i7 desktop. We validate the tracking performance in challenging scenarios, including environments with dozens of obstacles.</p></details> | 8 pages, 6 figures |

The existing predictors tend to overfit to clean observation affecting their robustness when used with noisy inputs. In this work, we propose MonoTransmotion (MT), a Transformer-based framework that uses only a monocular camera to jointly solve localization and prediction tasks. Our framework has two main modules: Bird's Eye View (BEV) localization and trajectory prediction. The BEV localization module estimates the position of a person using 2D human poses, enhanced by a novel directional loss for smoother sequential localizations. The trajectory prediction module predicts future motion from these estimates. We show that by jointly training both tasks with our unified framework, our method is more robust in real-world scenarios made of noisy inputs. We validate our MT network on both curated and non-curated datasets. On the curated dataset, MT achieves around 12% improvement over baseline models on BEV localization and trajectory prediction. On real-world non-curated dataset, experimental results indicate that MT maintains similar performance levels, highlighting its robustness and generalization capability.

This work demonstrates that the non-stop flights of three or more carriers are compatible with holding a constant pose of a cable-suspended load, thus potentially enabling aerial manipulation with energy-efficient non-stop carriers. It also presents an algorithm for generating the coordinated non-stop trajectories. The proposed method builds upon two pillars: (1)~the choice of $n$ special linearly independent directions of internal forces within the $3n-6$-dimensional nullspace of the grasp matrix of the load, chosen as the edges of a Hamiltonian cycle on the graph that connects the cable attachment points on the load. Adjacent pairs of directions are used to generate $n$ forces evolving on distinct 2D affine subspaces, despite the attachment points being generically in 3D; (2)~the construction of elliptical trajectories within these subspaces by mapping, through appropriate graph coloring, each edge of the Hamiltonian cycle to a periodic coordinate while ensuring that no adjacent coordinates exhibit simultaneous zero derivatives. Combined with conditions for load statics and attachment point positions, these choices ensure that each of the $n$ force trajectories projects onto the corresponding cable constraint sphere with non-zero tangential velocity, enabling perpetual motion of the carriers while the load is still. The theoretical findings are validated through simulations and laboratory experiments with non-stopping multirotor UAVs.</p></details> |  |

For the overall system dynamics, a two-degrees-of-freedom (2-DOF) vehicle model is established and a two-point preview driver model is adopted. A dynamic authority allocation strategy based on cooperation level is proposed to combine the steering input of the human driver and the automatic controller. To make further improvements in the controller design, three main contributions are put forward. Firstly, the CNF controller is designed for trajectory tracking control with refined transient performance. Besides, the self-triggered rule is applied such that the system will update in discrete times to save computing resources and increase efficiency. Moreover, by introducing the data-based ADP algorithm, the optimal control problem can be solved through iteration using system input and output information, reducing the need for accurate knowledge of system dynamics. The effectiveness of the proposed control method is validated through Carsim-Simulink co-simulations in diverse driving scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics (12 pages)</p></details> |

| **[SEAL: Safety Enhanced Trajectory Planning and Control Framework for Quadrotor Flight in Complex Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03346v1)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For quadrotors, achieving safe and autonomous flight in complex environments with wind disturbances and dynamic obstacles still faces significant challenges. Most existing methods address wind disturbances in either trajectory planning or control, which may lead to hazardous situations during flight. The emergence of dynamic obstacles would further worsen the situation. Therefore, we propose an efficient and reliable framework for quadrotors that incorporates wind disturbance estimations during both the planning and control phases via a generalized proportional integral observer. First, we develop a real-time adaptive spatial-temporal trajectory planner that utilizes Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability analysis for error dynamics resulting from wind disturbances. By considering the forward reachability sets propagation on an Euclidean Signed Distance Field (ESDF) map, safety is guaranteed. Additionally, a Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) controller considering wind disturbance compensation is implemented for robust trajectory tracking. Simulation and real-world experiments verify the effectiveness of our framework. The video and supplementary material will be available at https://github.com/Ma29-HIT/SEAL/.</p></details> |  |

To guarantee safety and prevent collisions, autonomous vehicles must be capable of accurately predicting the trajectories of surrounding traffic agents. Over the past decade, significant efforts from both academia and industry have been dedicated to designing solutions for precise trajectory forecasting. These efforts have produced a diverse range of approaches, raising questions about the differences between these methods and whether trajectory prediction challenges have been fully addressed. This paper reviews a substantial portion of recent trajectory prediction methods and devises a taxonomy to classify existing solutions. A general overview of the prediction pipeline is also provided, covering input and output modalities, modeling features, and prediction paradigms discussed in the literature. In addition, the paper discusses active research areas within trajectory prediction, addresses the posed research questions, and highlights the remaining research gaps and challenges.</p></details> |  |

Currently, the inherent trade-off between constraint compliance and computational efficiency enhancement in UAV trajectory optimization problems has not been sufficiently addressed. To enhance the performance of UAV trajectory optimization, we propose a spatial-temporal iterative optimization framework. Firstly, B-splines are utilized to represent UAV trajectories, with rigorous safety assurance achieved through strict enforcement of constraints on control points. Subsequently, a set of QP-LP subproblems via spatial-temporal decoupling and constraint linearization is derived. Finally, an iterative optimization strategy incorporating guidance gradients is employed to obtain high-performance UAV trajectories in different scenarios. Both simulation and real-world experimental results validate the efficiency and high-performance of the proposed optimization framework in generating safe and fast trajectories.

While recent learning-based methods, particularly reinforcement learning (RL), have shown promise in specific scenarios, RL planners struggle with training inefficiencies and managing large-scale, real-world driving scenarios. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{CarPlanner}, a \textbf{C}onsistent \textbf{a}uto-\textbf{r}egressive \textbf{Planner} that uses RL to generate multi-modal trajectories. The auto-regressive structure enables efficient large-scale RL training, while the incorporation of consistency ensures stable policy learning by maintaining coherent temporal consistency across time steps. Moreover, CarPlanner employs a generation-selection framework with an expert-guided reward function and an invariant-view module, simplifying RL training and enhancing policy performance. Extensive analysis demonstrates that our proposed RL framework effectively addresses the challenges of training efficiency and performance enhancement, positioning CarPlanner as a promising solution for trajectory planning in autonomous driving. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to demonstrate that the RL-based planner can surpass both IL- and rule-based state-of-the-arts (SOTAs) on the challenging large-scale real-world dataset nuPlan. Our proposed CarPlanner surpasses RL-, IL-, and rule-based SOTA approaches within this demanding dataset.</p></details> | CVPR 2025 |

Existing approaches either rely on heuristics for instantaneous foothold selection--compromising safety and versatility--or solve expensive trajectory optimization problems with complex terrain features and long time horizons. In contrast, our framework leverages reactive synthesis to generate correct-by-construction controllers at the symbolic level, and mixed-integer convex programming (MICP) for dynamic and physically feasible footstep planning for each symbolic transition. We use a high-level manager to reduce the large state space in synthesis by incorporating local environment information, improving synthesis scalability. To handle specifications that cannot be met due to dynamic infeasibility, and to minimize costly MICP solves, we leverage a symbolic repair process to generate only necessary symbolic transitions. During online execution, re-running the MICP with real-world terrain data, along with runtime symbolic repair, bridges the gap between offline synthesis and online execution. We demonstrate, in simulation, our framework's capabilities to discover missing locomotion skills and react promptly in safety-critical environments, such as scattered stepping stones and rebars.</p></details> |  |

The neural representation of a set is used as the terminal set constraint for a model predictive control (MPC) local planner, resulting in improved recursive feasibility and safety. To achieve real-time performance and desired generalization properties, we employ the idea of hypernetworks. We use the Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability analysis as the source of supervision during the training process, allowing us to consider general nonlinear dynamics and arbitrary constraints. The proposed method is extensively evaluated against relevant baselines in simulations for different environments and robot dynamics. The results show a success rate increase of up to 52 \% compared to the best baseline while maintaining comparable execution speed. Additionally, we deploy our proposed method, NTC-MPC, on a physical robot and demonstrate its ability to safely avoid obstacles in scenarios where the baselines fail.</p></details> |  |

Our approach addresses the complex dynamics of a system in which a team of quadrotors transports and manipulates a cable-suspended rigid-body payload in environments cluttered with obstacles. The proposed algorithm ensures obstacle avoidance for the entire system, including the quadrotors, cables, and the payload in all six degrees of freedom (DoF). We introduce the use of CBFs to enable safe and smooth maneuvers, effectively navigating through cluttered environments while accommodating the system's nonlinear dynamics. To simplify complex constraints, the system components are modeled as convex polytopes, and the Duality theorem is employed to reduce the computational complexity of the optimization problem. We validate the performance of our planning approach both in simulation and real-world environments using multiple quadrotors. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in achieving obstacle avoidance and safe trajectory generation for cooperative transportation tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted for publication in the IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation(ICRA), 2025.

Numerical models, such as MEDSLIK-II, simulate advection, dispersion, and transformation processes of oil particles. However, simulations heavily rely on accurate parameter tuning, still based on expert knowledge and manual calibration. To overcome these limitations, we integrate the MEDSLIK-II numerical oil spill model with a Bayesian optimization framework to iteratively estimate the best physical parameter configuration that yields simulation closer to satellite observations of the slick. We focus on key parameters, such as horizontal diffusivity and drift factor, maximizing the Fraction Skill Score (FSS) as a measure of spatio-temporal overlap between simulated and observed oil distributions. We validate the framework for the Baniyas oil incident that occurred in Syria between August 23 and September 4, 2021, which released over 12,000 $m^3$ of oil. We show that, on average, the proposed approach systematically improves the FSS from 5.82% to 11.07% compared to control simulations initialized with default parameters. The optimization results in consistent improvement across multiple time steps, particularly during periods of increased drift variability, demonstrating the robustness of our method in dynamic environmental conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 10 figures, 3 tables, research paper</p></details> |

Although many methods have been explored, they assign correlation coefficients to surrounding agents in a purely learning-based manner. In this study, we present ASPILin, which manually selects interacting agents and replaces the attention scores in Transformer with a newly computed physical correlation coefficient, enhancing the interpretability of interaction modeling. Surprisingly, these simple modifications can significantly improve prediction performance and substantially reduce computational costs. We intentionally simplified our model in other aspects, such as map encoding. Remarkably, experiments conducted on the INTERACTION, highD, and CitySim datasets demonstrate that our method is efficient and straightforward, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>code:...</summary><p>code:https://github.com/kkk00714/ASPILin</p></details> |

However, concerns about the reliability of the content they generate persist, as it frequently deviates from factual correctness or exhibits deficiencies in logical reasoning. This paper proposes a novel decoding strategy aimed at enhancing both factual accuracy and inferential reasoning without requiring any modifications to the architecture or pre-trained parameters of LLMs. Our approach adjusts next-token probabilities by analyzing the trajectory of logits from lower to higher layers in Transformers and applying linear regression. We find that this Decoding by Logit Trajectory-based approach (DeLTa) effectively reinforces factuality and reasoning while mitigating incorrect generation. Experiments on TruthfulQA demonstrate that DeLTa attains up to a 4.9% improvement over the baseline. Furthermore, it enhances performance by up to 8.1% on StrategyQA and 7.3% on GSM8K, both of which demand strong reasoning capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Sourc...</summary><p>Source code is available at https://github.com/githubhyz/DeLTa</p></details> |

Trajectory optimization is a powerful and widely used algorithm in control, parameterized by a cost and a dynamics function. The key to our approach is to leverage the recent progress in differentiable trajectory optimization, which enables computing the gradients of the loss with respect to the parameters of trajectory optimization. As a result, the cost and dynamics functions of trajectory optimization can be learned end-to-end. DiffTORI addresses the ``objective mismatch'' issue of prior model-based RL algorithms, as the dynamics model in DiffTORI is learned to directly maximize task performance by differentiating the policy gradient loss through the trajectory optimization process. We further benchmark DiffTORI for imitation learning on standard robotic manipulation task suites with high-dimensional sensory observations and compare our method to feed-forward policy classes as well as Energy-Based Models (EBM) and Diffusion. Across 15 model-based RL tasks and 35 imitation learning tasks with high-dimensional image and point cloud inputs, DiffTORI outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods in both domains.

| **[Quantifying Point Contributions: A Lightweight Framework for Efficient and Effective Query-Driven Trajectory Simplification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02047v1)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As large volumes of trajectory data accumulate, simplifying trajectories to reduce storage and querying costs is increasingly studied. Existing proposals face three main problems. First, they require numerous iterations to decide which GPS points to delete. Second, they focus only on the relationships between neighboring points (local information) while neglecting the overall structure (global information), reducing the global similarity between the simplified and original trajectories and making it difficult to maintain consistency in query results, especially for similarity-based queries. Finally, they fail to differentiate the importance of points with similar features, leading to suboptimal selection of points to retain the original trajectory information. We propose MLSimp, a novel Mutual Learning query-driven trajectory simplification framework that integrates two distinct models: GNN-TS, based on graph neural networks, and Diff-TS, based on diffusion models. GNN-TS evaluates the importance of a point according to its globality, capturing its correlation with the entire trajectory, and its uniqueness, capturing its differences from neighboring points. It also incorporates attention mechanisms in the GNN layers, enabling simultaneous data integration from all points within the same trajectory and refining representations, thus avoiding iterative processes. Diff-TS generates amplified signals to enable the retention of the most important points at low compression rates. Experiments involving eight baselines on three databases show that MLSimp reduces the simplification time by 42%--70% and improves query accuracy over simplified trajectories by up to 34.6%.</p></details> | Accepted by VLDB2025 |

This work investigates LLMs' ability to estimate probability density functions (PDFs) from data observed in-context; such density estimation (DE) is a fundamental task underlying many probabilistic modeling problems. We leverage the Intensive Principal Component Analysis (InPCA) to visualize and analyze the in-context learning dynamics of LLaMA-2 models. Our main finding is that these LLMs all follow similar learning trajectories in a low-dimensional InPCA space, which are distinct from those of traditional density estimation methods like histograms and Gaussian kernel density estimation (KDE). We interpret the LLaMA in-context DE process as a KDE with an adaptive kernel width and shape. This custom kernel model captures a significant portion of LLaMA's behavior despite having only two parameters. We further speculate on why LLaMA's kernel width and shape differs from classical algorithms, providing insights into the mechanism of in-context probabilistic reasoning in LLMs. Our codebase, along with a 3D visualization of an LLM's in-context learning trajectory, is publicly available at https://github.com/AntonioLiu97/LLMICL_inPCA</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches rely on expensive human annotation, making them unsustainable at scale. We propose AgentTrek, a scalable data synthesis pipeline that generates web agent trajectories by leveraging publicly available tutorials. Our three-stage method: (1) automatically harvests and filters tutorial-like texts from the internet using a specialized classification model, (2) transforms these texts into structured task specifications with step-by-step instructions, and (3) employs a visual-language model (VLM) agent to execute these instructions in real environments, while a VLM-based evaluator verifies trajectory correctness. The synthesized trajectories encompass multiple modalities, including text-based HTML observations with function-calling API actions, and vision-based screenshot observations with pixel-level actions. This multimodal data, enriched with chain-of-thought reasoning, enables agents to achieve state-of-the-art performance on both textual web browsing benchmarks (e.g., WebArena) and visual web grounding and browsing benchmarks (e.g., ScreenSpot Web and Multimodal Mind2Web). Furthermore, our fully automated approach significantly reduces data collection costs, achieving a cost of just $0.55 per high-quality trajectory without human annotators. Our work demonstrates that guided replay using web tutorials is a practical and scalable strategy for training advanced GUI agents, paving the way for more capable and autonomous digital assistants.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR2...</summary><p>ICLR2025 Spotlight https://agenttrek.github.io</p></details> |

In this paper, we propose a new task goal identification from observed UI trajectories aiming to infer the user's detailed intentions when performing a task within UI environments. To support this task, we also introduce a novel evaluation methodology designed to assess whether two intent descriptions can be considered paraphrases within a specific UI environment. Furthermore, we demonstrate how this task can leverage datasets designed for the inverse problem of UI automation, utilizing Android and web datasets for our experiments. To benchmark this task, we compare the performance of humans and state-of-the-art models, specifically GPT-4 and Gemini-1.5 Pro, using our proposed metric. The results reveal that both Gemini and GPT underperform relative to human performance, underscoring the challenge of the proposed task and the significant room for improvement.

We refer to this type of problem as a multi-task, and we train agents to be versatile in this multi-task setting through a single training process. To address this challenge, we introduce TRajectory-class-Aware Multi-Agent reinforcement learning (TRAMA). In TRAMA, agents recognize a task type by identifying the class of trajectories they are experiencing through partial observations, and the agents use this trajectory awareness or prediction as additional information for action policy. To this end, we introduce three primary objectives in TRAMA: (a) constructing a quantized latent space to generate trajectory embeddings that reflect key similarities among them; (b) conducting trajectory clustering using these trajectory embeddings; and (c) building a trajectory-class-aware policy. Specifically for (c), we introduce a trajectory-class predictor that performs agent-wise predictions on the trajectory class; and we design a trajectory-class representation model for each trajectory class. Each agent takes actions based on this trajectory-class representation along with its partial observation for task-aware execution. The proposed method is evaluated on various tasks, including multi-task problems built upon StarCraft II. Empirical results show further performance improvements over state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICLR 2025</p></details> |

However, this task is generally nontrivial due to the inherent stochasticity of human motion, which naturally requires the predictor to generate multi-modal prediction. Previous works leverage various generative methods, such as GAN and VAE, for pedestrian trajectory prediction. Nevertheless, these methods may suffer from mode collapse and relatively low-quality results. The denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) has recently been applied to trajectory prediction due to its simple training process and powerful reconstruction ability. However, current diffusion-based methods do not fully utilize input information and usually require many denoising iterations that lead to a long inference time or an additional network for initialization. To address these challenges and facilitate the use of diffusion models in multi-modal trajectory prediction, we propose GDTS, a novel Goal-Guided Diffusion Model with Tree Sampling for multi-modal trajectory prediction. Considering the "goal-driven" characteristics of human motion, GDTS leverages goal estimation to guide the generation of the diffusion network. A two-stage tree sampling algorithm is presented, which leverages common features to reduce the inference time and improve accuracy for multi-modal prediction. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed framework achieves comparable state-of-the-art performance with real-time inference speed in public datasets.</p></details> |  |

However, existing solutions suffer from limited cross-task transferability. In addition, they only utilize optimal weights as training samples, ignoring the value of other weights in the optimization process. To address these issues, we propose Lt-Di, which integrates the diffusion algorithm with meta-learning to generate weights for unseen tasks. Furthermore, we extend the vanilla diffusion algorithm into a trajectory diffusion algorithm to utilize other weights along the optimization trajectory. Trajectory diffusion decomposes the entire diffusion chain into multiple shorter ones, improving training and inference efficiency. We analyze the convergence properties of the weight generation paradigm and improve convergence efficiency without additional time overhead. Our experiments demonstrate Lt-Di's higher accuracy while reducing computational overhead across various tasks, including zero-shot and few-shot learning, multi-domain generalization, and large-scale language model fine-tuning.Our code is released at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Lt-Di-0E51.</p></details> |  |

This paper presents a chattering-free fast terminal sliding mode control (FTSMC) strategy for a three-degree-of-freedom (3-DOF) robotic arm, designed to enhance tracking accuracy and robustness while ensuring finite-time convergence. The control framework is developed using Newton-Euler dynamics, followed by a state-space representation that captures the system's angular position and velocity. By incorporating an improved sliding surface and a Lyapunov-based stability analysis, the proposed FTSMC effectively mitigates chattering while preserving the advantages of SMC, such as fast response and strong disturbance rejection. The controller's performance is rigorously evaluated through comparisons with conventional PD sliding mode control (PDSMC) and terminal sliding mode control (TSMC). Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves superior trajectory tracking performance, faster convergence, and enhanced stability compared to existing methods, making it a promising solution for high-precision robotic applications.</p></details> |  |

However, extensive demonstrations are required for policy robustness and generalization. To reduce the demonstration reliance, we leverage spatial symmetry and propose ET-SEED, an efficient trajectory-level SE(3) equivariant diffusion model for generating action sequences in complex robot manipulation tasks. Further, previous equivariant diffusion models require the per-step equivariance in the Markov process, making it difficult to learn policy under such strong constraints. We theoretically extend equivariant Markov kernels and simplify the condition of equivariant diffusion process, thereby significantly improving training efficiency for trajectory-level SE(3) equivariant diffusion policy in an end-to-end manner. We evaluate ET-SEED on representative robotic manipulation tasks, involving rigid body, articulated and deformable object. Experiments demonstrate superior data efficiency and manipulation proficiency of our proposed method, as well as its ability to generalize to unseen configurations with only a few demonstrations.

To ensure safety, planners require reliable uncertainty estimates of the predicted behavior of surrounding agents, yet this aspect has received limited attention. In particular, decomposing uncertainty into its aleatoric and epistemic components is essential for distinguishing between inherent environmental randomness and model uncertainty, thereby enabling more robust and informed decision-making. This paper addresses the challenge of uncertainty modeling in trajectory prediction with a holistic approach that emphasizes uncertainty quantification, decomposition, and the impact of model composition. Our method, grounded in information theory, provides a theoretically principled way to measure uncertainty and decompose it into aleatoric and epistemic components.

| **[Trajectory-based Road Autolabeling with Lidar-Camera Fusion in Winter Conditions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02370v2)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robust road segmentation in all road conditions is required for safe autonomous driving and advanced driver assistance systems. Supervised deep learning methods provide accurate road segmentation in the domain of their training data but cannot be trusted in out-of-distribution scenarios. Including the whole distribution in the trainset is challenging as each sample must be labeled by hand. Trajectory-based self-supervised methods offer a potential solution as they can learn from the traversed route without manual labels. However, existing trajectory-based methods use learning schemes that rely only on the camera or only on the lidar. In this paper, trajectory-based learning is implemented jointly with lidar and camera for increased performance. Our method outperforms recent standalone camera- and lidar-based methods when evaluated with a challenging winter driving dataset including countryside and suburb driving scenes.

Previous studies aim to predict gaze trajectories when humans are free-viewing an image, searching for required targets, or looking for clues to answer questions in an image. While these tasks focus on visual-centric scenarios, humans move their gaze also along with audio signal inputs in more common scenarios. To fill this gap, we introduce a new task that predicts human gaze trajectories in a visual scene with synchronized audio inputs and provide a new dataset containing 20k gaze points from 8 subjects. To effectively integrate audio information and simulate the dynamic process of human gaze motion, we propose a novel learning framework called EyEar (Eye moving while Ear listening) based on physics-informed dynamics, which considers three key factors to predict gazes: eye inherent motion tendency, vision salient attraction, and audio semantic attraction. We also propose a probability density score to overcome the high individual variability of gaze trajectories, thereby improving the stabilization of optimization and the reliability of the evaluation. Experimental results show that EyEar outperforms all the baselines in the context of all evaluation metrics, thanks to the proposed components in the learning model.</p></details> |  |

Starting with a small number of embodiment-flexible human demonstrations collected in a virtual reality simulation environment, the pipeline refines these demonstrations using optimization-based kinematic retargeting and trajectory optimization to adapt them across various robot embodiments and physical parameters. This process yields a diverse, physically consistent dataset that enables cross-embodiment data transfer, and offers the potential to reuse legacy datasets collected under different hardware configurations or physical parameters. We validate the pipeline's effectiveness by training diffusion policies from the generated datasets for challenging contact-rich manipulation tasks across multiple robot embodiments, including a floating Allegro hand and bimanual robot arms. The trained policies are deployed zero-shot on hardware for bimanual iiwa arms, achieving high success rates with minimal human input.

This paper introduces the Trajectory-to-Action Pipeline (TAP), a scalable and automated method for extracting SDL labels from large trajectory datasets. TAP applies a rules-based cross-entropy optimization approach to learn parameters directly from data, enhancing generalization across diverse driving contexts. Using the Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD), TAP achieves 30% greater precision than Average Displacement Error (ADE) and 24% over Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) in identifying behaviorally similar trajectories. Additionally, TAP enables automated detection of unique driving behaviors, streamlining safety evaluation processes for AV testing. This work provides a foundation for scalable scenario-based AV behavior analysis, with potential extensions for integrating multi-agent contexts.</p></details> | 8 pages, 6 figures |

However, the inherently dynamic nature of the heart imposes strict limits on acquisition times, making high-resolution T1 mapping a persistent challenge. Compressed sensing (CS) approaches have reduced scan durations by undersampling k-space and reconstructing images from partial data, and recent studies show that jointly optimizing the undersampling patterns with the reconstruction network can substantially improve performance. Still, most current T1 mapping pipelines rely on static, hand-crafted masks that do not exploit the full acceleration and accuracy potential. In this work, we introduce T1-PILOT: an end-to-end method that explicitly incorporates the T1 signal relaxation model into the sampling-reconstruction framework to guide the learning of non-Cartesian trajectories, crossframe alignment, and T1 decay estimation. Through extensive experiments on the CMRxRecon dataset, T1-PILOT significantly outperforms several baseline strategies (including learned single-mask and fixed radial or golden-angle sampling schemes), achieving higher T1 map fidelity at greater acceleration factors. In particular, we observe consistent gains in PSNR and VIF relative to existing methods, along with marked improvements in delineating finer myocardial structures. Our results highlight that optimizing sampling trajectories in tandem with the physical relaxation model leads to both enhanced quantitative accuracy and reduced acquisition times. Code for reproducing all results will be made publicly available upon publication.</p></details> |  |

We present Generation Chain-of-Thought (GoT), a novel paradigm that enables generation and editing through an explicit language reasoning process before outputting images. This approach transforms conventional text-to-image generation and editing into a reasoning-guided framework that analyzes semantic relationships and spatial arrangements. We define the formulation of GoT and construct large-scale GoT datasets containing over 9M samples with detailed reasoning chains capturing semantic-spatial relationships. To leverage the advantages of GoT, we implement a unified framework that integrates Qwen2.5-VL for reasoning chain generation with an end-to-end diffusion model enhanced by our novel Semantic-Spatial Guidance Module. Experiments show our GoT framework achieves excellent performance on both generation and editing tasks, with significant improvements over baselines. Additionally, our approach enables interactive visual generation, allowing users to explicitly modify reasoning steps for precise image adjustments. GoT pioneers a new direction for reasoning-driven visual generation and editing, producing images that better align with human intent. To facilitate future research, we make our datasets, code, and pretrained models publicly available at https://github.com/rongyaofang/GoT.</p></details> | <details><summary>Datas...</summary><p>Dataset and models are released in https://github.com/rongyaofang/GoT</p></details> |

Recent advances in 3D human reconstruction mainly focus on static human modeling, and the reliance of using synthetic 3D scans for training limits their generalization ability. Conversely, optimization-based video methods achieve higher fidelity but demand controlled capture conditions and computationally intensive refinement processes. Motivated by the emergence of large reconstruction models for efficient static reconstruction, we propose LHM (Large Animatable Human Reconstruction Model) to infer high-fidelity avatars represented as 3D Gaussian splatting in a feed-forward pass. Our model leverages a multimodal transformer architecture to effectively encode the human body positional features and image features with attention mechanism, enabling detailed preservation of clothing geometry and texture. To further boost the face identity preservation and fine detail recovery, we propose a head feature pyramid encoding scheme to aggregate multi-scale features of the head regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our LHM generates plausible animatable human in seconds without post-processing for face and hands, outperforming existing methods in both reconstruction accuracy and generalization ability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://lingtengqiu.github.io/LHM/</p></details> |

One particularly challenging task is autonomous driving, which demands thorough cognitive processing before decisions can be made. In this domain, a sequential and interpretive understanding of visual cues is essential for effective perception, prediction, and planning. Nevertheless, common VQA benchmarks often focus on the accuracy of the final answer while overlooking the reasoning process that enables the generation of accurate responses. Moreover, existing methods lack a comprehensive framework for evaluating step-by-step reasoning in realistic driving scenarios. To address this gap, we propose DriveLMM-o1, a new dataset and benchmark specifically designed to advance step-wise visual reasoning for autonomous driving. Our benchmark features over 18k VQA examples in the training set and more than 4k in the test set, covering diverse questions on perception, prediction, and planning, each enriched with step-by-step reasoning to ensure logical inference in autonomous driving scenarios. We further introduce a large multimodal model that is fine-tuned on our reasoning dataset, demonstrating robust performance in complex driving scenarios. In addition, we benchmark various open-source and closed-source methods on our proposed dataset, systematically comparing their reasoning capabilities for autonomous driving tasks. Our model achieves a +7.49% gain in final answer accuracy, along with a 3.62% improvement in reasoning score over the previous best open-source model. Our framework, dataset, and model are available at https://github.com/ayesha-ishaq/DriveLMM-o1.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 4 figures, 3 tables, github: https://github.com/ayesha-ishaq/DriveLMM-o1</p></details> |

Unlike single-turn jailbreaks that rely on one meticulously engineered prompt, Siege expands the conversation at each turn in a breadth-first fashion, branching out multiple adversarial prompts that exploit partial compliance from previous responses. By tracking these incremental policy leaks and re-injecting them into subsequent queries, Siege reveals how minor concessions can accumulate into fully disallowed outputs. Evaluations on the JailbreakBench dataset show that Siege achieves a 100% success rate on GPT-3.5-turbo and 97% on GPT-4 in a single multi-turn run, using fewer queries than baselines such as Crescendo or GOAT. This tree search methodology offers an in-depth view of how model safeguards degrade over successive dialogue turns, underscoring the urgency of robust multi-turn testing procedures for language models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2025 Trustworthy LLM</p></details> |

While methods such as LoRA impose orthogonality constraints at the weight level, they do not fully address interference in hidden-state representations. We propose Compositional Subspace Representation Fine-tuning (CS-ReFT), a novel representation-based approach that learns multiple orthonormal subspace transformations, each specializing in a distinct skill, and composes them via a lightweight router. By isolating these subspace edits in the hidden state, rather than weight matrices, CS-ReFT prevents cross-task conflicts more effectively. On the AlpacaEval benchmark, applying CS-ReFT to Llama-2-7B achieves a 93.94% win rate, surpassing GPT-3.5 Turbo (86.30%) while requiring only 0.0098% of model parameters. These findings show that specialized representation edits, composed via a simple router, significantly enhance multi-task instruction following with minimal overhead.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2025 SCOPE</p></details> |

Among these advancements, DeepSeek models have emerged as noteworthy contenders, demonstrating promising capabilities that set them apart from their peers. While previous studies have conducted comparative analyses of LLMs, few have delivered a comprehensive evaluation of mathematical reasoning across a broad spectrum of LLMs. In this work, we aim to bridge this gap by conducting an in-depth comparative study, focusing on the strengths and limitations of DeepSeek models in relation to their leading counterparts. In particular, our study systematically evaluates the mathematical reasoning performance of two DeepSeek models alongside five prominent LLMs across three independent benchmark datasets. The findings reveal several key insights: 1). DeepSeek-R1 consistently achieved the highest accuracy on two of the three datasets, demonstrating strong mathematical reasoning capabilities. 2). The distilled variant of LLMs significantly underperformed compared to its peers, highlighting potential drawbacks in using distillation techniques. 3). In terms of response time, Gemini 2.0 Flash demonstrated the fastest processing speed, outperforming other models in efficiency, which is a crucial factor for real-time applications. Beyond these quantitative assessments, we delve into how architecture, training, and optimization impact LLMs' mathematical reasoning. Moreover, our study goes beyond mere performance comparison by identifying key areas for future advancements in LLM-driven mathematical reasoning. This research enhances our understanding of LLMs' mathematical reasoning and lays the groundwork for future advancements</p></details> |  |

However, their potential remains untapped, primarily due to the limited quantity and suboptimal quality of 3D datasets. Current approaches attempt to transfer knowledge from 2D MLLMs to expand 3D instruction data, but still face modality and domain gaps. To this end, we introduce PiSA-Engine (Point-Self-Augmented-Engine), a new framework for generating instruction point-language datasets enriched with 3D spatial semantics. We observe that existing 3D MLLMs offer a comprehensive understanding of point clouds for annotation, while 2D MLLMs excel at cross-validation by providing complementary information. By integrating holistic 2D and 3D insights from off-the-shelf MLLMs, PiSA-Engine enables a continuous cycle of high-quality data generation. We select PointLLM as the baseline and adopt this co-evolution training framework to develop an enhanced 3D MLLM, termed PointLLM-PiSA. Additionally, we identify limitations in previous 3D benchmarks, which often feature coarse language captions and insufficient category diversity, resulting in inaccurate evaluations. To address this gap, we further introduce PiSA-Bench, a comprehensive 3D benchmark covering six key aspects with detailed and diverse labels. Experimental results demonstrate PointLLM-PiSA's state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot 3D object captioning and generative classification on our PiSA-Bench, achieving significant improvements of 46.45% (+8.33%) and 63.75% (+16.25%), respectively. We will release the code, datasets, and benchmark.</p></details> | Technical Report |
| **[When Text Embedding Meets Large Language Model: A Comprehensive Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09165v2)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text embedding has become a foundational technology in natural language processing (NLP) during the deep learning era, driving advancements across a wide array of downstream tasks. While many natural language understanding challenges can now be modeled using generative paradigms and leverage the robust generative and comprehension capabilities of large language models (LLMs), numerous practical applications-such as semantic matching, clustering, and information retrieval-continue to rely on text embeddings for their efficiency and effectiveness. Therefore, how to combine the LLMs and the text embeddings has become one of the hotspots of academic attention in recent years. In this survey, we categorize the interplay between LLMs and text embeddings into three overarching themes: (1) LLM-augmented text embedding, enhancing traditional embedding methods with LLMs; (2) LLMs as text embedders, adapting their innate capabilities for high-quality embedding; and (3) Text embedding understanding with LLMs, leveraging LLMs to analyze and interpret embeddings. By organizing recent works based on interaction patterns rather than specific downstream applications, we offer a novel and systematic overview of contributions from various research and application domains in the era of LLMs. Furthermore, we highlight the unresolved challenges that persisted in the pre-LLM era with pre-trained language models (PLMs) and explore the emerging obstacles brought forth by LLMs. Building on this analysis, we outline prospective directions for the evolution of text embedding, addressing both theoretical and practical opportunities in the rapidly advancing landscape of NLP.</p></details> | Work in progress |
| **[SySLLM: Generating Synthesized Policy Summaries for Reinforcement Learning Agents Using Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10509v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Policies generated by Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms can be difficult to describe to users, as they result from the interplay between complex reward structures and neural network-based representations. This combination often leads to unpredictable behaviors, making policies challenging to analyze and posing significant obstacles to fostering human trust in real-world applications. Global policy summarization methods aim to describe agent behavior through a demonstration of actions in a subset of world-states. However, users can only watch a limited number of demonstrations, restricting their understanding of policies. Moreover, those methods overly rely on user interpretation, as they do not synthesize observations into coherent patterns. In this work, we present SySLLM (Synthesized Summary using LLMs), a novel method that employs synthesis summarization, utilizing large language models' (LLMs) extensive world knowledge and ability to capture patterns, to generate textual summaries of policies. Specifically, an expert evaluation demonstrates that the proposed approach generates summaries that capture the main insights generated by experts while not resulting in significant hallucinations. Additionally, a user study shows that SySLLM summaries are preferred over demonstration-based policy summaries and match or surpass their performance in objective agent identification tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[TokenCarve: Information-Preserving Visual Token Compression in Multimodal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10501v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are becoming increasingly popular, while the high computational cost associated with multimodal data input, particularly from visual tokens, poses a significant challenge. Existing training-based token compression methods improve inference efficiency but require costly retraining, while training-free methods struggle to maintain performance when aggressively reducing token counts. In this study, we reveal that the performance degradation of MLLM closely correlates with the accelerated loss of information in the attention output matrix. This insight introduces a novel information-preserving perspective, making it possible to maintain performance even under extreme token compression. Based on this finding, we propose TokenCarve, a training-free, plug-and-play, two-stage token compression framework. The first stage employs an Information-Preservation-Guided Selection (IPGS) strategy to prune low-information tokens, while the second stage further leverages IPGS to guide token merging, minimizing information loss. Extensive experiments on 11 datasets and 2 model variants demonstrate the effectiveness of TokenCarve. It can even reduce the number of visual tokens to 22.2% of the original count, achieving a 1.23x speedup in inference, a 64% reduction in KV cache storage, and only a 1.54% drop in accuracy. Our code is available at https://github.com/ShawnTan86/TokenCarve.</p></details> |  |
| **[InftyThink: Breaking the Length Limits of Long-Context Reasoning in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06692v2)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advanced reasoning in large language models has achieved remarkable performance on challenging tasks, but the prevailing long-context reasoning paradigm faces critical limitations: quadratic computational scaling with sequence length, reasoning constrained by maximum context boundaries, and performance degradation beyond pre-training context windows. Existing approaches primarily compress reasoning chains without addressing the fundamental scaling problem. To overcome these challenges, we introduce InftyThink, a paradigm that transforms monolithic reasoning into an iterative process with intermediate summarization. By interleaving short reasoning segments with concise progress summaries, our approach enables unbounded reasoning depth while maintaining bounded computational costs. This creates a characteristic sawtooth memory pattern that significantly reduces computational complexity compared to traditional approaches. Furthermore, we develop a methodology for reconstructing long-context reasoning datasets into our iterative format, transforming OpenR1-Math into 333K training instances. Experiments across multiple model architectures demonstrate that our approach reduces computational costs while improving performance, with Qwen2.5-Math-7B showing 3-13% improvements across MATH500, AIME24, and GPQA_diamond benchmarks. Our work challenges the assumed trade-off between reasoning depth and computational efficiency, providing a more scalable approach to complex reasoning without architectural modifications.</p></details> |  |

To address this gap, we introduce MMLU-ProX, a comprehensive multilingual benchmark covering 13 typologically diverse languages with approximately 11,829 questions per language. Building on the challenging reasoning-focused design of MMLU-Pro, our framework employs a semi-automatic translation process: translations generated by state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) are rigorously evaluated by expert annotators to ensure conceptual accuracy, terminological consistency, and cultural relevance. We comprehensively evaluate 25 state-of-the-art LLMs using 5-shot chain-of-thought (CoT) and zero-shot prompting strategies, analyzing their performance across linguistic and cultural boundaries. Our experiments reveal consistent performance degradation from high-resource languages to lower-resource ones, with the best models achieving over 70% accuracy on English but dropping to around 40% for languages like Swahili, highlighting persistent gaps in multilingual capabilities despite recent advances. MMLU-ProX is an ongoing project; we are expanding our benchmark by incorporating additional languages and evaluating more language models to provide a more comprehensive assessment of multilingual capabilities.</p></details> |  |

Recent advances in self-supervised pre-training have shown remarkable performances in generalization across various vision tasks. However, their effectiveness in gaze estimation remains unexplored. We propose UniGaze, for the first time, leveraging large-scale in-the-wild facial datasets for gaze estimation through self-supervised pre-training. Through systematic investigation, we clarify critical factors that are essential for effective pretraining in gaze estimation. Our experiments reveal that self-supervised approaches designed for semantic tasks fail when applied to gaze estimation, while our carefully designed pre-training pipeline consistently improves cross-domain performance. Through comprehensive experiments of challenging cross-dataset evaluation and novel protocols including leave-one-dataset-out and joint-dataset settings, we demonstrate that UniGaze significantly improves generalization across multiple data domains while minimizing reliance on costly labeled data. source code and model are available at https://github.com/ut-vision/UniGaze.</p></details> |  |
| **[DataMan: Data Manager for Pre-training Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19363v2)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The performance emergence of large language models (LLMs) driven by data scaling laws makes the selection of pre-training data increasingly important. However, existing methods rely on limited heuristics and human intuition, lacking comprehensive and clear guidelines. To address this, we are inspired by ``reverse thinking'' -- prompting LLMs to self-identify which criteria benefit its performance. As its pre-training capabilities are related to perplexity (PPL), we derive 14 quality criteria from the causes of text perplexity anomalies and introduce 15 common application domains to support domain mixing. In this paper, we train a Data Manager (DataMan) to learn quality ratings and domain recognition from pointwise rating, and use it to annotate a 447B token pre-training corpus with 14 quality ratings and domain type. Our experiments validate our approach, using DataMan to select 30B tokens to train a 1.3B-parameter language model, demonstrating significant improvements in in-context learning (ICL), perplexity, and instruction-following ability over the state-of-the-art baseline. The best-performing model, based on the Overall Score l=5 surpasses a model trained with 50% more data using uniform sampling. We continue pre-training with high-rated, domain-specific data annotated by DataMan to enhance domain-specific ICL performance and thus verify DataMan's domain mixing ability. Our findings emphasize the importance of quality ranking, the complementary nature of quality criteria, and their low correlation with perplexity, analyzing misalignment between PPL and ICL performance. We also thoroughly analyzed our pre-training dataset, examining its composition, the distribution of quality ratings, and the original document sources.</p></details> | ICLR2025 paper |

However, existing code benchmarks remain static, consisting of fixed datasets with predefined problems. This makes them vulnerable to memorization during training, where LLMs recall specific test cases instead of generalizing to new problems, leading to data contamination and unreliable evaluation results. To address these issues, we introduce DynaCode, a dynamic, complexity-aware benchmark that overcomes the limitations of static datasets. DynaCode evaluates LLMs systematically using a complexity-aware metric, incorporating both code complexity and call-graph structures. DynaCode achieves large-scale diversity, generating up to 189 million unique nested code problems across four distinct levels of code complexity, referred to as units, and 16 types of call graphs. Results on 12 latest LLMs show an average performance drop of 16.8% to 45.7% compared to MBPP+, a static code generation benchmark, with performance progressively decreasing as complexity increases. This demonstrates DynaCode's ability to effectively differentiate LLMs. Additionally, by leveraging call graphs, we gain insights into LLM behavior, particularly their preference for handling subfunction interactions within nested code.</p></details> | 16 pages, 11 figures |

While LangSplat successfully grounds CLIP features into 3D Gaussian representations, achieving precision and efficiency in 3D static scenes, it lacks the ability to handle dynamic 4D fields as CLIP, designed for static image-text tasks, cannot capture temporal dynamics in videos. Real-world environments are inherently dynamic, with object semantics evolving over time. Building a precise 4D language field necessitates obtaining pixel-aligned, object-wise video features, which current vision models struggle to achieve. To address these challenges, we propose 4D LangSplat, which learns 4D language fields to handle time-agnostic or time-sensitive open-vocabulary queries in dynamic scenes efficiently. 4D LangSplat bypasses learning the language field from vision features and instead learns directly from text generated from object-wise video captions via Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Specifically, we propose a multimodal object-wise video prompting method, consisting of visual and text prompts that guide MLLMs to generate detailed, temporally consistent, high-quality captions for objects throughout a video. These captions are encoded using a Large Language Model into high-quality sentence embeddings, which then serve as pixel-aligned, object-specific feature supervision, facilitating open-vocabulary text queries through shared embedding spaces. Recognizing that objects in 4D scenes exhibit smooth transitions across states, we further propose a status deformable network to model these continuous changes over time effectively. Our results across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that 4D LangSplat attains precise and efficient results for both time-sensitive and time-agnostic open-vocabulary queries.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025.

This work focuses on equality, inequality, and inclusion, along with the properties they satisfy, such as ir/reflexivity, a/symmetry, transitivity, and logical complexity (e.g., number of reasoning ``hops''). We propose an alternative to in-context learning that trains only the representations of newly introduced tokens, namely out-of-context representation learning. This method mitigates linguistic biases already present in a model and, differently from in-context learning, does not rely on external information or illustrations. We argue out-of-context representation learning as a better alternative to in-context learning and fine-tuning to evaluate the capabilities of LLMs on logic tasks that are the building blocks of more complex reasoning benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[ProtTeX: Structure-In-Context Reasoning and Editing of Proteins with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08179v3)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models have made remarkable progress in the field of molecular science, particularly in understanding and generating functional small molecules. This success is largely attributed to the effectiveness of molecular tokenization strategies. In protein science, the amino acid sequence serves as the sole tokenizer for LLMs. However, many fundamental challenges in protein science are inherently structure-dependent. The absence of structure-aware tokens significantly limits the capabilities of LLMs for comprehensive biomolecular comprehension and multimodal generation. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel framework, ProtTeX, which tokenizes the protein sequences, structures, and textual information into a unified discrete space. This innovative approach enables joint training of the LLM exclusively through the Next-Token Prediction paradigm, facilitating multimodal protein reasoning and generation. ProtTeX enables general LLMs to perceive and process protein structures through sequential text input, leverage structural information as intermediate reasoning components, and generate or manipulate structures via sequential text output. Experiments demonstrate that our model achieves significant improvements in protein function prediction, outperforming the state-of-the-art domain expert model with a twofold increase in accuracy. Our framework enables high-quality conformational generation and customizable protein design. For the first time, we demonstrate that by adopting the standard training and inference pipelines from the LLM domain, ProtTeX empowers decoder-only LLMs to effectively address diverse spectrum of protein-related tasks.</p></details> | 26 pages, 9 figures |

Inspired by the success of Large Language Models (LLMs), NotaGen adopts pre-training, fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning paradigms (henceforth referred to as the LLM training paradigms). It is pre-trained on 1.6M pieces of music in ABC notation, and then fine-tuned on approximately 9K high-quality classical compositions conditioned on "period-composer-instrumentation" prompts. For reinforcement learning, we propose the CLaMP-DPO method, which further enhances generation quality and controllability without requiring human annotations or predefined rewards. Our experiments demonstrate the efficacy of CLaMP-DPO in symbolic music generation models with different architectures and encoding schemes. Furthermore, subjective A/B tests show that NotaGen outperforms baseline models against human compositions, greatly advancing musical aesthetics in symbolic music generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unlocking Historical Clinical Trial Data with ALIGN: A Compositional Large Language Model System for Medical Coding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13163v2)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The reuse of historical clinical trial data has significant potential to accelerate medical research and drug development. However, interoperability challenges, particularly with missing medical codes, hinders effective data integration across studies. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising solution for automated coding without labeled data, current approaches face challenges on complex coding tasks. We introduce ALIGN, a novel compositional LLM-based system for automated, zero-shot medical coding. ALIGN follows a three-step process: (1) diverse candidate code generation; (2) self-evaluation of codes and (3) confidence scoring and uncertainty estimation enabling human deferral to ensure reliability. We evaluate ALIGN on harmonizing medication terms into Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) and medical history terms into Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) codes extracted from 22 immunology trials. ALIGN outperformed the LLM baselines, while also providing capabilities for trustworthy deployment. For MedDRA coding, ALIGN achieved high accuracy across all levels, matching RAG and excelling at the most specific levels (87-90% for HLGT). For ATC coding, ALIGN demonstrated superior performance, particularly at lower hierarchy levels (ATC Level 4), with 72-73% overall accuracy and 86-89% accuracy for common medications, outperforming baselines by 7-22%. ALIGN's uncertainty-based deferral improved accuracy by 17% to 90% accuracy with 30% deferral, notably enhancing performance on uncommon medications. ALIGN achieves this cost-efficiently at \$0.0007 and \$0.02 per code for GPT-4o-mini and GPT-4o, reducing barriers to clinical adoption. ALIGN advances automated medical coding for clinical trial data, contributing to enhanced data interoperability and reusability, positioning it as a promising tool to improve clinical research and accelerate drug development.</p></details> |  |
| **[New Trends for Modern Machine Translation with Large Reasoning Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10351v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), particularly those leveraging Chain-of-Thought reasoning (CoT), have opened brand new possibility for Machine Translation (MT). This position paper argues that LRMs substantially transformed traditional neural MT as well as LLMs-based MT paradigms by reframing translation as a dynamic reasoning task that requires contextual, cultural, and linguistic understanding and reasoning. We identify three foundational shifts: 1) contextual coherence, where LRMs resolve ambiguities and preserve discourse structure through explicit reasoning over cross-sentence and complex context or even lack of context; 2) cultural intentionality, enabling models to adapt outputs by inferring speaker intent, audience expectations, and socio-linguistic norms; 3) self-reflection, LRMs can perform self-reflection during the inference time to correct the potential errors in translation especially extremely noisy cases, showing better robustness compared to simply mapping X->Y translation. We explore various scenarios in translation including stylized translation, document-level translation and multimodal translation by showcasing empirical examples that demonstrate the superiority of LRMs in translation. We also identify several interesting phenomenons for LRMs for MT including auto-pivot translation as well as the critical challenges such as over-localisation in translation and inference efficiency. In conclusion, we think that LRMs redefine translation systems not merely as text converters but as multilingual cognitive agents capable of reasoning about meaning beyond the text. This paradigm shift reminds us to think of problems in translation beyond traditional translation scenarios in a much broader context with LRMs - what we can achieve on top of it.</p></details> |  |

However, writing automated tests for such REST APIs is challenging because one needs strong and readable tests that exercise the boundary values of the protocol embedded in the REST API. In this paper, we report our experience with using "out of the box" large language models (ChatGPT and GitHub's Copilot) to amplify REST API test suites. We compare the resulting tests based on coverage and understandability, and we derive a series of guidelines and lessons learned concerning the prompts that result in the strongest test suite.</p></details> |  |

Although organizations or enterprises have dedicated personnel responsible for reviewing these logs, it is impossible to manually examine all logs entirely.In response to the vast number of logs, we propose a system called RedChronos, which is a Large Language Model-Based Log Analysis System. This system incorporates innovative improvements over previous research by employing Query-Aware Weighted Voting and a Semantic Expansion-based Genetic Algorithm with LLM-driven Mutations. On the public datasets CERT 4.2 and 5.2, RedChronos outperforms or matches existing approaches in terms of accuracy, precision, and detection rate. Moreover, RedChronos reduces the need for manual intervention in security log reviews by approximately 90% in the Xiaohongshu Security Operation Center. Therefore, our RedChronos system demonstrates exceptional performance in handling IDT tasks, providing innovative solutions for these challenges. We believe that future research can continue to enhance the system's performance in IDT tasks while also reducing the response time to internal risk events.</p></details> |  |

However, their training remains computationally expensive and exhibits instabilities, some of which are expected to be caused by finite-precision computations. We provide a theoretical analysis of the impact of round-off errors within the forward pass of a transformer architecture which yields fundamental bounds for these effects. In addition, we conduct a series of numerical experiments which demonstrate the practical relevance of our bounds. Our results yield concrete guidelines for choosing hyperparameters that mitigate round-off errors, leading to more robust and stable inference.</p></details> |  |
| **[ATRNet-STAR: A Large Dataset and Benchmark Towards Remote Sensing Object Recognition in the Wild](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13354v4)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The absence of publicly available, large-scale, high-quality datasets for Synthetic Aperture Radar Automatic Target Recognition (SAR ATR) has significantly hindered the application of rapidly advancing deep learning techniques, which hold huge potential to unlock new capabilities in this field. This is primarily because collecting large volumes of diverse target samples from SAR images is prohibitively expensive, largely due to privacy concerns, the characteristics of microwave radar imagery perception, and the need for specialized expertise in data annotation. Throughout the history of SAR ATR research, there have been only a number of small datasets, mainly including targets like ships, airplanes, buildings, etc. There is only one vehicle dataset MSTAR collected in the 1990s, which has been a valuable source for SAR ATR. To fill this gap, this paper introduces a large-scale, new dataset named ATRNet-STAR with 40 different vehicle categories collected under various realistic imaging conditions and scenes. It marks a substantial advancement in dataset scale and diversity, comprising over 190,000 well-annotated samples, 10 times larger than its predecessor, the famous MSTAR. Building such a large dataset is a challenging task, and the data collection scheme will be detailed. Secondly, we illustrate the value of ATRNet-STAR via extensively evaluating the performance of 15 representative methods with 7 different experimental settings on challenging classification and detection benchmarks derived from the dataset. Finally, based on our extensive experiments, we identify valuable insights for SAR ATR and discuss potential future research directions in this field. We hope that the scale, diversity, and benchmark of ATRNet-STAR can significantly facilitate the advancement of SAR ATR.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 14 figures; ATRNet-STAR: https://github.com/waterdisappear/ATRNet-STAR</p></details> |
| **[FaVChat: Unlocking Fine-Grained Facial Video Understanding with Multimodal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09158v2)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video-based multimodal large language models (VMLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential in cross-modal video understanding. However, their abilities in fine-grained face comprehension remain largely underexplored. Given its pivotal role in human-centric intelligence, developing VMLLMs for facial understanding holds a fundamental problem. To address this gap, we propose FaVChat, the first VMLLM specifically designed for fine-grained facial video understanding. To facilitate its training, we construct a large-scale facial video dataset comprising over 60k videos, with the majority annotated with 83 fine-grained facial attributes. These attributes are incorporated to enrich GPT-4o-generated captions, yielding 60k high-quality video-summary pairs and an additional 170k fine-grained question-answering (QA) pairs. To effectively capture rich facial clues, we propose a hybrid model architecture composed of a general visual encoder, a dedicated facial encoder, and a mixture-of-experts-enhanced adapter for adaptive fusion of multi-source visual features. To mitigate information loss during feature transformation, we extract multi-granularity representations from the facial encoder and integrate them into the subsequent LLM. This design enhances the model's ability to comprehend and respond to questions involving diverse levels of visual details. We employ a progressive training paradigm, transitioning from video summarization to a high-quality subset of video QA, gradually increasing task complexity to enhance the model's fine-grained visual perception. We conduct extensive zero-shot evaluation on a couple of public benchmarks, demonstrating that FaVChat consistently surpasses existing VMLLMs across multiple tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[HexiScale: Accommodating Large Language Model Training over Heterogeneous Environment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01143v2)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training large language model (LLM) is a computationally intensive task, which is typically conducted in data centers with homogeneous high-performance GPUs. We explore an alternative approach by deploying training computations across heterogeneous GPUs to enable better flexibility and efficiency for heterogeneous resource utilization. To achieve this goal, we propose a novel system, HexiScale, that can flexibly support asymmetric partition of training computations in the scope of data-, pipeline-, and tensor model parallelism. We further formalize the allocation of asymmetric partitioned training computations over a set of heterogeneous GPUs as a constrained optimization problem and propose an efficient hierarchical graph partitioning algorithm. Our approach effectively allocates training computations across GPUs, fully leveraging the available computational power. We conduct empirical studies to evaluate the performance of HexiScale with state-of-the-art homogeneous and heterogeneous training systems. When training LLMs at different scales (from 7B to 30B), HexiScale achieves comparable MFU when running over heterogeneous GPUs compared to state-of-the-art training systems running over homogeneous high-performance GPUs with the same total peak FLOPS. The percentage gaps in MFU between HexiScale and comparable homogeneous settings are as low as $0.3\%$, with an average of $3.5\%$.</p></details> |  |
| **[$ShiftwiseConv:$ Small Convolutional Kernel with Large Kernel Effect](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12736v2)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large kernels make standard convolutional neural networks (CNNs) great again over transformer architectures in various vision tasks. Nonetheless, recent studies meticulously designed around increasing kernel size have shown diminishing returns or stagnation in performance. Thus, the hidden factors of large kernel convolution that affect model performance remain unexplored. In this paper, we reveal that the key hidden factors of large kernels can be summarized as two separate components: extracting features at a certain granularity and fusing features by multiple pathways. To this end, we leverage the multi-path long-distance sparse dependency relationship to enhance feature utilization via the proposed Shiftwise (SW) convolution operator with a pure CNN architecture. In a wide range of vision tasks such as classification, segmentation, and detection, SW surpasses state-of-the-art transformers and CNN architectures, including SLaK and UniRepLKNet. More importantly, our experiments demonstrate that $3 \times 3$ convolutions can replace large convolutions in existing large kernel CNNs to achieve comparable effects, which may inspire follow-up works.

| **[ImageScope: Unifying Language-Guided Image Retrieval via Large Multimodal Model Collective Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10166v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the proliferation of images in online content, language-guided image retrieval (LGIR) has emerged as a research hotspot over the past decade, encompassing a variety of subtasks with diverse input forms. While the development of large multimodal models (LMMs) has significantly facilitated these tasks, existing approaches often address them in isolation, requiring the construction of separate systems for each task. This not only increases system complexity and maintenance costs, but also exacerbates challenges stemming from language ambiguity and complex image content, making it difficult for retrieval systems to provide accurate and reliable results. To this end, we propose ImageScope, a training-free, three-stage framework that leverages collective reasoning to unify LGIR tasks. The key insight behind the unification lies in the compositional nature of language, which transforms diverse LGIR tasks into a generalized text-to-image retrieval process, along with the reasoning of LMMs serving as a universal verification to refine the results. To be specific, in the first stage, we improve the robustness of the framework by synthesizing search intents across varying levels of semantic granularity using chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. In the second and third stages, we then reflect on retrieval results by verifying predicate propositions locally, and performing pairwise evaluations globally. Experiments conducted on six LGIR datasets demonstrate that ImageScope outperforms competitive baselines. Comprehensive evaluations and ablation studies further confirm the effectiveness of our design.</p></details> | WWW 2025 |

However, existing RS MLLMs lack the pixel-level dialogue capability, which involves responding to user instructions with segmentation masks for specific instances. In this paper, we propose GeoPix, a RS MLLM that extends image understanding capabilities to the pixel level. This is achieved by equipping the MLLM with a mask predictor, which transforms visual features from the vision encoder into masks conditioned on the LLM's segmentation token embeddings. To facilitate the segmentation of multi-scale objects in RS imagery, a class-wise learnable memory module is integrated into the mask predictor to capture and store class-wise geo-context at the instance level across the entire dataset. In addition, to address the absence of large-scale datasets for training pixel-level RS MLLMs, we construct the GeoPixInstruct dataset, comprising 65,463 images and 140,412 instances, with each instance annotated with text descriptions, bounding boxes, and masks. Furthermore, we develop a two-stage training strategy to balance the distinct requirements of text generation and masks prediction in multi-modal multi-task optimization. Extensive experiments verify the effectiveness and superiority of GeoPix in pixel-level segmentation tasks, while also maintaining competitive performance in image- and region-level benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

Moreover, we introduce LS-CAD, a new large-scale CAD dataset to support our experiments, with each floorplan covering around 1,000 square meters, significantly larger than previous benchmarks.

Accelerated by a standardized collection pipeline with human-in-the-loop verification, AgiBot World guarantees high-quality and diverse data distribution.

This study evaluates structured reasoning techniques-Chain-of-Thought (CoT), Self-Consistency (SC-CoT), and Tree-of-Thought (ToT)-to improve classification accuracy across multiple mental health datasets sourced from Reddit. We analyze reasoning-driven prompting strategies, including Zero-shot CoT and Few-shot CoT, using key performance metrics such as Balanced Accuracy, F1 score, and Sensitivity/Specificity. Our findings indicate that reasoning-enhanced techniques improve classification performance over direct prediction, particularly in complex cases. Compared to baselines such as Zero Shot non-CoT Prompting, and fine-tuned pre-trained transformers such as BERT and Mental-RoBerta, and fine-tuned Open Source LLMs such as Mental Alpaca and Mental-Flan-T5, reasoning-driven LLMs yield notable gains on datasets like Dreaddit (+0.52\% over M-LLM, +0.82\% over BERT) and SDCNL (+4.67\% over M-LLM, +2.17\% over BERT). However, performance declines in Depression Severity, and CSSRS predictions suggest dataset-specific limitations, likely due to our using a more extensive test set. Among prompting strategies, Few-shot CoT consistently outperforms others, reinforcing the effectiveness of reasoning-driven LLMs. Nonetheless, dataset variability highlights challenges in model reliability and interpretability. This study provides a comprehensive benchmark of reasoning-based LLM techniques for mental health text classification. It offers insights into their potential for scalable clinical applications while identifying key challenges for future improvements.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 4 Figures, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[TPO: Aligning Large Language Models with Multi-branch & Multi-step Preference Trees](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12854v2)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the domain of complex reasoning tasks, such as mathematical reasoning, recent advancements have proposed the use of Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to suppress output of dispreferred responses, thereby enhancing the long-chain reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). To this end, these studies employed LLMs to generate preference trees via Tree-of-thoughts (ToT) and sample the paired preference responses required by the DPO algorithm. However, the DPO algorithm based on binary preference optimization is unable to learn multiple responses with varying degrees of preference/dispreference that provided by the preference trees, resulting in incomplete preference learning. In this work, we introduce Tree Preference Optimization (TPO), that does not sample paired preference responses from the preference tree; instead, it directly learns from the entire preference tree during the fine-tuning. Specifically, TPO formulates the language model alignment as a Preference List Ranking problem, where the policy can potentially learn more effectively from a ranked preference list of responses given the prompt. In addition, to further assist LLMs in identifying discriminative steps within long-chain reasoning and increase the relative reward margin in the preference list, TPO utilizes Adaptive Step Reward to adjust the reward values of each step in trajectory for performing fine-grained preference optimization. We carry out extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning tasks to evaluate TPO. The experimental results indicate that TPO consistently outperforms DPO across five public large language models on four datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Representation-based Reward Modeling for Efficient Safety Alignment of Large Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10093v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms for safety alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs), such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), encounter the challenge of distribution shift. Current approaches typically address this issue through online sampling from the target policy, which requires significant computational resources. In this paper, we hypothesize that during off-policy training, while the ranking order of output generated by policy changes, their overall distribution remains relatively stable. This stability allows the transformation of the sampling process from the target policy into a re-ranking of preference data. Building on this hypothesis, We propose a new framework that leverages the model's intrinsic safety judgment capability to extract reward signals, which are then used to calculate label confidence for preferences reordering. Extensive experimental results and theoretical analysis demonstrate that the proposed method effectively addresses the distribution shift issue, remarkably enhancing the safety performance while reducing about 300x computational overheads.</p></details> |  |

In particular, we identify that existing pre-training strategies for monolithic MLLMs often suffer from unstable optimization or catastrophic forgetting. To address this issue, our core idea is to embed a new visual parameter space into a pre-trained LLM, thereby stably learning visual knowledge from noisy data while freezing the LLM. Based on this principle, we present Mono-InternVL, a novel monolithic MLLM that seamlessly integrates a set of visual experts via a multimodal mixture-of-experts structure. Moreover, we propose an innovative pre-training strategy to maximize the visual capability of Mono-InternVL, namely Endogenous Visual Pre-training (EViP). In particular, EViP is designed as a progressive learning process for visual experts, which aims to fully exploit the visual knowledge from noisy data to high-quality data. To validate our approach, we conduct extensive experiments on 16 benchmarks. Experimental results confirm the superior performance of Mono-InternVL than existing monolithic MLLMs on 13 of 16 multimodal benchmarks, e.g., +80 points over Emu3 on OCRBench. Compared to the modular baseline, i.e., InternVL-1.5, Mono-InternVL still retains comparable multimodal performance while reducing up to 67% first token latency.

However, the practical use of open-source LLMs is hindered by high resource requirements, making deployment expensive and limiting widespread development. The collaborative inference is a promising solution for this problem, in which users collaborate by each hosting a subset of layers and transmitting intermediate activation. Many companies are building collaborative inference platforms to reduce LLM serving costs, leveraging users' underutilized GPUs. Despite widespread interest in collaborative inference within academia and industry, the privacy risks associated with LLM collaborative inference have not been well studied. This is largely because of the challenge posed by inverting LLM activation due to its strong non-linearity. In this paper, to validate the severity of privacy threats in LLM collaborative inference, we introduce the concept of prompt inversion attack (PIA), where a malicious participant intends to recover the input prompt through the activation transmitted by its previous participant. Extensive experiments show that our PIA method substantially outperforms existing baselines. For example, our method achieves an 88.4\% token accuracy on the Skytrax dataset with the Llama-65B model when inverting the maximum number of transformer layers, while the best baseline method only achieves 22.8\% accuracy. The results verify the effectiveness of our PIA attack and highlights its practical threat to LLM collaborative inference systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear at IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy 2025</p></details> |

Recently, deep learning models have been proposed as alternatives. However, these models require some domain knowledge and extensive hyperparameter tuning as well as lacking interpretability, which is crucial in practice when transparency of the learned mechanisms is mandatory. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach, named LLMMech, that addresses these limitations by incorporating large language models (LLMs) into an evolutionary framework for generating interpretable, hyperparameter-free, empirically strategyproof, and nearly optimal mechanisms. Our experimental results, evaluated on various problem settings where the social cost is arbitrarily weighted across agents and the agent preferences may not be uniformly distributed, demonstrate that the LLM-generated mechanisms generally outperform existing handcrafted baselines and deep learning models. Furthermore, the mechanisms exhibit impressive generalizability to out-of-distribution agent preferences and to larger instances with more agents.</p></details> | Under Review |

Traditionally, tree models have dominated in handling tabular data. However, financial datasets in the industry often encounter some challenges, such as data heterogeneity, the predominance of numerical features and the large scale of the data, which can range from tens of millions to hundreds of millions of records. These challenges can lead to significant memory and computational issues when using tree-based models. Consequently, there is a growing need for neural network-based solutions that can outperform these models. In this paper, we introduce TKGMLP, an hybrid network for tabular data that combines shallow Kolmogorov Arnold Networks with Gated Multilayer Perceptron. This model leverages the strengths of both architectures to improve performance and scalability. We validate TKGMLP on a real-world credit scoring dataset, where it achieves state-of-the-art results and outperforms current benchmarks. Furthermore, our findings demonstrate that the model continues to improve as the dataset size increases, making it highly scalable. Additionally, we propose a novel feature encoding method for numerical data, specifically designed to address the predominance of numerical features in financial datasets. The integration of this feature encoding method within TKGMLP significantly improves prediction accuracy. This research not only advances table prediction technology but also offers a practical and effective solution for handling large-scale numerical tabular data in various industrial applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The formula in section 3.1 contains an error</p></details> |

However, their performance tends to falter when confronted with more challenging programming problems. We observe that conventional models often generate solutions as monolithic code blocks, restricting their effectiveness in tackling intricate questions. To overcome this limitation, we present Modular-of-Thought Coder (MoTCoder). We introduce a pioneering framework for MoT instruction tuning, designed to promote the decomposition of tasks into logical sub-tasks and sub-modules. Our investigations reveal that, through the cultivation and utilization of sub-modules, MoTCoder significantly improves both the modularity and correctness of the generated solutions, leading to substantial relative pass@1 improvements of 12.9% on APPS and 9.43% on CodeContests.

Placing Them in An Extensible Escape Game](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10042v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancing of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has spurred interest in complex multimodal reasoning tasks in the real-world and virtual environment, which require coordinating multiple abilities, including visual perception, visual reasoning, spatial awareness, and target deduction. However, existing evaluations primarily assess the final task completion, often degrading assessments to isolated abilities such as visual grounding and visual question answering. Less attention is given to comprehensively and quantitatively analyzing reasoning process in multimodal environments, which is crucial for understanding model behaviors and underlying reasoning mechanisms beyond merely task success. To address this, we introduce MM-Escape, an extensible benchmark for investigating multimodal reasoning, inspired by real-world escape games. MM-Escape emphasizes intermediate model behaviors alongside final task completion. To achieve this, we develop EscapeCraft, a customizable and open environment that enables models to engage in free-form exploration for assessing multimodal reasoning. Extensive experiments show that MLLMs, regardless of scale, can successfully complete the simplest room escape tasks, with some exhibiting human-like exploration strategies. Yet, performance dramatically drops as task difficulty increases. Moreover, we observe that performance bottlenecks vary across models, revealing distinct failure modes and limitations in their multimodal reasoning abilities, such as repetitive trajectories without adaptive exploration, getting stuck in corners due to poor visual spatial awareness, and ineffective use of acquired props, such as the key. We hope our work sheds light on new challenges in multimodal reasoning, and uncovers potential improvements in MLLMs capabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Reasoning Era: A Survey of Long Chain-of-Thought for Reasoning Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09567v2)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in reasoning with large language models (RLLMs), such as OpenAI-O1 and DeepSeek-R1, have demonstrated their impressive capabilities in complex domains like mathematics and coding. A central factor in their success lies in the application of long chain-of-thought (Long CoT) characteristics, which enhance reasoning abilities and enable the solution of intricate problems. However, despite these developments, a comprehensive survey on Long CoT is still lacking, limiting our understanding of its distinctions from traditional short chain-of-thought (Short CoT) and complicating ongoing debates on issues like "overthinking" and "test-time scaling." This survey seeks to fill this gap by offering a unified perspective on Long CoT. (1) We first distinguish Long CoT from Short CoT and introduce a novel taxonomy to categorize current reasoning paradigms. (2) Next, we explore the key characteristics of Long CoT: deep reasoning, extensive exploration, and feasible reflection, which enable models to handle more complex tasks and produce more efficient, coherent outcomes compared to the shallower Short CoT. (3) We then investigate key phenomena such as the emergence of Long CoT with these characteristics, including overthinking, and test-time scaling, offering insights into how these processes manifest in practice. (4) Finally, we identify significant research gaps and highlight promising future directions, including the integration of multi-modal reasoning, efficiency improvements, and enhanced knowledge frameworks. By providing a structured overview, this survey aims to inspire future research and further the development of logical reasoning in artificial intelligence.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper are available at https://long-cot.github.io/</p></details> |

However, addressing real-world OR problems requires OR experts to perform mathematical modeling and programmers to develop solution algorithms. This traditional method, heavily reliant on experts, is costly and has long development cycles, severely limiting the widespread adoption of OR techniques. Few have considered using Artificial Intelligence (AI) to replace professionals to achieve fully automated solutions for OR problems. We propose OR-LLM-Agent, the first AI agent that enables end-to-end automation for solving real-world OR problems. OR-LLM-Agent leverages the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to translate natural language problem descriptions into formal mathematical models and automatically generate Gurobi solver code. In OR-LLM-Agent, OR-CodeAgent is designed to automate code execution and repair within a sandbox environment, facilitating the derivation of the final solution. Due to the lack of dedicated benchmark datasets for evaluating the automated solving of OR problems, we construct a benchmark dataset comprising 83 real-world OR problems described in natural language. We conduct comparative experiments with state-of-the-art (SOTA) reasoning LLMs, including GPT-o3-mini, DeepSeek-R1, and Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking. The OR-LLM-Agent achieved the highest pass rate of 100% and the highest solution accuracy of 85%, demonstrating the feasibility of automated OR problem-solving.

Traditional KV cache eviction strategies, which discard less critical KV pairs based on attention scores, often degrade generation quality, leading to issues such as context loss or hallucinations. In this work, we introduce Dynamic Discriminative Operations (D2O), a KV cache compression method that optimizes KV cache size dynamically and discriminatively at two levels without fine-tuning, while preserving essential context. At layer level, D2O leverages the varying densities of attention weights between shallow and deep layers to dynamically determine which layers should avoid excessive eviction via a novel dynamic allocation strategy to minimize information loss. At token level, D2O incorporates a compensation mechanism that maintains a similarity threshold to re-discriminate the importance of currently discarded tokens, determining whether they should be recalled and merged with similar tokens. We conduct experiments on various benchmarks and LLM architectures. Our results show that D2O not only achieves significant memory savings and enhances inference throughput by more than 3$\times$ but also maintains high-quality long-text generation.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |

The quality of the provided demonstrations significantly influences the success of downstream inference tasks. Current unsupervised CoT methods primarily select examples based on the semantics of the questions, which can introduce noise and lack interpretability. In this paper, we propose leveraging reasoning patterns to enhance CoT prompting effectiveness. Reasoning patterns represent the process by which language models arrive at their final results. By utilizing prior knowledge and prompt-based methods from large models, we first construct task-specific pattern sets. We then select diverse demonstrations based on different reasoning patterns. This approach not only mitigates the impact of noise but also provides explicit interpretability to help us understand the mechanisms of CoT. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method is more robust and consistently leads to improvements across various reasoning tasks.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces MedHallBench, a comprehensive benchmark framework for evaluating and mitigating hallucinations in MLLMs. Our methodology integrates expert-validated medical case scenarios with established medical databases to create a robust evaluation dataset. The framework employs a sophisticated measurement system that combines automated ACHMI (Automatic Caption Hallucination Measurement in Medical Imaging) scoring with rigorous clinical expert evaluations and utilizes reinforcement learning methods to achieve automatic annotation. Through an optimized reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) training pipeline specifically designed for medical applications, MedHallBench enables thorough evaluation of MLLMs across diverse clinical contexts while maintaining stringent accuracy standards. We conducted comparative experiments involving various models, utilizing the benchmark to establish a baseline for widely adopted large language models (LLMs). Our findings indicate that ACHMI provides a more nuanced understanding of the effects of hallucinations compared to traditional metrics, thereby highlighting its advantages in hallucination assessment. This research establishes a foundational framework for enhancing MLLMs' reliability in healthcare settings and presents actionable strategies for addressing the critical challenge of AI hallucinations in medical applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published to AAAI-25 Bridge Program</p></details> |

Knowledge Graphs (KGs), which capture vast amounts of facts in a structured format, offer a reliable source of knowledge for reasoning. However, existing KG-based LLM reasoning methods face challenges like handling multi-hop reasoning, multi-entity questions, and effectively utilizing graph structures. To address these issues, we propose Paths-over-Graph (PoG), a novel method that enhances LLM reasoning by integrating knowledge reasoning paths from KGs, improving the interpretability and faithfulness of LLM outputs. PoG tackles multi-hop and multi-entity questions through a three-phase dynamic multi-hop path exploration, which combines the inherent knowledge of LLMs with factual knowledge from KGs. In order to improve the efficiency, PoG prunes irrelevant information from the graph exploration first and introduces efficient three-step pruning techniques that incorporate graph structures, LLM prompting, and a pre-trained language model (e.g., SBERT) to effectively narrow down the explored candidate paths. This ensures all reasoning paths contain highly relevant information captured from KGs, making the reasoning faithful and interpretable in problem-solving. PoG innovatively utilizes graph structure to prune the irrelevant noise and represents the first method to implement multi-entity deep path detection on KGs for LLM reasoning tasks. Comprehensive experiments on five benchmark KGQA datasets demonstrate PoG outperforms the state-of-the-art method ToG across GPT-3.5-Turbo and GPT-4, achieving an average accuracy improvement of 18.9%. Notably, PoG with GPT-3.5-Turbo surpasses ToG with GPT-4 by up to 23.9%.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by The Web Conference 2025 (WWW, 2025)</p></details> |

Mapping Scientific Research with Knowledge Graphs and Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09894v1)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The scientific literature's exponential growth makes it increasingly challenging to navigate and synthesize knowledge across disciplines. Large language models (LLMs) are powerful tools for understanding scientific text, but they fail to capture detailed relationships across large bodies of work. Unstructured approaches, like retrieval augmented generation, can sift through such corpora to recall relevant facts; however, when millions of facts influence the answer, unstructured approaches become cost prohibitive. Structured representations offer a natural complement -- enabling systematic analysis across the whole corpus. Recent work enhances LLMs with unstructured or semistructured representations of scientific concepts; to complement this, we try extracting structured representations using LLMs. By combining LLMs' semantic understanding with a schema of scientific concepts, we prototype a system that answers precise questions about the literature as a whole. Our schema applies across scientific fields and we extract concepts from it using only 20 manually annotated abstracts. To demonstrate the system, we extract concepts from 30,000 papers on arXiv spanning astrophysics, fluid dynamics, and evolutionary biology. The resulting database highlights emerging trends and, by visualizing the knowledge graph, offers new ways to explore the ever-growing landscape of scientific knowledge.

However, their robustness and reliability in real-world applications remain under-explored, particularly concerning their susceptibility to adversarial attacks. In this paper, we introduce a targeted adversarial attack framework for LLM-based time series forecasting. By employing both gradient-free and black-box optimization methods, we generate minimal yet highly effective perturbations that significantly degrade the forecasting accuracy across multiple datasets and LLM architectures. Our experiments, which include models like LLMTime with GPT-3.5, GPT-4, LLaMa, and Mistral, TimeGPT, and TimeLLM show that adversarial attacks lead to much more severe performance degradation than random noise, and demonstrate the broad effectiveness of our attacks across different LLMs. The results underscore the critical vulnerabilities of LLMs in time series forecasting, highlighting the need for robust defense mechanisms to ensure their reliable deployment in practical applications.

More recently, topological data analysis popularized the use of simplicial complexes to represent data topology with two main methodologies: topological inference with geometric complexes and large-scale topology visualization with Mapper graphs -- central to these is the nerve construction from topology, which builds a simplicial complex given a cover of a space by subsets. While successful, these have limitations: geometric complexes scale poorly with data size, and Mapper graphs can be hard to tune and only contain low dimensional information. In this paper, we propose to study the problem of learning covers in its own right, and from the perspective of optimization. We describe a method for learning topologically-faithful covers of geometric datasets, and show that the simplicial complexes thus obtained can outperform standard topological inference approaches in terms of size, and Mapper-type algorithms in terms of representation of large-scale topology.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, 17 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

However, many cases do not interact with the healthcare system, posing significant challenges for traditional surveillance methods. The growth of publicly available online restaurant reviews and advancements in large language models (LLMs) present potential opportunities to extend disease surveillance by identifying public reports of GI illness. In this study, we introduce a novel annotation schema, developed with experts in GI illness, applied to the Yelp Open Dataset of reviews. Our annotations extend beyond binary disease detection, to include detailed extraction of information on symptoms and foods. We evaluate the performance of open-weight LLMs across these three tasks: GI illness detection, symptom extraction, and food extraction. We compare this performance to RoBERTa-based classification models fine-tuned specifically for these tasks. Our results show that using prompt-based approaches, LLMs achieve micro-F1 scores of over 90% for all three of our tasks. Using prompting alone, we achieve micro-F1 scores that exceed those of smaller fine-tuned models. We further demonstrate the robustness of LLMs in GI illness detection across three bias-focused experiments. Our results suggest that publicly available review text and LLMs offer substantial potential for public health surveillance of GI illness by enabling highly effective extraction of key information. While LLMs appear to exhibit minimal bias in processing, the inherent limitations of restaurant review data highlight the need for cautious interpretation of results.</p></details> | 20 pages |

Modern techniques typically rely on large models for representing general knowledge of one or several languages (Large Language Models, LLMs), or for representing speech and general audio characteristics. These models have been trained with large amounts of speech and language data, typically including web content. When humans interact with such technologies, the effectiveness of the interaction will be influenced by how far humans make use of the same type of language the models have been trained on or, in other words, if the models are able to generalize to the language used by humans when interacting with the technology. This may lead to some gradual forms of adaptation in human speech and language production, and users who do not adapt may be excluded from efficient use of such technologies. On top of this, as commercial model development follows market needs, under-represented languages and dialects/sociolects may decrease in terms of priorities. Furthermore, for many lesser spoken languages the necessary data is not available, which will worsen a digital divide in speech and language technology usage. The workshop sets out to discuss this problem based on scientific contributions from the perspective of computer science and linguistics (including computational linguistics and NLP).</p></details> |  |

However, with the rapid iteration of OS, finding the proper configurations that meet specific requirements can be challenging, which can be primarily attributed to the default kernel provided by vendors does not take the requirements of specific workloads into account, and the heavyweight tuning process cannot catch up with the rapid evolving pace of the kernel. To address these challenges, we propose BYOS, a novel framework powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) to customize kernel configurations for diverse user requirements. By integrating OS-oriented Dual-layer Knowledge Graph (OD-KG) and corresponding reasoning strategy, BYOS enhanced the LLM's understanding of the characteristics and capabilities of OS, thus enabling customized, cost-effective, and convenient generation of kernel configurations. Experiments show that the kernels configured by BYOS outperform the default vendor-configured kernels by 7.1% to 155.4%, demonstrating the effectiveness and efficiency of BYOS in customizing kernel configurations.

In this paper, we introduce CryptoX, an evaluation framework that, for the first time, combines existing benchmarks and cryptographic, to quantify the compositional reasoning capacity of LLMs. Building upon CryptoX, we construct CryptoBench, which integrates these principles into several benchmarks for systematic evaluation. We conduct detailed experiments on widely used open-source and closed-source LLMs using CryptoBench, revealing a huge gap between open-source and closed-source LLMs. We further conduct thorough mechanical interpretability experiments to reveal the inner mechanism of LLMs' compositional reasoning, involving subproblem decomposition, subproblem inference, and summarizing subproblem conclusions. Through analysis based on CryptoBench, we highlight the value of independently studying compositional reasoning and emphasize the need to enhance the compositional reasoning capabilities of LLMs.</p></details> |  |

Here, we explore the potential of LLMs to perform symbolic regression -- a machine-learning method for finding simple and accurate equations from datasets. We prompt GPT-4 to suggest expressions from data, which are then optimized and evaluated using external Python tools. These results are fed back to GPT-4, which proposes improved expressions while optimizing for complexity and loss. Using chain-of-thought prompting, we instruct GPT-4 to analyze the data, prior expressions, and the scientific context (expressed in natural language) for each problem before generating new expressions. We evaluated the workflow in rediscovery of five well-known scientific equations from experimental data, and on an additional dataset without a known equation. GPT-4 successfully rediscovered all five equations, and in general, performed better when prompted to use a scratchpad and consider scientific context. We demonstrate how strategic prompting improves the model's performance and how the natural language interface simplifies integrating theory with data. We also observe how theory can sometimes offset noisy data and, in other cases, data can make up for poor context. Although this approach does not outperform established SR programs where target equations are more complex, LLMs can nonetheless iterate toward improved solutions while following instructions and incorporating scientific context in natural language.</p></details> |  |

This process has established itself as a suitable joining tool for metallic materials due to its non-contact processing, short cycle times, and small heat-affected zones. One potential problem, however, is the formation of solidification cracks, which particularly affects alloys with a pronounced melting range. Since solidification cracking is influenced by both temperature and strain rate, precise measurement technologies are of crucial importance. For this purpose, as an experimental setup, a Controlled Tensile Weldability (CTW) test combined with a local deformation measurement technique is used. The aim of the present work is the development of computational methods and software tools to numerically simulate the CTW. The numerical results are compared with those obtained from the experimental CTW. In this study, an austenitic stainless steel sheet is selected. A thermo-elastoplastic material behavior with temperature-dependent material parameters is assumed. The time-dependent problem is first discretized in time and then the resulting nonlinear problem is linearized with Newton's method. For the discretization in space, finite elements are used. In order to obtain a sufficiently accurate solution, a large number of finite elements has to be used. In each Newton step, this yields a large linear system of equations that has to be solved. Therefore, a highly parallel scalable solver framework, based on the software library PETSc, was used to solve this computationally challenging problem on a high-performance computing architecture. Finally, the experimental results and the numerical simulations are compared, showing to be qualitatively in good agreement.</p></details> |  |

Existing solutions are biased toward only well-trained objects, creating a gap when dealing with new objects. Currently, HRI systems using predefined gestures or language tokens for pretrained objects pose challenges for all individuals, especially elderly ones. These challenges include difficulties in recalling commands, memorizing hand gestures, and learning new names. This paper introduces NVP-HRI, an intuitive multi-modal HRI paradigm that combines voice commands and deictic posture. NVP-HRI utilizes the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to analyze visual cues and depth data, enabling precise structural object representation. Through a pre-trained SAM network, NVP-HRI allows interaction with new objects via zero-shot prediction, even without prior knowledge. NVP-HRI also integrates with a large language model (LLM) for multimodal commands, coordinating them with object selection and scene distribution in real time for collision-free trajectory solutions. We also regulate the action sequence with the essential control syntax to reduce LLM hallucination risks. The evaluation of diverse real-world tasks using a Universal Robot showcased up to 59.2\% efficiency improvement over traditional gesture control, as illustrated in the video https://youtu.be/EbC7al2wiAc.

However, due to their limited inherent causal reasoning ability, LLMs still face challenges in handling tasks that require robust causal reasoning ability, such as health-care and economic analysis. As a result, a growing body of research has focused on enhancing the causal reasoning ability of LLMs. Despite the booming research, there lacks a survey to well review the challenges, progress and future directions in this area. To bridge this significant gap, we systematically review literature on how to strengthen LLMs' causal reasoning ability in this paper. We start from the introduction of background and motivations of this topic, followed by the summarisation of key challenges in this area. Thereafter, we propose a novel taxonomy to systematically categorise existing methods, together with detailed comparisons within and between classes of methods. Furthermore, we summarise existing benchmarks and evaluation metrics for assessing LLMs' causal reasoning ability. Finally, we outline future research directions for this emerging field, offering insights and inspiration to researchers and practitioners in the area.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM-PS: Empowering Large Language Models for Time Series Forecasting with Temporal Patterns and Semantics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09656v1)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time Series Forecasting (TSF) is critical in many real-world domains like financial planning and health monitoring. Recent studies have revealed that Large Language Models (LLMs), with their powerful in-contextual modeling capabilities, hold significant potential for TSF. However, existing LLM-based methods usually perform suboptimally because they neglect the inherent characteristics of time series data. Unlike the textual data used in LLM pre-training, the time series data is semantically sparse and comprises distinctive temporal patterns. To address this problem, we propose LLM-PS to empower the LLM for TSF by learning the fundamental \textit{Patterns} and meaningful \textit{Semantics} from time series data. Our LLM-PS incorporates a new multi-scale convolutional neural network adept at capturing both short-term fluctuations and long-term trends within the time series. Meanwhile, we introduce a time-to-text module for extracting valuable semantics across continuous time intervals rather than isolated time points. By integrating these patterns and semantics, LLM-PS effectively models temporal dependencies, enabling a deep comprehension of time series and delivering accurate forecasts. Intensive experimental results demonstrate that LLM-PS achieves state-of-the-art performance in both short- and long-term forecasting tasks, as well as in few- and zero-shot settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Prompt Inference Attack on Distributed Large Language Model Inference Frameworks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09291v1)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The inference process of modern large language models (LLMs) demands prohibitive computational resources, rendering them infeasible for deployment on consumer-grade devices. To address this limitation, recent studies propose distributed LLM inference frameworks, which employ split learning principles to enable collaborative LLM inference on resource-constrained hardware. However, distributing LLM layers across participants requires the transmission of intermediate outputs, which may introduce privacy risks to the original input prompts - a critical issue that has yet to be thoroughly explored in the literature. In this paper, we rigorously examine the privacy vulnerabilities of distributed LLM inference frameworks by designing and evaluating three prompt inference attacks aimed at reconstructing input prompts from intermediate LLM outputs. These attacks are developed under various query and data constraints to reflect diverse real-world LLM service scenarios. Specifically, the first attack assumes an unlimited query budget and access to an auxiliary dataset sharing the same distribution as the target prompts. The second attack also leverages unlimited queries but uses an auxiliary dataset with a distribution differing from the target prompts. The third attack operates under the most restrictive scenario, with limited query budgets and no auxiliary dataset available. We evaluate these attacks on a range of LLMs, including state-of-the-art models such as Llama-3.2 and Phi-3.5, as well as widely-used models like GPT-2 and BERT for comparative analysis. Our experiments show that the first two attacks achieve reconstruction accuracies exceeding 90%, while the third achieves accuracies typically above 50%, even under stringent constraints. These findings highlight privacy risks in distributed LLM inference frameworks, issuing a strong alert on their deployment in real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we present Crowdsourced Homophily Ties Based Graph Annotation via Large Language Model (CSA-LLM), a novel approach that combines the strengths of crowdsourced annotations with the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to enhance the graph annotation process. CSA-LLM harnesses the structural context of graph data by integrating information from 1-hop and 2-hop neighbors. By emphasizing homophily ties - key connections that signify similarity within the graph - CSA-LLM significantly improves the accuracy of annotations. Experimental results demonstrate that this method enhances the performance of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) by delivering more precise and reliable annotations.</p></details> |  |

This study investigates how large language models (LLMs) can enhance teacher preparation by incorporating them with Gagne's Nine Events of Instruction, especially in the field of mathematics education in compulsory education. It investigates two distinct methodologies: the development of Chain of Thought (CoT) prompts to direct LLMs in generating content that aligns with instructional events, and the application of fine-tuning approaches like Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to enhance model performance. This research starts with creating a comprehensive dataset based on math curriculum standards and Gagne's instructional events. The first method involves crafting CoT-optimized prompts to generate detailed, logically coherent responses from LLMs, improving their ability to create educationally relevant content. The second method uses specialized datasets to fine-tune open-source models, enhancing their educational content generation and analysis capabilities. This study contributes to the evolving dialogue on the integration of AI in education, illustrating innovative strategies for leveraging LLMs to bolster teaching and learning processes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large-scale Regional Traffic Signal Control Based on Single-Agent Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09252v1)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the context of global urbanization and motorization, traffic congestion has become a significant issue, severely affecting the quality of life, environment, and economy. This paper puts forward a single-agent reinforcement learning (RL)-based regional traffic signal control (TSC) model. Different from multi - agent systems, this model can coordinate traffic signals across a large area, with the goals of alleviating regional traffic congestion and minimizing the total travel time. The TSC environment is precisely defined through specific state space, action space, and reward functions. The state space consists of the current congestion state, which is represented by the queue lengths of each link, and the current signal phase scheme of intersections. The action space is designed to select an intersection first and then adjust its phase split. Two reward functions are meticulously crafted. One focuses on alleviating congestion and the other aims to minimize the total travel time while considering the congestion level. The experiments are carried out with the SUMO traffic simulation software. The performance of the TSC model is evaluated by comparing it with a base case where no signal-timing adjustments are made. The results show that the model can effectively control congestion. For example, the queuing length is significantly reduced in the scenarios tested. Moreover, when the reward is set to both alleviate congestion and minimize the total travel time, the average travel time is remarkably decreased, which indicates that the model can effectively improve traffic conditions. This research provides a new approach for large-scale regional traffic signal control and offers valuable insights for future urban traffic management.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 8 figures. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2503.02279</p></details> |
| **[Rethinking Prompt-based Debiasing in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09219v1)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Investigating bias in large language models (LLMs) is crucial for developing trustworthy AI. While prompt-based through prompt engineering is common, its effectiveness relies on the assumption that models inherently understand biases. Our study systematically analyzed this assumption using the BBQ and StereoSet benchmarks on both open-source models as well as commercial GPT model. Experimental results indicate that prompt-based is often superficial; for instance, the Llama2-7B-Chat model misclassified over 90% of unbiased content as biased, despite achieving high accuracy in identifying bias issues on the BBQ dataset. Additionally, specific evaluation and question settings in bias benchmarks often lead LLMs to choose "evasive answers", disregarding the core of the question and the relevance of the response to the context. Moreover, the apparent success of previous methods may stem from flawed evaluation metrics. Our research highlights a potential "false prosperity" in prompt-base efforts and emphasizes the need to rethink bias metrics to ensure truly trustworthy AI.</p></details> |  |

To address this limitation, this paper introduces VECOGEN, a novel tool that combines large language models with formal verification to automate the generation of formally verified C programs. VECOGEN takes a formal specification in ANSI/ISO C Specification Language, a natural language specification, and a set of test cases to attempt to generate a verified program. This program-generation process consists of two steps. First, VECOGEN generates an initial set of candidate programs. Secondly, the tool iteratively improves on previously generated candidates. If a candidate program meets the formal specification, then we are sure the program.is correct. We evaluate VECOGEN on 15 problems presented in Codeforces competitions. On these problems, VECOGEN solves 13 problems. This work shows the potential of combining large language models with formal verification to automate program generation.</p></details> |  |

This paper addresses the challenge of predicting the spreading factor (SF) in LoRaWAN networks using machine learning (ML) techniques. Optimal SF allocation is crucial for optimizing data transmission in IoT-enabled mobile devices, yet it remains a challenging task due to the fluctuation in environment and network conditions. We evaluated ML model performance across a large publicly available dataset to explore the best feature across key LoRaWAN features such as RSSI, SNR, frequency, distance between end devices and gateways, and antenna height of the end device, further, we also experimented with 31 different combinations possible for 5 features. We trained and evaluated the model using k-nearest neighbors (k-NN), Decision Tree Classifier (DTC), Random Forest (RF), and Multinomial Logistic Regression (MLR) algorithms. The combination of RSSI and SNR was identified as the best feature set. The finding of this paper provides valuable information for reducing the overall cost of dataset collection for ML model training and extending the battery life of LoRaWAN devices. This work contributes to a more reliable LoRaWAN system by understanding the importance of specific feature sets for optimized SF allocation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at 31st National Conference on Communications</p></details> |
| **[Can open source large language models be used for tumor documentation in Germany? -- An evaluation on urological doctors' notes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12106v2)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tumor documentation in Germany is largely done manually, requiring reading patient records and entering data into structured databases. Large language models (LLMs) could potentially enhance this process by improving efficiency and reliability. This evaluation tests eleven different open source LLMs with sizes ranging from 1-70 billion model parameters on three basic tasks of the tumor documentation process: identifying tumor diagnoses, assigning ICD-10 codes, and extracting the date of first diagnosis. For evaluating the LLMs on these tasks, a dataset of annotated text snippets based on anonymized doctors' notes from urology was prepared. Different prompting strategies were used to investigate the effect of the number of examples in few-shot prompting and to explore the capabilities of the LLMs in general. The models Llama 3.1 8B, Mistral 7B, and Mistral NeMo 12 B performed comparably well in the tasks. Models with less extensive training data or having fewer than 7 billion parameters showed notably lower performance, while larger models did not display performance gains. Examples from a different medical domain than urology could also improve the outcome in few-shot prompting, which demonstrates the ability of LLMs to handle tasks needed for tumor documentation. Open source LLMs show a strong potential for automating tumor documentation. Models from 7-12 billion parameters could offer an optimal balance between performance and resource efficiency. With tailored fine-tuning and well-designed prompting, these models might become important tools for clinical documentation in the future. The code for the evaluation is available from https://github.com/stefan-m-lenz/UroLlmEval. We also release the dataset as a new valuable resource that addresses the shortage of authentic and easily accessible benchmarks in German-language medical NLP.</p></details> | 48 pages, 5 figures |
| **[ANLS* -- A Universal Document Processing Metric for Generative Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03848v9)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditionally, discriminative models have been the predominant choice for tasks like document classification and information extraction. These models make predictions that fall into a limited number of predefined classes, facilitating a binary true or false evaluation and enabling the direct calculation of metrics such as the F1 score. However, recent advancements in generative large language models (GLLMs) have prompted a shift in the field due to their enhanced zero-shot capabilities, which eliminate the need for a downstream dataset and computationally expensive fine-tuning. However, evaluating GLLMs presents a challenge as the binary true or false evaluation used for discriminative models is not applicable to the predictions made by GLLMs. This paper introduces a new metric for generative models called ANLS* for evaluating a wide variety of tasks, including information extraction and classification tasks. The ANLS* metric extends existing ANLS metrics as a drop-in-replacement and is still compatible with previously reported ANLS scores. An evaluation of 7 different datasets, and more than 20 different GLLMs together with 3 different prompting methods using the ANLS* metric is also provided, demonstrating the importance of the proposed metric. We also benchmark a novel approach to generate prompts for documents, called SFT, against other prompting techniques such as LATIN. In almost all cases, SFT outperforms other techniques and improves the state-of-the-art, sometimes by as much as $10$ percentage points.

Although some current works have achieved satisfactory results in the task of single-person dance generation, the field of multi-person dance generation remains relatively novel. In this work, we present a group choreography framework that leverages recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLM) by modeling the group dance generation problem as a sequence-to-sequence translation task. Our framework consists of a tokenizer that transforms continuous features into discrete tokens, and an LLM that is fine-tuned to predict motion tokens given the audio tokens. We show that by proper tokenization of input modalities and careful design of the LLM training strategies, our framework can generate realistic and diverse group dances while maintaining strong music correlation and dancer-wise consistency. Extensive experiments and evaluations demonstrate that our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[GRU: Mitigating the Trade-off between Unlearning and Retention for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09117v1)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model (LLM) unlearning has demonstrated its essential role in removing privacy and copyright-related responses, crucial for their legal and safe applications. However, the pursuit of complete unlearning often comes with substantial costs due to its compromises in their general functionality, leading to a notorious trade-off between unlearning and retention. In examining the update process for unlearning dynamically, we find gradients hold essential information for revealing this trade-off. In particular, we look at the varying relationship between retention performance and directional disparities between gradients during unlearning. It motivates the sculpting of an update mechanism derived from gradients from two sources, i.e., harmful for retention and useful for unlearning. Accordingly, we propose Gradient Rectified Unlearning (GRU), an enhanced unlearning framework controlling the updating gradients in a geometry-focused and optimization-driven manner such that their side impacts on other, unrelated responses can be minimized. Specifically, GRU derives a closed-form solution to project the unlearning gradient onto the orthogonal space of that gradient harmful for retention, ensuring minimal deviation from its original direction under the condition that overall performance is retained. Comprehensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate that GRU, as a general framework, is straightforward to implement and efficiently enhances a range of baseline methods through its adaptable and compatible characteristics. Additionally, experimental results show its broad effectiveness across a diverse set of benchmarks for LLM unlearning.</p></details> |  |

KBQA is considered a challenging task, particularly in parsing intricate questions into executable logical forms. Traditional semantic parsing (SP)-based methods require extensive data annotations, which result in significant costs. Recently, the advent of few-shot in-context learning, powered by large language models (LLMs), has showcased promising capabilities. However, fully leveraging LLMs to parse questions into logical forms in low-resource scenarios poses a substantial challenge. To tackle these hurdles, we introduce Interactive-KBQA, a framework designed to generate logical forms through direct interaction with knowledge bases (KBs). Within this framework, we have developed three generic APIs for KB interaction. For each category of complex question, we devised exemplars to guide LLMs through the reasoning processes. Our method achieves competitive results on the WebQuestionsSP, ComplexWebQuestions, KQA Pro, and MetaQA datasets with a minimal number of examples (shots). Importantly, our approach supports manual intervention, allowing for the iterative refinement of LLM outputs. By annotating a dataset with step-wise reasoning processes, we showcase our model's adaptability and highlight its potential for contributing significant enhancements to the field.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been accepted by the ACL 2024 main conference.

This study proposes a novel meta-surrogate framework to assist many-task optimization, by leveraging the knowledge transfer strengths and emergent capabilities of large language models (LLMs). We formulate a unified framework for many-task fitness prediction, by defining a universal model with metadata to fit a group of problems. Fitness prediction is performed on metadata and decision variables, enabling efficient knowledge sharing across tasks and adaptability to new tasks. The LLM-based meta-surrogate treats fitness prediction as conditional probability estimation, employing a unified token sequence representation for task metadata, inputs, and outputs. This approach facilitates efficient inter-task knowledge sharing through shared token embeddings and captures complex task dependencies via multi-task model training. Experimental results demonstrate the model's emergent generalization ability, including zero-shot performance on problems with unseen dimensions. When integrated into evolutionary transfer optimization (ETO), our framework supports dual-level knowledge transfer -- at both the surrogate and individual levels -- enhancing optimization efficiency and robustness. This work establishes a novel foundation for applying LLMs in surrogate modeling, offering a versatile solution for many-task optimization.</p></details> | 13 pages |

Despite their effectiveness in modeling KG structural information, KRL methods are suffering from the sparseness of KGs. The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) built on the Transformer architecture presents promising opportunities for enhancing KRL by incorporating textual information to address information sparsity in KGs. LLM-enhanced KRL methods, including three key approaches, encoder-based methods that leverage detailed contextual information, encoder-decoder-based methods that utilize a unified Seq2Seq model for comprehensive encoding and decoding, and decoder-based methods that utilize extensive knowledge from large corpora, have significantly advanced the effectiveness and generalization of KRL in addressing a wide range of downstream tasks. This work provides a broad overview of downstream tasks while simultaneously identifying emerging research directions in these evolving domains.</p></details> |  |

In addition, saved checkpoints are dispatched to evaluation tasks or transferred across different training stages (e.g., from pre-training to post-training). All these scenarios require resharding distributed checkpoints from one parallelism to another. In production environments, different LFMs are trained with various frameworks and storage backends, depending on model sizes and training scales. A high-performance checkpointing system is needed to enable efficient checkpoint management at scale throughout the lifecycle of LFM development. We introduce ByteCheckpoint, an industrial-grade checkpointing system for large-scale LFM training. ByteCheckpoint features: a parallelism-agnostic checkpoint representation that enables efficient load-time checkpoint resharding; a generic checkpoint saving/loading workflow to accommodate multiple training frameworks and support different storage backends; full-stack optimizations to ensure high I/O efficiency and scalability; a suite of monitoring tools to streamline large-scale performance analysis and bottleneck detection. Compared to existing open-source checkpointing systems [52, 58], ByteCheckpoint significantly reduces runtime checkpoint stalls, achieving an average reduction of 54.20x. For saving and loading times, ByteCheckpoint achieves improvements of up to 9.96x and 8.80x, respectively.</p></details> |  |

Therefore, this work proposes a difficulty-aware self-training (DAST) framework that focuses on improving both the quantity and quality of self-generated responses on challenging queries during self-training. DAST is specified in three components: 1) sampling-based difficulty level estimation, 2) difficulty-aware data augmentation, and 3) the self-training algorithm using SFT and DPO respectively. Experiments on mathematical tasks demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization of DAST, highlighting the critical role of difficulty-aware strategies in advancing LLM self-training.</p></details> |  |

Unlike images, videos possess an additional temporal dimension, which harbors considerable redundant information, making condensation even more crucial. However, video dataset condensation still remains an underexplored area. We aim to bridge this gap by providing a large-scale study with systematic design and fair comparison. Specifically, our work delves into three key aspects to provide valuable empirical insights: (1) temporal processing of video data, (2) the evaluation protocol for video dataset condensation, and (3) adaptation of condensation algorithms to the space-time domain. From this study, we derive several intriguing observations: (i) labeling methods greatly influence condensation performance, (ii) simple sliding-window sampling is effective for temporal processing, and (iii) dataset distillation methods perform better in challenging scenarios, while sample selection methods excel in easier ones. Furthermore, we propose a unified evaluation protocol for the fair comparison of different condensation algorithms and achieve state-of-the-art results on four widely-used action recognition datasets: HMDB51, UCF101, SSv2 and K400.

| **[Enhancing High-Quality Code Generation in Large Language Models with Comparative Prefix-Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09020v1)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have been widely adopted in commercial code completion engines, significantly enhancing coding efficiency and productivity. However, LLMs may generate code with quality issues that violate coding standards and best practices, such as poor code style and maintainability, even when the code is functionally correct. This necessitates additional effort from developers to improve the code, potentially negating the efficiency gains provided by LLMs. To address this problem, we propose a novel comparative prefix-tuning method for controllable high-quality code generation. Our method introduces a single, property-specific prefix that is prepended to the activations of the LLM, serving as a lightweight alternative to fine-tuning. Unlike existing methods that require training multiple prefixes, our approach trains only one prefix and leverages pairs of high-quality and low-quality code samples, introducing a sequence-level ranking loss to guide the model's training. This comparative approach enables the model to better understand the differences between high-quality and low-quality code, focusing on aspects that impact code quality. Additionally, we design a data construction pipeline to collect and annotate pairs of high-quality and low-quality code, facilitating effective training. Extensive experiments on the Code Llama 7B model demonstrate that our method improves code quality by over 100% in certain task categories, while maintaining functional correctness. We also conduct ablation studies and generalization experiments, confirming the effectiveness of our method's components and its strong generalization capability.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we introduce Cumulative Reasoning (CR), an approach that utilizes LLMs cumulatively and iteratively, mirroring human thought processes for problem-solving. CR decomposes tasks into smaller, manageable components and leverages previous propositions for effective composition, significantly enhancing problem-solving capabilities. We demonstrate CR's advantage through several complex reasoning tasks: it outperforms existing methods in logical inference tasks with up to a 9.3% improvement, achieving 98.04% accuracy on the curated FOLIO wiki dataset. In the Game of 24, it achieves 98% accuracy, marking a 24% improvement over the prior state-of-the-art. In solving MATH problems, CR achieves a 4.2% increase from previous methods and a 43% relative improvement in the most challenging level 5 problems. When incorporating a code environment with CR, we further harness LLMs' reasoning capabilities and outperform the Program of Thought (PoT) method by 38.8%.

Current evaluations primarily compare models employing global attention (e.g., graph transformers) with those using local neighborhood aggregation (e.g., message-passing neural networks) without a direct measurement of long-range dependency. In this work, we introduce City-Networks, a novel large-scale transductive learning dataset derived from real-world city roads. This dataset features graphs with over $10^5$ nodes and significantly larger diameters than those in existing benchmarks, naturally embodying long-range information. We annotate the graphs using an eccentricity-based approach, ensuring that the classification task inherently requires information from distant nodes. Furthermore, we propose a model-agnostic measurement based on the Jacobians of neighbors from distant hops, offering a principled quantification of long-range dependencies. Finally, we provide theoretical justifications for both our dataset design and the proposed measurement - particularly by focusing on over-smoothing and influence score dilution - which establishes a robust foundation for further exploration of long-range interactions in graph neural networks.</p></details> | work in progress |

| **[Siamese Foundation Models for Crystal Structure Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10471v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Crystal Structure Prediction (CSP), which aims to generate stable crystal structures from compositions, represents a critical pathway for discovering novel materials. While structure prediction tasks in other domains, such as proteins, have seen remarkable progress, CSP remains a relatively underexplored area due to the more complex geometries inherent in crystal structures. In this paper, we propose Siamese foundation models specifically designed to address CSP. Our pretrain-finetune framework, named DAO, comprises two complementary foundation models: DAO-G for structure generation and DAO-P for energy prediction. Experiments on CSP benchmarks (MP-20 and MPTS-52) demonstrate that our DAO-G significantly surpasses state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods across all metrics. Extensive ablation studies further confirm that DAO-G excels in generating diverse polymorphic structures, and the dataset relaxation and energy guidance provided by DAO-P are essential for enhancing DAO-G's performance. When applied to three real-world superconductors ($\text{CsV}_3\text{Sb}_5$, $ \text{Zr}_{16}\text{Rh}_8\text{O}_4$ and $\text{Zr}_{16}\text{Pd}_8\text{O}_4$) that are known to be challenging to analyze, our foundation models achieve accurate critical temperature predictions and structure generations. For instance, on $\text{CsV}_3\text{Sb}_5$, DAO-G generates a structure close to the experimental one with an RMSE of 0.0085; DAO-P predicts the $T_c$ value with high accuracy (2.26 K vs. the ground-truth value of 2.30 K). In contrast, conventional DFT calculators like Quantum Espresso only successfully derive the structure of the first superconductor within an acceptable time, while the RMSE is nearly 8 times larger, and the computation speed is more than 1000 times slower. These compelling results collectively highlight the potential of our approach for advancing materials science research and development.</p></details> |  |

We develop a framework - the "Society of HiveMind" (SOHM) - that orchestrates the interaction between multiple AI foundation models, imitating the observed behavior of animal swarms in nature by following modern evolutionary theories. On the one hand, we find that the SOHM provides a negligible benefit on tasks that mainly require real-world knowledge. On the other hand, we remark a significant improvement on tasks that require intensive logical reasoning, indicating that multi-agent systems are capable of increasing the reasoning capabilities of the collective compared to the individual agents. Our findings demonstrate the potential of combining a multitude of diverse AI foundation models to form an artificial swarm intelligence capable of self-improvement through interactions with a given environment.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages (excl. appendix)</p></details> |
| **[RoMA: Scaling up Mamba-based Foundation Models for Remote Sensing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10392v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in self-supervised learning for Vision Transformers (ViTs) have fueled breakthroughs in remote sensing (RS) foundation models. However, the quadratic complexity of self-attention poses a significant barrier to scalability, particularly for large models and high-resolution images. While the linear-complexity Mamba architecture offers a promising alternative, existing RS applications of Mamba remain limited to supervised tasks on small, domain-specific datasets. To address these challenges, we propose RoMA, a framework that enables scalable self-supervised pretraining of Mamba-based RS foundation models using large-scale, diverse, unlabeled data. RoMA enhances scalability for high-resolution images through a tailored auto-regressive learning strategy, incorporating two key innovations: 1) a rotation-aware pretraining mechanism combining adaptive cropping with angular embeddings to handle sparsely distributed objects with arbitrary orientations, and 2) multi-scale token prediction objectives that address the extreme variations in object scales inherent to RS imagery. Systematic empirical studies validate that Mamba adheres to RS data and parameter scaling laws, with performance scaling reliably as model and data size increase. Furthermore, experiments across scene classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation tasks demonstrate that RoMA-pretrained Mamba models consistently outperform ViT-based counterparts in both accuracy and computational efficiency. The source code and pretrained models will be released at https://github.com/MiliLab/RoMA.</p></details> |  |

This makes it impossible to introduce implementation and optimization techniques that are provably correct and, in fact, has led to discrepancies between different implementations. Moreover, it precludes studying fundamental properties of different languages (e.g., expressive power). To address this gap, this paper introduces a language-agnostic algebra for capturing mapping definitions. As further contributions, we show that the popular mapping language RML can be translated into our algebra (by which we also provide a formal definition of the semantics of RML) and we prove several algebraic rewriting rules that can be used to optimize mapping plans based on our algebra.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is an extended version of a research paper accepted for the 22nd Extended Semantic Web Conference (ESWC 2025).

| **[ReVLA: Reverting Visual Domain Limitation of Robotic Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15250v2)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent progress in large language models and access to large-scale robotic datasets has sparked a paradigm shift in robotics models transforming them into generalists able to adapt to various tasks, scenes, and robot modalities. A large step for the community are open Vision Language Action models which showcase strong performance in a wide variety of tasks. In this work, we study the visual generalization capabilities of three existing robotic foundation models, and propose a corresponding evaluation framework. Our study shows that the existing models do not exhibit robustness to visual out-of-domain scenarios. This is potentially caused by limited variations in the training data and/or catastrophic forgetting, leading to domain limitations in the vision foundation models. We further explore OpenVLA, which uses two pre-trained vision foundation models and is, therefore, expected to generalize to out-of-domain experiments. However, we showcase catastrophic forgetting by DINO-v2 in OpenVLA through its failure to fulfill the task of depth regression. To overcome the aforementioned issue of visual catastrophic forgetting, we propose a gradual backbone reversal approach founded on model merging. This enables OpenVLA which requires the adaptation of the visual backbones during initial training -- to regain its visual generalization ability. Regaining this capability enables our ReVLA model to improve over OpenVLA by a factor of 77% and 66% for grasping and lifting in visual OOD tasks .</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICRA-2025, Atlanta</p></details> |

Despite significant efforts to build real-world simulators, the application of generative models to virtual worlds, like financial markets, remains under-explored. In financial markets, generative models can simulate complex market effects of participants with various behaviors, enabling interaction under different market conditions, and training strategies without financial risk. This simulation relies on the finest structured data in financial market like orders thus building the finest realistic simulation. We propose Large Market Model (LMM), an order-level generative foundation model, for financial market simulation, akin to language modeling in the digital world. Our financial Market Simulation engine (MarS), powered by LMM, addresses the domain-specific need for realistic, interactive and controllable order generation. Key observations include LMM's strong scalability across data size and model complexity, and MarS's robust and practicable realism in controlled generation with market impact. We showcase MarS as a forecast tool, detection system, analysis platform, and agent training environment, thus demonstrating MarS's "paradigm shift" potential for a variety of financial applications. We release the code of MarS at https://github.com/microsoft/MarS/.</p></details> | <details><summary>35 pa...</summary><p>35 pages, 26 figures, ICLR 2025</p></details> |

A Holistic Embodied Cognition Benchmark](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05031v2)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The enhancement of generalization in robots by large vision-language models (LVLMs) is increasingly evident. Therefore, the embodied cognitive abilities of LVLMs based on egocentric videos are of great interest. However, current datasets for embodied video question answering lack comprehensive and systematic evaluation frameworks. Critical embodied cognitive issues, such as robotic self-cognition, dynamic scene perception, and hallucination, are rarely addressed. To tackle these challenges, we propose ECBench, a high-quality benchmark designed to systematically evaluate the embodied cognitive abilities of LVLMs. ECBench features a diverse range of scene video sources, open and varied question formats, and 30 dimensions of embodied cognition. To ensure quality, balance, and high visual dependence, ECBench uses class-independent meticulous human annotation and multi-round question screening strategies. Additionally, we introduce ECEval, a comprehensive evaluation system that ensures the fairness and rationality of the indicators. Utilizing ECBench, we conduct extensive evaluations of proprietary, open-source, and task-specific LVLMs. ECBench is pivotal in advancing the embodied cognitive capabilities of LVLMs, laying a solid foundation for developing reliable core models for embodied agents.

Traditional single-modality approaches often fail to leverage the complementary insights provided by radiological and pathological assessments. In this work, we introduce M4Survive (Multi-Modal Mamba Modeling for Survival Prediction), a novel framework that learns joint foundation model representations using efficient adapter networks. Our approach dynamically fuses heterogeneous embeddings from a foundation model repository (e.g., MedImageInsight, BiomedCLIP, Prov-GigaPath, UNI2-h), creating a correlated latent space optimized for survival risk estimation. By leveraging Mamba-based adapters, M4Survive enables efficient multi-modal learning while preserving computational efficiency. Experimental evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms both unimodal and traditional static multi-modal baselines in survival prediction accuracy. This work underscores the potential of foundation model-driven multi-modal fusion in advancing precision oncology and predictive analytics.</p></details> | 10 pages |

The advancement of deep learning has facilitated the creation of numerous medical datasets with diverse expert-level annotations. Aggregating these datasets can maximize data utilization and address the inadequacy of labeled data. However, the heterogeneity of expert-level annotations across tasks such as classification, localization, and segmentation presents a significant challenge for learning from these datasets. To this end, we introduce nFoundation X, an end-to-end framework that utilizes diverse expert-level annotations from numerous public datasets to train a foundation model capable of multiple tasks including classification, localization, and segmentation. To address the challenges of annotation and task heterogeneity, we propose a Lock-Release pretraining strategy to enhance the cyclic learning from multiple datasets, combined with the student-teacher learning paradigm, ensuring the model retains general knowledge for all tasks while preventing overfitting to any single task. To demonstrate the effectiveness of Foundation X, we trained a model using 11 chest X-ray datasets, covering annotations for classification, localization, and segmentation tasks. Our experimental results show that Foundation X achieves notable performance gains through extensive annotation utilization, excels in cross-dataset and cross-task learning, and further enhances performance in organ localization and segmentation tasks.

As vision foundation models (VFMs) increasingly serve as the backbone of vision applications, it remains unclear how SSL interacts with these pre-trained models. To address this gap, we develop new SSL benchmark datasets where frozen VFMs underperform and systematically evaluate representative SSL methods. We make a surprising observation: parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) using only labeled data often matches SSL performance, even without leveraging unlabeled data. This motivates us to revisit self-training, a conceptually simple SSL baseline, where we use the supervised PEFT model to pseudo-label unlabeled data for further training. To overcome the notorious issue of noisy pseudo-labels, we propose ensembling multiple PEFT approaches and VFM backbones to produce more robust pseudo-labels. Empirical results validate the effectiveness of this simple yet powerful approach, providing actionable insights into SSL with VFMs and paving the way for more scalable and practical semi-supervised learning in the era of foundation models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Parameter-Efficient Adaptation of Geospatial Foundation Models through Embedding Deflection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09493v1)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As large-scale heterogeneous data sets become increasingly available, adapting foundation models at low cost has become a key issue. Seminal works in natural language processing, e.g. Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), leverage the low "intrinsic rank" of parameter updates during adaptation. In this paper, we argue that incorporating stronger inductive biases in both data and models can enhance the adaptation of Geospatial Foundation Models (GFMs), pretrained on RGB satellite images, to other types of optical satellite data. Specifically, the pretrained parameters of GFMs serve as a strong prior for the spatial structure of multispectral images. For this reason, we introduce DEFLECT (Deflecting Embeddings for Finetuning Latent representations for Earth and Climate Tasks), a novel strategy for adapting GFMs to multispectral satellite imagery with very few additional parameters. DEFLECT improves the representation capabilities of the extracted features, particularly enhancing spectral information, which is essential for geoscience and environmental-related tasks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method across three different GFMs and five diverse datasets, ranging from forest monitoring to marine environment segmentation. Compared to competing methods, DEFLECT achieves on-par or higher accuracy with 5-10$\times$ fewer parameters for classification and segmentation tasks. The code will be made publicly available.</p></details> |  |

For this reason, they are susceptible to the memorization and subsequent reproduction of training samples. In this paper, we introduce a training-as-compressing perspective, wherein the model's weights embody a compressed representation of the training data. From a copyright standpoint, this point of view implies that the weights can be considered a reproduction or, more likely, a derivative work of a potentially protected set of works. We investigate the technical and legal challenges that emerge from this framing of the copyright of outputs generated by foundation models, including their implications for practitioners and researchers. We demonstrate that adopting an information-centric approach to the problem presents a promising pathway for tackling these emerging complex legal issues.</p></details> | <details><summary>Spotl...</summary><p>Spotlight presentation at GenLaw'24, see https://www.genlaw.org/2024-icml-papers#training-foundation-models-as-data-compression-on-information-model-weights-and-copyright-law</p></details> |
| **[Towards Graph Foundation Models: A Transferability Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09363v1)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, Graph Foundation Models (GFMs) have gained significant attention for their potential to generalize across diverse graph domains and tasks. Some works focus on Domain-Specific GFMs, which are designed to address a variety of tasks within a specific domain, while others aim to create General-Purpose GFMs that extend the capabilities of domain-specific models to multiple domains. Regardless of the type, transferability is crucial for applying GFMs across different domains and tasks. However, achieving strong transferability is a major challenge due to the structural, feature, and distributional variations in graph data. To date, there has been no systematic research examining and analyzing GFMs from the perspective of transferability. To bridge the gap, we present the first comprehensive taxonomy that categorizes and analyzes existing GFMs through the lens of transferability, structuring GFMs around their application scope (domain-specific vs. general-purpose) and their approaches to knowledge acquisition and transfer. We provide a structured perspective on current progress and identify potential pathways for advancing GFM generalization across diverse graph datasets and tasks. We aims to shed light on the current landscape of GFMs and inspire future research directions in GFM development.</p></details> |  |

Despite recent advancements in foundation model adaptation to monocular depth estimation of endoscopic scenes via self-supervised learning (SSL), no prior work has explored their use for pose estimation. These methods rely on low rank-based adaptation approaches, which constrain model updates to a low-rank space. We propose Endo-FASt3r, the first monocular SSL depth and pose estimation framework that uses foundation models for both tasks. We extend the Reloc3r relative pose estimation foundation model by designing Reloc3rX, introducing modifications necessary for convergence in SSL. We also present DoMoRA, a novel adaptation technique that enables higher-rank updates and faster convergence. Experiments on the SCARED dataset show that Endo-FASt3r achieves a substantial $10\%$ improvement in pose estimation and a $2\%$ improvement in depth estimation over prior work. Similar performance gains on the Hamlyn and StereoMIS datasets reinforce the generalisability of Endo-FASt3r across different datasets.</p></details> |  |

LLM-Based Curation for a Data-Efficient Audio-Video Foundation Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09205v1)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Integrating audio and visual data for training multimodal foundational models remains challenging. We present Audio-Video Vector Alignment (AVVA), which aligns audiovisual (AV) scene content beyond mere temporal synchronization via a Large Language Model (LLM)-based data curation pipeline. Specifically, AVVA scores and selects high-quality training clips using Whisper (speech-based audio foundation model) for audio and DINOv2 for video within a dual-encoder contrastive learning framework. Evaluations on AudioCaps, VALOR, and VGGSound demonstrate that this approach can achieve significant accuracy gains with substantially less curated data. For instance, AVVA yields a 7.6% improvement in top-1 accuracy for audio-to-video retrieval on VGGSound compared to ImageBind, despite training on only 192 hours of carefully filtered data (vs. 5800+ hours). Moreover, an ablation study highlights that trading data quantity for data quality improves performance, yielding respective top-3 accuracy increases of 47.8, 48.4, and 58.0 percentage points on AudioCaps, VALOR, and VGGSound over uncurated baselines. While these results underscore AVVA's data efficiency, we also discuss the overhead of LLM-driven curation and how it may be scaled or approximated in larger domains. Overall, AVVA provides a viable path toward more robust, text-free audiovisual learning with improved retrieval accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 5 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

Recently, publicly available material data repositories have grown rapidly. This growth encompasses not only more materials but also a greater variety and quantity of their associated properties. Existing machine learning efforts in materials science focus primarily on single-modality tasks, i.e. relationships between materials and a single physical property, thus not taking advantage of the rich and multimodal set of material properties. Here, we introduce Multimodal Learning for Materials (MultiMat), which enables self-supervised multi-modality training of foundation models for materials. We demonstrate our framework's potential using data from the Materials Project database on multiple axes: (i) MultiMat achieves state-of-the-art performance for challenging material property prediction tasks; (ii) MultiMat enables novel and accurate material discovery via latent space similarity, enabling screening for stable materials with desired properties; and (iii) MultiMat encodes interpretable emergent features that may provide novel scientific insights.</p></details> | 12 pages, 4 figures |

While early developments centered on uni-modal models trained solely on visual data, recent advances have highlighted the promise of multi-modal foundation models that integrate heterogeneous data sources such as textual reports, structured domain knowledge, and molecular profiles. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive and up-to-date review of multi-modal foundation models in CPath, with a particular focus on models built upon hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained whole slide images (WSIs) and tile-level representations. We categorize 32 state-of-the-art multi-modal foundation models into three major paradigms: vision-language, vision-knowledge graph, and vision-gene expression. We further divide vision-language models into non-LLM-based and LLM-based approaches. Additionally, we analyze 28 available multi-modal datasets tailored for pathology, grouped into image-text pairs, instruction datasets, and image-other modality pairs. Our survey also presents a taxonomy of downstream tasks, highlights training and evaluation strategies, and identifies key challenges and future directions. We aim for this survey to serve as a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners working at the intersection of pathology and AI.</p></details> |  |

In addition, saved checkpoints are dispatched to evaluation tasks or transferred across different training stages (e.g., from pre-training to post-training). All these scenarios require resharding distributed checkpoints from one parallelism to another. In production environments, different LFMs are trained with various frameworks and storage backends, depending on model sizes and training scales. A high-performance checkpointing system is needed to enable efficient checkpoint management at scale throughout the lifecycle of LFM development. We introduce ByteCheckpoint, an industrial-grade checkpointing system for large-scale LFM training. ByteCheckpoint features: a parallelism-agnostic checkpoint representation that enables efficient load-time checkpoint resharding; a generic checkpoint saving/loading workflow to accommodate multiple training frameworks and support different storage backends; full-stack optimizations to ensure high I/O efficiency and scalability; a suite of monitoring tools to streamline large-scale performance analysis and bottleneck detection. Compared to existing open-source checkpointing systems [52, 58], ByteCheckpoint significantly reduces runtime checkpoint stalls, achieving an average reduction of 54.20x. For saving and loading times, ByteCheckpoint achieves improvements of up to 9.96x and 8.80x, respectively.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing robot foundation models rely solely on 2D image observations, ignoring 3D geometric information, which is essential for robots to perceive and reason about the 3D world. In this paper, we introduce FP3, a first large-scale 3D foundation policy model for robotic manipulation. FP3 builds on a scalable diffusion transformer architecture and is pre-trained on 60k trajectories with point cloud observations. With the model design and diverse pre-training data, FP3 can be efficiently fine-tuned for downstream tasks while exhibiting strong generalization capabilities. Experiments on real robots demonstrate that with only 80 demonstrations, FP3 is able to learn a new task with over 90% success rates in novel environments with unseen objects, significantly surpassing existing robot foundation models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website: https://3d-foundation-policy.github.io</p></details> |

Analogously, substantial evidence suggests that the human visual system (HVS) is influenced by the statistical distribution of colors and patterns in the natural world, characteristics also present in the training data of foundation models. The question we address in this paper is whether foundation models trained on natural images mimic some of the low-level characteristics of the human visual system, such as contrast detection, contrast masking, and contrast constancy. Specifically, we designed a protocol comprising nine test types to evaluate the image encoders of 45 foundation and generative models. Our results indicate that some foundation models (e.g., DINO, DINOv2, and OpenCLIP), share some of the characteristics of human vision, but other models show little resemblance. Foundation models tend to show smaller sensitivity to low contrast and rather irregular responses to contrast across frequencies. The foundation models show the best agreement with human data in terms of contrast masking. Our findings suggest that human vision and computer vision may take both similar and different paths when learning to interpret images of the real world. Overall, while differences remain, foundation models trained on vision tasks start to align with low-level human vision, with DINOv2 showing the closest resemblance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2025</p></details> |

Specifically, YuE scales to trillions of tokens and generates up to five minutes of music while maintaining lyrical alignment, coherent musical structure, and engaging vocal melodies with appropriate accompaniment. It achieves this through (1) track-decoupled next-token prediction to overcome dense mixture signals, (2) structural progressive conditioning for long-context lyrical alignment, and (3) a multitask, multiphase pre-training recipe to converge and generalize. In addition, we redesign the in-context learning technique for music generation, enabling versatile style transfer (e.g., converting Japanese city pop into an English rap while preserving the original accompaniment) and bidirectional generation. Through extensive evaluation, we demonstrate that YuE matches or even surpasses some of the proprietary systems in musicality and vocal agility. In addition, fine-tuning YuE enables additional controls and enhanced support for tail languages. Furthermore, beyond generation, we show that YuE's learned representations can perform well on music understanding tasks, where the results of YuE match or exceed state-of-the-art methods on the MARBLE benchmark.

In this work, we show that advances in generative modeling, photorealistic rendering, and procedural generation allow us to tackle tasks requiring both. By generating contact-rich trajectories with accurate physics in semantically-diverse simulations, we can distill behaviors into large multimodal models that directly transfer to the real world: a system we call Proc4Gem. Specifically, we show that a foundation model, Gemini, fine-tuned on only simulation data, can be instructed in language to control a quadruped robot to push an object with its body to unseen targets in unseen real-world environments. Our real-world results demonstrate the promise of using simulation to imbue foundation models with physical agency.

The coding sequence as well as the Untranslated Regions (UTRs) of an mRNA can strongly influence translation efficiency, stability, degradation, and other factors that collectively determine a vaccine's effectiveness. However, optimizing mRNA sequences for those properties remains a complex challenge. Existing deep learning models often focus solely on coding region optimization, overlooking the UTRs. We present Helix-mRNA, a structured state-space-based and attention hybrid model to address these challenges. In addition to a first pre-training, a second pre-training stage allows us to specialise the model with high-quality data. We employ single nucleotide tokenization of mRNA sequences with codon separation, ensuring prior biological and structural information from the original mRNA sequence is not lost. Our model, Helix-mRNA, outperforms existing methods in analysing both UTRs and coding region properties. It can process sequences 6x longer than current approaches while using only 10% of the parameters of existing foundation models. Its predictive capabilities extend to all mRNA regions.

Fueled by this progress, these models are becoming the prevailing approach for a wide array of real-world vision problems, including risk-sensitive and high-stakes applications. However, ensuring safe deployment in these scenarios requires a more comprehensive understanding of their uncertainty modeling capabilities, which has been barely explored. In this work, we delve into the behaviour of vision and vision-language foundation models under Conformal Prediction (CP), a statistical framework that provides theoretical guarantees of marginal coverage of the true class. Across extensive experiments including popular vision classification benchmarks, well-known foundation vision models, and three CP methods, our findings reveal that foundation models are well-suited for conformalization procedures, particularly those integrating Vision Transformers. We also show that calibrating the confidence predictions of these models, a popular strategy to improve their uncertainty quantification, actually leads to efficiency degradation of the conformal set on adaptive CP methods. Furthermore, few-shot adaptation of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to downstream tasks, whose popularity is surging, enhances conformal scores compared to zero-shot predictions. Last, our empirical study exposes APS as particularly promising in the context of vision foundation models, as it does not violate the marginal coverage guarantees across multiple challenging, yet realistic scenarios.</p></details> |  |

We explored different supervised fine-tuning techniques to adapt our model to downstream tasks, resulting in performance comparable to or surpassing current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in tasks like atrial fibrillation detection. A standout feature of our GPT model is its inherent capability to perform generative tasks such as signal denoising effectively, without the need for further fine-tuning. This success is attributed to the generative nature of the GPT framework.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can Generative Geospatial Diffusion Models Excel as Discriminative Geospatial Foundation Models?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07890v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-supervised learning (SSL) has revolutionized representation learning in Remote Sensing (RS), advancing Geospatial Foundation Models (GFMs) to leverage vast unlabeled satellite imagery for diverse downstream tasks. Currently, GFMs primarily focus on discriminative objectives, such as contrastive learning or masked image modeling, owing to their proven success in learning transferable representations. However, generative diffusion models--which demonstrate the potential to capture multi-grained semantics essential for RS tasks during image generation--remain underexplored for discriminative applications. This prompts the question: can generative diffusion models also excel and serve as GFMs with sufficient discriminative power? In this work, we answer this question with SatDiFuser, a framework that transforms a diffusion-based generative geospatial foundation model into a powerful pretraining tool for discriminative RS. By systematically analyzing multi-stage, noise-dependent diffusion features, we develop three fusion strategies to effectively leverage these diverse representations. Extensive experiments on remote sensing benchmarks show that SatDiFuser outperforms state-of-the-art GFMs, achieving gains of up to +5.7% mIoU in semantic segmentation and +7.9% F1-score in classification, demonstrating the capacity of diffusion-based generative foundation models to rival or exceed discriminative GFMs. Code will be released.</p></details> |  |

Our approach derives two distinct lower bounds: i) for the downstream task space, such as classification, optimised using conditional and marginal cross-entropy alongside Kullback-Leibler divergence, and ii) for the latent space representation, regularised and aligned using a contrastive-like decomposition. This fine-tuning strategy retains the pre-trained structure of the foundation model, modifying only a specialised projector module comprising a small transformer and a token aggregation technique. Experiments on several datasets demonstrate significant improvements in classification tasks under extremely low-labelled conditions by effectively leveraging unlabelled data.</p></details> |  |

However, prevalent models such as Flux, SD3.5 and Midjourney, still grapple with issues like model bias, limited text rendering capabilities, and insufficient understanding of Chinese cultural nuances. To address these limitations, we present Seedream 2.0, a native Chinese-English bilingual image generation foundation model that excels across diverse dimensions, which adeptly manages text prompt in both Chinese and English, supporting bilingual image generation and text rendering. We develop a powerful data system that facilitates knowledge integration, and a caption system that balances the accuracy and richness for image description. Particularly, Seedream is integrated with a self-developed bilingual large language model as a text encoder, allowing it to learn native knowledge directly from massive data. This enable it to generate high-fidelity images with accurate cultural nuances and aesthetic expressions described in either Chinese or English. Beside, Glyph-Aligned ByT5 is applied for flexible character-level text rendering, while a Scaled ROPE generalizes well to untrained resolutions. Multi-phase post-training optimizations, including SFT and RLHF iterations, further improve the overall capability. Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate that Seedream 2.0 achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple aspects, including prompt-following, aesthetics, text rendering, and structural correctness. Furthermore, Seedream 2.0 has been optimized through multiple RLHF iterations to closely align its output with human preferences, as revealed by its outstanding ELO score. In addition, it can be readily adapted to an instruction-based image editing model, such as SeedEdit, with strong editing capability that balances instruction-following and image consistency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Offic...</summary><p>Official Page: https://team.doubao.com/tech/seedream</p></details> |
| **[A Representationalist, Functionalist and Naturalistic Conception of Intelligence as a Foundation for AGI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07600v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The article analyses foundational principles relevant to the creation of artificial general intelligence (AGI). Intelligence is understood as the ability to create novel skills that allow to achieve goals under previously unknown conditions. To this end, intelligence utilises reasoning methods such as deduction, induction and abduction as well as other methods such as abstraction and classification to develop a world model. The methods are applied to indirect and incomplete representations of the world, which are obtained through perception, for example, and which do not depict the world but only correspond to it. Due to these limitations and the uncertain and contingent nature of reasoning, the world model is constructivist. Its value is functionally determined by its viability, i.e., its potential to achieve the desired goals. In consequence, meaning is assigned to representations by attributing them a function that makes it possible to achieve a goal. This representational and functional conception of intelligence enables a naturalistic interpretation that does not presuppose mental features, such as intentionality and consciousness, which are regarded as independent of intelligence. Based on a phenomenological analysis, it is shown that AGI can gain a more fundamental access to the world than humans, although it is limited by the No Free Lunch theorems, which require assumptions to be made.</p></details> |  |

Meanwhile, the field of graph machine learning is witnessing a paradigm transition from shallow methods to more sophisticated deep learning approaches. The capabilities of foundation models in generalization and adaptation motivate graph machine learning researchers to discuss the potential of developing a new graph learning paradigm. This paradigm envisions models that are pre-trained on extensive graph data and can be adapted for various graph tasks. Despite this burgeoning interest, there is a noticeable lack of clear definitions and systematic analyses pertaining to this new domain. To this end, this article introduces the concept of Graph Foundation Models (GFMs), and offers an exhaustive explanation of their key characteristics and underlying technologies. We proceed to classify the existing work related to GFMs into three distinct categories, based on their dependence on graph neural networks and large language models. In addition to providing a thorough review of the current state of GFMs, this article also outlooks potential avenues for future research in this rapidly evolving domain.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is the author's version of the accepted paper (not the IEEE-published version).

| **[Towards Safe Robot Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07404v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robot foundation models hold the potential for deployment across diverse environments, from industrial applications to household tasks. While current research focuses primarily on the policies' generalization capabilities across a variety of tasks, it fails to address safety, a critical requirement for deployment on real-world systems. In this paper, we introduce a safety layer designed to constrain the action space of any generalist policy appropriately. Our approach uses ATACOM, a safe reinforcement learning algorithm that creates a safe action space and, therefore, ensures safe state transitions. By extending ATACOM to generalist policies, our method facilitates their deployment in safety-critical scenarios without requiring any specific safety fine-tuning. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this safety layer in an air hockey environment, where it prevents a puck-hitting agent from colliding with its surroundings, a failure observed in generalist policies.</p></details> |  |

However, they struggle to segment objects with certain structures, particularly those with dense, tree-like morphology and low textural contrast from their surroundings. These failure modes are crucial for understanding the limitations of SFMs in real-world applications. To systematically study this issue, we introduce interpretable metrics quantifying object tree-likeness and textural separability. On carefully controlled synthetic experiments and real-world datasets, we show that SFM performance (e.g., SAM, SAM 2, HQ-SAM) noticeably correlates with these factors. We link these failures to "textural confusion", where models misinterpret local structure as global texture, causing over-segmentation or difficulty distinguishing objects from similar backgrounds. Notably, targeted fine-tuning fails to resolve this issue, indicating a fundamental limitation. Our study provides the first quantitative framework for modeling the behavior of SFMs on challenging structures, offering interpretable insights into their segmentation capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/mazurowski-lab/SAM-TexturalConfusion-Metrics</p></details> |
| **[Learning A Zero-shot Occupancy Network from Vision Foundation Models via Self-supervised Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07125v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Estimating the 3D world from 2D monocular images is a fundamental yet challenging task due to the labour-intensive nature of 3D annotations. To simplify label acquisition, this work proposes a novel approach that bridges 2D vision foundation models (VFMs) with 3D tasks by decoupling 3D supervision into an ensemble of image-level primitives, e.g., semantic and geometric components. As a key motivator, we leverage the zero-shot capabilities of vision-language models for image semantics. However, due to the notorious ill-posed problem - multiple distinct 3D scenes can produce identical 2D projections, directly inferring metric depth from a monocular image in a zero-shot manner is unsuitable. In contrast, 2D VFMs provide promising sources of relative depth, which theoretically aligns with metric depth when properly scaled and offset. Thus, we adapt the relative depth derived from VFMs into metric depth by optimising the scale and offset using temporal consistency, also known as novel view synthesis, without access to ground-truth metric depth. Consequently, we project the semantics into 3D space using the reconstructed metric depth, thereby providing 3D supervision. Extensive experiments on nuScenes and SemanticKITTI demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework. For instance, the proposed method surpasses the current state-of-the-art by 3.34% mIoU on nuScenes for voxel occupancy prediction.</p></details> | preprint |
| **[Task-Specific Knowledge Distillation from the Vision Foundation Model for Enhanced Medical Image Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06976v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-scale pre-trained models, such as Vision Foundation Models (VFMs), have demonstrated impressive performance across various downstream tasks by transferring generalized knowledge, especially when target data is limited. However, their high computational cost and the domain gap between natural and medical images limit their practical application in medical segmentation tasks. Motivated by this, we pose the following important question: "How can we effectively utilize the knowledge of large pre-trained VFMs to train a small, task-specific model for medical image segmentation when training data is limited?" To address this problem, we propose a novel and generalizable task-specific knowledge distillation framework. Our method fine-tunes the VFM on the target segmentation task to capture task-specific features before distilling the knowledge to smaller models, leveraging Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to reduce the computational cost of fine-tuning. Additionally, we incorporate synthetic data generated by diffusion models to augment the transfer set, enhancing model performance in data-limited scenarios. Experimental results across five medical image datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms task-agnostic knowledge distillation and self-supervised pretraining approaches like MoCo v3 and Masked Autoencoders (MAE). For example, on the KidneyUS dataset, our method achieved a 28% higher Dice score than task-agnostic KD using 80 labeled samples for fine-tuning. On the CHAOS dataset, it achieved an 11% improvement over MAE with 100 labeled samples. These results underscore the potential of task-specific knowledge distillation to train accurate, efficient models for medical image segmentation in data-constrained settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 10 figures, 16 tables</p></details> |
| **[Towards a Multimodal MRI-Based Foundation Model for Multi-Level Feature Exploration in Segmentation, Molecular Subtyping, and Grading of Glioma](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06828v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate, noninvasive glioma characterization is crucial for effective clinical management. Traditional methods, dependent on invasive tissue sampling, often fail to capture the spatial heterogeneity of the tumor. While deep learning has improved segmentation and molecular profiling, few approaches simultaneously integrate tumor morphology and molecular features. Foundation deep learning models, which learn robust, task-agnostic representations from large-scale datasets, hold great promise but remain underutilized in glioma imaging biomarkers. We propose the Multi-Task SWIN-UNETR (MTS-UNET) model, a novel foundation-based framework built on the BrainSegFounder model, pretrained on large-scale neuroimaging data. MTS-UNET simultaneously performs glioma segmentation, histological grading, and molecular subtyping (IDH mutation and 1p/19q co-deletion). It incorporates two key modules: Tumor-Aware Feature Encoding (TAFE) for multi-scale, tumor-focused feature extraction and Cross-Modality Differential (CMD) for highlighting subtle T2-FLAIR mismatch signals associated with IDH mutation. The model was trained and validated on a diverse, multi-center cohort of 2,249 glioma patients from seven public datasets. MTS-UNET achieved a mean Dice score of 84% for segmentation, along with AUCs of 90.58% for IDH mutation, 69.22% for 1p/19q co-deletion prediction, and 87.54% for grading, significantly outperforming baseline models (p<=0.05). Ablation studies validated the essential contributions of the TAFE and CMD modules and demonstrated the robustness of the framework. The foundation-based MTS-UNET model effectively integrates tumor segmentation with multi-level classification, exhibiting strong generalizability across diverse MRI datasets. This framework shows significant potential for advancing noninvasive, personalized glioma management by improving predictive accuracy and interpretability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deep Learning Foundation and Pattern Models: Challenges in Hydrological Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15218v2)** | 2025-03-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There has been active investigation into deep learning approaches for time series analysis, including foundation models. However, most studies do not address significant scientific applications. This paper aims to identify key features in time series by examining hydrology data. Our work advances computer science by emphasizing critical application features and contributes to hydrology and other scientific fields by identifying modeling approaches that effectively capture these features. Scientific time series data are inherently complex, involving observations from multiple locations, each with various time-dependent data streams and exogenous factors that may be static or time-varying and either application-dependent or purely mathematical. This research analyzes hydrology time series from the CAMELS and Caravan global datasets, which encompass rainfall and runoff data across catchments, featuring up to six observed streams and 209 static parameters across approximately 8,000 locations. Our investigation assesses the impact of exogenous data through eight different model configurations for key hydrology tasks. Results demonstrate that integrating exogenous information enhances data representation, reducing mean squared error by up to 40% in the largest dataset. Additionally, we present a detailed performance comparison of over 20 state-of-the-art pattern and foundation models. The analysis is fully open-source, facilitated by Jupyter Notebook on Google Colab for LSTM-based modeling, data preprocessing, and model comparisons. Preliminary findings using alternative deep learning architectures reveal that models incorporating comprehensive observed and exogenous data outperform more limited approaches, including foundation models. Notably, natural annual periodic exogenous time series contribute the most significant improvements, though static and other periodic factors are also valuable.</p></details> |  |
| **[PathVQ: Reforming Computational Pathology Foundation Model for Whole Slide Image Analysis via Vector Quantization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06482v1)** | 2025-03-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computational pathology and whole-slide image (WSI) analysis are pivotal in cancer diagnosis and prognosis. However, the ultra-high resolution of WSIs presents significant modeling challenges. Recent advancements in pathology foundation models have improved performance, yet most approaches rely on [CLS] token representation of tile ViT as slide-level inputs (16x16 pixels is refereed as patch and 224x224 pixels as tile). This discards critical spatial details from patch tokens, limiting downstream WSI analysis tasks. We find that leveraging all spatial patch tokens benefits WSI analysis but incurs nearly 200x higher storage and training costs (e.g., 196 tokens in ViT$_{224}$). To address this, we introduce vector quantized (VQ) distillation on patch feature, which efficiently compresses spatial patch tokens using discrete indices and a decoder. Our method reduces token dimensionality from 1024 to 16, achieving a 64x compression rate while preserving reconstruction fidelity. Furthermore, we employ a multi-scale VQ (MSVQ) strategy, which not only enhances VQ reconstruction performance but also serves as a Self-supervised Learning (SSL) supervision for a seamless slide-level pretraining objective. Built upon the quantized patch features and supervision targets of tile via MSVQ, we develop a progressive convolutional module and slide-level SSL to extract representations with rich spatial-information for downstream WSI tasks. Extensive evaluations on multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving state-of-the-art performance in WSI analysis. Code will be available soon.</p></details> |  |
| **[Data Foundations for Large Scale Multimodal Clinical Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07667v1)** | 2025-03-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in clinical AI have enabled remarkable progress across many clinical domains. However, existing benchmarks and models are primarily limited to a small set of modalities and tasks, which hinders the development of large-scale multimodal methods that can make holistic assessments of patient health and well-being. To bridge this gap, we introduce Clinical Large-Scale Integrative Multimodal Benchmark (CLIMB), a comprehensive clinical benchmark unifying diverse clinical data across imaging, language, temporal, and graph modalities. CLIMB comprises 4.51 million patient samples totaling 19.01 terabytes distributed across 2D imaging, 3D video, time series, graphs, and multimodal data. Through extensive empirical evaluation, we demonstrate that multitask pretraining significantly improves performance on understudied domains, achieving up to 29% improvement in ultrasound and 23% in ECG analysis over single-task learning. Pretraining on CLIMB also effectively improves models' generalization capability to new tasks, and strong unimodal encoder performance translates well to multimodal performance when paired with task-appropriate fusion strategies. Our findings provide a foundation for new architecture designs and pretraining strategies to advance clinical AI research. Code is released at https://github.com/DDVD233/climb.</p></details> |  |

We present GeoLangBind, a novel agglomerative vision--language foundation model that bridges the gap between heterogeneous EO data modalities using language as a unifying medium. Our approach aligns different EO data types into a shared language embedding space, enabling seamless integration and complementary feature learning from diverse sensor data. To achieve this, we construct a large-scale multimodal image--text dataset, GeoLangBind-2M, encompassing six data modalities. GeoLangBind leverages this dataset to develop a zero-shot foundation model capable of processing arbitrary numbers of EO data channels as input. Through our designed Modality-aware Knowledge Agglomeration (MaKA) module and progressive multimodal weight merging strategy, we create a powerful agglomerative foundation model that excels in both zero-shot vision--language comprehension and fine-grained visual understanding. Extensive evaluation across 23 datasets covering multiple tasks demonstrates GeoLangBind's superior performance and versatility in EO applications, offering a robust framework for various environmental monitoring and analysis tasks.

Yet, using the same recipe for building embodied agents has faced noticeable difficulties. Despite the availability of many crowd-sourced embodied datasets, their action spaces often exhibit significant heterogeneity due to distinct physical embodiment and control interfaces for different robots, causing substantial challenges in developing embodied foundation models using cross-domain data. In this paper, we introduce UniAct, a new embodied foundation modeling framework operating in a Universal Action Space. Our learned universal actions capture the generic atomic behaviors across diverse robots by exploiting their shared structural features, and enable enhanced cross-domain data utilization and cross-embodiment generalizations by eliminating the notorious heterogeneity. The universal actions can be efficiently translated back to heterogeneous actionable commands by simply adding embodiment-specific details, from which fast adaptation to new robots becomes simple and straightforward. Our 0.5B instantiation of UniAct outperforms 14X larger SOTA embodied foundation models in extensive evaluations on various real-world and simulation robots, showcasing exceptional cross-embodiment control and adaptation capability, highlighting the crucial benefit of adopting universal actions.

Detecting their positions and orientations in X-ray fluoroscopic images is important for many clinical applications. Method: In this paper, a novel attention mechanism was designed to guide a convolution neural network (CNN) model to the areas of wires in X-ray images, as nearly all interventional devices and catheters used in cardiovascular procedures contain wires. The attention mechanism includes multi-scale Gaussian derivative filters and a dot-product-based attention layer. By utilizing the proposed attention mechanism, a lightweight foundation model can be created to detect multiple objects simultaneously with higher precision and real-time speed. Results: The proposed model was trained and tested on a total of 12,438 X-ray images. An accuracy of 0.88 was achieved for detecting an echo probe and 0.87 for detecting an artificial valve at 58 FPS. The accuracy was measured by intersection-over-union (IoU). We also achieved a 99.8% success rate in detecting a 10-electrode catheter and a 97.8% success rate in detecting an ablation catheter. Conclusion: Our detection foundation model can simultaneously detect and identify both interventional devices and flexible catheters in real-time X-ray fluoroscopic images. Significance: The proposed model employs a novel attention mechanism to achieve high-performance object detection, making it suitable for various clinical applications and robotic-assisted surgeries.

However, due to the limited real-world data and unbearable consequences of taking detrimental actions, the learning of RL policy is mainly restricted within the simulators. This practice guarantees safety in learning but introduces an inevitable sim-to-real gap in terms of deployment, thus causing degraded performance and risks in execution. There are attempts to solve the sim-to-real problems from different domains with various techniques, especially in the era with emerging techniques such as large foundations or language models that have cast light on the sim-to-real. This survey paper, to the best of our knowledge, is the first taxonomy that formally frames the sim-to-real techniques from key elements of the Markov Decision Process (State, Action, Transition, and Reward). Based on the framework, we cover comprehensive literature from the classic to the most advanced methods including the sim-to-real techniques empowered by foundation models, and we also discuss the specialties that are worth attention in different domains of sim-to-real problems. Then we summarize the formal evaluation process of sim-to-real performance with accessible code or benchmarks. The challenges and opportunities are also presented to encourage future exploration of this direction. We are actively maintaining a repository to include the most up-to-date sim-to-real research work to help domain researchers.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 6 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

To address this, we propose STAR (Smart Task Adaptation and Recovery), a novel framework that synergizes Foundation Models (FMs) with dynamically expanding Knowledge Graphs (KGs) to enable resilient task planning and autonomous failure recovery. While FMs offer remarkable generalization and contextual reasoning, their limitations, including computational inefficiency, hallucinations, and output inconsistencies hinder reliable deployment. STAR mitigates these issues by embedding learned knowledge into structured, reusable KGs, which streamline information retrieval, reduce redundant FM computations, and provide precise, scenario-specific insights. The framework leverages FM-driven reasoning to diagnose failures, generate context-aware recovery strategies, and execute corrective actions without human intervention or system restarts. Unlike conventional approaches that rely on rigid protocols, STAR dynamically expands its KG with experiential knowledge, ensuring continuous adaptation to novel scenarios. To evaluate the effectiveness of this approach, we developed a comprehensive dataset that includes various robotic tasks and failure scenarios. Through extensive experimentation, STAR demonstrated an 86% task planning accuracy and 78% recovery success rate, showing significant improvements over baseline methods. The framework's ability to continuously learn from experience while maintaining structured knowledge representation makes it particularly suitable for long-term deployment in real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

Existing models, limited to deterministic predictions, overlook real-world multi-layer depth. To address this, we introduce a paradigm shift from single-prediction to multi-hypothesis spatial foundation models. We first present \texttt{MD-3k}, a benchmark exposing depth biases in expert and foundational models through multi-layer spatial relationship labels and new metrics. To resolve depth ambiguity, we propose Laplacian Visual Prompting (LVP), a training-free spectral prompting technique that extracts hidden depth from pre-trained models via Laplacian-transformed RGB inputs. By integrating LVP-inferred depth with standard RGB-based estimates, our approach elicits multi-layer depth without model retraining. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of LVP in zero-shot multi-layer depth estimation, unlocking more robust and comprehensive geometry-conditioned visual generation, 3D-grounded spatial reasoning, and temporally consistent video-level depth inference.

| **[A Mixture of Exemplars Approach for Efficient Out-of-Distribution Detection with Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17093v5)** | 2025-03-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One of the early weaknesses identified in deep neural networks trained for image classification tasks was their inability to provide low confidence predictions on out-of-distribution (OOD) data that was significantly different from the in-distribution (ID) data used to train them. Representation learning, where neural networks are trained in specific ways that improve their ability to detect OOD examples, has emerged as a promising solution. However, these approaches require long training times and can add additional overhead to detect OOD examples. Recent developments in Vision Transformer (ViT) foundation models$\unicode{x2013}$large networks trained on large and diverse datasets with self-supervised approaches$\unicode{x2013}$also show strong performance in OOD detection, and could address these challenges. This paper presents Mixture of Exemplars (MoLAR), an efficient approach to tackling OOD detection challenges that is designed to maximise the benefit of training a classifier with a high quality, frozen, pretrained foundation model backbone. MoLAR provides strong OOD performance when only comparing the similarity of OOD examples to the exemplars, a small set of images chosen to be representative of the dataset, leading to up to 30 times faster OOD detection inference over other methods that provide best performance when the full ID dataset is used. In some cases, only using these exemplars actually improves performance with MoLAR. Extensive experiments demonstrate the improved OOD detection performance of MoLAR in comparison to comparable approaches in both supervised and semi-supervised settings, and code is available at github.com/emannix/molar-mixture-of-exemplars.</p></details> |  |
| **[Preserving Angles Improves Feature Distillation of Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15239v2)** | 2025-03-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge distillation approaches compress models by training a student network using the classification outputs of a high quality teacher model, but can fail to effectively transfer the properties of computer vision foundation models from the teacher to the student. While it has been recently shown that feature distillation$\unicode{x2013}$where a teacher model's output features are replicated instead$\unicode{x2013}$can reproduce performance for foundation models across numerous downstream tasks, they fall short in matching critical properties such as robustness and out-of-distribution (OOD) detection performance. This paper overcomes this shortcoming by introducing Cosine-similarity Preserving Compression (CosPress), a feature distillation technique that learns a mapping to compress the latent space of the teacher model into the smaller latent space of the student, by preserving the cosine similarities between image embeddings. This enables direct optimisation of the student network and produces a more faithful reproduction of the teacher's properties. It is shown that distillation with CosPress on a variety of datasets, including ImageNet, produces more accurate models with greater performance on generalisability, robustness and OOD detection benchmarks, and that this technique provides a competitive pathway for training highly performant lightweight models on small datasets.

Current AI governance approaches suffer from fragmentation, with risk management frameworks that focus on isolated domains, regulations that vary across jurisdictions despite conceptual alignment, and high-level standards lacking concrete implementation guidance. This fragmentation increases governance costs and creates a false dichotomy between innovation and responsibility. We propose the Unified Control Framework (UCF): a comprehensive governance approach that integrates risk management and regulatory compliance through a unified set of controls. The UCF consists of three key components: (1) a comprehensive risk taxonomy synthesizing organizational and societal risks, (2) structured policy requirements derived from regulations, and (3) a parsimonious set of 42 controls that simultaneously address multiple risk scenarios and compliance requirements. We validate the UCF by mapping it to the Colorado AI Act, demonstrating how our approach enables efficient, adaptable governance that scales across regulations while providing concrete implementation guidance. The UCF reduces duplication of effort, ensures comprehensive coverage, and provides a foundation for automation, enabling organizations to achieve responsible AI governance without sacrificing innovation speed.</p></details> |  |

However, they face challenges such as low computational efficiency and limited interpretability, especially when dealing with large-scale remote sensing images. To overcome these, we draw inspiration from heat conduction, a physical process modeling local heat diffusion. Building on this idea, we are the first to explore the potential of using the parallel computing model of heat conduction to simulate the local region correlations in high-resolution remote sensing images, and introduce RS-vHeat, an efficient multi-modal remote sensing foundation model. Specifically, RS-vHeat 1) applies the Heat Conduction Operator (HCO) with a complexity of $O(N^{1.5})$ and a global receptive field, reducing computational overhead while capturing remote sensing object structure information to guide heat diffusion; 2) learns the frequency distribution representations of various scenes through a self-supervised strategy based on frequency domain hierarchical masking and multi-domain reconstruction; 3) significantly improves efficiency and performance over state-of-the-art techniques across 4 tasks and 10 datasets. Compared to attention-based remote sensing foundation models, we reduce memory usage by 84\%, FLOPs by 24\% and improves throughput by 2.7 times. The code will be made publicly available.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 8 figures and 10 tables</p></details> |
| **[ORANSight-2.0: Foundational LLMs for O-RAN](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05200v1)** | 2025-03-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the transformative impact of Large Language Models (LLMs) across critical domains such as healthcare, customer service, and business marketing, their integration into Open Radio Access Networks (O-RAN) remains limited. This gap is primarily due to the absence of domain-specific foundational models, with existing solutions often relying on general-purpose LLMs that fail to address the unique challenges and technical intricacies of O-RAN. To bridge this gap, we introduce ORANSight-2.0 (O-RAN Insights), a pioneering initiative aimed at developing specialized foundational LLMs tailored for O-RAN. Built on 18 LLMs spanning five open-source LLM frameworks, ORANSight-2.0 fine-tunes models ranging from 1 to 70B parameters, significantly reducing reliance on proprietary, closed-source models while enhancing performance for O-RAN. At the core of ORANSight-2.0 is RANSTRUCT, a novel Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) based instruction-tuning framework that employs two LLM agents to create high-quality instruction-tuning datasets. The generated dataset is then used to fine-tune the 18 pre-trained open-source LLMs via QLoRA. To evaluate ORANSight-2.0, we introduce srsRANBench, a novel benchmark designed for code generation and codebase understanding in the context of srsRAN, a widely used 5G O-RAN stack. We also leverage ORANBench13K, an existing benchmark for assessing O-RAN-specific knowledge. Our comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that ORANSight-2.0 models outperform general-purpose and closed-source models, such as ChatGPT-4o and Gemini, by 5.421% on ORANBench and 18.465% on srsRANBench, achieving superior performance while maintaining lower computational and energy costs. We also experiment with RAG-augmented variants of ORANSight-2.0 LLMs and thoroughly evaluate their energy characteristics, demonstrating costs for training, standard inference, and RAG-augmented inference.</p></details> |  |
| **[Incentivizing Multi-Tenant Split Federated Learning for Foundation Models at the Network Edge](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04971v1)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models (FMs) such as GPT-4 exhibit exceptional generative capabilities across diverse downstream tasks through fine-tuning. Split Federated Learning (SFL) facilitates privacy-preserving FM fine-tuning on resource-constrained local devices by offloading partial FM computations to edge servers, enabling device-edge synergistic fine-tuning. Practical edge networks often host multiple SFL tenants to support diversified downstream tasks. However, existing research primarily focuses on single-tenant SFL scenarios, and lacks tailored incentive mechanisms for multi-tenant settings, which are essential to effectively coordinate self-interested local devices for participation in various downstream tasks, ensuring that each SFL tenant's distinct FM fine-tuning requirements (e.g., FM types, performance targets, and fine-tuning deadlines) are met. To address this gap, we propose a novel Price-Incentive Mechanism (PRINCE) that guides multiple SFL tenants to offer strategic price incentives, which solicit high-quality device participation for efficient FM fine-tuning. Specifically, we first develop a bias-resilient global SFL model aggregation scheme to eliminate model biases caused by independent device participation. We then derive a rigorous SFL convergence bound to evaluate the contributions of heterogeneous devices to FM performance improvements, guiding the incentive strategies of SFL tenants. Furthermore, we model inter-tenant device competition as a congestion game for Stackelberg equilibrium (SE) analysis, deriving each SFL tenant's optimal incentive strategy. Extensive simulations involving four representative SFL tenant types (ViT, BERT, Whisper, and LLaMA) across diverse data modalities (text, images, and audio) demonstrate that PRINCE accelerates FM fine-tuning by up to 3.07x compared to state-of-the-art approaches, while consistently meeting fine-tuning performance targets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Index...</summary><p>Index Terms: Foundation models, Edge computing, Split federated learning, Multi-tenant system, Incentive mechanism</p></details> |

These can be used within data processing pipelines for machine learning tasks and numerical methods. We show how our GNPs can be trained to learn robust latent representations for the differential geometry of point-clouds to provide estimates of metric, curvature, and other shape-related features. We demonstrate how our pre-trained GNPs can be used (i) to estimate the geometric properties of surfaces of arbitrary shape and topologies with robustness in the presence of noise, (ii) to approximate solutions of geometric partial differential equations (PDEs) on manifolds, and (iii) to solve equations for shape deformations such as curvature driven flows. We also release a package of the codes and weights for using our pre-trained GNPs for processing point cloud representations. This allows for incorporating our pre-trained GNPs as components for reuse within existing and new data processing pipelines. The GNPs also can be used as part of numerical solvers involving geometry or as part of methods for performing inference and other geometric tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[TS-RAG: Retrieval-Augmented Generation based Time Series Foundation Models are Stronger Zero-Shot Forecaster](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07649v1)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) and Foundation Models (FMs) have become prevalent for time series forecasting tasks. However, fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) for forecasting enables the adaptation to specific domains but may not generalize well across diverse, unseen datasets. Meanwhile, existing time series foundation models (TSFMs) lack inherent mechanisms for domain adaptation and suffer from limited interpretability, making them suboptimal for zero-shot forecasting. To this end, we present TS-RAG, a retrieval-augmented generation based time series forecasting framework that enhances the generalization capability and interpretability of TSFMs. Specifically, TS-RAG leverages pre-trained time series encoders to retrieve semantically relevant time series segments from a dedicated knowledge database, incorporating contextual patterns for the given time series query. Next, we develop a learnable Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)-based augmentation module, which dynamically fuses retrieved time series patterns with the TSFM's representation of the input query, improving forecasting accuracy without requiring task-specific fine-tuning. Thorough empirical studies on seven public benchmark datasets demonstrate that TS-RAG achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot forecasting performance, outperforming TSFMs by up to 6.51% across diverse domains and showcasing desired interpretability.</p></details> |  |
| **[scDD: Latent Codes Based scRNA-seq Dataset Distillation with Foundation Model Knowledge](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04357v1)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology has profiled hundreds of millions of human cells across organs, diseases, development and perturbations to date. However, the high-dimensional sparsity, batch effect noise, category imbalance, and ever-increasing data scale of the original sequencing data pose significant challenges for multi-center knowledge transfer, data fusion, and cross-validation between scRNA-seq datasets. To address these barriers, (1) we first propose a latent codes-based scRNA-seq dataset distillation framework named scDD, which transfers and distills foundation model knowledge and original dataset information into a compact latent space and generates synthetic scRNA-seq dataset by a generator to replace the original dataset. Then, (2) we propose a single-step conditional diffusion generator named SCDG, which perform single-step gradient back-propagation to help scDD optimize distillation quality and avoid gradient decay caused by multi-step back-propagation. Meanwhile, SCDG ensures the scRNA-seq data characteristics and inter-class discriminability of the synthetic dataset through flexible conditional control and generation quality assurance. Finally, we propose a comprehensive benchmark to evaluate the performance of scRNA-seq dataset distillation in different data analysis tasks. It is validated that our proposed method can achieve 7.61% absolute and 15.70% relative improvement over previous state-of-the-art methods on average task.</p></details> |  |
| **[DuCos: Duality Constrained Depth Super-Resolution via Foundation Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04171v1)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce DuCos, a novel depth super-resolution framework grounded in Lagrangian duality theory, offering a flexible integration of multiple constraints and reconstruction objectives to enhance accuracy and robustness. Our DuCos is the first to significantly improve generalization across diverse scenarios with foundation models as prompts. The prompt design consists of two key components: Correlative Fusion (CF) and Gradient Regulation (GR). CF facilitates precise geometric alignment and effective fusion between prompt and depth features, while GR refines depth predictions by enforcing consistency with sharp-edged depth maps derived from foundation models. Crucially, these prompts are seamlessly embedded into the Lagrangian constraint term, forming a synergistic and principled framework. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DuCos outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior accuracy, robustness, and generalization. The source codes and pre-trained models will be publicly available.</p></details> |  |

To handle time series data from various domains, TimeFound employs a multi-resolution patching strategy to capture complex temporal patterns at multiple scales. We pre-train our model with two sizes (200M and 710M parameters) on a large time-series corpus comprising both real-world and synthetic datasets. Over a collection of unseen datasets across diverse domains and forecasting horizons, our empirical evaluations suggest that TimeFound can achieve superior or competitive zero-shot forecasting performance, compared to state-of-the-art time series foundation models.</p></details> |  |
| **[GENERator: A Long-Context Generative Genomic Foundation Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07272v2)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advancements in DNA sequencing technologies have significantly improved our ability to decode genomic sequences. However, the prediction and interpretation of these sequences remain challenging due to the intricate nature of genetic material. Large language models (LLMs) have introduced new opportunities for biological sequence analysis. Recent developments in genomic language models have underscored the potential of LLMs in deciphering DNA sequences. Nonetheless, existing models often face limitations in robustness and application scope, primarily due to constraints in model structure and training data scale. To address these limitations, we present GENERator, a generative genomic foundation model featuring a context length of 98k base pairs (bp) and 1.2B parameters. Trained on an expansive dataset comprising 386B bp of eukaryotic DNA, the GENERator demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across both established and newly proposed benchmarks. The model adheres to the central dogma of molecular biology, accurately generating protein-coding sequences that translate into proteins structurally analogous to known families. It also shows significant promise in sequence optimization, particularly through the prompt-responsive generation of enhancer sequences with specific activity profiles. These capabilities position the GENERator as a pivotal tool for genomic research and biotechnological advancement, enhancing our ability to interpret and predict complex biological systems and enabling precise genomic interventions. Implementation details and supplementary resources are available at https://github.com/GenerTeam/GENERator.</p></details> |  |
| **[Shazam: Unifying Multiple Foundation Models for Advanced Computational Pathology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00736v2)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation Models (FMs) in computational pathology (CPath) have significantly advanced the extraction of meaningful features from histopathology image datasets, achieving strong performance across various clinical tasks. Despite their impressive performance, these models often exhibit variability when applied to different tasks, prompting the need for a unified framework capable of consistently excelling across various applications. In this work, we propose Shazam, a novel framework designed to efficiently combine multiple CPath models. Unlike previous approaches that train a fixed-parameter FM, Shazam dynamically extracts and refines information from diverse FMs for each specific task. To ensure that each FM contributes effectively without dominance, a novel distillation strategy is applied, guiding the student model with features from all teacher models, which enhances its generalization ability. Experimental results on two pathology patch classification datasets demonstrate that Shazam outperforms existing CPath models and other fusion methods. Its lightweight, flexible design makes it a promising solution for improving CPath analysis in real-world settings. Code will be available at https://github.com/Tuner12/Shazam.</p></details> | 9 pages, 2 figures |

However, foundation models that can freely sense, interact, and actuate the physical domain is far from being realized. This is due to 1) requiring dense deployments of sensors to fully cover and analyze large spaces, while 2) events often being localized to small areas, making it difficult for FMs to pinpoint relevant areas of interest relevant to the current task. We propose FlexiFly, a platform that enables FMs to ``zoom in'' and analyze relevant areas with higher granularity to better understand the physical environment and carry out tasks. FlexiFly accomplishes by introducing 1) a novel image segmentation technique that aids in identifying relevant locations and 2) a modular and reconfigurable sensing and actuation drone platform that FMs can actuate to ``zoom in'' with relevant sensors and actuators. We demonstrate through real smart home deployments that FlexiFly enables FMs and LLMs to complete diverse tasks up to $85\%$ more successfully. FlexiFly is critical step towards FMs and LLMs that can naturally interface with the physical world.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted by ACM SenSys 2025.

| **[Task-Agnostic Attacks Against Vision Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03842v1)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The study of security in machine learning mainly focuses on downstream task-specific attacks, where the adversarial example is obtained by optimizing a loss function specific to the downstream task. At the same time, it has become standard practice for machine learning practitioners to adopt publicly available pre-trained vision foundation models, effectively sharing a common backbone architecture across a multitude of applications such as classification, segmentation, depth estimation, retrieval, question-answering and more. The study of attacks on such foundation models and their impact to multiple downstream tasks remains vastly unexplored. This work proposes a general framework that forges task-agnostic adversarial examples by maximally disrupting the feature representation obtained with foundation models. We extensively evaluate the security of the feature representations obtained by popular vision foundation models by measuring the impact of this attack on multiple downstream tasks and its transferability between models.</p></details> |  |
| **[TEDDY: A Family Of Foundation Models For Understanding Single Cell Biology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03485v1)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding the biological mechanism of disease is critical for medicine, and in particular drug discovery. AI-powered analysis of genome-scale biological data hold great potential in this regard. The increasing availability of single-cell RNA sequencing data has enabled the development of large foundation models for disease biology. However, existing foundation models either do not improve or only modestly improve over task-specific models in downstream applications. Here, we explored two avenues for improving the state-of-the-art. First, we scaled the pre-training dataset to 116 million cells, which is larger than those used by previous models. Second, we leveraged the availability of large-scale biological annotations as a form of supervision during pre-training. We trained the TEDDY family of models comprising six transformer-based state-of-the-art single-cell foundation models with 70 million, 160 million, and 400 million parameters. We vetted our models on two downstream evaluation tasks -- identifying the underlying disease state of held-out donors not seen during training and distinguishing healthy cells from diseased ones for disease conditions and donors not seen during training. Scaling experiments showed that performance improved predictably with both data volume and parameter count. Our models showed substantial improvement over existing work on the first task and more muted improvements on the second.</p></details> |  |
| **[UniFlow: A Foundation Model for Unified Urban Spatio-Temporal Flow Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12972v2)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Urban spatio-temporal flow prediction, encompassing traffic flows and crowd flows, is crucial for optimizing city infrastructure and managing traffic and emergency responses. Traditional approaches have relied on separate models tailored to either grid-based data, representing cities as uniform cells, or graph-based data, modeling cities as networks of nodes and edges. In this paper, we build UniFlow, a foundational model for general urban flow prediction that unifies both grid-based and graphbased data. We first design a multi-view spatio-temporal patching mechanism to standardize different data into a consistent sequential format and then introduce a spatio-temporal transformer architecture to capture complex correlations and dynamics. To leverage shared spatio-temporal patterns across different data types and facilitate effective cross-learning, we propose SpatioTemporal Memory Retrieval Augmentation (ST-MRA). By creating structured memory modules to store shared spatio-temporal patterns, ST-MRA enhances predictions through adaptive memory retrieval. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniFlow outperforms existing models in both grid-based and graph-based flow prediction, excelling particularly in scenarios with limited data availability, showcasing its superior performance and broad applicability. The datasets and code implementation have been released on https://github.com/YuanYuan98/UniFlow.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM as GNN: Graph Vocabulary Learning for Text-Attributed Graph Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03313v1)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-Attributed Graphs (TAGs), where each node is associated with text descriptions, are ubiquitous in real-world scenarios. They typically exhibit distinctive structure and domain-specific knowledge, motivating the development of a Graph Foundation Model (GFM) that generalizes across diverse graphs and tasks. Despite large efforts to integrate Large Language Models (LLMs) and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for TAGs, existing approaches suffer from decoupled architectures with two-stage alignment, limiting their synergistic potential. Even worse, existing methods assign out-of-vocabulary (OOV) tokens to graph nodes, leading to graph-specific semantics, token explosion, and incompatibility with task-oriented prompt templates, which hinders cross-graph and cross-task transferability. To address these challenges, we propose PromptGFM, a versatile GFM for TAGs grounded in graph vocabulary learning. PromptGFM comprises two key components: (1) Graph Understanding Module, which explicitly prompts LLMs to replicate the finest GNN workflow within the text space, facilitating seamless GNN-LLM integration and elegant graph-text alignment; (2) Graph Inference Module, which establishes a language-based graph vocabulary ensuring expressiveness, transferability, and scalability, enabling readable instructions for LLM fine-tuning. Extensive experiments demonstrate our superiority and transferability across diverse graphs and tasks. The code is available at this: https://github.com/agiresearch/PromptGFM.</p></details> |  |

However, traditional methods frequently struggle with the inherent complexity, interconnectedness, and limited data of such systems. Foundation models, with their large-scale pre-training and universal representations, offer transformative opportunities by integrating diverse data sources, capturing spatiotemporal dependencies, and adapting to a broad range of tasks. This survey presents a comprehensive overview of foundation model applications in environmental science, highlighting advancements in forward prediction, data generation, data assimilation, downscaling, model ensembling, and decision-making across domains. We also detail the development process of these models, covering data collection, architecture design, training, tuning, and evaluation. By showcasing these emerging methods, we aim to foster interdisciplinary collaboration and advance the integration of cutting-edge machine learning for sustainable solutions in environmental science.</p></details> |  |
| **[The 2024 Foundation Model Transparency Index](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12929v2)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models are increasingly consequential yet extremely opaque. To characterize the status quo, the Foundation Model Transparency Index (FMTI) was launched in October 2023 to measure the transparency of leading foundation model developers. FMTI 2023 assessed 10 major foundation model developers (e.g. OpenAI, Google) on 100 transparency indicators (e.g. does the developer disclose the wages it pays for data labor?). At the time, developers publicly disclosed very limited information with the average score being 37 out of 100. To understand how the status quo has changed, we conduct a follow-up study after 6 months: we score 14 developers against the same 100 indicators. While in FMTI 2023 we searched for publicly available information, in FMTI 2024 developers submit reports on the 100 transparency indicators, potentially including information that was not previously public. We find that developers now score 58 out of 100 on average, a 21 point improvement over FMTI 2023. Much of this increase is driven by developers disclosing information during the FMTI 2024 process: on average, developers disclosed information related to 16.6 indicators that was not previously public. We observe regions of sustained (i.e. across 2023 and 2024) and systemic (i.e. across most or all developers) opacity such as on copyright status, data access, data labor, and downstream impact. We publish transparency reports for each developer that consolidate information disclosures: these reports are based on the information disclosed to us via developers. Our findings demonstrate that transparency can be improved in this nascent ecosystem, the Foundation Model Transparency Index likely contributes to these improvements, and policymakers should consider interventions in areas where transparency has not improved.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in TMLR 2025.

However, existing artificial intelligence-driven PET/CT analyses rely predominantly on task-specific models trained from scratch or on limited datasets, limiting their generalizability and robustness. To address this, we propose a foundation model approach specifically designed for multimodal PET/CT imaging. We introduce the Cross-Fraternal Twin Masked Autoencoder (FratMAE), a novel framework that effectively integrates whole-body anatomical and functional or molecular information. FratMAE employs separate Vision Transformer (ViT) encoders for PET and CT scans, along with cross-attention decoders that enable synergistic interactions between modalities during masked autoencoder training. Additionally, it incorporates textual metadata to enhance PET representation learning. By pre-training on PET/CT datasets, FratMAE captures intricate cross-modal relationships and global uptake patterns, achieving superior performance on downstream tasks and demonstrating its potential as a generalizable foundation model.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 2 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

Traditional visual language models (VLMs) use separate modules for understanding and generating visual content, which can lead to misalignment and increased complexity. In contrast, VILA-U employs a single autoregressive next-token prediction framework for both tasks, eliminating the need for additional components like diffusion models. This approach not only simplifies the model but also achieves near state-of-the-art performance in visual language understanding and generation. The success of VILA-U is attributed to two main factors: the unified vision tower that aligns discrete visual tokens with textual inputs during pretraining, which enhances visual perception, and autoregressive image generation can achieve similar quality as diffusion models with high-quality dataset. This allows VILA-U to perform comparably to more complex models using a fully token-based autoregressive framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/mit-han-lab/vila-u.

FMs are trained on numerous diverse datasets and claim to be effective forecasters across multiple different time series domains, including cloud data. In this work we investigate this claim, exploring the effectiveness of FMs on cloud data. We demonstrate that many well-known FMs fail to generate meaningful or accurate zero-shot forecasts in this setting. We support this claim empirically, showing that FMs are outperformed consistently by simple linear baselines. We also illustrate a number of interesting pathologies, including instances where FMs suddenly output seemingly erratic, random-looking forecasts. Our results suggest a widespread failure of FMs to model cloud data.</p></details> | 5 pages, Preprint |
| **[A Token-level Text Image Foundation Model for Document Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02304v1)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, general visual foundation models (VFMs) have witnessed increasing adoption, particularly as image encoders for popular multi-modal large language models (MLLMs). However, without semantically fine-grained supervision, these models still encounter fundamental prediction errors in the context of downstream text-image-related tasks, i.e., perception, understanding and reasoning with images containing small and dense texts. To bridge this gap, we develop TokenOCR, the first token-level visual foundation model specifically tailored for text-image-related tasks, designed to support a variety of traditional downstream applications. To facilitate the pretraining of TokenOCR, we also devise a high-quality data production pipeline that constructs the first token-level image text dataset, TokenIT, comprising 20 million images and 1.8 billion token-mask pairs. Furthermore, leveraging this foundation with exceptional image-as-text capability, we seamlessly replace previous VFMs with TokenOCR to construct a document-level MLLM, TokenVL, for VQA-based document understanding tasks. Finally, extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of TokenOCR and TokenVL. Code, datasets, and weights will be available at https://token-family.github.io/TokenOCR_project.</p></details> | 23 pages |

Most of the ongoing technical validation of foundation models have been applied to optical images like RGB or multi-spectral images. Due to difficulty in semantic labeling to create datasets and higher noise content with respect to optical images, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data has not been explored a lot in the field for foundation models. Therefore, in this work as a pre-training approach, we explored masked auto-encoder, specifically MixMAE on Sentinel-1 SAR images and its impact on SAR image classification tasks. Moreover, we proposed to use the physical characteristic of SAR data for applying weighting parameter on the auto-encoder training loss (MSE) to reduce the effect of speckle noise and very high values on the SAR images. Proposed SAR intensity-based weighting of the reconstruction loss demonstrates promising results both on SAR pre-training and downstream tasks specifically on flood detection compared with the baseline model.</p></details> | 5 pages, 1 figure |
| **[Robust Scene Change Detection Using Visual Foundation Models and Cross-Attention Mechanisms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16850v3)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a novel method for scene change detection that leverages the robust feature extraction capabilities of a visual foundational model, DINOv2, and integrates full-image cross-attention to address key challenges such as varying lighting, seasonal variations, and viewpoint differences. In order to effectively learn correspondences and mis-correspondences between an image pair for the change detection task, we propose to a) ``freeze'' the backbone in order to retain the generality of dense foundation features, and b) employ ``full-image'' cross-attention to better tackle the viewpoint variations between the image pair. We evaluate our approach on two benchmark datasets, VL-CMU-CD and PSCD, along with their viewpoint-varied versions. Our experiments demonstrate significant improvements in F1-score, particularly in scenarios involving geometric changes between image pairs.

Recent studies indicate that scaling-up and advanced design of the recommendation model can bring significant performance improvement. However, with a larger model scale, such prior studies have a significantly increasing gap from industry as they often neglect two fundamental challenges in industrial-scale applications. First, training and inference budgets are restricted for the model to be served, exceeding which may incur latency and impair user experience. Second, large-volume data arrive in a streaming mode with data distributions dynamically shifting, as new users/ads join and existing users/ads leave the system. We propose the External Large Foundation Model (ExFM) framework to address the overlooked challenges. Specifically, we develop external distillation and a data augmentation system (DAS) to control the computational cost of training/inference while maintaining high performance. We design the teacher in a way like a foundation model (FM) that can serve multiple students as vertical models (VMs) to amortize its building cost. We propose Auxiliary Head and Student Adapter to mitigate the data distribution gap between FM and VMs caused by the streaming data issue. Comprehensive experiments on internal industrial-scale applications and public datasets demonstrate significant performance gain by ExFM.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the ACM Web Conference (WWW) 2025 Industrial Track as Oral Presentation</p></details> |

Despite these advancements, the high inference latency and the "overthinking" issues in model inference impair the efficiency and effectiveness of foundation models, thus limiting their application in real-time clinical settings. To address these challenges, we proposed EPEE (Entropy- and Patience-based Early Exiting), a novel hybrid strategy designed to improve the inference efficiency of foundation models. The core idea was to leverage the strengths of entropy-based and patience-based early exiting methods to overcome their respective weaknesses. To evaluate EPEE, we conducted experiments on three core biomedical tasks-classification, relation extraction, and event extraction-using four foundation models (BERT, ALBERT, GPT-2, and ViT) across twelve datasets, including clinical notes and medical images. The results showed that EPEE significantly reduced inference time while maintaining or improving accuracy, demonstrating its adaptability to diverse datasets and tasks. EPEE addressed critical barriers to deploying foundation models in healthcare by balancing efficiency and effectiveness. It potentially provided a practical solution for real-time clinical decision-making with foundation models, supporting reliable and efficient workflows.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to npj Digital Medicine</p></details> |

Various physiological and behavioural modalities have been explored for this purpose, with Electrocardiogram (ECG) emerging as a standout choice for real-time emotion monitoring, particularly in dynamic and unpredictable driving conditions. Existing methods, however, often rely on multi-channel ECG signals recorded under static conditions, limiting their applicability in real-world dynamic driving scenarios. To address this limitation, the paper introduces ECG-EmotionNet, a novel architecture designed specifically for emotion recognition in dynamic driving environments. ECG-EmotionNet is constructed by adapting a recently introduced ECG Foundation Model (FM) and uniquely employs single-channel ECG signals, ensuring both robust generalizability and computational efficiency. Unlike conventional adaptation methods such as full fine-tuning, linear probing, or low-rank adaptation, we propose an intuitively pleasing alternative, referred to as the nested Mixture of Experts (MoE) adaptation. More precisely, each transformer layer of the underlying FM is treated as a separate expert, with embeddings extracted from these experts fused using trainable weights within a gating mechanism. This approach enhances the representation of both global and local ECG features, leading to a 6% improvement in accuracy and a 7% increase in the F1 score, all while maintaining computational efficiency. The effectiveness of the proposed ECG-EmotionNet architecture is evaluated using a recently introduced and challenging driver emotion monitoring dataset.</p></details> |  |
| **[GRNFormer: A Biologically-Guided Framework for Integrating Gene Regulatory Networks into RNA Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01682v1)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models for single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) have shown promising capabilities in capturing gene expression patterns. However, current approaches face critical limitations: they ignore biological prior knowledge encoded in gene regulatory relationships and fail to leverage multi-omics signals that could provide complementary regulatory insights. In this paper, we propose GRNFormer, a new framework that systematically integrates multi-scale Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs) inferred from multi-omics data into RNA foundation model training. Our framework introduces two key innovations. First, we introduce a pipeline for constructing hierarchical GRNs that capture regulatory relationships at both cell-type-specific and cell-specific resolutions. Second, we design a structure-aware integration framework that addresses the information asymmetry in GRNs through two technical advances: (1) A graph topological adapter using multi-head cross-attention to weight regulatory relationships dynamically, and (2) a novel edge perturbation strategy that perturb GRNs with biologically-informed co-expression links to augment graph neural network training. Comprehensive experiments have been conducted on three representative downstream tasks across multiple model architectures to demonstrate the effectiveness of GRNFormer. It achieves consistent improvements over state-of-the-art (SoTA) baselines: $3.6\%$ increase in drug response prediction correlation, $9.6\%$ improvement in single-cell drug classification AUC, and $1.1\%$ average gain in gene perturbation prediction accuracy.</p></details> |  |

However, their open nature also makes them vulnerable to exploitation by malicious actors, including state-sponsored entities, who can conduct information operations (IOs) to manipulate public opinion. The spread of misinformation, false news, and misleading claims threatens democratic processes and societal cohesion, making it crucial to develop methods for the timely detection of inauthentic activity to protect the integrity of online discourse. In this work, we introduce a methodology designed to identify users orchestrating information operations, a.k.a. IO drivers, across various influence campaigns. Our framework, named IOHunter, leverages the combined strengths of Language Models and Graph Neural Networks to improve generalization in supervised, scarcely-supervised, and cross-IO contexts. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple sets of IOs originating from six countries, significantly surpassing existing approaches. This research marks a step toward developing Graph Foundation Models specifically tailored for the task of IO detection on social media platforms.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at AAAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[A General Purpose Spectral Foundational Model for Both Proximal and Remote Sensing Spectral Imaging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01628v1)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spectral imaging data acquired via multispectral and hyperspectral cameras can have hundreds of channels, where each channel records the reflectance at a specific wavelength and bandwidth. Time and resource constraints limit our ability to collect large spectral datasets, making it difficult to build and train predictive models from scratch. In the RGB domain, we can often alleviate some of the limitations of smaller datasets by using pretrained foundational models as a starting point. However, most existing foundation models are pretrained on large datasets of 3-channel RGB images, severely limiting their effectiveness when used with spectral imaging data. The few spectral foundation models that do exist usually have one of two limitations: (1) they are built and trained only on remote sensing data limiting their application in proximal spectral imaging, (2) they utilize the more widely available multispectral imaging datasets with less than 15 channels restricting their use with hundred-channel hyperspectral images. To alleviate these issues, we propose a large-scale foundational model and dataset built upon the masked autoencoder architecture that takes advantage of spectral channel encoding, spatial-spectral masking and ImageNet pretraining for an adaptable and robust model for downstream spectral imaging tasks.</p></details> |  |

Intrinsic motivation attempts to decouple exploration from external, task-based rewards. However, established approaches to intrinsic motivation that follow general principles such as information gain, often only uncover low-level interactions. In contrast, children's play suggests that they engage in meaningful high-level behavior by imitating or interacting with their caregivers. Recent work has focused on using foundation models to inject these semantic biases into exploration. However, these methods often rely on unrealistic assumptions, such as language-embedded environments or access to high-level actions. We propose SEmaNtically Sensible ExploratIon (SENSEI), a framework to equip model-based RL agents with an intrinsic motivation for semantically meaningful behavior. SENSEI distills a reward signal of interestingness from Vision Language Model (VLM) annotations, enabling an agent to predict these rewards through a world model. Using model-based RL, SENSEI trains an exploration policy that jointly maximizes semantic rewards and uncertainty. We show that in both robotic and video game-like simulations SENSEI discovers a variety of meaningful behaviors from image observations and low-level actions. SENSEI provides a general tool for learning from foundation model feedback, a crucial research direction, as VLMs become more powerful.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint, under review.

| **[AnyECG: Foundational Models for Multitask Cardiac Analysis in Real-World Settings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17711v2)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Electrocardiogram (ECG), a non-invasive and affordable tool for cardiac monitoring, is highly sensitive in detecting acute heart attacks. However, due to the lengthy nature of ECG recordings, numerous machine learning methods have been developed for automated heart disease detection to reduce human workload. Despite these efforts, performance remains suboptimal. A key obstacle is the inherent complexity of ECG data, which includes heterogeneity (e.g., varying sampling rates), high levels of noise, demographic-related pattern shifts, and intricate rhythm-event associations. To overcome these challenges, this paper introduces AnyECG, a foundational model designed to extract robust representations from any real-world ECG data. Specifically, a tailored ECG Tokenizer encodes each fixed-duration ECG fragment into a token and, guided by proxy tasks, converts noisy, continuous ECG features into discrete, compact, and clinically meaningful local rhythm codes. These codes encapsulate basic morphological, frequency, and demographic information (e.g., sex), effectively mitigating signal noise. We further pre-train the AnyECG to learn rhythmic pattern associations across ECG tokens, enabling the capture of cardiac event semantics. By being jointly pre-trained on diverse ECG data sources, AnyECG is capable of generalizing across a wide range of downstream tasks where ECG signals are recorded from various devices and scenarios. The experimental results show that AnyECG achieves an average performance improvement of 6% across four critical tasks-anomaly detection, arrhythmia classification, corrupted lead generation, and ultra-long ECG recognition. AnyECG learns common ECG rhythm from data and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in each of these tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, these claims have yet to be thoroughly validated empirically. Recently, foundation models have demonstrated unparalleled capabilities across diverse domains, from language to computer vision, positioning them as a potential cornerstone of future research for a wide range of computational tasks. In this paper, we conduct an extensive empirical study on representation learning for downstream Visual Question Answering (VQA), which requires an accurate compositional understanding of the scene. We thoroughly investigate the benefits and trade-offs of OC models and alternative approaches including large pre-trained foundation models on both synthetic and real-world data, ultimately identifying a promising path to leverage the strengths of both paradigms. The extensiveness of our study, encompassing over 600 downstream VQA models and 15 different types of upstream representations, also provides several additional insights that we believe will be of interest to the community at large.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at ICLR 2025</p></details> |

Recently, foundation models (FMs) leveraging self-supervised pre-training have been widely advocated as a universal solution for diverse downstream tasks. However, open questions remain about their clinical applicability and generalization advantages over end-to-end learning using task-specific (TS) models. Here, we focused on AI with clinical-grade performance for prostate cancer diagnosis and Gleason grading. We present the largest validation of AI for this task, using over 100,000 core needle biopsies from 7,342 patients across 15 sites in 11 countries. We compared two FMs with a fully end-to-end TS model in a multiple instance learning framework. Our findings challenge assumptions that FMs universally outperform TS models. While FMs demonstrated utility in data-scarce scenarios, their performance converged with - and was in some cases surpassed by - TS models when sufficient labeled training data were available. Notably, extensive task-specific training markedly reduced clinically significant misgrading, misdiagnosis of challenging morphologies, and variability across different WSI scanners. Additionally, FMs used up to 35 times more energy than the TS model, raising concerns about their sustainability. Our results underscore that while FMs offer clear advantages for rapid prototyping and research, their role as a universal solution for clinically applicable medical AI remains uncertain. For high-stakes clinical applications, rigorous validation and consideration of task-specific training remain critically important. We advocate for integrating the strengths of FMs and end-to-end learning to achieve robust and resource-efficient AI pathology solutions fit for clinical use.</p></details> | <details><summary>50 pa...</summary><p>50 pages, 15 figures and an appendix (study protocol) which is previously published, see https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.07.04.24309948; updated authors list format</p></details> |
| **[Causality Is Key to Understand and Balance Multiple Goals in Trustworthy ML and Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21123v2)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring trustworthiness in machine learning (ML) systems is crucial as they become increasingly embedded in high-stakes domains. This paper advocates for integrating causal methods into machine learning to navigate the trade-offs among key principles of trustworthy ML, including fairness, privacy, robustness, accuracy, and explainability. While these objectives should ideally be satisfied simultaneously, they are often addressed in isolation, leading to conflicts and suboptimal solutions. Drawing on existing applications of causality in ML that successfully align goals such as fairness and accuracy or privacy and robustness, this paper argues that a causal approach is essential for balancing multiple competing objectives in both trustworthy ML and foundation models. Beyond highlighting these trade-offs, we examine how causality can be practically integrated into ML and foundation models, offering solutions to enhance their reliability and interpretability. Finally, we discuss the challenges, limitations, and opportunities in adopting causal frameworks, paving the way for more accountable and ethically sound AI systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving Representation of High-frequency Components for Medical Visual Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14651v3)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models have recently attracted significant attention for their impressive generalizability across diverse downstream tasks. However, these models are demonstrated to exhibit great limitations in representing high-frequency components and fine-grained details. In many medical imaging tasks, the precise representation of such information is crucial due to the inherently intricate anatomical structures, sub-visual features, and complex boundaries involved. Consequently, the limited representation of prevalent foundation models can result in significant performance degradation or even failure in these tasks. To address these challenges, we propose a novel pretraining strategy, named Frequency-advanced Representation Autoencoder (Frepa). Through high-frequency masking and low-frequency perturbation combined with adversarial learning, Frepa encourages the encoder to effectively represent and preserve high-frequency components in the image embeddings. Additionally, we introduce an innovative histogram-equalized image masking strategy, extending the Masked Autoencoder approach beyond ViT to other architectures such as Swin Transformer and convolutional networks. We develop Frepa across nine medical modalities and validate it on 32 downstream tasks for both 2D images and 3D volume data. Without fine-tuning, Frepa can outperform other self-supervised pretraining methods and, in some cases, even surpasses task-specific trained models. This improvement is particularly significant for tasks involving fine-grained details, such as achieving up to a +15% increase in DSC for retina vessel segmentation and a +7% increase in IoU for lung nodule detection. Further experiments quantitatively reveal that Frepa enables superior high-frequency representations and preservation in the embeddings, underscoring its potential for developing more generalized and universal medical image foundation models.</p></details> |  |

With the success of visual foundation models (VFMs) in the image domain, leveraging 2D priors to address 3D online segmentation has become a prominent research focus. Since segmentation results provided by 2D priors often require spatial consistency to be lifted into final 3D segmentation, an efficient method for identifying spatial overlap among 2D masks is essential - yet existing methods rarely achieve this in real time, mainly limiting its use to offline approaches. To address this, we propose an efficient method that lifts 2D masks generated by VFMs into a unified 3D instance using a hashing technique. By employing voxel hashing for efficient 3D scene querying, our approach reduces the time complexity of costly spatial overlap queries from $O(n^2)$ to $O(n)$. Accurate spatial associations further enable 3D merging of 2D masks through simple similarity-based filtering in a zero-shot manner, making our approach more robust to incomplete and noisy data. Evaluated on the ScanNet and SceneNN benchmarks, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in online, open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation with leading efficiency.</p></details> |  |

However, the general applicability of these encodings and their potential to serve as foundational representations for graphs remain uncertain. This paper investigates the fine-tuning efficiency, scalability with sample size, and generalization capability of learnable PSEs across diverse graph datasets. Specifically, we evaluate their potential as universal pre-trained models that can be easily adapted to new tasks with minimal fine-tuning and limited data. Furthermore, we assess the expressivity of the learned representations, particularly, when used to augment downstream GNNs. We demonstrate through extensive benchmarking and empirical analysis that PSEs generally enhance downstream models. However, some datasets may require specific PSE-augmentations to achieve optimal performance. Nevertheless, our findings highlight their significant potential to become integral components of future graph foundation models. We provide new insights into the strengths and limitations of PSEs, contributing to the broader discourse on foundation models in graph learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at TMLR (https://openreview.net/forum?id=mSoDRZXsqj)</p></details> |

Those foundation models are typically trained in a prediction-focused manner to maximize forecast quality. In contrast, decision-focused learning directly improves the resulting value of the forecast in downstream optimization rather than merely maximizing forecasting quality. The practical integration of forecast values into forecasting models is challenging, particularly when addressing complex applications with diverse instances, such as buildings. This becomes even more complicated when instances possess specific characteristics that require instance-specific, tailored predictions to increase the forecast value. To tackle this challenge, we use decision-focused fine-tuning within time series foundation models to offer a scalable and efficient solution for decision-focused learning applied to the dispatchable feeder optimization problem. To obtain more robust predictions for scarce building data, we use Moirai as a state-of-the-art foundation model, which offers robust and generalized results with few-shot parameter-efficient fine-tuning. Comparing the decision-focused fine-tuned Moirai with a state-of-the-art classical prediction-focused fine-tuning Morai, we observe an improvement of 9.45% in average total daily costs.</p></details> |  |

Developing foundation models for hypergraphs is challenging due to their distinct data, which includes both vertex features and intricate structural information. We present Hyper-FM, a Hypergraph Foundation Model for multi-domain knowledge extraction, featuring Hierarchical High-Order Neighbor Guided Vertex Knowledge Embedding for vertex feature representation and Hierarchical Multi-Hypergraph Guided Structural Knowledge Extraction for structural information. Additionally, we curate 10 text-attributed hypergraph datasets to advance research between HGNNs and LLMs. Experiments on these datasets show that Hyper-FM outperforms baseline methods by approximately 13.3\%, validating our approach. Furthermore, we propose the first scaling law for hypergraph foundation models, demonstrating that increasing domain diversity significantly enhances performance, unlike merely augmenting vertex and hyperedge counts. This underscores the critical role of domain diversity in scaling hypergraph models.</p></details> |  |

However, there have been limited efforts to evaluate these audio FMs comprehensively on their ability to have natural and interactive conversations. To engage in meaningful conversation with the end user, we would want the FMs to additionally perform a fluent succession of turns without too much overlapping speech or long stretches of silence. Inspired by this, we ask whether the recently proposed audio FMs can understand, predict, and perform turn-taking events? To answer this, we propose a novel evaluation protocol that can assess spoken dialog system's turn-taking capabilities using a supervised model as a judge that has been trained to predict turn-taking events in human-human conversations. Using this protocol, we present the first comprehensive user study that evaluates existing spoken dialogue systems on their ability to perform turn-taking events and reveal many interesting insights, such as they sometimes do not understand when to speak up, can interrupt too aggressively and rarely backchannel. We further evaluate multiple open-source and proprietary audio FMs accessible through APIs on carefully curated test benchmarks from Switchboard to measure their ability to understand and predict turn-taking events and identify significant room for improvement. We will open source our evaluation platform to promote the development of advanced conversational AI systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICLR 2025</p></details> |

First, we compared the proposed method with previous multitask reinforcement learning methods in the standard multi-locomotion tasks. The results showed that the proposed approach outperformed the baseline methods. Then, we applied the proposed method to the ball heading task using a monopod robot model to evaluate skill generation performance. The results showed that the proposed method was able to adapt to novel target positions or inexperienced ball restitution coefficients but to acquire a foundational policy network, originally learned for heading motion, which can generate an entirely new overhead kicking skill.</p></details> | 11 pages, 9 figures |

Hypernetworks, neural networks that generate some or all of the parameters of another neural network, have become an increasingly important technique for conditioning and generalizing implicit neural representations (INRs), which represent signals or objects such as audio or 3D shapes using a neural network. However, despite the potential benefits of incorporating foundation models in hypernetwork methods, this research direction has not been investigated, likely due to the dissimilarity of the weight generation task with other visual tasks. To address this gap, we (1) show how foundation models can improve hypernetworks with Transformer-based architectures, (2) provide an empirical analysis of the benefits of foundation models for hypernetworks through the lens of the generalizable INR task, showing that leveraging foundation models improves performance, generalizability, and data efficiency across a variety of algorithms and modalities. We also provide further analysis in examining the design space of foundation model-based hypernetworks, including examining the choice of foundation models, algorithms, and the effect of scaling foundation models.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |

However, these models still struggle with domain gaps in practical applications. Specifically, even after fine-tuning on source-domain data, task-adapted foundation models often perform poorly in the target domain. To address this challenge, we propose a few-shot unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) framework for MFMs, named MFM-DA, which only leverages a limited number of unlabeled target-domain images. Our approach begins by training a Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM), which is then adapted to the target domain using a proposed dynamic instance-aware adaptor and a distribution direction loss, enabling the DDPM to translate source-domain images into the target domain style. The adapted images are subsequently processed through the MFM, where we introduce a designed channel-spatial alignment Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to ensure effective feature alignment. Extensive experiments on optic cup and disc segmentation tasks demonstrate that MFM-DA outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Our work provides a practical solution to the domain gap issue in real-world MFM deployment. Code will be available at here.</p></details> |  |

We investigate three self-supervised learning methods (SimCLR, BYOL, MAE) with ResNet-50 and Vision Transformer architectures, assessing model generalization through leave-one-dataset-out experiments and data scaling analysis. Results show that pre-training on diverse datasets significantly improves generalization, with BYOL and MAE outperforming SimCLR, highlighting the efficacy of feature-consistency and generative learning over contrastive approaches. Data scaling experiments reveal that performance saturates at 60-70% of total data for BYOL and MAE, while SimCLR requires more data. These findings demonstrate that publicly available ECG data can match or surpass proprietary datasets in training robust ECG-FMs, paving the way for scalable, clinically meaningful AI-driven ECG analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[CBraMod: A Criss-Cross Brain Foundation Model for EEG Decoding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07236v4)** | 2025-03-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Electroencephalography (EEG) is a non-invasive technique to measure and record brain electrical activity, widely used in various BCI and healthcare applications. Early EEG decoding methods rely on supervised learning, limited by specific tasks and datasets, hindering model performance and generalizability. With the success of large language models, there is a growing body of studies focusing on EEG foundation models. However, these studies still leave challenges: Firstly, most of existing EEG foundation models employ full EEG modeling strategy. It models the spatial and temporal dependencies between all EEG patches together, but ignores that the spatial and temporal dependencies are heterogeneous due to the unique structural characteristics of EEG signals. Secondly, existing EEG foundation models have limited generalizability on a wide range of downstream BCI tasks due to varying formats of EEG data, making it challenging to adapt to. To address these challenges, we propose a novel foundation model called CBraMod. Specifically, we devise a criss-cross transformer as the backbone to thoroughly leverage the structural characteristics of EEG signals, which can model spatial and temporal dependencies separately through two parallel attention mechanisms. And we utilize an asymmetric conditional positional encoding scheme which can encode positional information of EEG patches and be easily adapted to the EEG with diverse formats. CBraMod is pre-trained on a very large corpus of EEG through patch-based masked EEG reconstruction. We evaluate CBraMod on up to 10 downstream BCI tasks (12 public datasets). CBraMod achieves the state-of-the-art performance across the wide range of tasks, proving its strong capability and generalizability.
