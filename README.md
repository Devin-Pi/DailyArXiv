| **[Evaluating Large Language Models on Spatial Tasks: A Multi-Task Benchmarking Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14438v1)** | 2024-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The advent of large language models such as ChatGPT, Gemini, and others has underscored the importance of evaluating their diverse capabilities, ranging from natural language understanding to code generation. However, their performance on spatial tasks has not been comprehensively assessed. This study addresses this gap by introducing a novel multi-task spatial evaluation dataset, designed to systematically explore and compare the performance of several advanced models on spatial tasks. The dataset encompasses twelve distinct task types, including spatial understanding and path planning, each with verified, accurate answers. We evaluated multiple models, including OpenAI's gpt-3.5-turbo, gpt-4o, and ZhipuAI's glm-4, through a two-phase testing approach. Initially, we conducted zero-shot testing, followed by categorizing the dataset by difficulty and performing prompt tuning tests. Results indicate that gpt-4o achieved the highest overall accuracy in the first phase, with an average of 71.3%. Although moonshot-v1-8k slightly underperformed overall, it surpassed gpt-4o in place name recognition tasks. The study also highlights the impact of prompt strategies on model performance in specific tasks. For example, the Chain-of-Thought (COT) strategy increased gpt-4o's accuracy in path planning from 12.4% to 87.5%, while a one-shot strategy enhanced moonshot-v1-8k's accuracy in mapping tasks from 10.1% to 76.3%.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generalized Bayesian nonparametric clustering framework for high-dimensional spatial omics data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14410v1)** | 2024-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The advent of next-generation sequencing-based spatially resolved transcriptomics (SRT) techniques has transformed genomic research by enabling high-throughput gene expression profiling while preserving spatial context. Identifying spatial domains within SRT data is a critical task, with numerous computational approaches currently available. However, most existing methods rely on a multi-stage process that involves ad-hoc dimension reduction techniques to manage the high dimensionality of SRT data. These low-dimensional embeddings are then subjected to model-based or distance-based clustering methods. Additionally, many approaches depend on arbitrarily specifying the number of clusters (i.e., spatial domains), which can result in information loss and suboptimal downstream analysis. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Bayesian nonparametric mixture of factor analysis (BNPMFA) model, which incorporates a Markov random field-constrained Gibbs-type prior for partitioning high-dimensional spatial omics data. This new prior effectively integrates the spatial constraints inherent in SRT data while simultaneously inferring cluster membership and determining the optimal number of spatial domains. We have established the theoretical identifiability of cluster membership within this framework. The efficacy of our proposed approach is demonstrated through realistic simulations and applications to two SRT datasets. Our results show that the BNPMFA model not only surpasses state-of-the-art methods in clustering accuracy and estimating the number of clusters but also offers novel insights for identifying cellular regions within tissue samples.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-head Spatial-Spectral Mamba for Hyperspectral Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01224v3)** | 2024-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial-Spectral Mamba (SSM) improves computational efficiency and captures long-range dependencies, addressing Transformer limitations. However, traditional Mamba models overlook rich spectral information in HSIs and struggle with high dimensionality and sequential data. To address these issues, we propose the SSM with multi-head self-attention and token enhancement (MHSSMamba). This model integrates spectral and spatial information by enhancing spectral tokens and using multi-head attention to capture complex relationships between spectral bands and spatial locations. It also manages long-range dependencies and the sequential nature of HSI data, preserving contextual information across spectral bands. MHSSMamba achieved remarkable classification accuracies of 97.62\% on Pavia University, 96.92\% on the University of Houston, 96.85\% on Salinas, and 99.49\% on Wuhan-longKou datasets. The source code is available at \href{https://github.com/MHassaanButt/MHA\_SS\_Mamba}{GitHub}.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bengali Sign Language Recognition through Hand Pose Estimation using Multi-Branch Spatial-Temporal Attention Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14111v1)** | 2024-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hand gesture-based sign language recognition (SLR) is one of the most advanced applications of machine learning, and computer vision uses hand gestures. Although, in the past few years, many researchers have widely explored and studied how to address BSL problems, specific unaddressed issues remain, such as skeleton and transformer-based BSL recognition. In addition, the lack of evaluation of the BSL model in various concealed environmental conditions can prove the generalized property of the existing model by facing daily life signs. As a consequence, existing BSL recognition systems provide a limited perspective of their generalisation ability as they are tested on datasets containing few BSL alphabets that have a wide disparity in gestures and are easy to differentiate. To overcome these limitations, we propose a spatial-temporal attention-based BSL recognition model considering hand joint skeletons extracted from the sequence of images. The main aim of utilising hand skeleton-based BSL data is to ensure the privacy and low-resolution sequence of images, which need minimum computational cost and low hardware configurations. Our model captures discriminative structural displacements and short-range dependency based on unified joint features projected onto high-dimensional feature space. Specifically, the use of Separable TCN combined with a powerful multi-head spatial-temporal attention architecture generated high-performance accuracy. The extensive experiments with a proposed dataset and two benchmark BSL datasets with a wide range of evaluations, such as intra- and inter-dataset evaluation settings, demonstrated that our proposed models achieve competitive performance with extremely low computational complexity and run faster than existing models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Network Level Spatial Temporal Traffic State Forecasting with Hierarchical Attention LSTM (HierAttnLSTM)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.05760v4)** | 2024-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic state data, such as speed, volume and travel time collected from ubiquitous traffic monitoring sensors require advanced network level analytics for forecasting and identifying significant traffic patterns. This paper leverages diverse traffic state datasets from the Caltrans Performance Measurement System (PeMS) hosted on the open benchmark and achieved promising performance compared to well recognized spatial-temporal models. Drawing inspiration from the success of hierarchical architectures in various Artificial Intelligence (AI) tasks, we integrate cell and hidden states from low-level to high-level Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks with an attention pooling mechanism, similar to human perception systems. The developed hierarchical structure is designed to account for dependencies across different time scales, capturing the spatial-temporal correlations of network-level traffic states, enabling the prediction of traffic states for all corridors rather than a single link or route. The efficiency of designed attention-based LSTM is analyzed by ablation study. Comparative results with baseline LSTM models demonstrate that the Hierarchical Attention LSTM (HierAttnLSTM) model not only provides higher prediction accuracy but also effectively forecasts unusual congestion patterns. Data and code are made publicly available to support reproducible scientific research.</p></details> |  |
| **[GeoPlant: Spatial Plant Species Prediction Dataset](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13928v1)** | 2024-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The difficulty of monitoring biodiversity at fine scales and over large areas limits ecological knowledge and conservation efforts. To fill this gap, Species Distribution Models (SDMs) predict species across space from spatially explicit features. Yet, they face the challenge of integrating the rich but heterogeneous data made available over the past decade, notably millions of opportunistic species observations and standardized surveys, as well as multi-modal remote sensing data. In light of that, we have designed and developed a new European-scale dataset for SDMs at high spatial resolution (10-50 m), including more than 10k species (i.e., most of the European flora). The dataset comprises 5M heterogeneous Presence-Only records and 90k exhaustive Presence-Absence survey records, all accompanied by diverse environmental rasters (e.g., elevation, human footprint, and soil) that are traditionally used in SDMs. In addition, it provides Sentinel-2 RGB and NIR satellite images with 10 m resolution, a 20-year time-series of climatic variables, and satellite time-series from the Landsat program. In addition to the data, we provide an openly accessible SDM benchmark (hosted on Kaggle), which has already attracted an active community and a set of strong baselines for single predictor/modality and multimodal approaches. All resources, e.g., the dataset, pre-trained models, and baseline methods (in the form of notebooks), are available on Kaggle, allowing one to start with our dataset literally with two mouse clicks.</p></details> |  |
| **[StreamAAD: Decoding Spatial Auditory Attention with a Streaming Architecture](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13522v1)** | 2024-08-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we present our approach for the Track 1 of the Chinese Auditory Attention Decoding (Chinese AAD) Challenge at ISCSLP 2024. Most existing spatial auditory attention decoding (Sp-AAD) methods employ an isolated window architecture, focusing solely on global invariant features without considering relationships between different decision windows, which can lead to suboptimal performance. To address this issue, we propose a novel streaming decoding architecture, termed StreamAAD. In StreamAAD, decision windows are input to the network as a sequential stream and decoded in order, allowing for the modeling of inter-window relationships. Additionally, we employ a model ensemble strategy, achieving significant better performance than the baseline, ranking First in the challenge.</p></details> |  |
| **[AngleSizer: Enhancing Spatial Scale Perception for the Visually Impaired with an Interactive Smartphone Assistant](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13505v1)** | 2024-08-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial perception, particularly at small and medium scales, is an essential human sense but poses a significant challenge for the blind and visually impaired (BVI). Traditional learning methods for BVI individuals are often constrained by the limited availability of suitable learning environments and high associated costs. To tackle these barriers, we conducted comprehensive studies to delve into the real-world challenges faced by the BVI community. We have identified several key factors hindering their spatial perception, including the high social cost of seeking assistance, inefficient methods of information intake, cognitive and behavioral disconnects, and a lack of opportunities for hands-on exploration. As a result, we developed AngleSizer, an innovative teaching assistant that leverages smartphone technology. AngleSizer is designed to enable BVI individuals to use natural interaction gestures to try, feel, understand, and learn about sizes and angles effectively. This tool incorporates dual vibration-audio feedback, carefully crafted teaching processes, and specialized learning modules to enhance the learning experience. Extensive user experiments validated its efficacy and applicability with diverse abilities and visual conditions. Ultimately, our research not only expands the understanding of BVI behavioral patterns but also greatly improves their spatial perception capabilities, in a way that is both cost-effective and allows for independent learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper was accepted by IMWUT/Ubicomp 2024</p></details> |
| **[Localized Observation Abstraction Using Piecewise Linear Spatial Decay for Reinforcement Learning in Combat Simulations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13328v1)** | 2024-08-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the domain of combat simulations, the training and deployment of deep reinforcement learning (RL) agents still face substantial challenges due to the dynamic and intricate nature of such environments. Unfortunately, as the complexity of the scenarios and available information increases, the training time required to achieve a certain threshold of performance does not just increase, but often does so exponentially. This relationship underscores the profound impact of complexity in training RL agents. This paper introduces a novel approach that addresses this limitation in training artificial intelligence (AI) agents using RL. Traditional RL methods have been shown to struggle in these high-dimensional, dynamic environments due to real-world computational constraints and the known sample inefficiency challenges of RL. To overcome these limitations, we propose a method of localized observation abstraction using piecewise linear spatial decay. This technique simplifies the state space, reducing computational demands while still preserving essential information, thereby enhancing AI training efficiency in dynamic environments where spatial relationships are often critical. Our analysis reveals that this localized observation approach consistently outperforms the more traditional global observation approach across increasing scenario complexity levels. This paper advances the research on observation abstractions for RL, illustrating how localized observation with piecewise linear spatial decay can provide an effective solution to large state representation challenges in dynamic environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatial-Spectral Morphological Mamba for Hyperspectral Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01372v2)** | 2024-08-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, the emergence of Transformers with self-attention mechanism has revolutionized the hyperspectral image (HSI) classification. However, these models face major challenges in computational efficiency, as their complexity increases quadratically with the sequence length. The Mamba architecture, leveraging a state space model (SSM), offers a more efficient alternative to Transformers. This paper introduces the Spatial-Spectral Morphological Mamba (MorpMamba) model in which, a token generation module first converts the HSI patch into spatial-spectral tokens. These tokens are then processed by morphological operations, which compute structural and shape information using depthwise separable convolutional operations. The extracted information is enhanced in a feature enhancement module that adjusts the spatial and spectral tokens based on the center region of the HSI sample, allowing for effective information fusion within each block. Subsequently, the tokens are refined through a multi-head self-attention which further improves the feature space. Finally, the combined information is fed into the state space block for classification and the creation of the ground truth map. Experiments on widely used HSI datasets demonstrate that the MorpMamba model outperforms (parametric efficiency) both CNN and Transformer models. The source code will be made publicly available at \url{https://github.com/MHassaanButt/MorpMamba}.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLaVA-VSD: Large Language-and-Vision Assistant for Visual Spatial Description](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04957v2)** | 2024-08-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual Spatial Description (VSD) aims to generate texts that describe the spatial relationships between objects within images. Traditional visual spatial relationship classification (VSRC) methods typically output the spatial relationship between two objects in an image, often neglecting world knowledge and lacking general language capabilities. In this paper, we propose a Large Language-and-Vision Assistant for Visual Spatial Description, named LLaVA-VSD, which is designed for the classification, description, and open-ended description of visual spatial relationships. Specifically, the model first constructs a VSD instruction-following dataset using given figure-caption pairs for the three tasks. It then employs LoRA to fine-tune a Large Language and Vision Assistant for VSD, which has 13 billion parameters and supports high-resolution images. Finally, a large language model (Qwen-2) is used to refine the generated sentences, enhancing their diversity and accuracy. LLaVA-VSD demonstrates excellent multimodal conversational capabilities and can follow open-ended instructions to assist with inquiries about object relationships in images.</p></details> |  |
| **[SIMPNet: Spatial-Informed Motion Planning Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12831v1)** | 2024-08-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current robotic manipulators require fast and efficient motion-planning algorithms to operate in cluttered environments. State-of-the-art sampling-based motion planners struggle to scale to high-dimensional configuration spaces and are inefficient in complex environments. This inefficiency arises because these planners utilize either uniform or hand-crafted sampling heuristics within the configuration space. To address these challenges, we present the Spatial-informed Motion Planning Network (SIMPNet). SIMPNet consists of a stochastic graph neural network (GNN)-based sampling heuristic for informed sampling within the configuration space. The sampling heuristic of SIMPNet encodes the workspace embedding into the configuration space through a cross-attention mechanism. It encodes the manipulator's kinematic structure into a graph, which is used to generate informed samples within the framework of sampling-based motion planning algorithms. We have evaluated the performance of SIMPNet using a UR5e robotic manipulator operating within simple and complex workspaces, comparing it against baseline state-of-the-art motion planners. The evaluation results show the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed planner compared to the baseline planners.</p></details> |  |
| **[Leveraging Information Consistency in Frequency and Spatial Domain for Adversarial Attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12670v1)** | 2024-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Adversarial examples are a key method to exploit deep neural networks. Using gradient information, such examples can be generated in an efficient way without altering the victim model. Recent frequency domain transformation has further enhanced the transferability of such adversarial examples, such as spectrum simulation attack. In this work, we investigate the effectiveness of frequency domain-based attacks, aligning with similar findings in the spatial domain. Furthermore, such consistency between the frequency and spatial domains provides insights into how gradient-based adversarial attacks induce perturbations across different domains, which is yet to be explored. Hence, we propose a simple, effective, and scalable gradient-based adversarial attack algorithm leveraging the information consistency in both frequency and spatial domains. We evaluate the algorithm for its effectiveness against different models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our algorithm achieves state-of-the-art results compared to other gradient-based algorithms.

| **[Deep Learning Improvements for Sparse Spatial Field Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12531v1)** | 2024-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurately reconstructing a global spatial field from sparse data has been a longstanding problem in several domains, such as Earth Sciences and Fluid Dynamics. Historically, scientists have approached this problem by employing complex physics models to reconstruct the spatial fields. However, these methods are often computationally intensive. With the increase in popularity of machine learning (ML), several researchers have applied ML to the spatial field reconstruction task and observed improvements in computational efficiency. One such method in arXiv:2101.00554 utilizes a sparse mask of sensor locations and a Voronoi tessellation with sensor measurements as inputs to a convolutional neural network for reconstructing the global spatial field. In this work, we propose multiple adjustments to the aforementioned approach and show improvements on geoscience and fluid dynamics simulation datasets. We identify and discuss scenarios that benefit the most using the proposed ML-based spatial field reconstruction approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning to Imitate Spatial Organization in Multi-robot Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11592v3)** | 2024-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding collective behavior and how it evolves is important to ensure that robot swarms can be trusted in a shared environment. One way to understand the behavior of the swarm is through collective behavior reconstruction using prior demonstrations. Existing approaches often require access to the swarm controller which may not be available. We reconstruct collective behaviors in distinct swarm scenarios involving shared environments without using swarm controller information. We achieve this by transforming prior demonstrations into features that describe multi-agent interactions before behavior reconstruction with multi-agent generative adversarial imitation learning (MA-GAIL). We show that our approach outperforms existing algorithms in spatial organization, and can be used to observe and reconstruct a swarm's behavior for further analysis and testing, which might be impractical or undesirable on the original robot swarm.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 4 figures.

| **[StreamLTS: Query-based Temporal-Spatial LiDAR Fusion for Cooperative Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03825v2)** | 2024-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cooperative perception via communication among intelligent traffic agents has great potential to improve the safety of autonomous driving. However, limited communication bandwidth, localization errors and asynchronized capturing time of sensor data, all introduce difficulties to the data fusion of different agents. To some extend, previous works have attempted to reduce the shared data size, mitigate the spatial feature misalignment caused by localization errors and communication delay. However, none of them have considered the asynchronized sensor ticking times, which can lead to dynamic object misplacement of more than one meter during data fusion. In this work, we propose Time-Aligned COoperative Object Detection (TA-COOD), for which we adapt widely used dataset OPV2V and DairV2X with considering asynchronous LiDAR sensor ticking times and build an efficient fully sparse framework with modeling the temporal information of individual objects with query-based techniques. The experiment results confirmed the superior efficiency of our fully sparse framework compared to the state-of-the-art dense models. More importantly, they show that the point-wise observation timestamps of the dynamic objects are crucial for accurate modeling the object temporal context and the predictability of their time-related locations. The official code is available at \url{https://github.com/YuanYunshuang/CoSense3D}.</p></details> |  |
| **[Object Re-identification via Spatial-temporal Fusion Networks and Causal Identity Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05558v2)** | 2024-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Object re-identification (ReID) in large camera networks faces numerous challenges. First, the similar appearances of objects degrade ReID performance, a challenge that needs to be addressed by existing appearance-based ReID methods. Second, most ReID studies are performed in laboratory settings and do not consider real-world scenarios. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a novel ReID framework that leverages a spatial-temporal fusion network and causal identity matching (CIM). Our framework estimates camera network topology using a proposed adaptive Parzen window and combines appearance features with spatial-temporal cues within the fusion network. This approach has demonstrated outstanding performance across several datasets, including VeRi776, Vehicle-3I, and Market-1501, achieving up to 99.70% rank-1 accuracy and 95.5% mAP. Furthermore, the proposed CIM approach, which dynamically assigns gallery sets based on camera network topology, has further improved ReID accuracy and robustness in real-world settings, evidenced by a 94.95% mAP and a 95.19% F1 score on the Vehicle-3I dataset. The experimental results support the effectiveness of incorporating spatial-temporal information and CIM for real-world ReID scenarios, regardless of the data domain (e.g., vehicle, person).</p></details> |  |
| **[Computer-Aided Fall Recognition Using a Three-Stream Spatial-Temporal GCN Model with Adaptive Feature Aggregation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12211v1)** | 2024-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The prevention of falls is paramount in modern healthcare, particularly for the elderly, as falls can lead to severe injuries or even fatalities. Additionally, the growing incidence of falls among the elderly, coupled with the urgent need to prevent suicide attempts resulting from medication overdose, underscores the critical importance of accurate and efficient fall detection methods. In this scenario, a computer-aided fall detection system is inevitable to save elderly people's lives worldwide. Many researchers have been working to develop fall detection systems. However, the existing fall detection systems often struggle with issues such as unsatisfactory performance accuracy, limited robustness, high computational complexity, and sensitivity to environmental factors due to a lack of effective features. In response to these challenges, this paper proposes a novel three-stream spatial-temporal feature-based fall detection system. Our system incorporates joint skeleton-based spatial and temporal Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) features, joint motion-based spatial and temporal GCN features, and residual connections-based features. Each stream employs adaptive graph-based feature aggregation and consecutive separable convolutional neural networks (Sep-TCN), significantly reducing computational complexity and model parameters compared to prior systems. Experimental results across multiple datasets demonstrate the superior effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed system, with accuracies of 99.51\%, 99.15\%, 99.79\% and 99.85 \% achieved on the ImViA, UR-Fall, Fall-UP and FU-Kinect datasets, respectively. The remarkable performance of our system highlights its superiority, efficiency, and generalizability in real-world fall detection scenarios, offering significant advancements in healthcare and societal well-being.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bayesian Function-on-Function Regression for Spatial Functional Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08175v2)** | 2024-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial functional data arise in many settings, such as particulate matter curves observed at monitoring stations and age population curves at each areal unit. Most existing functional regression models have limited applicability because they do not consider spatial correlations. Although functional kriging methods can predict the curves at unobserved spatial locations, they are based on variogram fittings rather than constructing hierarchical statistical models. In this manuscript, we propose a Bayesian framework for spatial function-on-function regression that can carry out parameter estimations and predictions. However, the proposed model has computational and inferential challenges because the model needs to account for within and between-curve dependencies. Furthermore, high-dimensional and spatially correlated parameters can lead to the slow mixing of Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms. To address these issues, we first utilize a basis transformation approach to simplify the covariance and apply projection methods for dimension reduction. We also develop a simultaneous band score for the proposed model to detect the significant region in the regression function. We apply our method to both areal and point-level spatial functional data, showing the proposed method is computationally efficient and provides accurate estimations and predictions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fast and robust cross-validation-based scoring rule inference for spatial statistics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11994v1)** | 2024-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scoring rules are aimed at evaluation of the quality of predictions, but can also be used for estimation of parameters in statistical models. We propose estimating parameters of multivariate spatial models by maximising the average leave-one-out cross-validation score. This method, LOOS, thus optimises predictions instead of maximising the likelihood. The method allows for fast computations for Gaussian models with sparse precision matrices, such as spatial Markov models. It also makes it possible to tailor the estimator's robustness to outliers and their sensitivity to spatial variations of uncertainty through the choice of the scoring rule which is used in the maximisation. The effects of the choice of scoring rule which is used in LOOS are studied by simulation in terms of computation time, statistical efficiency, and robustness. Various popular scoring rules and a new scoring rule, the root score, are compared to maximum likelihood estimation. The results confirmed that for spatial Markov models the computation time for LOOS was much smaller than for maximum likelihood estimation. Furthermore, the standard deviations of parameter estimates were smaller for maximum likelihood estimation, although the differences often were small. The simulations also confirmed that the usage of a robust scoring rule results in robust LOOS estimates and that the robustness provides better predictive quality for spatial data with outliers. Finally, the new inference method was applied to ERA5 temperature reanalysis data for the contiguous United States and the average July temperature for the years 1940 to 2023, and this showed that the LOOS estimator provided parameter estimates that were more than a hundred times faster to compute compared to maximum-likelihood estimation, and resulted in a model with better predictive performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Time Series Foundation Models and Deep Learning Architectures for Earthquake Temporal and Spatial Nowcasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11990v1)** | 2024-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advancing the capabilities of earthquake nowcasting, the real-time forecasting of seismic activities remains a crucial and enduring objective aimed at reducing casualties. This multifaceted challenge has recently gained attention within the deep learning domain, facilitated by the availability of extensive, long-term earthquake datasets. Despite significant advancements, existing literature on earthquake nowcasting lacks comprehensive evaluations of pre-trained foundation models and modern deep learning architectures. These architectures, such as transformers or graph neural networks, uniquely focus on different aspects of data, including spatial relationships, temporal patterns, and multi-scale dependencies. This paper addresses the mentioned gap by analyzing different architectures and introducing two innovation approaches called MultiFoundationQuake and GNNCoder. We formulate earthquake nowcasting as a time series forecasting problem for the next 14 days within 0.1-degree spatial bins in Southern California, spanning from 1986 to 2024. Earthquake time series is forecasted as a function of logarithm energy released by quakes. Our comprehensive evaluation employs several key performance metrics, notably Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency and Mean Squared Error, over time in each spatial region. The results demonstrate that our introduced models outperform other custom architectures by effectively capturing temporal-spatial relationships inherent in seismic data. The performance of existing foundation models varies significantly based on the pre-training datasets, emphasizing the need for careful dataset selection. However, we introduce a new general approach termed MultiFoundationPattern that combines a bespoke pattern with foundation model results handled as auxiliary streams. In the earthquake case, the resultant MultiFoundationQuake model achieves the best overall performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 8 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[Uncertainty estimation of machine learning spatial precipitation predictions from satellite data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07511v3)** | 2024-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Merging satellite and gauge data with machine learning produces high-resolution precipitation datasets, but uncertainty estimates are often missing. We addressed the gap of how to optimally provide such estimates by benchmarking six algorithms, mostly novel even for the more general task of quantifying predictive uncertainty in spatial prediction settings. On 15 years of monthly data from over the contiguous United States (CONUS), we compared quantile regression (QR), quantile regression forests (QRF), generalized random forests (GRF), gradient boosting machines (GBM), light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM), and quantile regression neural networks (QRNN). Their ability to issue predictive precipitation quantiles at nine quantile levels (0.025, 0.050, 0.100, 0.250, 0.500, 0.750, 0.900, 0.950, 0.975), approximating the full probability distribution, was evaluated using quantile scoring functions and the quantile scoring rule. Predictors at a site were nearby values from two satellite precipitation retrievals, namely PERSIANN (Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks) and IMERG (Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals), and the site's elevation. The dependent variable was the monthly mean gauge precipitation. With respect to QR, LightGBM showed improved performance in terms of the quantile scoring rule by 11.10%, also surpassing QRF (7.96%), GRF (7.44%), GBM (4.64%) and QRNN (1.73%). Notably, LightGBM outperformed all random forest variants, the current standard in spatial prediction with machine learning. To conclude, we propose a suite of machine learning algorithms for estimating uncertainty in spatial data prediction, supported with a formal evaluation framework based on scoring functions and scoring rules.</p></details> |  |
| **[ST-USleepNet: A Spatial-Temporal Coupling Prominence Network for Multi-Channel Sleep Staging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11884v1)** | 2024-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sleep staging is critical for assessing sleep quality and diagnosing disorders. Recent advancements in artificial intelligence have driven the development of automated sleep staging models, which still face two significant challenges. 1) Simultaneously extracting prominent temporal and spatial sleep features from multi-channel raw signals, including characteristic sleep waveforms and salient spatial brain networks. 2) Capturing the spatial-temporal coupling patterns essential for accurate sleep staging. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework named ST-USleepNet, comprising a spatial-temporal graph construction module (ST) and a U-shaped sleep network (USleepNet). The ST module converts raw signals into a spatial-temporal graph to model spatial-temporal couplings. The USleepNet utilizes a U-shaped structure originally designed for image segmentation. Similar to how image segmentation isolates significant targets, when applied to both raw sleep signals and ST module-generated graph data, USleepNet segments these inputs to extract prominent temporal and spatial sleep features simultaneously.

| **[ContextualStory: Consistent Visual Storytelling with Spatially-Enhanced and Storyline Context](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09774v2)** | 2024-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual storytelling involves generating a sequence of coherent frames from a textual storyline while maintaining consistency in characters and scenes. Existing autoregressive methods, which rely on previous frame-sentence pairs, struggle with high memory usage, slow generation speeds, and limited context integration. To address these issues, we propose ContextualStory, a novel framework designed to generate coherent story frames and extend frames for story continuation. ContextualStory utilizes Spatially-Enhanced Temporal Attention to capture spatial and temporal dependencies, handling significant character movements effectively. Additionally, we introduces a Storyline Contextualizer to enrich context in storyline embedding and a StoryFlow Adapter to measure scene changes between frames for guiding model. Extensive experiments on PororoSV and FlintstonesSV benchmarks demonstrate that ContextualStory significantly outperforms existing methods in both story visualization and story continuation.</p></details> |  |
| **[AS-LIO: Spatial Overlap Guided Adaptive Sliding Window LiDAR-Inertial Odometry for Aggressive FOV Variation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11426v1)** | 2024-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LiDAR-Inertial Odometry (LIO) demonstrates outstanding accuracy and stability in general low-speed and smooth motion scenarios. However, in high-speed and intense motion scenarios, such as sharp turns, two primary challenges arise: firstly, due to the limitations of IMU frequency, the error in estimating significantly non-linear motion states escalates; secondly, drastic changes in the Field of View (FOV) may diminish the spatial overlap between LiDAR frame and pointcloud map (or between frames), leading to insufficient data association and constraint degradation. To address these issues, we propose a novel Adaptive Sliding window LIO framework (AS-LIO) guided by the Spatial Overlap Degree (SOD). Initially, we assess the SOD between the LiDAR frames and the registered map, directly evaluating the adverse impact of current FOV variation on pointcloud alignment. Subsequently, we design an adaptive sliding window to manage the continuous LiDAR stream and control state updates, dynamically adjusting the update step according to the SOD. This strategy enables our odometry to adaptively adopt higher update frequency to precisely characterize trajectory during aggressive FOV variation, thus effectively reducing the non-linear error in positioning. Meanwhile, the historical constraints within the sliding window reinforce the frame-to-map data association, ensuring the robustness of state estimation. Experiments show that our AS-LIO framework can quickly perceive and respond to challenging FOV change, outperforming other state-of-the-art LIO frameworks in terms of accuracy and robustness.</p></details> | 8 pages, 6 figures |

A large number of perfect and approximate sampling algorithms have been devised to sample from the hard-sphere model, and our perfect sampling algorithm is efficient for a range of parameters for which only efficient approximate samplers were previously known and is faster than these known approximate approaches. Our methods also extend to the more general setting of Gibbs point processes interacting via finite-range, repulsive potentials.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatial Voting with Incomplete Voter Information](http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.08929v2)** | 2024-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider spatial voting where candidates are located in the Euclidean $d$-dimensional space, and each voter ranks candidates based on their distance from the voter's ideal point. We explore the case where information about the location of voters' ideal points is incomplete: for each dimension, we are given an interval of possible values. We study the computational complexity of finding the possible and necessary winners for positional scoring rules. Our results show that we retain tractable cases of the classic model where voters have partial-order preferences. Moreover, we show that there are positional scoring rules under which the possible-winner problem is intractable for partial orders, but tractable in the one-dimensional spatial setting. We also consider approval voting in this setting. We show that for up to two dimensions, the necessary-winner problem is tractable, while the possible-winner problem is hard for any number of dimensions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Human-Aware 3D Scene Generation with Spatially-constrained Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18159v2)** | 2024-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating 3D scenes from human motion sequences supports numerous applications, including virtual reality and architectural design. However, previous auto-regression-based human-aware 3D scene generation methods have struggled to accurately capture the joint distribution of multiple objects and input humans, often resulting in overlapping object generation in the same space. To address this limitation, we explore the potential of diffusion models that simultaneously consider all input humans and the floor plan to generate plausible 3D scenes. Our approach not only satisfies all input human interactions but also adheres to spatial constraints with the floor plan. Furthermore, we introduce two spatial collision guidance mechanisms: human-object collision avoidance and object-room boundary constraints. These mechanisms help avoid generating scenes that conflict with human motions while respecting layout constraints. To enhance the diversity and accuracy of human-guided scene generation, we have developed an automated pipeline that improves the variety and plausibility of human-object interactions in the existing 3D FRONT HUMAN dataset. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our framework can generate more natural and plausible 3D scenes with precise human-scene interactions, while significantly reducing human-object collisions compared to previous state-of-the-art methods. Our code and data will be made publicly available upon publication of this work.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Efficient Sign Language Translation Using Spatial Configuration and Motion Dynamics with LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10593v1)** | 2024-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Gloss-free Sign Language Translation (SLT) converts sign videos directly into spoken language sentences without relying on glosses. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable translation performance in gloss-free methods by harnessing their powerful natural language generation capabilities. However, these methods often rely on domain-specific fine-tuning of visual encoders to achieve optimal results. By contrast, this paper emphasizes the importance of capturing the spatial configurations and motion dynamics inherent in sign language. With this in mind, we introduce Spatial and Motion-based Sign Language Translation (SpaMo), a novel LLM-based SLT framework. The core idea of SpaMo is simple yet effective. We first extract spatial and motion features using off-the-shelf visual encoders and then input these features into an LLM with a language prompt. Additionally, we employ a visual-text alignment process as a warm-up before the SLT supervision. Our experiments demonstrate that SpaMo achieves state-of-the-art performance on two popular datasets, PHOENIX14T and How2Sign.</p></details> | Under Review |

Many variable selection methods have been adapted for identifying single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) linked to phenotypic variation in genome-wide association studies. We develop a Bayesian variable selection regression model for identifying SNPs linked to phenotypic variation. We modify our Bayesian variable selection regression models to control the false discovery rate of SNPs using a knockoff variable approach. We reduce spurious associations by regressing the phenotype of interest against a set of basis functions that account for the relatedness of individuals. Using a restricted regression approach, we simultaneously estimate the SNP-level effects while removing variation in the phenotype that can be explained by population structure. We also accommodate the spatial structure among causal SNPs by modeling their inclusion probabilities jointly with a reduced rank Gaussian process. In a simulation study, we demonstrate that our spatial Bayesian variable selection regression model controls the false discovery rate and increases power when the relevant SNPs are clustered. We conclude with an analysis of Arabidopsis thaliana flowering time, a polygenic trait that is confounded with population structure, and find the discoveries of our method cluster near described flowering time genes.</p></details> | <details><summary>32 pa...</summary><p>32 pages and 6 figures</p></details> |

Specifically, the framework accommodates any customized conditional independence (CI) among any number of p variate fields at the first stage, alleviating dynamic memory burden. Meanwhile, it facilitates parallel generation of covariance and precision matrix, with the latter's generation order scaling only linearly in p. In the second stage, we demonstrate the multivariate Hammersley-Clifford theorem from a column-wise conditional perspective and unearth the existence of cross-MRF. The link of the mixed spatial graphical framework and the cross-MRF allows for a mixed conditional approach, resulting in the sparsest possible representation of the precision matrix via accommodating the doubly CI among both p and n, with the highest possible exact-zero-value percentage. We also explore the possibility of the co-existence of geostatistical and MRF modelling approaches in one unified framework, imparting a potential solution to an open problem. The derived theories are illustrated with 1D simulation and 2D real-world spatial data.</p></details> | 46 pages; 11 figures |
| **[Spatial-Frequency Dual Progressive Attention Network For Medical Image Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07952v2)** | 2024-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In medical images, various types of lesions often manifest significant differences in their shape and texture. Accurate medical image segmentation demands deep learning models with robust capabilities in multi-scale and boundary feature learning. However, previous networks still have limitations in addressing the above issues. Firstly, previous networks simultaneously fuse multi-level features or employ deep supervision to enhance multi-scale learning. However, this may lead to feature redundancy and excessive computational overhead, which is not conducive to network training and clinical deployment. Secondly, the majority of medical image segmentation networks exclusively learn features in the spatial domain, disregarding the abundant global information in the frequency domain. This results in a bias towards low-frequency components, neglecting crucial high-frequency information. To address these problems, we introduce SF-UNet, a spatial-frequency dual-domain attention network. It comprises two main components: the Multi-scale Progressive Channel Attention (MPCA) block, which progressively extract multi-scale features across adjacent encoder layers, and the lightweight Frequency-Spatial Attention (FSA) block, with only 0.05M parameters, enabling concurrent learning of texture and boundary features from both spatial and frequency domains. We validate the effectiveness of the proposed SF-UNet on three public datasets. Experimental results show that compared to previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) medical image segmentation networks, SF-UNet achieves the best performance, and achieves up to 9.4\% and 10.78\% improvement in DSC and IOU. Codes will be released at https://github.com/nkicsl/SF-UNet.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages accepted by 2024 IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine (BIBM 2024)</p></details> |

The simplest solution is to use one-shirt-size policy to alleviate it. Nevertheless, each region has its unique issues, which require a unique solution to solve them. In the aspect of spatial analysis, neighbor regions can provide useful information to analyze issues of a given region. In this work, we proposed inferred boundaries of regions of Thailand that can explain better the poverty dynamics, instead of the usual government administrative regions. The proposed regions maximize a trade-off between poverty-related features and geographical coherence. We use a spatial analysis together with Moran's cluster algorithms and Bayesian hierarchical regression models, with the potential of assist the implementation of the right policy to alleviate the poverty phenomenon. We found that all variables considered show a positive spatial autocorrelation. The results of analysis illustrate that 1) Northern, Northeastern Thailand, and in less extend Northcentral Thailand are the regions that require more attention in the aspect of poverty issues, 2) Northcentral, Northeastern, Northern and Southern Thailand present dramatically low levels of education, income and amount of savings contrasted with large cities such as Bangkok-Pattaya and Central Thailand, and 3) Bangkok-Pattaya is the only region whose average years of education is above 12 years, which corresponds (approx.) with a complete senior high school.</p></details> | <details><summary>Codes...</summary><p>Codes to reproduce our results are available in https://github.com/IrvingGomez/SpatialPovertyFactors</p></details> |

One such approach is the integration of sensing and communications (ISAC) paradigms to jointly access the spectrum. Recent ISAC studies have focused on upper millimeter-wave and low terahertz bands to exploit ultrawide bandwidths. At these frequencies, hybrid beamformers that employ fewer radio-frequency chains are employed to offset expensive hardware but at the cost of lower multiplexing gains. Wideband hybrid beamforming also suffers from the beam-split effect arising from the subcarrier-independent (SI) analog beamformers. To overcome these limitations, this paper introduces a spatial path index modulation (SPIM) ISAC architecture, which transmits additional information bits via modulating the spatial paths between the base station and communications users. We design the SPIM-ISAC beamformers by first estimating both radar and communications parameters by developing beam-split-aware algorithms. Then, we propose to employ a family of hybrid beamforming techniques such as hybrid, SI, and subcarrier-dependent analog-only, and beam-split-aware beamformers. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed SPIM-ISAC approach exhibits significantly improved spectral efficiency performance in the presence of beam-split than that of even fully digital non-SPIM beamformers.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted Paper in IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications</p></details> |

Humans, however, are inaccurate in localizing sound cues, especially with multiple sources due to limitations in human auditory perception such as angular discrimination error and front-back confusion. This decreases the efficiency of XR interfaces because users misidentify from which XR element a sound is coming. To address this, we propose Auptimize, a novel computational approach for placing XR sound sources, which mitigates such localization errors by utilizing the ventriloquist effect. Auptimize disentangles the sound source locations from the visual elements and relocates the sound sources to optimal positions for unambiguous identification of sound cues, avoiding errors due to inter-source proximity and front-back confusion. Our evaluation shows that Auptimize decreases spatial audio-based source identification errors compared to playing sound cues at the paired visual-sound locations. We demonstrate the applicability of Auptimize for diverse spatial audio-based interactive XR scenarios.</p></details> | UIST 2024 |

The vectors are composed of levels that split a formula into equal-sized regions of one or more types (e.g., rectangles or ellipses). For each region type, this produces a pyramid of overlapping regions, where the first level contains the entire formula, and the final level the finest-grained regions. In this work, we introduce concentric rectangles for regions, and analyze whether subsequent PHOC levels encode redundant information by omitting levels from PHOC configurations. As a baseline, we include a bag of words PHOC containing only the first whole-formula level. Finally, using the ARQMath-3 formula retrieval benchmark, we demonstrate that some levels encoded in the original PHOC configurations are redundant, that PHOC models with rectangular regions outperform earlier PHOC models, and that despite their simplicity, PHOC models are surprisingly competitive with the state-of-the-art. PHOC is not math-specific, and might be used for chemical diagrams, charts, or other graphics.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we delve into the emerging practice transitioning these events from physical venues to social VR as a new medium. Specifically, we ask: how does the spatial design in social VR affect the attendee's networking behaviors and experiences at these events? To answer this question, we conducted in-situ observations and in-depth interviews with 13 participants. Each of them had attended or hosted at least one real-world professional event taking place in social VR. We identified four elements of VR spatial design that shaped social interactions at these events: area size, which influenced a person's perceived likelihood of encountering others; pathways connecting areas, which guided their planning of the next activity to perform; magnets in areas, which facilitated spontaneous gatherings among people; and conventionality, which affected the assessment of a person's behavior appropriateness. Some of these elements were interpreted differently depending on the role of the participant, i.e., event hosts vs. attendees. We concluded this paper with multiple design implications derived from our findings.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods often treat road networks over time as spatial-temporal graphs, addressing spatial and temporal representations independently. However, these approaches struggle to capture the dynamic topology of road networks, encounter issues with message passing mechanisms and over-smoothing, and face challenges in learning spatial and temporal relationships separately. To address these limitations, we propose treating nodes in road networks at different time steps as independent spatial-temporal tokens and feeding them into a vanilla Transformer to learn complex spatial-temporal patterns, design STformer achieving SOTA. Given its quadratic complexity, we introduce a variant NSTformer based on Nystr$\ddot{o}$m method to approximate self-attention with linear complexity but even slightly better than former in a few cases astonishingly. Extensive experimental results on traffic datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance at an affordable computational cost.

These methods are the first of their kind in the field of multivariate areal spatial functional data analysis. The multivariate functional Moran's I statistic is employed to assess spatial autocorrelation, while mfasPCA is utilized for dimension reduction in both univariate and multivariate functional areal data. Through simulation studies and real-world examples, we demonstrate that the multivariate functional Moran's I statistic and mfasPCA are powerful tools for evaluating spatial autocorrelation in univariate and multivariate functional areal data analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bayesian Modeling of Incompatible Spatial Data: A Case Study Involving Post-Adrian Storm Forest Damage Assessment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11256v2)** | 2024-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modeling incompatible spatial data, i.e., data with different spatial resolutions, is a pervasive challenge in remote sensing data analysis. Typical approaches to addressing this challenge aggregate information to a common coarse resolution, i.e., compatible resolutions, prior to modeling. Such pre-processing aggregation simplifies analysis, but potentially causes information loss and hence compromised inference and predictive performance. To avoid losing potential information provided by finer spatial resolution data and improve predictive performance, we propose a new Bayesian method that constructs a latent spatial process model at the finest spatial resolution. This model is tailored to settings where the outcome variable is measured on a coarser spatial resolution than predictor variables -- a configuration seen increasingly when high spatial resolution remotely sensed predictors are used in analysis. A key contribution of this work is an efficient algorithm that enables full Bayesian inference using finer resolution data while optimizing computational and storage costs. The proposed method is applied to a forest damage assessment for the 2018 Adrian storm in Carinthia, Austria, that uses high-resolution laser imaging detection and ranging (LiDAR) measurements and relatively coarse resolution forest inventory measurements. Extensive simulation studies demonstrate the proposed approach substantially improves inference for small prediction units.</p></details> | 27 pages, 8 figures |

Considering a data deficiency and constrained computational resource scenario, this paper proposes a novel parameter-efficient transfer learning framework for vision recognition models in the black-box setting. Our framework incorporates two novel training techniques. First, we align the input space (i.e., image) of PTMs to the target data distribution by generating visual prompts of spatial and frequency domain. Along with the novel spatial-frequency hybrid visual prompter, we design a novel training technique based on probabilistic clusters, which can enhance class separation in the output space (i.e., prediction probabilities). In experiments, our model demonstrates superior performance in a few-shot transfer learning setting across extensive visual recognition datasets, surpassing state-of-the-art baselines. Additionally, we show that the proposed method efficiently reduces computational costs for training and inference phases.</p></details> | ACM Multimedia 2024 |

However, the limited FOV interrupts the generation of descriptions and impacts place recognition adversely. Therefore, we suffer from correcting accumulated drift errors in a consistent map using LiDAR-based place recognition with limited FOV. Thus, in this paper, we propose a robust LiDAR-based place recognition method for handling narrow FOV scenarios. The proposed method establishes spatial organization based on the range-elevation bin and azimuth-elevation bin to represent places. In addition, we achieve a robust place description through reweighting based on vertical direction information. Based on these representations, our method enables addressing rotational changes and determining the initial heading. Additionally, we designed a lightweight and fast approach for the robot's onboard autonomy. For rigorous validation, the proposed method was tested across various LiDAR place recognition scenarios (i.e., single-session, multi-session, and multi-robot scenarios). To the best of our knowledge, we report the first method to cope with the restricted FOV. Our place description and SLAM codes will be released.

In real traffic settings, achieving a BEV akin to that in a simulator necessitates the deployment of drones or specific sensor mounting, which is neither feasible nor practical. Consequently, traffic intersection management remains confined to simulation environments given these constraints. In this paper, we address the gap between simulated environments and real-world implementation by introducing a novel deep-learning model that converts a single camera's perspective of a road intersection into a BEV. We created a simulation environment that closely resembles a real-world traffic junction. The proposed model transforms the vehicles into BEV images, facilitating road intersection monitoring and control model processing. Inspired by image transformation techniques, we propose a Spatial-Transformer Double Decoder-UNet (SDD-UNet) model that aims to eliminate the transformed image distortions. In addition, the model accurately estimates the vehicle's positions and enables the direct application of simulation-trained models in real-world contexts. SDD-UNet model achieves an average dice similarity coefficient (DSC) above 95% which is 40% better than the original UNet model. The mean absolute error (MAE) is 0.102 and the centroid of the predicted mask is 0.14 meters displaced, on average, indicating high accuracy.</p></details> |  |

While supervised methods demonstrate proficiency, their reliance on extensive pixel-level annotations limits scalability. We introduce DynaSeg, an innovative unsupervised image segmentation approach that overcomes the challenge of balancing feature similarity and spatial continuity without relying on extensive hyperparameter tuning. Unlike traditional methods, DynaSeg employs a dynamic weighting scheme that automates parameter tuning, adapts flexibly to image characteristics, and facilitates easy integration with other segmentation networks. By incorporating a Silhouette Score Phase, DynaSeg prevents undersegmentation failures where the number of predicted clusters might converge to one. DynaSeg uses CNN-based and pre-trained ResNet feature extraction, making it computationally efficient and more straightforward than other complex models. Experimental results showcase state-of-the-art performance, achieving a 12.2% and 14.12% mIOU improvement over current unsupervised segmentation approaches on COCO-All and COCO-Stuff datasets, respectively.

Recent studies are primarily dedicated to designing Transformer-based architectures for spatial-spectral long-range dependencies modeling, which is computationally expensive with quadratic complexity. Selective structured state space model (Mamba), which is efficient for modeling long-range dependencies with linear complexity, has recently shown promising progress. However, its potential in hyperspectral image processing that requires handling numerous spectral bands has not yet been explored. In this paper, we innovatively propose S$^2$Mamba, a spatial-spectral state space model for hyperspectral image classification, to excavate spatial-spectral contextual features, resulting in more efficient and accurate land cover analysis. In S$^2$Mamba, two selective structured state space models through different dimensions are designed for feature extraction, one for spatial, and the other for spectral, along with a spatial-spectral mixture gate for optimal fusion. More specifically, S$^2$Mamba first captures spatial contextual relations by interacting each pixel with its adjacent through a Patch Cross Scanning module and then explores semantic information from continuous spectral bands through a Bi-directional Spectral Scanning module. Considering the distinct expertise of the two attributes in homogenous and complicated texture scenes, we realize the Spatial-spectral Mixture Gate by a group of learnable matrices, allowing for the adaptive incorporation of representations learned across different dimensions. Extensive experiments conducted on HSI classification benchmarks demonstrate the superiority and prospect of S$^2$Mamba.

In fact, most related approaches in the autonomous industry propose target-based calibration methods using corner reflectors that have proven to be unsuitable for the near field. In contrast, we propose a novel, joint calibration approach for optical RGB-D sensors and MIMO radars that is designed to operate in the radar's near-field range, within decimeters from the sensors. Our pipeline consists of a bespoke calibration target, allowing for automatic target detection and localization, followed by the spatial calibration of the two sensor coordinate systems through target registration. We validate our approach using two different depth sensing technologies from the optical domain.

| **[Spatial-Temporal Graph Enhanced DETR Towards Multi-Frame 3D Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.00347v4)** | 2024-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Detection Transformer (DETR) has revolutionized the design of CNN-based object detection systems, showcasing impressive performance. However, its potential in the domain of multi-frame 3D object detection remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we present STEMD, a novel end-to-end framework that enhances the DETR-like paradigm for multi-frame 3D object detection by addressing three key aspects specifically tailored for this task. First, to model the inter-object spatial interaction and complex temporal dependencies, we introduce the spatial-temporal graph attention network, which represents queries as nodes in a graph and enables effective modeling of object interactions within a social context. To solve the problem of missing hard cases in the proposed output of the encoder in the current frame, we incorporate the output of the previous frame to initialize the query input of the decoder. Finally, it poses a challenge for the network to distinguish between the positive query and other highly similar queries that are not the best match. And similar queries are insufficiently suppressed and turn into redundant prediction boxes. To address this issue, our proposed IoU regularization term encourages similar queries to be distinct during the refinement. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in handling challenging scenarios, while incurring only a minor additional computational overhead. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/Eaphan/STEMD.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 9 figures; Accepted by IEEE TPAMI</p></details> |

Rendering Spatial Information of Static and Moving Objects in VR via Haptic Feedback for Blind People](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06550v1)** | 2024-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Perceiving spatial information of a virtual object (e.g., direction, distance) is critical yet challenging for blind users seeking an immersive virtual reality experience. To facilitate VR accessibility for blind users, in this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of two types of haptic cues--vibrotactile and skin-stretch cues--in conveying the spatial information of a virtual object when applied to the dorsal side of a blind user's hand. We conducted a user study with 10 blind users to investigate how they perceive static and moving objects in VR with a custom-made haptic apparatus. Our results reveal that blind users can more accurately understand an object's location and movement when receiving skin-stretch cues, as opposed to vibrotactile cues. We discuss the pros and cons of both types of haptic cues and conclude with design recommendations for future haptic solutions for VR accessibility.</p></details> |  |
| **[Neural Dynamical Operator: Continuous Spatial-Temporal Model with Gradient-Based and Derivative-Free Optimization Methods](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11798v3)** | 2024-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data-driven modeling techniques have been explored in the spatial-temporal modeling of complex dynamical systems for many engineering applications. However, a systematic approach is still lacking to leverage the information from different types of data, e.g., with different spatial and temporal resolutions, and the combined use of short-term trajectories and long-term statistics. In this work, we build on the recent progress of neural operator and present a data-driven modeling framework called neural dynamical operator that is continuous in both space and time. A key feature of the neural dynamical operator is the resolution-invariance with respect to both spatial and temporal discretizations, without demanding abundant training data in different temporal resolutions. To improve the long-term performance of the calibrated model, we further propose a hybrid optimization scheme that leverages both gradient-based and derivative-free optimization methods and efficiently trains on both short-term time series and long-term statistics. We investigate the performance of the neural dynamical operator with three numerical examples, including the viscous Burgers' equation, the Navier-Stokes equations, and the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation. The results confirm the resolution-invariance of the proposed modeling framework and also demonstrate stable long-term simulations with only short-term time series data. In addition, we show that the proposed model can better predict long-term statistics via the hybrid optimization scheme with a combined use of short-term and long-term data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Powerful Spatial Multiple Testing via Borrowing Neighboring Information](http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.17121v2)** | 2024-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Clustered effects are often encountered in multiple hypothesis testing of spatial signals. In this paper, we propose a new method, termed \textit{two-dimensional spatial multiple testing} (2d-SMT) procedure, to control the false discovery rate (FDR) and improve the detection power by exploiting the spatial information encoded in neighboring observations. The proposed method provides a novel perspective of utilizing spatial information by gathering signal patterns and spatial dependence into an auxiliary statistic. 2d-SMT rejects the null when a primary statistic at the location of interest and the auxiliary statistic constructed based on nearby observations are greater than their corresponding cutoffs. 2d-SMT can also be combined with different variants of the weighted BH procedures to improve the detection power further. A fast algorithm is developed to accelerate the search for optimal cutoffs in 2d-SMT. In theory, we establish the asymptotic FDR control of 2d-SMT under weak spatial dependence. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate that the 2d-SMT method combined with various weighted BH procedures achieves the most competitive performance in FDR and power trade-off.</p></details> | 35 pages |

Despite the improvement brought by the strong visual backbone in extracting spatial features, CLIP still falls short in capturing and integrating spatial-temporal features which is essential for video recognition. In this paper, we propose OmniCLIP, a framework that adapts CLIP for video recognition by focusing on learning comprehensive features encompassing spatial, temporal, and dynamic spatial-temporal scales, which we refer to as omni-scale features. This is achieved through the design of spatial-temporal blocks that include parallel temporal adapters (PTA), enabling efficient temporal modeling. Additionally, we introduce a self-prompt generator (SPG) module to capture dynamic object spatial features. The synergy between PTA and SPG allows OmniCLIP to discern varying spatial information across frames and assess object scales over time. We have conducted extensive experiments in supervised video recognition, few-shot video recognition, and zero-shot recognition tasks. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, especially with OmniCLIP achieving a top-1 accuracy of 74.30\% on HMDB51 in a 16-shot setting, surpassing the recent MotionPrompt approach even with full training data.

However, it is non-interpretable. This can limit its usefulness in applied sciences, where understanding the relationships between predictors and response variable is crucial from a decision-making perspective. In the literature, several methods have been proposed to explain RF, but none of them addresses the challenge of explaining RF in the context of spatially dependent data. Therefore, this work aims to explain regression RF in the case of spatially dependent data by extracting a compact and simple list of rules. In this respect, we propose S-SIRUS, a spatial extension of SIRUS, the latter being a well-established regression rule algorithm able to extract a stable and short list of rules from the classical regression RF algorithm. A simulation study was conducted to evaluate the explainability capability of the proposed S-SIRUS, in comparison to SIRUS, by considering different levels of spatial dependence among the data. The results suggest that S-SIRUS exhibits a higher test predictive accuracy than SIRUS when spatial correlation is present. Moreover, for higher levels of spatial correlation, S-SIRUS produces a shorter list of rules, easing the explanation of the mechanism behind the predictions.</p></details> |  |

This is due to soft materials unique properties, including flexibility, safety, and shock absorption, among others. Despite many advancement in the field, the development of effective design methodologies and production techniques for soft robots remains a challenge. Although numerous robot prototypes have been proposed in recent years, their designs are often complex and difficult to produce. As such, there is a need for more efficient and unified design approaches that can facilitate the production of soft robots with desirable properties. In this paper, we propose a method for designing soft robots using elastic beams and spatial compliant mechanisms. The method is based on an evolutionary approach that enables the creation of designs with both high motion and force transmission ratios. Specifically, we focus on the development of locomotion mechanisms using a central linear actuator. Our approach involves the use of commonly available plastic materials and a 3D printer to manufacture the designs. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach by presenting experimental results that show successful production and real world operation. Overall, our findings suggest that the use of elastic beams and an evolutionary approach can facilitate the creation of soft robots with desirable locomotion properties, including fast locomotion up to 3.7 body lengths per second, locomotion with a payload, and underwater locomotion. This method has the potential to enable the development of more efficient and practical soft robots for various applications.</p></details> | 20 pages, 11 figures |
| **[Spatial Deconfounding is Reasonable Statistical Practice: Interpretations, Clarifications, and New Benefits](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05106v1)** | 2024-08-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The spatial linear mixed model (SLMM) consists of fixed and spatial random effects that can be confounded. Restricted spatial regression (RSR) models restrict the spatial random effects to be in the orthogonal column space of the covariates, which "deconfounds" the SLMM. Recent articles have shown that the RSR generally performs worse than the SLMM under a certain interpretation of the RSR. We show that every additive model can be reparameterized as a deconfounded model leading to what we call the linear reparameterization of additive models (LRAM). Under this reparameterization the coefficients of the covariates (referred to as deconfounded regression effects) are different from the (confounded) regression effects in the SLMM. It is shown that under the LRAM interpretation, existing deconfounded spatial models produce estimated deconfounded regression effects, spatial prediction, and spatial prediction variances equivalent to that of SLMM in Bayesian contexts. Furthermore, a general RSR (GRSR) and the SLMM produce identical inferences on confounded regression effects. While our results are in complete agreement with recent criticisms, our new results under the LRAM interpretation provide clarifications that lead to different and sometimes contrary conclusions. Additionally, we discuss the inferential and computational benefits to deconfounding, which we illustrate via a simulation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Masked adversarial neural network for cell type deconvolution in spatial transcriptomics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05065v1)** | 2024-08-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurately determining cell type composition in disease-relevant tissues is crucial for identifying disease targets. Most existing spatial transcriptomics (ST) technologies cannot achieve single-cell resolution, making it challenging to accurately determine cell types. To address this issue, various deconvolution methods have been developed. Most of these methods use single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data from the same tissue as a reference to infer cell types in ST data spots. However, they often overlook the differences between scRNA-seq and ST data. To overcome this limitation, we propose a Masked Adversarial Neural Network (MACD). MACD employs adversarial learning to align real ST data with simulated ST data generated from scRNA-seq data. By mapping them into a unified latent space, it can minimize the differences between the two types of data. Additionally, MACD uses masking techniques to effectively learn the features of real ST data and mitigate noise. We evaluated MACD on 32 simulated datasets and 2 real datasets, demonstrating its accuracy in performing cell type deconvolution. All code and public datasets used in this paper are available at https://github.com/wenwenmin/MACD and https://zenodo.org/records/12804822.</p></details> |  |

Spatial domain identification and gene denoising are key objectives in SRT data analysis. We propose a Contrastively Augmented Masked Graph Autoencoder (STMGAC) to learn low-dimensional latent representations for domain identification. In the latent space, persistent signals for representations are obtained through self-distillation to guide self-supervised matching. At the same time, positive and negative anchor pairs are constructed using triplet learning to augment the discriminative ability. We evaluated the performance of STMGAC on five datasets, achieving results superior to those of existing baseline methods. All code and public datasets used in this paper are available at https://github.com/wenwenmin/STMGAC and https://zenodo.org/records/13253801.</p></details> |  |

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformers have demonstrated impressive capability in capturing spectral-spatial contextual dependencies. However, these architectures suffer from limited receptive fields and quadratic computational complexity, respectively. Fortunately, recent Mamba architectures built upon the State Space Model integrate the advantages of long-range sequence modeling and linear computational efficiency, exhibiting substantial potential in low-dimensional scenarios. Motivated by this, we propose a novel 3D-Spectral-Spatial Mamba (3DSS-Mamba) framework for HSI classification, allowing for global spectral-spatial relationship modeling with greater computational efficiency. Technically, a spectral-spatial token generation (SSTG) module is designed to convert the HSI cube into a set of 3D spectral-spatial tokens. To overcome the limitations of traditional Mamba, which is confined to modeling causal sequences and inadaptable to high-dimensional scenarios, a 3D-Spectral-Spatial Selective Scanning (3DSS) mechanism is introduced, which performs pixel-wise selective scanning on 3D hyperspectral tokens along the spectral and spatial dimensions. Five scanning routes are constructed to investigate the impact of dimension prioritization. The 3DSS scanning mechanism combined with conventional mapping operations forms the 3D-spectral-spatial mamba block (3DMB), enabling the extraction of global spectral-spatial semantic representations. Experimental results and analysis demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on HSI classification benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Low-Depth Spatial Tree Algorithms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12953v3)** | 2024-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contemporary accelerator designs exhibit a high degree of spatial localization, wherein two-dimensional physical distance determines communication costs between processing elements. This situation presents considerable algorithmic challenges, particularly when managing sparse data, a pivotal component in progressing data science. The spatial computer model quantifies communication locality by weighting processor communication costs by distance, introducing a term named energy. Moreover, it integrates depth, a widely-utilized metric, to promote high parallelism. We propose and analyze a framework for efficient spatial tree algorithms within the spatial computer model. Our primary method constructs a spatial tree layout that optimizes the locality of the neighbors in the compute grid. This approach thereby enables locality-optimized messaging within the tree. Our layout achieves a polynomial factor improvement in energy compared to utilizing a PRAM approach. Using this layout, we develop energy-efficient treefix sum and lowest common ancestor algorithms, which are both fundamental building blocks for other graph algorithms. With high probability, our algorithms exhibit near-linear energy and poly-logarithmic depth. Our contributions augment a growing body of work demonstrating that computations can have both high spatial locality and low depth. Moreover, our work constitutes an advancement in the spatial layout of irregular and sparse computations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Using a negative spatial auto-correlation index to evaluate and improve intrinsic TagMap's multi-scale visualization capabilities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12610v1)** | 2024-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The popularity of tag clouds has sparked significant interest in the geographic research community, leading to the development of map-based adaptations known as intrinsic tag maps. However, existing methodologies for tag maps primarily focus on tag layout at specific scales, which may result in large empty areas or close proximity between tags when navigating across multiple scales. This issue arises because initial tag layouts may not ensure an even distribution of tags with varying sizes across the region. To address this problem, we incorporate the negative spatial auto-correlation index into tag maps to assess the uniformity of tag size distribution. Subsequently, we integrate this index into a TIN-based intrinsic tag map layout approach to enhance its ability to support multi-scale visualization. This enhancement involves iteratively filtering out candidate tags and selecting optimal tags that meet the defined index criteria. Experimental findings from two representative areas (the USA and Italy) demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in enhancing multi-scale visualization capabilities, albeit with trade-offs in compactness and time efficiency. Specifically, when retaining the same number of tags in the layout, our approach achieves higher compactness but requires more time. Conversely, when reducing the number of tags in the layout, our approach exhibits reduced time requirements but lower compactness. Furthermore, we discuss the effectiveness of various applied strategies aligned with existing approaches to generate diverse intrinsic tag maps tailored to user preferences. Additional details and resources can be found on our project website: https://github.com/TrentonWei/Multi-scale-TagMap.git.</p></details> | <details><summary>39 pa...</summary><p>39 pages,10 figures, an accepted version of Journal Cartography and Geographic Information Science</p></details> |

Especially when multiple remote users connect, a large shared space is necessary for people to maintain their personal space while collaborating, but the existing simple intersection method leads to the creation of narrow shared spaces as the number of remote spaces increases. To robustly align to the host space even as the number of remote spaces increases, we propose a spatial affordance-aware interactable subspace allocation algorithm. The key concept of our approach is to consider the perceivable and interactable areas separately, where every user views the same mutual space, but each remote user has a different interactable subspace, considering their location and spatial affordance. We conducted an evaluation with 900 space combinations, varying the number of remote spaces as two, four, and six, and results show our method outperformed in securing wide interactable mutual space and instantiating users compared to the other spatial matching methods. Our work enables multiple clients from diverse remote locations to access the AR host's space, allowing them to interact directly with the table, wall, or floor by aligning their physical subspaces within a connected mutual space.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 2024 IEEE ISMAR Conference. 10 pages, 6 figures</p></details> |

However, prevailing deep learning models struggle with poor generalization due to (i) intra-class variations, where the same class appears differently in different samples, and (ii) inter-class independence, resulting in difficulties capturing intricate relationships between distinct objects, leading to higher false negative cases. This paper presents a novel approach that synergies spatial and spectral representations to enhance domain-generalized medical image segmentation. We introduce the innovative Spectral Correlation Coefficient objective to improve the model's capacity to capture middle-order features and contextual long-range dependencies. This objective complements traditional spatial objectives by incorporating valuable spectral information. Extensive experiments reveal that optimizing this objective with existing architectures like UNet and TransUNet significantly enhances generalization, interpretability, and noise robustness, producing more confident predictions. For instance, in cardiac segmentation, we observe a 0.81 pp and 1.63 pp (pp = percentage point) improvement in DSC over UNet and TransUNet, respectively. Our interpretability study demonstrates that, in most tasks, objectives optimized with UNet outperform even TransUNet by introducing global contextual information alongside local details. These findings underscore the versatility and effectiveness of our proposed method across diverse imaging modalities and medical domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>Early...</summary><p>Early Accepted at ICPR-2024 for Oral Presentation</p></details> |

Unlike other time series forecasting problems, crime incidents are sparse, particularly in small regions and within specific time periods. Traditional spatial-temporal deep learning models often struggle with this sparsity, as they typically cannot effectively handle the non-Gaussian nature of crime data, which is characterized by numerous zeros and over-dispersed patterns. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel approach termed Spatial Temporal Multivariate Zero-Inflated Negative Binomial Graph Neural Networks (STMGNN-ZINB). This framework leverages diffusion and convolution networks to analyze spatial, temporal, and multivariate correlations, enabling the parameterization of probabilistic distributions of crime incidents. By incorporating a Zero-Inflated Negative Binomial model, STMGNN-ZINB effectively manages the sparse nature of crime data, enhancing prediction accuracy and the precision of confidence intervals. Our evaluation on real-world datasets confirms that STMGNN-ZINB outperforms existing models, providing a more reliable tool for predicting and understanding crime dynamics.</p></details> |  |

These learning-based methods often employ convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or Transformer-based architectures. However, these nonlinear approaches frequently overlook the frequency characteristics of images, which limits their compression efficiency. To address this issue, we propose a novel Transformer-based image compression method that enhances the transformation stage by considering frequency components within the feature map. Our method integrates a novel Hybrid Spatial-Channel Attention Transformer Block (HSCATB), where a spatial-based branch independently handles high and low frequencies at the attention layer, and a Channel-aware Self-Attention (CaSA) module captures information across channels, significantly improving compression performance. Additionally, we introduce a Mixed Local-Global Feed Forward Network (MLGFFN) within the Transformer block to enhance the extraction of diverse and rich information, which is crucial for effective compression. These innovations collectively improve the transformation's ability to project data into a more decorrelated latent space, thereby boosting overall compression efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework surpasses state-of-the-art LIC methods in rate-distortion performance.</p></details> |  |

Commonly, one global numerical sensitivity value is computed per simulation parameter. However, when considering 3D spatial simulations, the analysis of localized sensitivities in different spatial regions is of importance in many applications. For analyzing the spatial variation of parameter sensitivity, one needs to compute a spatial sensitivity scalar field per simulation parameter. Given $n$ simulation parameters, we obtain multi-field data consisting of $n$ scalar fields when considering all simulation parameters. We propose an interactive visual analytics solution to analyze the multi-field sensitivity data. It supports the investigation of how strongly and in what way individual parameters influence the simulation outcome, in which spatial regions this is happening, and what the interplay of the simulation parameters is. Its central component is an overview visualization of all sensitivity fields that avoids 3D occlusions by linearizing the data using an adapted scheme of data-driven space-filling curves. The spatial sensitivity values are visualized in a combination of a Horizon Graph and a line chart. We validate our approach by applying it to synthetic and real-world ensemble data.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages paper, 2 pages appendix, 14 figures paper, 1 figure appendix, accepted at IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics (TVCG)</p></details> |
| **[Semantic-guided modeling of spatial relation and object co-occurrence for indoor scene recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.12661v4)** | 2024-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Exploring the semantic context in scene images is essential for indoor scene recognition. However, due to the diverse intra-class spatial layouts and the coexisting inter-class objects, modeling contextual relationships to adapt various image characteristics is a great challenge. Existing contextual modeling methods for scene recognition exhibit two limitations: 1) They typically model only one type of spatial relationship (order or metric) among objects within scenes, with limited exploration of diverse spatial layouts. 2) They often overlook the differences in coexisting objects across different scenes, suppressing scene recognition performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose SpaCoNet, which simultaneously models Spatial relation and Co-occurrence of objects guided by semantic segmentation. Firstly, the Semantic Spatial Relation Module (SSRM) is constructed to model scene spatial features. With the help of semantic segmentation, this module decouples spatial information from the scene image and thoroughly explores all spatial relationships among objects in an end-to-end manner, thereby obtaining semantic-based spatial features. Secondly, both spatial features from the SSRM and deep features from the Image Feature Extraction Module are allocated to each object, so as to distinguish the coexisting object across different scenes. Finally, utilizing the discriminative features above, we design a Global-Local Dependency Module to explore the long-range co-occurrence among objects, and further generate a semantic-guided feature representation for indoor scene recognition. Experimental results on three widely used scene datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of the proposed method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under second review at Expert Systems with Applications</p></details> |

This emerging discipline has the potential to serve as a foundation for developing tools to design precision medicines. However, due to the higher costs and expertise required for such experiments, its translation into a regular clinical practice might be challenging. Despite the implementation of modern deep learning to enhance information obtained from histological images using AI, efforts have been constrained by limitations in the diversity of information. In this paper, we developed a model, HistoSPACE that explore the diversity of histological images available with ST data to extract molecular insights from tissue image. Our proposed study built an image encoder derived from universal image autoencoder. This image encoder was connected to convolution blocks to built the final model. It was further fine tuned with the help of ST-Data. This model is notably lightweight in compared to traditional histological models. Our developed model demonstrates significant efficiency compared to contemporary algorithms, revealing a correlation of 0.56 in leave-one-out cross-validation. Finally, its robustness was validated through an independent dataset, showing a well matched preditction with predefined disease pathology.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatial-Frequency Discriminability for Revealing Adversarial Perturbations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10856v3)** | 2024-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The vulnerability of deep neural networks to adversarial perturbations has been widely perceived in the computer vision community. From a security perspective, it poses a critical risk for modern vision systems, e.g., the popular Deep Learning as a Service (DLaaS) frameworks. For protecting deep models while not modifying them, current algorithms typically detect adversarial patterns through discriminative decomposition for natural and adversarial data. However, these decompositions are either biased towards frequency resolution or spatial resolution, thus failing to capture adversarial patterns comprehensively. Also, when the detector relies on few fixed features, it is practical for an adversary to fool the model while evading the detector (i.e., defense-aware attack). Motivated by such facts, we propose a discriminative detector relying on a spatial-frequency Krawtchouk decomposition. It expands the above works from two aspects: 1) the introduced Krawtchouk basis provides better spatial-frequency discriminability, capturing the differences between natural and adversarial data comprehensively in both spatial and frequency distributions, w.r.t. the common trigonometric or wavelet basis; 2) the extensive features formed by the Krawtchouk decomposition allows for adaptive feature selection and secrecy mechanism, significantly increasing the difficulty of the defense-aware attack, w.r.t. the detector with few fixed features. Theoretical and numerical analyses demonstrate the uniqueness and usefulness of our detector, exhibiting competitive scores on several deep models and image sets against a variety of adversarial attacks.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods are limited by their ability to handle large, complex datasets. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a hybrid approach that combines the strengths of open-source large and small-scale language models (LLMs and LMs) with traditional forecasting methods. We augment traditional methods with dynamic prompting and a grouped-query, multi-head attention mechanism to more effectively capture both intra-series and inter-series dependencies in evolving nonlinear time series data. In addition, we facilitate on-premises customization by fine-tuning smaller open-source LMs for time series trend analysis utilizing descriptions generated by open-source large LMs on consumer-grade hardware using Low-Rank Adaptation with Activation Memory Reduction (LoRA-AMR) technique to reduce computational overhead and activation storage memory demands while preserving inference latency.

| **[Navigating Spatio-Temporal Heterogeneity: A Graph Transformer Approach for Traffic Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10822v2)** | 2024-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic forecasting has emerged as a crucial research area in the development of smart cities. Although various neural networks with intricate architectures have been developed to address this problem, they still face two key challenges: i) Recent advancements in network designs for modeling spatio-temporal correlations are starting to see diminishing returns in performance enhancements. ii) Additionally, most models do not account for the spatio-temporal heterogeneity inherent in traffic data, i.e., traffic distribution varies significantly across different regions and traffic flow patterns fluctuate across various time slots. To tackle these challenges, we introduce the Spatio-Temporal Graph Transformer (STGormer), which effectively integrates attribute and structure information inherent in traffic data for learning spatio-temporal correlations, and a mixture-of-experts module for capturing heterogeneity along spaital and temporal axes. Specifically, we design two straightforward yet effective spatial encoding methods based on the graph structure and integrate time position encoding into the vanilla transformer to capture spatio-temporal traffic patterns. Additionally, a mixture-of-experts enhanced feedforward neural network (FNN) module adaptively assigns suitable expert layers to distinct patterns via a spatio-temporal gating network, further improving overall prediction accuracy. Experiments on real-world traffic datasets demonstrate that STGormer achieves state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  |

However, current methods struggle with large, complex datasets. We propose a dynamic, multi-modal approach that integrates the strengths of traditional forecasting methods and instruction tuning of small language models for time series trend analysis. This approach utilizes a mixture of experts (MoE) architecture with parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods, tailored for consumer hardware to scale up AI solutions in low resource settings while balancing performance and latency tradeoffs. Additionally, our approach leverages related past experiences for similar input time series to efficiently handle both intra-series and inter-series dependencies of non-stationary data with a time-then-space modeling approach, using grouped-query attention, while mitigating the limitations of traditional forecasting techniques in handling distributional shifts. Our approach models predictive uncertainty to improve decision-making. Our framework enables on-premises customization with reduced computational and memory demands, while maintaining inference speed and data privacy/security.

| **[Causally-Aware Spatio-Temporal Multi-Graph Convolution Network for Accurate and Reliable Traffic Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13293v1)** | 2024-08-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate and reliable prediction has profound implications to a wide range of applications. In this study, we focus on an instance of spatio-temporal learning problem--traffic prediction--to demonstrate an advanced deep learning model developed for making accurate and reliable forecast. Despite the significant progress in traffic prediction, limited studies have incorporated both explicit and implicit traffic patterns simultaneously to improve prediction performance. Meanwhile, the variability nature of traffic states necessitates quantifying the uncertainty of model predictions in a statistically principled way; however, extant studies offer no provable guarantee on the statistical validity of confidence intervals in reflecting its actual likelihood of containing the ground truth. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end traffic prediction framework that leverages three primary components to generate accurate and reliable traffic predictions: dynamic causal structure learning for discovering implicit traffic patterns from massive traffic data, causally-aware spatio-temporal multi-graph convolution network (CASTMGCN) for learning spatio-temporal dependencies, and conformal prediction for uncertainty quantification. CASTMGCN fuses several graphs that characterize different important aspects of traffic networks and an auxiliary graph that captures the effect of exogenous factors on the road network. On this basis, a conformal prediction approach tailored to spatio-temporal data is further developed for quantifying the uncertainty in node-wise traffic predictions over varying prediction horizons. Experimental results on two real-world traffic datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms several state-of-the-art models in prediction accuracy; moreover, it generates more efficient prediction regions than other methods while strictly satisfying the statistical validity in coverage.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatio-Temporal Road Traffic Prediction using Real-time Regional Knowledge](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12882v1)** | 2024-08-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For traffic prediction in transportation services such as car-sharing and ride-hailing, mid-term road traffic prediction (within a few hours) is considered essential. However, the existing road-level traffic prediction has mainly studied how significantly micro traffic events propagate to the adjacent roads in terms of short-term prediction. On the other hand, recent attempts have been made to incorporate regional knowledge such as POIs, road characteristics, and real-time social events to help traffic prediction. However, these studies lack in understandings of different modalities of road-level and region-level spatio-temporal correlations and how to combine such knowledge. This paper proposes a novel method that embeds real-time region-level knowledge using POIs, satellite images, and real-time LTE access traces via a regional spatio-temporal module that consists of dynamic convolution and temporal attention, and conducts bipartite spatial transform attention to convert into road-level knowledge. Then the model ingests this embedded knowledge into a road-level attention-based prediction model. Experimental results on real-world road traffic prediction show that our model outperforms the baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Geolocation Representation from Large Language Models are Generic Enhancers for Spatio-Temporal Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12116v1)** | 2024-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the geospatial domain, universal representation models are significantly less prevalent than their extensive use in natural language processing and computer vision. This discrepancy arises primarily from the high costs associated with the input of existing representation models, which often require street views and mobility data. To address this, we develop a novel, training-free method that leverages large language models (LLMs) and auxiliary map data from OpenStreetMap to derive geolocation representations (LLMGeovec). LLMGeovec can represent the geographic semantics of city, country, and global scales, which acts as a generic enhancer for spatio-temporal learning. Specifically, by direct feature concatenation, we introduce a simple yet effective paradigm for enhancing multiple spatio-temporal tasks including geographic prediction (GP), long-term time series forecasting (LTSF), and graph-based spatio-temporal forecasting (GSTF). LLMGeovec can seamlessly integrate into a wide spectrum of spatio-temporal learning models, providing immediate enhancements. Experimental results demonstrate that LLMGeovec achieves global coverage and significantly boosts the performance of leading GP, LTSF, and GSTF models.</p></details> |  |
| **[SOAP: Enhancing Spatio-Temporal Relation and Motion Information Capturing for Few-Shot Action Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16344v3)** | 2024-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High frame-rate (HFR) videos of action recognition improve fine-grained expression while reducing the spatio-temporal relation and motion information density. Thus, large amounts of video samples are continuously required for traditional data-driven training. However, samples are not always sufficient in real-world scenarios, promoting few-shot action recognition (FSAR) research. We observe that most recent FSAR works build spatio-temporal relation of video samples via temporal alignment after spatial feature extraction, cutting apart spatial and temporal features within samples. They also capture motion information via narrow perspectives between adjacent frames without considering density, leading to insufficient motion information capturing. Therefore, we propose a novel plug-and-play architecture for FSAR called Spatio-tempOral frAme tuPle enhancer (SOAP) in this paper. The model we designed with such architecture refers to SOAP-Net. Temporal connections between different feature channels and spatio-temporal relation of features are considered instead of simple feature extraction. Comprehensive motion information is also captured, using frame tuples with multiple frames containing more motion information than adjacent frames. Combining frame tuples of diverse frame counts further provides a broader perspective. SOAP-Net achieves new state-of-the-art performance across well-known benchmarks such as SthSthV2, Kinetics, UCF101, and HMDB51. Extensive empirical evaluations underscore the competitiveness, pluggability, generalization, and robustness of SOAP.

The color, shape, and location of moire patterns may differ across video frames, posing a challenge in learning information from adjacent frames and preserving temporal consistency. Previous video demoireing methods heavily rely on well-designed alignment modules, resulting in substantial computational burdens. Recently, Mamba, an improved version of the State Space Model (SSM), has demonstrated significant potential for modeling long-range dependencies with linear complexity, enabling efficient temporal modeling in video demoireing without requiring a specific alignment module. In this paper, we propose a novel alignment-free Raw video demoireing network with frequency-assisted spatio-temporal Mamba (DemMamba). The Spatial Mamba Block (SMB) and Temporal Mamba Block (TMB) are sequentially arranged to facilitate effective intra- and inter-relationship modeling in Raw videos with moire patterns. Within SMB, an Adaptive Frequency Block (AFB) is introduced to aid demoireing in the frequency domain. For TMB, a Channel Attention Block (CAB) is embedded to further enhance temporal information interactions by exploiting the inter-channel relationships among features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed DemMamba surpasses state-of-the-art approaches by 1.3 dB and delivers a superior visual experience.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Spatio-temporal Prediction Methodology Based on Deep Learning and Real Wi-Fi Measurements](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09423v1)** | 2024-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid development of Wi-Fi technologies in recent years has caused a significant increase in the traffic usage. Hence, knowledge obtained from Wi-Fi network measurements can be helpful for a more efficient network management. In this paper, we propose a methodology to predict future values of some specific network metrics (e.g. traffic load, transmission failures, etc.). These predictions may be useful for improving the network performance. After data collection and preprocessing, the correlation between each target access point (AP) and its neighbouring APs is estimated. According to these correlations, either an only-temporal or a spatio-temporal based prediction is done. To evaluate the proposed methodology, real measurements are collected from 100 APs deployed in different university buildings for 3 months. Deep Learning (DL) methods (i.e. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Simple Recurrent Neural Network (SRNN), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Transformer) are evaluated and compared for both temporal and spatio-temporal based predictions. Moreover, a hybrid prediction methodology is proposed using a spatial processing based on CNN and a temporal prediction based on RNN. The proposed hybrid methodology provides an improvement in the prediction accuracy at expenses of a slight increase in the Training Computational Time (TCT) and negligible in Prediction Computational Time (PCT).</p></details> | 18 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Temporal Reversed Training for Spiking Neural Networks with Generalized Spatio-Temporal Representation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09108v1)** | 2024-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have received widespread attention as an ultra-low energy computing paradigm. Recent studies have focused on improving the feature extraction capability of SNNs, but they suffer from inefficient inference and suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective temporal reversed training (TRT) method to optimize the spatio-temporal performance of SNNs and circumvent these problems. We perturb the input temporal data by temporal reversal, prompting the SNN to produce original-reversed consistent output logits and to learn perturbation-invariant representations. For static data without temporal dimension, we generalize this strategy by exploiting the inherent temporal property of spiking neurons for spike feature temporal reversal. In addition, we utilize the lightweight ``star operation" (element-wise multiplication) to hybridize the original and temporally reversed spike firing rates and expand the implicit dimensions, which serves as spatio-temporal regularization to further enhance the generalization of the SNN. Our method involves only an additional temporal reversal operation and element-wise multiplication during training, thus incurring negligible training overhead and not affecting the inference efficiency at all. Extensive experiments on static/neuromorphic object/action recognition, and 3D point cloud classification tasks demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our method. In particular, with only two timesteps, our method achieves 74.77\% and 90.57\% accuracy on ImageNet and ModelNet40, respectively.</p></details> | 15 pages, 8 figures |

However, existing models often face limitations in generalization, struggling with zero-shot prediction on unseen regions and cities, as well as diminished long-term accuracy. This is primarily due to the inherent challenges in handling the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of traffic data, coupled with the significant distribution shift across time and space. In this work, we aim to unlock new possibilities for building versatile, resilient and adaptive spatio-temporal foundation models for traffic prediction. To achieve this goal, we introduce a novel foundation model, named OpenCity, that can effectively capture and normalize the underlying spatio-temporal patterns from diverse data characteristics, facilitating zero-shot generalization across diverse urban environments. OpenCity integrates the Transformer architecture with graph neural networks to model the complex spatio-temporal dependencies in traffic data. By pre-training OpenCity on large-scale, heterogeneous traffic datasets, we enable the model to learn rich, generalizable representations that can be seamlessly applied to a wide range of traffic forecasting scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that OpenCity exhibits exceptional zero-shot predictive performance. Moreover, OpenCity showcases promising scaling laws, suggesting the potential for developing a truly one-for-all traffic prediction solution that can adapt to new urban contexts with minimal overhead. We made our proposed OpenCity model open-source and it is available at the following link: https://github.com/HKUDS/OpenCity.</p></details> | 12 pages |

The safety risk and urgency of autonomous vehicles in the absence of collision are evaluated. To ensure safety and improve road efficiency, a method of pre-compiling the spatio-temporal trajectory of vehicles is established to eliminate conflicts between vehicles in advance. The calculation method of the safe distance under spatio-temporal conditions is studied, considering vehicle speed differences, vehicle positioning errors, and clock errors. By combining collision acceleration and urgent acceleration, an evaluation model for vehicle conflict risk is constructed. Mainline vehicles that may have conflicts with on-ramp vehicles are identified, and the target gap for on-ramp vehicles is determined. Finally, a cooperative control method is established based on the selected target gap, preparing the vehicle travel path in advance. Taking highway ramp merge as an example, the mainline priority spatio-temporal cooperative control method is proposed and verified through simulation.

| **[System States Forecasting of Microservices with Dynamic Spatio-Temporal Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07894v1)** | 2024-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the AIOps (Artificial Intelligence for IT Operations) era, accurately forecasting system states is crucial. In microservices systems, this task encounters the challenge of dynamic and complex spatio-temporal relationships among microservice instances, primarily due to dynamic deployments, diverse call paths, and cascading effects among instances. Current time-series forecasting methods, which focus mainly on intrinsic patterns, are insufficient in environments where spatial relationships are critical. Similarly, spatio-temporal graph approaches often neglect the nature of temporal trend, concentrating mostly on message passing between nodes. Moreover, current research in microservices domain frequently underestimates the importance of network metrics and topological structures in capturing the evolving dynamics of systems. This paper introduces STMformer, a model tailored for forecasting system states in microservices environments, capable of handling multi-node and multivariate time series. Our method leverages dynamic network connection data and topological information to assist in modeling the intricate spatio-temporal relationships within the system. Additionally, we integrate the PatchCrossAttention module to compute the impact of cascading effects globally. We have developed a dataset based on a microservices system and conducted comprehensive experiments with STMformer against leading methods. In both short-term and long-term forecasting tasks, our model consistently achieved a 8.6% reduction in MAE(Mean Absolute Error) and a 2.2% reduction in MSE (Mean Squared Error).

Nonetheless, these methods mainly adopt imagepair appearance matching and face challenges of the intrinsic high quadratic complexity of the attention mechanism, resulting in constrained exploitation of temporal information. Inspired by the recently emerged State Space Model Mamba, renowned for its impressive long sequence modeling capabilities and linear computational complexity, this work innovatively proposes a pure Mamba-based framework (MambaVT) to fully exploit spatio-temporal contextual modeling for robust visible-thermal tracking. Specifically, we devise the long-range cross-frame integration component to globally adapt to target appearance variations, and introduce short-term historical trajectory prompts to predict the subsequent target states based on local temporal location clues. Extensive experiments show the significant potential of vision Mamba for RGB-T tracking, with MambaVT achieving state-of-the-art performance on four mainstream benchmarks while requiring lower computational costs. We aim for this work to serve as a simple yet strong baseline, stimulating future research in this field. The code and pre-trained models will be made available.</p></details> |  |
| **[Advancing Spatio-Temporal Processing in Spiking Neural Networks through Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07517v1)** | 2024-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficient implementations of spiking neural networks on neuromorphic hardware promise orders of magnitude less power consumption than their non-spiking counterparts. The standard neuron model for spike-based computation on such neuromorphic systems has long been the leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neuron. As a promising advancement, a computationally light augmentation of the LIF neuron model with an adaptation mechanism experienced a recent upswing in popularity, caused by demonstrations of its superior performance on spatio-temporal processing tasks. The root of the superiority of these so-called adaptive LIF neurons however, is not well understood. In this article, we thoroughly analyze the dynamical, computational, and learning properties of adaptive LIF neurons and networks thereof. We find that the frequently observed stability problems during training of such networks can be overcome by applying an alternative discretization method that results in provably better stability properties than the commonly used Euler-Forward method. With this discretization, we achieved a new state-of-the-art performance on common event-based benchmark datasets. We also show that the superiority of networks of adaptive LIF neurons extends to the prediction and generation of complex time series. Our further analysis of the computational properties of networks of adaptive LIF neurons shows that they are particularly well suited to exploit the spatio-temporal structure of input sequences. Furthermore, these networks are surprisingly robust to shifts of the mean input strength and input spike rate, even when these shifts were not observed during training. As a consequence, high-performance networks can be obtained without any normalization techniques such as batch normalization or batch-normalization through time.</p></details> |  |

Especially the asymptotic properties of estimation for network autoregression are obtained under reasonable regularity conditions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Weakly Supervised Video Anomaly Detection and Localization with Spatio-Temporal Prompts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05905v2)** | 2024-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current weakly supervised video anomaly detection (WSVAD) task aims to achieve frame-level anomalous event detection with only coarse video-level annotations available. Existing works typically involve extracting global features from full-resolution video frames and training frame-level classifiers to detect anomalies in the temporal dimension. However, most anomalous events tend to occur in localized spatial regions rather than the entire video frames, which implies existing frame-level feature based works may be misled by the dominant background information and lack the interpretation of the detected anomalies. To address this dilemma, this paper introduces a novel method called STPrompt that learns spatio-temporal prompt embeddings for weakly supervised video anomaly detection and localization (WSVADL) based on pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs). Our proposed method employs a two-stream network structure, with one stream focusing on the temporal dimension and the other primarily on the spatial dimension. By leveraging the learned knowledge from pre-trained VLMs and incorporating natural motion priors from raw videos, our model learns prompt embeddings that are aligned with spatio-temporal regions of videos (e.g., patches of individual frames) for identify specific local regions of anomalies, enabling accurate video anomaly detection while mitigating the influence of background information. Without relying on detailed spatio-temporal annotations or auxiliary object detection/tracking, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on three public benchmarks for the WSVADL task.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACMMM2024</p></details> |

Considering the spatio-temporal nature of EEG data, one of our frameworks is based on a CNN-BiLSTM model. The other involves a CNN-Transformer architecture which inherently involves the more versatile attention based learning paradigm. In both cases, a special 1D-CNN feature extraction module is used to generate the initial embeddings with 1D convolutions in the time and the EEG channel domains. Considering the EEG signals are noisy, non stationary and the discriminative features are even less clear (than in semantically structured data such as text or image), we also follow a window-based classification followed by majority voting during inference, to yield labels at a signal level. To illustrate how brain patterns correlate with different image classes, we visualize t-SNE plots of the BiLSTM embeddings alongside brain activation maps for the top 10 classes. These visualizations provide insightful revelations into the distinct neural signatures associated with each visual category, showcasing the BiLSTM's capability to capture and represent the discriminative brain activity linked to visual stimuli.

However, existing transformer-based methods primarily use self-attention mechanisms for spatio-temporal modeling, leading to a quadratic complexity, unidirectional modeling of spatio-temporal relationships, and insufficient learning of spatial-temporal correlations. Recently, the Mamba architecture, utilizing the state space model (SSM), has exhibited superior long-range modeling capabilities in a variety of vision tasks with linear complexity. In this paper, we propose PoseMamba, a novel purely SSM-based approach with linear complexity for 3D human pose estimation in monocular video. Specifically, we propose a bidirectional global-local spatio-temporal SSM block that comprehensively models human joint relations within individual frames as well as temporal correlations across frames. Within this bidirectional global-local spatio-temporal SSM block, we introduce a reordering strategy to enhance the local modeling capability of the SSM. This strategy provides a more logical geometric scanning order and integrates it with the global SSM, resulting in a combined global-local spatial scan. We have quantitatively and qualitatively evaluated our approach using two benchmark datasets: Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PoseMamba achieves state-of-the-art performance on both datasets while maintaining a smaller model size and reducing computational costs. The code and models will be released.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatio-Temporal Adaptive Diffusion Models for EEG Super-Resolution in Epilepsy Diagnosis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03089v3)** | 2024-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Electroencephalogram (EEG) technology, particularly high-density EEG (HD EEG) devices, is widely used in fields such as neuroscience. HD EEG devices improve the spatial resolution of EEG by placing more electrodes on the scalp, meeting the requirements of clinical diagnostic applications such as epilepsy focus localization. However, this technique faces challenges such as high acquisition costs and limited usage scenarios. In this paper, spatio-temporal adaptive diffusion models (STADMs) are proposed to pioneer the use of diffusion models for achieving spatial SR reconstruction from low-resolution (LR, 64 channels or fewer) EEG to high-resolution (HR, 256 channels) EEG. Specifically, a spatio-temporal condition module is designed to extract the spatio-temporal features of LR EEG, which then serve as conditional inputs to guide the reverse denoising process of diffusion models. Additionally, a multi-scale Transformer denoising module is constructed to leverage multi-scale convolution blocks and cross-attention-based diffusion Transformer blocks for conditional guidance to generate subject-adaptive SR EEG. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively enhances the spatial resolution of LR EEG and quantitatively outperforms existing methods. Furthermore, STADMs demonstrate their value by applying synthetic SR EEG to classification and source localization tasks of epilepsy patients, indicating their potential to significantly improve the spatial resolution of LR EEG.</p></details> |  |

Yet, these models fall short of quantifying future uncertainties. Recently, many probabilistic methods, especially variants of diffusion models, have been proposed to fill this gap. However, existing diffusion methods typically deal with individual sensors separately when generating future time series, resulting in limited usage of spatial information in the probabilistic learning process. In this work, we propose SpecSTG, a novel spectral diffusion framework, to better leverage spatial dependencies and systematic patterns inherent in traffic data. More specifically, our method generates the Fourier representation of future time series, transforming the learning process into the spectral domain enriched with spatial information. Additionally, our approach incorporates a fast spectral graph convolution designed for Fourier input, alleviating the computational burden associated with existing models. Compared with state-of-the-arts, SpecSTG achieves up to 8% improvements on point estimations and up to 0.78% improvements on quantifying future uncertainties. Furthermore, SpecSTG's training and validation speed is 3.33X of the most efficient existing diffusion method for STG forecasting.

However, acquiring high-resolution MRI typically extends scan time, which can introduce motion artifacts. Super-resolution of MRI therefore emerges as a promising approach to mitigate these challenges. Earlier studies have investigated the use of multiple contrasts for MRI super-resolution (MCSR), whereas majority of them did not fully exploit the rich contrast-invariant structural information. To fully utilize such crucial prior knowledge of multi-contrast MRI, in this work, we propose a novel structure-guided MCSR (SGSR) framework based on a new spatio-frequency co-query attention (CQA) mechanism. Specifically, CQA performs attention on features of multiple contrasts with a shared structural query, which is particularly designed to extract, fuse, and refine the common structures from different contrasts. We further propose a novel frequency-domain CQA module in addition to the spatial domain, to enable more fine-grained structural refinement. Extensive experiments on fastMRI knee data and low-field brain MRI show that SGSR outperforms state-of-the-art MCSR methods with statistical significance.</p></details> | <details><summary>The 1...</summary><p>The 15th International Workshop on Machine Learning in Medical Imaging (MLMI 2024)</p></details> |

The central aim of multi-agent optimization is for a network of agents to collaboratively solve a system-level optimization problem with local objective functions and node-to-node communication by distributed algorithms. The scalability of such algorithms crucially depends on the complexity of the communication messages, and a number of communication compressors for distributed optimization have recently been proposed in the literature. First of all, we introduce a general spatio-temporal compressor characterized by the stability of the resulting dynamical system along the vector field of the compressor. We show that several important distributed optimization compressors such as the greedy sparsifier, the uniform quantizer, and the scalarizer all fall into the category of this spatio-temporal compressor. Next, we propose two distributed prime-dual flows with the spatio-temporal compressors being applied to local node states and local error states, respectively, and prove (exponential) convergence of the node trajectories to the global optimizer for (strongly) convex cost functions. Finally, a few numerical examples are present to illustrate our theoretical results.</p></details> |  |

Most existing studies show satisfying performance under regular scenarios, but most neglected safety-critical scenarios. In this study, a spatio-temporal dual-encoder network named STDA for safety-critical scenarios was developed. Considering the exceptional capabilities of human drivers in terms of situational awareness and comprehending risks, driver attention was incorporated into STDA to facilitate swift identification of the critical regions, which is expected to improve both performance and interpretability. STDA contains four parts: the driver attention prediction module, which predicts driver attention; the fusion module designed to fuse the features between driver attention and raw images; the temporary encoder module used to enhance the capability to interpret dynamic scenes; and the behavior prediction module to predict the behavior. The experiment data are used to train and validate the model. The results show that STDA improves the G-mean from 0.659 to 0.719 when incorporating driver attention and adopting a temporal encoder module. In addition, extensive experimentation has been conducted to validate that the proposed module exhibits robust generalization capabilities and can be seamlessly integrated into other mainstream models.</p></details> |  |

This study, part of the European LAMASUS (Land Management for Sustainability) project, aims to support the EU's climate neutrality target by developing a governance model through collaboration between policymakers, land users, and researchers. We present a methodological synthesis for treating land use data using a Bayesian approach within spatial and spatio-temporal modeling frameworks. The study tackles the challenges of analyzing land use changes, particularly the presence of zero values and computational issues with large datasets. It introduces joint model structures to address zeros and employs sequential inference and consensus methods for Big Data problems. Spatial downscaling models approximate smaller scales from aggregated data, circumventing high-resolution data complications. We explore Beta regression and Compositional Data Analysis (CoDa) for land use data, review relevant spatial and spatio-temporal models, and present strategies for handling zeros. The paper demonstrates the implementation of key models, downscaling techniques, and solutions to Big Data challenges with examples from simulated data and the LAMASUS project, providing a comprehensive framework for understanding and managing land use changes.</p></details> | 29 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Spatio-Temporal Partial Sensing Forecast for Long-term Traffic](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02689v1)** | 2024-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic forecasting uses recent measurements by sensors installed at chosen locations to forecast the future road traffic. Existing work either assumes all locations are equipped with sensors or focuses on short-term forecast. This paper studies partial sensing traffic forecast of long-term traffic, assuming sensors only at some locations. The study is important in lowering the infrastructure investment cost in traffic management since deploying sensors at all locations could incur prohibitively high cost. However, the problem is challenging due to the unknown distribution at unsensed locations, the intricate spatio-temporal correlation in long-term forecasting, as well as noise in data and irregularities in traffic patterns (e.g., road closure). We propose a Spatio-Temporal Partial Sensing (STPS) forecast model for long-term traffic prediction, with several novel contributions, including a rank-based embedding technique to capture irregularities and overcome noise, a spatial transfer matrix to overcome the spatial distribution shift from permanently sensed locations to unsensed locations, and a multi-step training process that utilizes all available data to successively refine the model parameters for better accuracy. Extensive experiments on several real-world traffic datasets demonstrate that STPS outperforms the state-of-the-art and achieves superior accuracy in partial sensing long-term forecasting.</p></details> |  |

However, their predictive distribution is not generally known. Under this modeling assumption, we define a novel spatio-temporal embedding and a theory-guided machine learning approach that employs a generalized Bayesian algorithm to make ensemble forecasts. We use Lipschitz predictors and determine fixed-time and any-time PAC Bayesian bounds in the batch learning setting. Performing causal forecast is a highlight of our methodology as its potential application to data with spatial and temporal short and long-range dependence. We then test the performance of our learning methodology by using linear predictors and data sets simulated from a spatio-temporal Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process.</p></details> |  |
| **[SARN: Structurally-Aware Recurrent Network for Spatio-Temporal Disaggregation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07292v4)** | 2024-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open data is frequently released spatially aggregated, usually to comply with privacy policies. But coarse, heterogeneous aggregations complicate learning and integration for downstream AI/ML systems. In this work, we consider models to disaggregate spatio-temporal data from a low-resolution, irregular partition (e.g., census tract) to a high-resolution, irregular partition (e.g., city block). We propose an overarching model named the Structurally-Aware Recurrent Network (SARN), which integrates structurally-aware spatial attention (SASA) layers into the Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) model. The spatial attention layers capture spatial interactions among regions, while the gated recurrent module captures the temporal dependencies. Each SASA layer calculates both global and structural attention -- global attention facilitates comprehensive interactions between different geographic levels, while structural attention leverages the containment relationship between different geographic levels (e.g., a city block being wholly contained within a census tract) to ensure coherent and consistent results. For scenarios with limited historical training data, we explore transfer learning and show that a model pre-trained on one city variable can be fine-tuned for another city variable using only a few hundred samples. Evaluating these techniques on two mobility datasets, we find that on both datasets, SARN significantly outperforms other neural models (5% and 1%) and typical heuristic methods (40% and 14%), enabling us to generate realistic, high-quality fine-grained data for downstream applications.</p></details> |  |

Different from conventional approaches that statically estimate fetal brain motions from pairs of images, our method dynamically tracks the rigid movement patterns of the fetal head across temporal and spatial dimensions. Specifically, we first develop an equivariant neural network that efficiently learns rigid motion sequences through low-dimensional spatial representations of images. Subsequently, we learn spatio-temporal representations by incorporating time encoding and self-attention neural network layers. This approach allows for the capture of long-term dependencies of fetal brain motion and addresses alignment errors due to contrast changes and severe motion artifacts. Our model also provides a geometric deformation estimation that properly addresses image distortions among all time frames. To the best of our knowledge, our approach is the first to learn spatial-temporal representations via deep neural networks for fetal motion tracking without data augmentation. We validated our model using real fetal echo-planar images with simulated and real motions. Our method carries significant potential value in accurately measuring, tracking, and correcting fetal motion in fetal MRI sequences.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 3 figures, Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Interventions (MICCAI) Workshop on Perinatal Imaging, Placental and Preterm Image analysis (PIPPI) 2024</p></details> |
| **[STANet: A Novel Spatio-Temporal Aggregation Network for Depression Classification with Small and Unbalanced FMRI Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21323v1)** | 2024-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate diagnosis of depression is crucial for timely implementation of optimal treatments, preventing complications and reducing the risk of suicide. Traditional methods rely on self-report questionnaires and clinical assessment, lacking objective biomarkers. Combining fMRI with artificial intelligence can enhance depression diagnosis by integrating neuroimaging indicators. However, the specificity of fMRI acquisition for depression often results in unbalanced and small datasets, challenging the sensitivity and accuracy of classification models. In this study, we propose the Spatio-Temporal Aggregation Network (STANet) for diagnosing depression by integrating CNN and RNN to capture both temporal and spatial features of brain activity. STANet comprises the following steps:(1) Aggregate spatio-temporal information via ICA. (2) Utilize multi-scale deep convolution to capture detailed features. (3) Balance data using the SMOTE to generate new samples for minority classes. (4) Employ the AFGRU classifier, which combines Fourier transformation with GRU, to capture long-term dependencies, with an adaptive weight assignment mechanism to enhance model generalization. The experimental results demonstrate that STANet achieves superior depression diagnostic performance with 82.38% accuracy and a 90.72% AUC. The STFA module enhances classification by capturing deeper features at multiple scales. The AFGRU classifier, with adaptive weights and stacked GRU, attains higher accuracy and AUC. SMOTE outperforms other oversampling methods. Additionally, spatio-temporal aggregated features achieve better performance compared to using only temporal or spatial features. STANet outperforms traditional or deep learning classifiers, and functional connectivity-based classifiers, as demonstrated by ten-fold cross-validation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatio-temporal areal models to support small area estimation: An application to national-scale forest carbon monitoring](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09909v2)** | 2024-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>National Forest Inventory (NFI) programs can provide vital information on the status, trend, and change in forest parameters. These programs are being increasingly asked to provide forest parameter estimates for spatial and temporal extents smaller than their current design and accompanying design-based methods can deliver with desired levels of uncertainty. Many NFI designs and estimation methods focus on status and are not well equipped to provide acceptable estimates for trend and change parameters, especially over small spatial domains and/or short time periods. Fine-scale space-time indexed estimates are critical to a variety of environmental, ecological, and economic monitoring efforts. Estimates for forest carbon status, trend, and change are of particular importance to international initiatives to track carbon dynamics. Model-based small area estimation (SAE) methods for NFI and similar ecological monitoring data typically pursue inference on status within small spatial domains, with few demonstrated methods that account for spatio-temporal dependence needed for trend and change estimation. We propose a spatio-temporal Bayesian model framework that delivers statistically valid estimates with full uncertainty quantification for status, trend, and change. The framework accommodates a variety of space and time dependency structures, and we detail model configurations for different settings. Through analysis of simulated datasets, we compare the relative performance of candidate models and a traditional direct estimator. We then apply candidate models to a large-scale NFI dataset to demonstrate the utility of the proposed framework for providing unique quantification of forest carbon dynamics in the contiguous United States. We also provide computationally efficient algorithms, software, and data to reproduce our results and for benchmarking.</p></details> |  |
| **[SpotFormer: Multi-Scale Spatio-Temporal Transformer for Facial Expression Spotting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20799v1)** | 2024-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Facial expression spotting, identifying periods where facial expressions occur in a video, is a significant yet challenging task in facial expression analysis. The issues of irrelevant facial movements and the challenge of detecting subtle motions in micro-expressions remain unresolved, hindering accurate expression spotting. In this paper, we propose an efficient framework for facial expression spotting. First, we propose a Sliding Window-based Multi-Resolution Optical flow (SW-MRO) feature, which calculates multi-resolution optical flow of the input image sequence within compact sliding windows. The window length is tailored to perceive complete micro-expressions and distinguish between general macro- and micro-expressions. SW-MRO can effectively reveal subtle motions while avoiding severe head movement problems. Second, we propose SpotFormer, a multi-scale spatio-temporal Transformer that simultaneously encodes spatio-temporal relationships of the SW-MRO features for accurate frame-level probability estimation. In SpotFormer, our proposed Facial Local Graph Pooling (FLGP) and convolutional layers are applied for multi-scale spatio-temporal feature extraction. We show the validity of the architecture of SpotFormer by comparing it with several model variants. Third, we introduce supervised contrastive learning into SpotFormer to enhance the discriminability between different types of expressions. Extensive experiments on SAMM-LV and CAS(ME)^2 show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art models, particularly in micro-expression spotting.</p></details> |  |
| **[Orca: Ocean Significant Wave Height Estimation with Spatio-temporally Aware Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20053v1)** | 2024-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Significant wave height (SWH) is a vital metric in marine science, and accurate SWH estimation is crucial for various applications, e.g., marine energy development, fishery, early warning systems for potential risks, etc. Traditional SWH estimation methods that are based on numerical models and physical theories are hindered by computational inefficiencies. Recently, machine learning has emerged as an appealing alternative to improve accuracy and reduce computational time. However, due to limited observational technology and high costs, the scarcity of real-world data restricts the potential of machine learning models. To overcome these limitations, we propose an ocean SWH estimation framework, namely Orca. Specifically, Orca enhances the limited spatio-temporal reasoning abilities of classic LLMs with a novel spatiotemporal aware encoding module. By segmenting the limited buoy observational data temporally, encoding the buoys' locations spatially, and designing prompt templates, Orca capitalizes on the robust generalization ability of LLMs to estimate significant wave height effectively with limited data. Experimental results on the Gulf of Mexico demonstrate that Orca achieves state-of-the-art performance in SWH estimation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Causal Deepsets for Off-policy Evaluation under Spatial or Spatio-temporal Interferences](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17910v1)** | 2024-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Off-policy evaluation (OPE) is widely applied in sectors such as pharmaceuticals and e-commerce to evaluate the efficacy of novel products or policies from offline datasets. This paper introduces a causal deepset framework that relaxes several key structural assumptions, primarily the mean-field assumption, prevalent in existing OPE methodologies that handle spatio-temporal interference. These traditional assumptions frequently prove inadequate in real-world settings, thereby restricting the capability of current OPE methods to effectively address complex interference effects. In response, we advocate for the implementation of the permutation invariance (PI) assumption. This innovative approach enables the data-driven, adaptive learning of the mean-field function, offering a more flexible estimation method beyond conventional averaging. Furthermore, we present novel algorithms that incorporate the PI assumption into OPE and thoroughly examine their theoretical foundations. Our numerical analyses demonstrate that this novel approach yields significantly more precise estimations than existing baseline algorithms, thereby substantially improving the practical applicability and effectiveness of OPE methodologies. A Python implementation of our proposed method is available at https://github.com/BIG-S2/Causal-Deepsets.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods either utilize multi-modal information in video-text pairs or apply global and local alignment techniques to promote alignment precision. However, these methods often fail to fully explore the spatio-temporal relationships among vision tokens within video and across different video-text pairs. In this paper, we propose a novel Spatio-Temporal Graph Transformer module to uniformly learn spatial and temporal contexts for video-language alignment pre-training (dubbed STGT). Specifically, our STGT combines spatio-temporal graph structure information with attention in transformer block, effectively utilizing the spatio-temporal contexts. In this way, we can model the relationships between vision tokens, promoting video-text alignment precision for benefiting downstream tasks. In addition, we propose a self-similarity alignment loss to explore the inherent self-similarity in the video and text. With the initial optimization achieved by contrastive learning, it can further promote the alignment accuracy between video and text. Experimental results on challenging downstream tasks, including video-text retrieval and video question answering, verify the superior performance of our method.</p></details> | under review |

Current state-of-the-art methods either require multiple independent stages of processing that employ motion cues or, in the case of end-to-end trainable networks, lack in segmentation accuracy, in part due to the difficulty of learning segmentation maps from videos with transient object presence. This limits the application of WSVOS for semantic annotation of surgical videos where multiple surgical tools frequently move in and out of the field of view, a problem that is more difficult than typically encountered in WSVOS. This paper introduces Video Spatio-Temporal Disentanglement Networks (VDST-Net), a framework to disentangle spatiotemporal information using semi-decoupled knowledge distillation to predict high-quality class activation maps (CAMs). A teacher network designed to resolve temporal conflicts when specifics about object location and timing in the video are not provided works with a student network that integrates information over time by leveraging temporal dependencies. We demonstrate the efficacy of our framework on a public reference dataset and on a more challenging surgical video dataset where objects are, on average, present in less than 60\% of annotated frames. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques and generates superior segmentation masks under video-level weak supervision.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 6 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |

The knowledge tree enables the visualization of hierarchical interrelation within the STKG, while the knowledge net elucidates semantic relationships among knowledge entities. Additionally, the knowledge map displays spatial and temporal distributions via spatial maps and time axes, respectively. Our visualization technology addresses the limitations inherent in single-view approaches and the deficiency of interaction in spatio-temporal perspectives evident in existing visualization methods. Moreover, we have encapsulated this technology within an integrated, open-source platform named GeoViz.

These deep learning based methods learn ST correlations to support the downstream tasks in the fields such as smart mobility, smart city and other intelligent transportation systems. Despite their effectiveness, ST data fusion and forecasting methods face practical challenges in real-world scenarios. First, forecasting performance for ST data-insufficient area is inferior, making it necessary to transfer meta knowledge from heterogeneous area to enhance the sparse representations. Second, it is nontrivial to accurately forecast in multi-transportation-mode scenarios due to the fine-grained ST features of similar transportation modes, making it necessary to distinguish and measure the ST correlations to alleviate the influence caused by entangled ST features. At last, partial data modalities (e.g., transportation mode) are lost due to privacy or technical issues in certain scenarios, making it necessary to effectively fuse the multimodal sparse ST features and enrich the ST representations. To tackle these challenges, our research work aim to develop effective fusion and forecasting methods for multimodal ST data in smart mobility scenario. In this paper, we will introduce our recent works that investigates the challenges in terms of various real-world applications and establish the open challenges in this field for future work.</p></details> | 4 pages |

Although Bayesian methods are common in spatio-temporal modeling, standard Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques are usually slow for large datasets such as house price data. To tackle this problem, we propose a divide-and-conquer spatio-temporal modeling approach. This method involves partitioning the data into multiple subsets and applying an appropriate Gaussian process model to each subset in parallel. The results from each subset are then combined using the Wasserstein barycenter technique to obtain the global parameters for the original problem. The proposed methodology allows for multiple observations per spatial and time unit, thereby offering added benefits for practitioners. As a real-life application, we analyze house price data of more than 0.6 million transactions from 983 middle layer super output areas in London over a period of eight years. The methodology provides insightful findings about the effects of various amenities, trend patterns, and the relationship between prices and carbon emissions. Furthermore, as demonstrated through a cross-validation study, it shows good predictive accuracy while balancing computational efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Suppl...</summary><p>Supplementary material is available from the authors upon request</p></details> |

Large space-time datasets call for new numerical methods to efficiently process them. The Stochastic Partial Differential Equation (SPDE) approach has proven to be effective for the estimation and the prediction in a spatial context. We present here the advection-diffusion SPDE with first order derivative in time which defines a large class of nonseparable spatio-temporal models. A Gaussian Markov random field approximation of the solution to the SPDE is built by discretizing the temporal derivative with a finite difference method (implicit Euler) and by solving the spatial SPDE with a finite element method (continuous Galerkin) at each time step. The ''Streamline Diffusion'' stabilization technique is introduced when the advection term dominates the diffusion. Computationally efficient methods are proposed to estimate the parameters of the SPDE and to predict the spatio-temporal field by kriging, as well as to perform conditional simulations. The approach is applied to a solar radiation dataset. Its advantages and limitations are discussed.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Spatio-Temporal Approach with Self-Corrective Causal Inference for Flight Delay Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15185v1)** | 2024-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate flight delay prediction is crucial for the secure and effective operation of the air traffic system. Recent advances in modeling inter-airport relationships present a promising approach for investigating flight delay prediction from the multi-airport scenario. However, the previous prediction works only accounted for the simplistic relationships such as traffic flow or geographical distance, overlooking the intricate interactions among airports and thus proving inadequate. In this paper, we leverage causal inference to precisely model inter-airport relationships and propose a self-corrective spatio-temporal graph neural network (named CausalNet) for flight delay prediction. Specifically, Granger causality inference coupled with a self-correction module is designed to construct causality graphs among airports and dynamically modify them based on the current airport's delays. Additionally, the features of the causality graphs are adaptively extracted and utilized to address the heterogeneity of airports. Extensive experiments are conducted on the real data of top-74 busiest airports in China. The results show that CausalNet is superior to baselines. Ablation studies emphasize the power of the proposed self-correction causality graph and the graph feature extraction module. All of these prove the effectiveness of the proposed methodology.</p></details> |  |

This variability poses a Domain Adaptation (DA) problem, as training and testing data distributions often differ. In this work, we propose Spatio-Temporal Monge Alignment (STMA) to mitigate these variabilities. This Optimal Transport (OT) based method adapts the cross-power spectrum density (cross-PSD) of multivariate signals by mapping them to the Wasserstein barycenter of source domains (multi-source DA). Predictions for new domains can be done with a filtering without the need for retraining a model with source data (test-time DA). We also study and discuss two special cases of the method, Temporal Monge Alignment (TMA) and Spatial Monge Alignment (SMA). Non-asymptotic concentration bounds are derived for the mappings estimation, which reveals a bias-plus-variance error structure with a variance decay rate of $\mathcal{O}(n_\ell^{-1/2})$ with $n_\ell$ the signal length. This theoretical guarantee demonstrates the efficiency of the proposed computational schema. Numerical experiments on multivariate biosignals and image data show that STMA leads to significant and consistent performance gains between datasets acquired with very different settings. Notably, STMA is a pre-processing step complementary to state-of-the-art deep learning methods.</p></details> |  |

Owing to the outstanding performance in dealing with structure learning potentials, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are often used to capture such complex spatio-temporal features in multivariate time series. However, these data-driven models often fail to capture the essential spatio-temporal relationships when significant signal corruption occurs. Additionally, calculating the high-order neighbor nodes in these models is of high computational complexity. To address these problems, we propose a novel higher-order spatio-temporal physics-incorporated GNN (HSPGNN). Firstly, the dynamic Laplacian matrix can be obtained by the spatial attention mechanism. Then, the generic inhomogeneous partial differential equation (PDE) of physical dynamic systems is used to construct the dynamic higher-order spatio-temporal GNN to obtain the missing time series values. Moreover, we estimate the missing impact by Normalizing Flows (NF) to evaluate the importance of each node in the graph for better explainability. Experimental results on four benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HSPGNN and the superior performance when combining various order neighbor nodes. Also, graph-like optical flow, dynamic graphs, and missing impact can be obtained naturally by HSPGNN, which provides better dynamic analysis and explanation than traditional data-driven models.

Traditional methods rely on hand-crafted features and machine learning techniques, which often struggle to model the complex dynamics of human motion. Recent deep learning-based methods have achieved success by learning spatio-temporal representations of motion, but these models often overlook the reliability of motion data. Additionally, the temporal and spatial dependencies of skeleton nodes are distinct. The temporal relationship captures motion information over time, while the spatial relationship describes body structure and the relationships between different nodes. In this paper, we propose a novel spatio-temporal branching network using incremental information for HMP, which decouples the learning of temporal-domain and spatial-domain features, extracts more motion information, and achieves complementary cross-domain knowledge learning through knowledge distillation. Our approach effectively reduces noise interference and provides more expressive information for characterizing motion by separately extracting temporal and spatial features. We evaluate our approach on standard HMP benchmarks and outperform state-of-the-art methods in terms of prediction accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>The i...</summary><p>The incremental information of our paper includes the displacement information from the last frame of the historical sequence, derived from the motion information of the first frame in the future sequence and the motion information of the last frame of the historical sequence.

Changes in the size, shape and movement of the chambers can be important markers for cardiac disease and modeling this in relation to clinical demography or disease is therefore of interest. Existing methods for spatio-temporal modeling of the human heart require shape correspondence over time or suffer from large memory requirements, making it difficult to use for complex anatomies. We introduce a novel conditional generative model, where the shape and movement is modeled implicitly in the form of a spatio-temporal neural distance field and conditioned on clinical demography. The model is based on an auto-decoder architecture and aims to disentangle the individual variations from that related to the clinical demography. It is tested on the left atrium (including the left atrial appendage), where it outperforms current state-of-the-art methods for anatomical sequence completion and generates synthetic sequences that realistically mimics the shape and motion of the real left atrium. In practice, this means we can infer functional measurements from a static image, generate synthetic populations with specified demography or disease and investigate how non-imaging clinical data effect the shape and motion of cardiac anatomies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for MICCAI2024</p></details> |
| **[Multivariate Bayesian models with flexible shared interactions for analyzing spatio-temporal patterns of rare cancers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10440v2)** | 2024-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rare cancers affect millions of people worldwide each year. However, estimating incidence or mortality rates associated with rare cancers presents important difficulties and poses new statistical methodological challenges. In this paper, we expand the collection of multivariate spatio-temporal models by introducing adaptable shared spatio-temporal components to enable a comprehensive analysis of both incidence and cancer mortality in rare cancer cases. These models allow the modulation of spatio-temporal effects between incidence and mortality, allowing for changes in their relationship over time. The new models have been implemented in INLA using r-generic constructions. We conduct a simulation study to evaluate the performance of the new spatio-temporal models. Our results show that multivariate spatio-temporal models incorporating a flexible shared spatio-temporal term outperform conventional multivariate spatio-temporal models that include specific spatio-temporal effects for each health outcome. We use these models to analyze incidence and mortality data for pancreatic cancer and leukaemia among males across 142 administrative health care districts of Great Britain over a span of nine biennial periods (2002-2019).</p></details> | 40 pages, 12 figures |

To address this limitation, this paper presents the spatio-temporal GraphFormer framework for 3D human pose estimation in video, which integrates body structure graph-based representations with spatio-temporal information. Specifically, we develop a spatio-temporal criss-cross graph (STG) attention mechanism. This approach is designed to learn the long-range dependencies in data across both time and space, integrating graph information directly into the respective attention layers. Furthermore, we introduce the dual-path modulated hop-wise regular GCN (MHR-GCN) module, which utilizes modulation to optimize parameter usage and employs spatio-temporal hop-wise skip connections to acquire higher-order information. Additionally, this module processes temporal and spatial dimensions independently to learn their respective features while avoiding mutual influence. Finally, we demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in 3D human pose estimation on the Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP datasets.</p></details> |  |

The restoration and enhancement have proven to be highly beneficial. However, there are only a limited number of enhancement methods explicitly designed for videos acquired in low-light conditions. We propose a Spatio-Temporal Aligned SUNet (STA-SUNet) model using a Swin Transformer as a backbone to capture low light video features and exploit their spatio-temporal correlations. The STA-SUNet model is trained on a novel, fully registered dataset (BVI), which comprises dynamic scenes captured under varying light conditions. It is further analysed comparatively against various other models over three test datasets. The model demonstrates superior adaptivity across all datasets, obtaining the highest PSNR and SSIM values. It is particularly effective in extreme low-light conditions, yielding fairly good visualisation results.</p></details> |  |

In this regard, covariance properties with respect to geometric image transformations in the earliest layers of the visual hierarchy are essential for expressing robust image operations, and for formulating invariant visual operations at higher levels. This paper defines and proves a set of joint covariance properties for spatio-temporal receptive fields in terms of spatio-temporal derivative operators applied to spatio-temporally smoothed image data under compositions of spatial scaling transformations, spatial affine transformations, Galilean transformations and temporal scaling transformations. Specifically, the derived relations show how the parameters of the receptive fields need to be transformed, in order to match the output from spatio-temporal receptive fields under composed spatio-temporal image transformations. For this purpose, we also fundamentally extend the notion of scale-normalized derivatives to affine-normalized derivatives, that are computed based on spatial smoothing with affine Gaussian kernels, and analyze the covariance properties of the resulting affine-normalized derivatives for the affine group as well as for important subgroups thereof. We conclude with a geometric analysis, showing how the derived joint covariance properties make it possible to relate or match spatio-temporal receptive field responses, when observing, possibly moving, local surface patches from different views, under locally linearized perspective or projective transformations, as well as when observing different instances of spatio-temporal events, that may occur either faster or slower between different views of similar spatio-temporal events.</p></details> | <details><summary>41 pa...</summary><p>41 pages, 13 figures.

Designing spatio-temporal forecasting models separately in a task-wise and city-wise manner to forecast demand and supply-demand gap in a ride-hailing system poses a burden for the expanding transportation network companies. Therefore, a multi-task learning architecture is proposed in this study by developing gated ensemble of spatio-temporal mixture of experts network (GESME-Net) with convolutional recurrent neural network (CRNN), convolutional neural network (CNN), and recurrent neural network (RNN) for simultaneously forecasting these spatio-temporal tasks in a city as well as across different cities. Furthermore, a task adaptation layer is integrated with the architecture for learning joint representation in multi-task learning and revealing the contribution of the input features utilized in prediction. The proposed architecture is tested with data from Didi Chuxing for: (i) simultaneously forecasting demand and supply-demand gap in Beijing, and (ii) simultaneously forecasting demand across Chengdu and Xian. In both scenarios, models from our proposed architecture outperformed the single-task and multi-task deep learning benchmarks and ensemble-based machine learning algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2012.08868</p></details> |

If an AV can predict its surrounding vehicles' future trajectories, it can make safe and efficient manoeuvre decisions. In this paper, we present such a Deep Spatio-Temporal Context-Aware decision Network (DST-CAN) model for predictive manoeuvre planning of AVs. A memory neuron network is used to predict future trajectories of its surrounding vehicles. The driving environment's spatio-temporal information (past, present, and predicted future trajectories) are embedded into a context-aware grid. The proposed DST-CAN model employs these context-aware grids as inputs to a convolutional neural network to understand the spatial relationships between the vehicles and determine a safe and efficient manoeuvre decision. The DST-CAN model also uses information of human driving behavior on a highway. Performance evaluation of DST-CAN has been carried out using two publicly available NGSIM US-101 and I-80 datasets. Also, rule-based ground truth decisions have been compared with those generated by DST-CAN. The results clearly show that DST-CAN can make much better decisions with 3-sec of predicted trajectories of neighboring vehicles compared to currently existing methods that do not use this prediction.</p></details> | 12 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Spatio-Temporal Encoding and Decoding-Based Method for Future Human Activity Skeleton Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05573v1)** | 2024-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inferring future activity information based on observed activity data is a crucial step to improve the accuracy of early activity prediction. Traditional methods based on generative adversarial networks(GAN) or joint learning frameworks can achieve good prediction accuracy under low observation ratios, but they usually have high computational costs. In view of this, this paper proposes a spatio-temporal encoding and decoding-based method for future human activity skeleton synthesis. Firstly, algorithms such as time control, discrete cosine transform, and low-pass filtering are used to cut or pad the skeleton sequences. Secondly, the encoder and decoder are responsible for extracting intermediate semantic encoding from observed skeleton sequences and inferring future sequences from the intermediate semantic encoding, respectively. Finally, joint displacement error, velocity error, and acceleration error, three higher-order kinematic features, are used as key components of the loss function to optimize model parameters. Experimental results show that the proposed future skeleton synthesis algorithm performs better than some existing algorithms. It generates skeleton sequences with smaller errors and fewer model parameters, effectively providing future information for early activity prediction.</p></details> |  |

We train this model on the Raw Heidelberg Digits keyword spotting benchmark using Backpropagation Through Time with surrogate gradients. Analysing the spatio-temporal structure of synaptic interactions in the network we observe that after training excitation and inhibition are grouped together both in space and time. To further enhance the efficiency and biological realism of our model, we implemented a dynamic pruning strategy that combines DEEP R for connection removal and RigL for connection reintroduction, ensuring that the network maintains optimal connectivity throughout training. Additionally, we incorporated Dale's Principle, enforcing each neuron to be exclusively excitatory or inhibitory -- aligning our model closer to biological neural networks. We observed that, after training, the spatio-temporal patterns of excitation and inhibition appeared in the more biologically plausible model as well. Our research demonstrates the potential of integrating learnable delays, dynamic pruning, and biological constraints to develop efficient SNN models for temporal data processing. Furthermore, our results enhance the understanding of spatio-temporal dynamics in SNNs -- suggesting that the spatio-temporal features which emerge from training are robust to both pruning and rewiring processes -- providing a solid foundation for future work in neuromorphic computing applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 4 figures, submitted to Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience</p></details> |

To address these problems, this study proposes a spatio-temporal model that incorporates skewness while maintaining mean and variance, by applying the flexible subclass of the closed skew-normal distribution. An efficient sampling method is introduced, leveraging the autoregressive representation of the model. Additionally, the model's symmetry concerning spatial order is demonstrated, and Mardia's skewness and kurtosis are derived, showing independence from the mean and variance. Simulation studies compare the estimation performance of the proposed model with that of the Gaussian model. The result confirms its superiority in high skewness and low observation noise scenarios. The identification of Cobb-Douglas production functions across US states is examined as an application to real data, revealing that the proposed model excels in both goodness-of-fit and predictive performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generative Adversarial Networks for Spatio-Spectral Compression of Hyperspectral Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08514v3)** | 2024-07-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The development of deep learning-based models for the compression of hyperspectral images (HSIs) has recently attracted great attention in remote sensing due to the sharp growing of hyperspectral data archives. Most of the existing models achieve either spectral or spatial compression, and do not jointly consider the spatio-spectral redundancies present in HSIs. To address this problem, in this paper we focus our attention on the High Fidelity Compression (HiFiC) model (which is proven to be highly effective for spatial compression problems) and adapt it to perform spatio-spectral compression of HSIs. In detail, we introduce two new models: i) HiFiC using Squeeze and Excitation (SE) blocks (denoted as HiFiC$_{SE}$); and ii) HiFiC with 3D convolutions (denoted as HiFiC$_{3D}$) in the framework of compression of HSIs. We analyze the effectiveness of HiFiC$_{SE}$ and HiFiC$_{3D}$ in compressing the spatio-spectral redundancies with channel attention and inter-dependency analysis. Experimental results show the efficacy of the proposed models in performing spatio-spectral compression, while reconstructing images at reduced bitrates with higher reconstruction quality. The code of the proposed models is publicly available at https://git.tu-berlin.de/rsim/HSI-SSC .</p></details> |  |

We train these networks to predict the dynamics of delay-dynamical and spatio-temporal systems for a single size. Then, we drive the networks by their own predictions. We demonstrate that by scaling the size of the trained network, we can predict the complex dynamics for larger or smaller system sizes. Thus, the network learns from a single example and, by exploiting symmetry properties, infers entire bifurcation diagrams.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enabling Multicast Transmission for Spatio-Temporally Asynchronous User Requests in Wireless Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04239v1)** | 2024-07-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The surge in wireless devices and data traffic volume necessitates more efficient transmission methods. Multicasting has garnered consistent attention as a means to fulfill the increasing demand for more efficient data transmission methods. Nevertheless, leveraging multicast wireless networks for spatio-temporally asynchronous data requests poses challenges. In this context, this paper introduces a new multicast mechanism called \emph{set-up based merged multicast (SMMC)} to minimize the delivery time of the requested file in wireless networks by considering the uncertainties inherent in wireless channels. The proposed mechanism comprises two phases. The first phase involves gathering asynchronous requests for a file from users experiencing diverse channel conditions. During this phase, packets of the requested file are transmitted individually in unicast mode within a specified set-up time. Following this, the second phase initiates multicast transmission, which sequentially handles the remaining packets of the file in multicast mode. In the proposed mechanism, we optimize the set-up time and transmission rates of both unicast and multicast modes to minimize the expected file delivery time by jointly taking into account the statistical characteristics of wireless channels, users' locations, and file popularity. Additionally, we also delve into a \emph{fine-tuned SMMC} by utilizing posterior information on the multicast group size and further improve the performance. Our performance evaluations reveal that the proposed SMMC outperforms conventional unicast methods, especially with high-demand data.</p></details> |  |

In a graphon particle system, the interactions among particles are characterized by the coupled mean field terms through an underlying graphon and the randomness of the coefficients comes from the stochastic processes associated with the particle labels. By constructing two-level approximated sequences converging in 2-Wasserstein distance, we prove the existence and uniqueness of the solution to the system. Besides, by constructing two-level approximated functions converging to the graphon mean field terms, we establish the law of large numbers, which reveals that if the number of particles tends to infinity and the discretization step tends to zero, then the discrete-time interacting particle system over a large-scale network converges to the graphon particle system. As a byproduct, we discover that the graphon particle system can describe the limiting dynamics of the distributed stochastic gradient descent algorithm over the large-scale network and prove that if the gradients of the local cost functions are Lipschitz continuous, then the graphon particle system can be regarded as the spatio-temporal approximation of the discrete-time distributed stochastic gradient descent algorithm as the number of network nodes tends to infinity and the algorithm step size tends to zero.</p></details> |  |

Despite remarkable breakthroughs in pretrained natural language models that enable one model to handle diverse tasks, a universal solution for spatio-temporal prediction remains challenging Existing prediction approaches are typically tailored for specific spatio-temporal scenarios, requiring task-specific model designs and extensive domain-specific training data.

In this work, we target enhancing VLMs with a fine-grained structural spatio-temporal alignment learning method (namely Finsta). First of all, we represent the input texts and videos with fine-grained scene graph (SG) structures, both of which are further unified into a holistic SG (HSG) for bridging two modalities. Then, an SG-based framework is built, where the textual SG (TSG) is encoded with a graph Transformer, while the video dynamic SG (DSG) and the HSG are modeled with a novel recurrent graph Transformer for spatial and temporal feature propagation. A spatial-temporal Gaussian differential graph Transformer is further devised to strengthen the sense of the changes in objects across spatial and temporal dimensions. Next, based on the fine-grained structural features of TSG and DSG, we perform object-centered spatial alignment and predicate-centered temporal alignment respectively, enhancing the video-language grounding in both the spatiality and temporality. We design our method as a plug&play system, which can be integrated into existing well-trained VLMs for further representation augmentation, without training from scratch or relying on SG annotations in downstream applications. On 6 representative VL modeling tasks over 12 datasets in both standard and long-form video scenarios, Finsta consistently improves the existing 13 strong-performing VLMs persistently, and refreshes the current state-of-the-art end task performance significantly in both the fine-tuning and zero-shot settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE TPAMI 2024</p></details> |

However, current works for evaluating the spatio-temporal understanding capability of LLMs are somewhat limited and biased. These works either fail to incorporate the latest language models or only focus on assessing the memorized spatio-temporal knowledge. To address this gap, this paper dissects LLMs' capability of spatio-temporal data into four distinct dimensions: knowledge comprehension, spatio-temporal reasoning, accurate computation, and downstream applications. We curate several natural language question-answer tasks for each category and build the benchmark dataset, namely STBench, containing 13 distinct tasks and over 60,000 QA pairs. Moreover, we have assessed the capabilities of 13 LLMs, such as GPT-4o, Gemma and Mistral. Experimental results reveal that existing LLMs show remarkable performance on knowledge comprehension and spatio-temporal reasoning tasks, with potential for further enhancement on other tasks through in-context learning, chain-of-though prompting, and fine-tuning.

Recent advancements in foundational models, particularly those employing self-attention mechanisms, have significantly enhanced our ability to comprehend the semantics of diverse data types. One such area that could highly benefit from multi-modality is in understanding geospatial data, which inherently has multiple modalities. However, current Natural Language Processing (NLP) mechanisms struggle to effectively address geospatial queries. Existing pre-trained LLMs are inadequately equipped to meet the unique demands of geospatial data, lacking the ability to retrieve precise spatio-temporal data in real-time, thus leading to significantly reduced accuracy in answering complex geospatial queries. To address these limitations, we introduce Geode--a pioneering system designed to tackle zero-shot geospatial question-answering tasks with high precision using spatio-temporal data retrieval. Our approach represents a significant improvement in addressing the limitations of current LLM models, demonstrating remarkable improvement in geospatial question-answering abilities compared to existing state-of-the-art pre-trained models.</p></details> |  |

While a few researchers focus on learning ice layer patterns from echogram images captured by airborne snow radar sensors via different convolutional neural networks, the noise in the echogram images proves to be a major obstacle. Instead, we focus on geometric deep learning based on graph neural networks to learn the spatio-temporal patterns from thickness information of shallow ice layers and make predictions for deep layers. In this paper, we propose a physics-informed hybrid graph neural network that combines the GraphSAGE framework for graph feature learning with the long short-term memory (LSTM) structure for learning temporal changes, and introduce measurements of physical ice properties from Model Atmospheric Regional (MAR) weather model as physical node features.

OFOS platforms offer dynamic allocation incentives to users and merchants through diverse marketing campaigns to encourage payments while maintaining the platforms' budget efficiency. Despite significant progress, the marketing domain continues to face two primary challenges: (i) how to allocate a limited budget with greater efficiency, demanding precision in predicting users' monotonic response (i.e. sensitivity) to incentives, and (ii) ensuring spatio-temporal adaptability and robustness in diverse marketing campaigns across different times and locations. To address these issues, we propose a Constrained Monotonic Adaptive Network (CoMAN) method for spatio-temporal perception within marketing pricing. Specifically, we capture spatio-temporal preferences within attribute features through two foundational spatio-temporal perception modules. To further enhance catching the user sensitivity differentials to incentives across varied times and locations, we design modules for learning spatio-temporal convexity and concavity as well as for expressing sensitivity functions. CoMAN can achieve a more efficient allocation of incentive investments during pricing, thus increasing the conversion rate and orders while maintaining budget efficiency. Extensive offline and online experimental results within our diverse marketing campaigns demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach while outperforming the monotonic state-of-the-art method.</p></details> | 7 pages |

Matrix factorization is employed to decompose spatio-temporal data into spatial and temporal components. To improve clarity in the temporal patterns, we introduce a nonnegativity constraint on the time domain along with regularization in the frequency domain. Specifically, regularization in the frequency domain involves selecting features in the frequency space, making an interpretation in the frequency domain more convenient. We propose two methods in the frequency domain: soft and hard regularizations, and provide convergence guarantees to first-order stationary points of the corresponding constrained optimization problem. While our primary motivation stems from geophysical data analysis based on GRACE (Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment) data, our methodology has the potential for wider application. Consequently, when applying our methodology to GRACE data, we find that the results with the proposed methodology are comparable to previous research in the field of geophysical sciences but offer clearer interpretability.</p></details> | <details><summary>35 pa...</summary><p>35 pages, Final version</p></details> |

Despite their advantages, a significant gap persists between real-world scenarios, where detection speed is critical, and existing proposals, which operate on large graphs representing several hours of traffic. This gap results in unrealistic operational conditions and impractical detection delays. Moreover, existing models do not generalize well across different networks, hampering their deployment in production environments. To address these issues, we introduce PPTGNN, a practical spatio-temporal GNN for intrusion detection. PPTGNN enables near real-time predictions, while better capturing the spatio-temporal dynamics of network attacks. PPTGNN employs self-supervised pre-training for improved performance and reduced dependency on labeled data. We evaluate PPTGNN on three public datasets and show that it significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models, such as E-ResGAT and E-GraphSAGE, with an average accuracy improvement of 10.38%. Finally, we show that a pre-trained PPTGNN can easily be fine-tuned to unseen networks with minimal labeled examples. This highlights the potential of PPTGNN as a general, large-scale pre-trained model that can effectively operate in diverse network environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper currently under review.

While limiting the variety of training data can make training easier, it can also lead to a lack of knowledge and information for the model, resulting in a decrease in performance. To address this challenge, we presented an innovative paradigm that incorporates three separate forms of curriculum learning specifically targeting from spatial, temporal, and quantile perspectives. Furthermore, our framework incorporates a stacking fusion module to combine diverse information from three types of curriculum learning, resulting in a strong and thorough learning process. We demonstrated the effectiveness of this framework with extensive empirical evaluations, highlighting its better performance in addressing complex ST challenges. We provided thorough ablation studies to investigate the effectiveness of our curriculum and to explain how it contributes to the improvement of learning efficiency on ST data.</p></details> |  |

Premature predictions may yield a higher rate of false alarms, whereas delaying predictions to gather more information can render them too late to be useful. In applications such as wildfires, crimes, and traffic jams, timely forecasting are vital for safeguarding human life and property. Consequently, finding a balance between accuracy and timeliness is crucial. In this paper, we propose an early spatio-temporal forecasting model based on Multi-Objective reinforcement learning that can either implement an optimal policy given a preference or infer the preference based on a small number of samples. The model addresses two primary challenges: 1) enhancing the accuracy of early forecasting and 2) providing the optimal policy for determining the most suitable prediction time for each area. Our method demonstrates superior performance on three large-scale real-world datasets, surpassing existing methods in early spatio-temporal forecasting tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted paper in KDD 2024</p></details> |

This paper proposes a Multi-level Multi-view Augmented Spatio-temporal Transformer (LVSTformer) for traffic prediction. The model aims to capture spatial dependencies from three different levels: local geographic, global semantic, and pivotal nodes, along with long- and short-term temporal dependencies. Specifically, we design three spatial augmented views to delve into the spatial information from the perspectives of local, global, and pivotal nodes. By combining three spatial augmented views with three parallel spatial self-attention mechanisms, the model can comprehensively captures spatial dependencies at different levels. We design a gated temporal self-attention mechanism to effectively capture long- and short-term temporal dependencies. Furthermore, a spatio-temporal context broadcasting module is introduced between two spatio-temporal layers to ensure a well-distributed allocation of attention scores, alleviating overfitting and information loss, and enhancing the generalization ability and robustness of the model. A comprehensive set of experiments is conducted on six well-known traffic benchmarks, the experimental results demonstrate that LVSTformer achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to competing baselines, with the maximum improvement reaching up to 4.32%.</p></details> |  |

Although several recent methods have been proposed to model complex dynamics in STGs, addressing long-range spatio-temporal dependencies remains a significant challenge, leading to limited performance gains. Inspired by a recently proposed state space model named Mamba, which has shown remarkable capability of capturing long-range dependency, we propose a new STG forecasting framework named SpoT-Mamba. SpoT-Mamba generates node embeddings by scanning various node-specific walk sequences. Based on the node embeddings, it conducts temporal scans to capture long-range spatio-temporal dependencies. Experimental results on the real-world traffic forecasting dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of SpoT-Mamba.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 2 figures, 3 tables.

In this paper, we focus on NCA models used for texture synthesis, where the update rule is inspired by partial differential equations (PDEs) describing reaction-diffusion systems. To train the NCA model, the spatio-temporal domain is discretized, and Euler integration is used to numerically simulate the PDE. However, whether a trained NCA truly learns the continuous dynamic described by the corresponding PDE or merely overfits the discretization used in training remains an open question. We study NCA models at the limit where space-time discretization approaches continuity. We find that existing NCA models tend to overfit the training discretization, especially in the proximity of the initial condition, also called "seed". To address this, we propose a solution that utilizes uniform noise as the initial condition. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in preserving the consistency of NCA dynamics across a wide range of spatio-temporal granularities. Our improved NCA model enables two new test-time interactions by allowing continuous control over the speed of pattern formation and the scale of the synthesized patterns. We demonstrate this new NCA feature in our interactive online demo. Our work reveals that NCA models can learn continuous dynamics and opens new venues for NCA research from a dynamical system's perspective.</p></details> | 9 pages, 12 figures |

Specifically, in the context of estimation, we seek the most likely evolution realizing measured spatio-temporal marginals of killed particles. In the context of control, we seek a suitable control action directing the killed process toward spatio-temporal probabilistic constraints. To this end, we derive a new Schr\"odinger system of coupled, in space and time, partial differential equations to construct the solution of the proposed problem. Further, we show that a Fortet-Sinkhorn type of algorithm is available to attain the associated bridge. A key feature of our framework is that the obtained bridge retains the Markovian structure in the prior process, and thereby, the corresponding controller takes the form of state feedback.</p></details> | 6 pages, 2 figures |

Mainstream approaches employ bidirectional feature propagation, spatio-temporal transformers, or a combination of both to extract information from the video sequence. However, limitations in memory and computational resources constraints the temporal window length of the spatio-temporal transformer, preventing the extraction of longer temporal contextual information from the video sequence. Additionally, bidirectional feature propagation is highly sensitive to inaccurate optical flow in blurry frames, leading to error accumulation during the propagation process. To address these issues, we propose \textbf{BSSTNet}, \textbf{B}lur-aware \textbf{S}patio-temporal \textbf{S}parse \textbf{T}ransformer Network. It introduces the blur map, which converts the originally dense attention into a sparse form, enabling a more extensive utilization of information throughout the entire video sequence. Specifically, BSSTNet (1) uses a longer temporal window in the transformer, leveraging information from more distant frames to restore the blurry pixels in the current frame. (2) introduces bidirectional feature propagation guided by blur maps, which reduces error accumulation caused by the blur frame. The experimental results demonstrate the proposed BSSTNet outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on the GoPro and DVD datasets.</p></details> | CVPR 2024 |

Spatio-temporal data, on the other hand, is vital for analyzing phenomena in both space and time, providing a dynamic perspective on complex system interactions. Recently, diffusion models have seen widespread application in time series and spatio-temporal data mining. Not only do they enhance the generative and inferential capabilities for sequential and temporal data, but they also extend to other downstream tasks. In this survey, we comprehensively and thoroughly review the use of diffusion models in time series and spatio-temporal data, categorizing them by model category, task type, data modality, and practical application domain. In detail, we categorize diffusion models into unconditioned and conditioned types and discuss time series and spatio-temporal data separately. Unconditioned models, which operate unsupervised, are subdivided into probability-based and score-based models, serving predictive and generative tasks such as forecasting, anomaly detection, classification, and imputation. Conditioned models, on the other hand, utilize extra information to enhance performance and are similarly divided for both predictive and generative tasks. Our survey extensively covers their application in various fields, including healthcare, recommendation, climate, energy, audio, and transportation, providing a foundational understanding of how these models analyze and generate data. Through this structured overview, we aim to provide researchers and practitioners with a comprehensive understanding of diffusion models for time series and spatio-temporal data analysis, aiming to direct future innovations and applications by addressing traditional challenges and exploring innovative solutions within the diffusion model framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>Ongoi...</summary><p>Ongoing work & Under review; 27 pages, 8 figures, 2 tables; Github Repo: https://github.com/yyysjz1997/Awesome-TimeSeries-SpatioTemporal-Diffusion-Model</p></details> |
| **[Spatio-Temporal Encoding of Brain Dynamics with Surface Masked Autoencoders](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05474v3)** | 2024-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The development of robust and generalisable models for encoding the spatio-temporal dynamics of human brain activity is crucial for advancing neuroscientific discoveries. However, significant individual variation in the organisation of the human cerebral cortex makes it difficult to identify population-level trends in these signals. Recently, Surface Vision Transformers (SiTs) have emerged as a promising approach for modelling cortical signals, yet they face some limitations in low-data scenarios due to the lack of inductive biases in their architecture. To address these challenges, this paper proposes the surface Masked AutoEncoder (sMAE) and video surface Masked AutoEncoder (vsMAE) - for multivariate and spatio-temporal pre-training of cortical signals over regular icosahedral grids. These models are trained to reconstruct cortical feature maps from masked versions of the input by learning strong latent representations of cortical structure and function. Such representations translate into better modelling of individual phenotypes and enhanced performance in downstream tasks. The proposed approach was evaluated on cortical phenotype regression using data from the young adult Human Connectome Project (HCP) and developing HCP (dHCP). Results show that (v)sMAE pre-trained models improve phenotyping prediction performance on multiple tasks by $\ge 26\%$, and offer faster convergence relative to models trained from scratch. Finally, we show that pre-training vision transformers on large datasets, such as the UK Biobank (UKB), supports transfer learning to low-data regimes. Our code and pre-trained models are publicly available at https://github.com/metrics-lab/surface-masked-autoencoders .</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publications for MIDL 2024; 20 figures; 7 figures</p></details> |

However, tackling the video camouflage object detection (VCOD) task presents a unique challenge. Camouflaged objects typically blend into the background, making them difficult to distinguish in still images. Additionally, ensuring temporal consistency in this context is a challenging problem. As a result, SAM encounters limitations and falls short when applied to the VCOD task. To overcome these challenges, we propose a new method called the SAM Propagation Module (SAM-PM). Our propagation module enforces temporal consistency within SAM by employing spatio-temporal cross-attention mechanisms. Moreover, we exclusively train the propagation module while keeping the SAM network weights frozen, allowing us to integrate task-specific insights with the vast knowledge accumulated by the large model. Our method effectively incorporates temporal consistency and domain-specific expertise into the segmentation network with an addition of less than 1% of SAM's parameters. Extensive experimentation reveals a substantial performance improvement in the VCOD benchmark when compared to the most recent state-of-the-art techniques. Code and pre-trained weights are open-sourced at https://github.com/SpiderNitt/SAM-PM</p></details> |  |

The prediction of the remaining useful life (RUL) of batteries is crucial for ensuring reliable and efficient operation, as well as reducing maintenance costs. However, determining the life cycle of batteries in real-world scenarios is challenging, and existing methods have limitations in predicting the number of cycles iteratively. In addition, existing works often oversimplify the datasets, neglecting important features of the batteries such as temperature, internal resistance, and material type. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a two-stage RUL prediction scheme for Lithium-ion batteries using a spatio-temporal multimodal attention network (ST-MAN). The proposed ST-MAN is to capture the complex spatio-temporal dependencies in the battery data, including the features that are often neglected in existing works. Despite operating without prior knowledge of end-of-life (EOL) events, our method consistently achieves lower error rates, boasting mean absolute error (MAE) and mean square error (MSE) of 0.0275 and 0.0014, respectively, compared to existing convolutional neural networks (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM)-based methods. The proposed method has the potential to improve the reliability and efficiency of battery operations and is applicable in various industries.</p></details> |  |

We propose novel approaches to improve mesh-agnostic spatio-temporal prediction of transient flow fields using graph U-Nets, enabling accurate prediction on diverse mesh configurations. Key enhancements to the graph U-Net architecture, including the Gaussian mixture model convolutional operator and noise injection approaches, provide increased flexibility in modeling node dynamics: the former reduces prediction error by 95\% compared to conventional convolutional operators, while the latter improves long-term prediction robustness, resulting in an error reduction of 86\%. We also investigate transductive and inductive-learning perspectives of graph U-Nets with proposed improvements. In the transductive setting, they effectively predict quantities for unseen nodes within the trained graph. In the inductive setting, they successfully perform in mesh scenarios with different vortex-shedding periods, showing 98\% improvement in predicting the future flow fields compared to a model trained without the inductive settings. It is found that graph U-Nets without pooling operations, i.e. without reducing and restoring the node dimensionality of the graph data, perform better in inductive settings due to their ability to learn from the detailed structure of each graph. Meanwhile, we also discover that the choice of normalization technique significantly impacts graph U-Net performance.</p></details> |  |

Although these methods have shown some potential in creating immersive experiences, two drawbacks limit their ubiquity: (i) a significant reduction in reconstruction quality when the computing budget is limited, and (ii) a lack of semantic understanding of the underlying scenes. To address these issues, we introduce Gear-NeRF, which leverages semantic information from powerful image segmentation models. Our approach presents a principled way for learning a spatio-temporal (4D) semantic embedding, based on which we introduce the concept of gears to allow for stratified modeling of dynamic regions of the scene based on the extent of their motion. Such differentiation allows us to adjust the spatio-temporal sampling resolution for each region in proportion to its motion scale, achieving more photo-realistic dynamic novel view synthesis. At the same time, almost for free, our approach enables free-viewpoint tracking of objects of interest - a functionality not yet achieved by existing NeRF-based methods. Empirical studies validate the effectiveness of our method, where we achieve state-of-the-art rendering and tracking performance on multiple challenging datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper accepted to IEEE/CVF CVPR 2024 (Spotlight).

An especially challenging case that has grown to prominence with advances in single-cell sequencing technologies is learning the behavior of individuals from population snapshots. In the absence of individual-level time series, standard stochastic differential equation models are often nonidentifiable because intrinsic diffusion cannot be distinguished from measurement noise. Despite the difficulty, accurately recovering diffusion terms is required to answer even basic questions about the system's behavior. We show how to combine population-level time series with velocity measurements to build a provably consistent estimator of the diffusion matrix.</p></details> | 22 pages, 5 figures |

However, existing methods are limited by their ability to handle large, complex datasets. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a hybrid approach that combines the strengths of open-source large and small-scale language models (LLMs and LMs) with traditional forecasting methods. We augment traditional methods with dynamic prompting and a grouped-query, multi-head attention mechanism to more effectively capture both intra-series and inter-series dependencies in evolving nonlinear time series data. In addition, we facilitate on-premises customization by fine-tuning smaller open-source LMs for time series trend analysis utilizing descriptions generated by open-source large LMs on consumer-grade hardware using Low-Rank Adaptation with Activation Memory Reduction (LoRA-AMR) technique to reduce computational overhead and activation storage memory demands while preserving inference latency. We combine language model processing for time series trend analysis with traditional time series representation learning method for cross-modal integration, achieving robust and accurate forecasts. The framework effectiveness is demonstrated through extensive experiments on various real-world datasets, outperforming existing methods by significant margins in terms of forecast accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper published at the Deployable AI (DAI) workshop at AAAI-2024</p></details> |

Instead of focusing on the prediction of the future effect, we propose to directly predict the causes via time series forecasting (TSF) of clinical variables and determine the effect by applying the gold standard consensus definition to the forecasted values. This method has the invaluable advantage of being straightforwardly interpretable to clinical practitioners, and because model training does not rely on a particular label anymore, the forecasted data can be used to predict any consensus-based label. We exemplify our method by means of long-term TSF with Transformer models, with a focus on accurate prediction of sparse clinical variables involved in the SOFA-based Sepsis-3 definition and the new Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS-II) definition. Our experiments are conducted on two datasets and show that contrary to recent proposals which advocate set function encoders for time series and direct multi-step decoders, best results are achieved by a combination of standard dense encoders with iterative multi-step decoders. The key for success of iterative multi-step decoding can be attributed to its ability to capture cross-variate dependencies and to a student forcing training strategy that teaches the model to rely on its own previous time step predictions for the next time step prediction.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at Machine Learning for Healthcare (MLHC), Toronto, 2024</p></details> |

Traditional static routing algorithms like Dijkstra and A* compute shortest paths but often fail under dynamic conditions. Recent Reinforcement Learning (RL) approaches offer improvements but tend to focus on local optima, risking dead-ends or boundary issues. This paper proposes a novel approach based on causal inference for real-time dynamic path planning, balancing global and local optimality. We first use the static Dijkstra algorithm to compute a globally optimal baseline path. A distributed control strategy then guides vehicles along this path. At intersections, DynamicRouteGPT performs real-time decision-making for local path selection, considering real-time traffic, driving preferences, and unexpected events. DynamicRouteGPT integrates Markov chains, Bayesian inference, and large-scale pretrained language models like Llama3 8B to provide an efficient path planning solution. It dynamically adjusts to traffic scenarios and driver preferences and requires no pre-training, offering broad applicability across road networks. A key innovation is the construction of causal graphs for counterfactual reasoning, optimizing path decisions. Experimental results show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in real-time dynamic path planning for multiple vehicles while providing explainable path selections, offering a novel and efficient solution for complex traffic environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is 12 pages long and represents the initial draft, version 1</p></details> |

Our technique tracks ARs using images from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) of NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). It involves a 2D circular kernel time series transformation, combined with Statistical and Entropy measures, and a Machine Learning (ML) approach. The technique transforms the circular area around pixels in the SDO AIA images into one-dimensional time series (1-DTS). Statistical measures (Median Value, Xmed; 95th Percentile, X95) and Entropy measures (Distribution Entropy, DisEn; Fuzzy Entropy, FuzzyEn) are used as feature selection methods (FSM 1), alongside a method applying 1-DTS elements directly as features (FSM 2). The ML algorithm classifies these series into three categories: no Active Region (nARs type 1, class 1), non-flaring Regions outside active regions with brightness (nARs type 2, class 2), and flaring Active Regions (ARs, class 3). The ML model achieves a classification accuracy of 0.900 and 0.914 for Entropy and Statistical measures, respectively. Notably, Fuzzy Entropy shows the highest classification accuracy (AKF=0.895), surpassing DisEn (AKF=0.738), X95 (AKF=0.873), and Xmed (AKF=0.840). This indicates the high effectiveness of Entropy and Statistical measures for AR detection in SDO AIA images. FSM 2 captures a similar distribution of flaring AR activities as FSM 1. Additionally, we introduce a generalizing characteristic of AR activities (GSA), finding a direct agreement between increased AR activities and higher GSA values.

Because of special conjugate operation characteristics, time-variant complex conjugate matrix equations need to be transformed into corresponding real field time-variant large-scale linear equations. In this paper, zeroing neural dynamic models based on complex field error (called Con-CZND1) and based on real field error (called Con-CZND2) are proposed for in-depth analysis. Con-CZND1 has fewer elements because of the direct processing of complex matrices. Con-CZND2 needs to be transformed into the real field, with more elements, and its performance is affected by the main diagonal dominance of coefficient matrices. A neural hypercomplex numbers space compressive approximation approach (NHNSCAA) is innovatively proposed. Then Con-CZND1 conj model is constructed. Numerical experiments verify Con-CZND1 conj model effectiveness and highlight NHNSCAA importance.</p></details> |  |

Existing TTA methods are typically designed for environments where domain changes occur sequentially and can struggle in more dynamic scenarios, as illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:settings}. Inspired by the principles of online K-Means, we introduce a novel approach to CTTA through visual prompting. We propose a \emph{Dynamic Prompt Coreset} that not only preserves knowledge from previously visited domains but also accommodates learning from new potential domains. This is complemented by a distance-based \emph{Weight Updating Mechanism} that ensures the coreset remains current and relevant. Our approach employs a fixed model architecture alongside the coreset and an innovative updating system to effectively mitigate challenges such as catastrophic forgetting and error accumulation. Extensive testing on four widely-used benchmarks demonstrates that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art alternatives in both classification and segmentation CTTA tasks across the structured and dynamic CTTA settings, with $99\%$ fewer trainable parameters.</p></details> |  |

Despite its prevalence and importance, handling distribution shifts in the tabular domain remains underexplored due to the inherent challenges within the tabular data itself. In this sense, test-time adaptation (TTA) offers a promising solution by adapting models to target data without accessing source data, crucial for privacy-sensitive tabular domains. However, existing TTA methods either 1) overlook the nature of tabular distribution shifts, often involving label distribution shifts, or 2) impose architectural constraints on the model, leading to a lack of applicability. To this end, we propose AdapTable, a novel TTA framework for tabular data. AdapTable operates in two stages: 1) calibrating model predictions using a shift-aware uncertainty calibrator, and 2) adjusting these predictions to match the target label distribution with a label distribution handler. We validate the effectiveness of AdapTable through theoretical analysis and extensive experiments on various distribution shift scenarios. Our results demonstrate AdapTable's ability to handle various real-world distribution shifts, achieving up to a 16% improvement on the HELOC dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under Review at AAAI 2025</p></details> |

| **[Dual-Path Adversarial Lifting for Domain Shift Correction in Online Test-time Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13983v1)** | 2024-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformer-based methods have achieved remarkable success in various machine learning tasks. How to design efficient test-time adaptation methods for transformer models becomes an important research task. In this work, motivated by the dual-subband wavelet lifting scheme developed in multi-scale signal processing which is able to efficiently separate the input signals into principal components and noise components, we introduce a dual-path token lifting for domain shift correction in test time adaptation. Specifically, we introduce an extra token, referred to as \textit{domain shift token}, at each layer of the transformer network. We then perform dual-path lifting with interleaved token prediction and update between the path of domain shift tokens and the path of class tokens at all network layers. The prediction and update networks are learned in an adversarial manner. Specifically, the task of the prediction network is to learn the residual noise of domain shift which should be largely invariant across all classes and all samples in the target domain. In other words, the predicted domain shift noise should be indistinguishable between all sample classes. On the other hand, the task of the update network is to update the class tokens by removing the domain shift from the input image samples so that input samples become more discriminative between different classes in the feature space. To effectively learn the prediction and update networks with two adversarial tasks, both theoretically and practically, we demonstrate that it is necessary to use smooth optimization for the update network but non-smooth optimization for the prediction network. Experimental results on the benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed method significantly improves the online fully test-time domain adaptation performance.

| **[PALM: Pushing Adaptive Learning Rate Mechanisms for Continual Test-Time Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10650v2)** | 2024-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world vision models in dynamic environments face rapid shifts in domain distributions, leading to decreased recognition performance. Using unlabeled test data, continual test-time adaptation (CTTA) directly adjusts a pre-trained source discriminative model to these changing domains. A highly effective CTTA method involves applying layer-wise adaptive learning rates for selectively adapting pre-trained layers. However, it suffers from the poor estimation of domain shift and the inaccuracies arising from the pseudo-labels. This work aims to overcome these limitations by identifying layers for adaptation via quantifying model prediction uncertainty without relying on pseudo-labels. We utilize the magnitude of gradients as a metric, calculated by backpropagating the KL divergence between the softmax output and a uniform distribution, to select layers for further adaptation. Subsequently, for the parameters exclusively belonging to these selected layers, with the remaining ones frozen, we evaluate their sensitivity to approximate the domain shift and adjust their learning rates accordingly. We conduct extensive image classification experiments on CIFAR-10C, CIFAR-100C, and ImageNet-C, demonstrating the superior efficacy of our method compared to prior approaches.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we show that the class of binding graphs is graph-isomorphism complete and that the stable partitions of binding graphs by the Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) algorithm produce automorphism partitions. To test the isomorphism of two graphs $G$ and $H$, one computes the stable graph of the binding graph $[G\uplus H]$ for the disjoint union graph $G\uplus H$. The automorphism partition reveals the isomorphism of $G$ and $H$.

However, there is a lack of comprehensive summaries that consolidate these advancements. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first to provide a comprehensive review of time series analysis techniques specifically within the educational context. We begin by exploring the landscape of educational data analytics, categorizing various data sources and types relevant to education. We then review four prominent time series methods-forecasting, classification, clustering, and anomaly detection-illustrating their specific application points in educational settings. Subsequently, we present a range of educational scenarios and applications, focusing on how these methods are employed to address diverse educational tasks, which highlights the practical integration of multiple time series methods to solve complex educational problems. Finally, we conclude with a discussion on future directions, including personalized learning analytics, multimodal data fusion, and the role of large language models (LLMs) in educational time series. The contributions of this paper include a detailed taxonomy of educational data, a synthesis of time series techniques with specific educational applications, and a forward-looking perspective on emerging trends and future research opportunities in educational analysis.

To capture these variations, time-since-infection dependent recovery and death rates offer a detailed description of the epidemic. However, obtaining individual-level data to estimate these rates is challenging, while aggregate epidemiological data (such as the number of new infections, number of active cases, number of new recoveries, and number of new deaths) are more readily available. In this article, a new methodology is proposed to estimate time-since-infection dependent recovery and death rates using easily available data sources, accommodating irregular data collection timings reflective of real-world reporting practices. The Nadaraya-Watson estimator is utilized to derive the number of new infections. This model improves the accuracy of epidemic progression descriptions and provides clear insights into recovery and death distributions. The proposed methodology is validated using COVID-19 data and its general applicability is demonstrated by applying it to some other diseases like measles and typhoid.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploring Reliable Matching with Phase Enhancement for Night-time Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13838v1)** | 2024-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semantic segmentation of night-time images holds significant importance in computer vision, particularly for applications like night environment perception in autonomous driving systems. However, existing methods tend to parse night-time images from a day-time perspective, leaving the inherent challenges in low-light conditions (such as compromised texture and deceiving matching errors) unexplored. To address these issues, we propose a novel end-to-end optimized approach, named NightFormer, tailored for night-time semantic segmentation, avoiding the conventional practice of forcibly fitting night-time images into day-time distributions. Specifically, we design a pixel-level texture enhancement module to acquire texture-aware features hierarchically with phase enhancement and amplified attention, and an object-level reliable matching module to realize accurate association matching via reliable attention in low-light environments. Extensive experimental results on various challenging benchmarks including NightCity, BDD and Cityscapes demonstrate that our proposed method performs favorably against state-of-the-art night-time semantic segmentation methods.</p></details> | ECCV 2024 |
| **[FRAP: A Flexible Resource Accessing Protocol for Multiprocessor Real-Time Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13772v1)** | 2024-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fully-partitioned fixed-priority scheduling (FP-FPS) multiprocessor systems are widely found in real-time applications, where spin-based protocols are often deployed to manage the mutually exclusive access of shared resources. Unfortunately, existing approaches either enforce rigid spin priority rules for resource accessing or carry significant pessimism in the schedulability analysis, imposing substantial blocking time regardless of task execution urgency or resource over-provisioning. This paper proposes FRAP, a spin-based flexible resource accessing protocol for FP-FPS systems. A task under FRAP can spin at any priority within a range for accessing a resource, allowing flexible and fine-grained resource control with predictable worst-case behaviour. Under flexible spinning, we demonstrate that the existing analysis techniques can lead to incorrect timing bounds and present a novel MCMF (minimum cost maximum flow)-based blocking analysis, providing predictability guarantee for FRAP. A spin priority assignment is reported that fully exploits flexible spinning to reduce the blocking time of tasks with high urgency, enhancing the performance of FRAP. Experimental results show that FRAP outperforms the existing spin-based protocols in schedulability by 15.20%-32.73% on average, up to 65.85%.</p></details> |  |

The design philosophy is based on the observation that different pixel regions within an image exhibit varying levels of complexity, with higher complexities posing a greater challenge for accurate segmentation. We thus introduce image complexity as prior guidance and propose the Image Complexity prior-guided Feature Refinement Network (ICFRNet). This network aggregates both complexity and segmentation features to produce an attention map for refining segmentation features within an Image Complexity Guided Attention (ICGA) module. We optimize the network in terms of both segmentation and image complexity prediction tasks with a combined loss function. Experimental results on the Cityscapes and CamViD datasets have shown that our ICFRNet achieves higher accuracy with a competitive efficiency for real-time segmentation.</p></details> |  |
| **[VPIT: Real-time Embedded Single Object 3D Tracking Using Voxel Pseudo Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.02619v2)** | 2024-08-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose a novel voxel-based 3D single object tracking (3D SOT) method called Voxel Pseudo Image Tracking (VPIT). VPIT is the first method that uses voxel pseudo images for 3D SOT. The input point cloud is structured by pillar-based voxelization, and the resulting pseudo image is used as an input to a 2D-like Siamese SOT method. The pseudo image is created in the Bird's-eye View (BEV) coordinates, and therefore the objects in it have constant size. Thus, only the object rotation can change in the new coordinate system and not the object scale. For this reason, we replace multi-scale search with a multi-rotation search, where differently rotated search regions are compared against a single target representation to predict both position and rotation of the object. Experiments on KITTI Tracking dataset show that VPIT is the fastest 3D SOT method and maintains competitive Success and Precision values. Application of a SOT method in a real-world scenario meets with limitations such as lower computational capabilities of embedded devices and a latency-unforgiving environment, where the method is forced to skip certain data frames if the inference speed is not high enough. We implement a real-time evaluation protocol and show that other methods lose most of their performance on embedded devices, while VPIT maintains its ability to track the object.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 7 figures, 5 tables.

Our proposed algorithm, Blending Bayesian Interaction Primitives (B-BIP) allows us to achieve responsive interactions in complex hugging scenarios, capable of reciprocating and adapting to a hugs motion and timing. We show that this algorithm is a generalization of prior work, for which the original formulation reduces to the particular case of a single interaction, and evaluate our method through both an extensive user study and empirical experiments. Our algorithm yields significantly better quantitative prediction error and more-favorable participant responses with respect to accuracy, responsiveness, and timing, when compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

However, current methods struggle with large, complex datasets. We propose a dynamic, multi-modal approach that integrates the strengths of traditional forecasting methods and instruction tuning of small language models for time series trend analysis. This approach utilizes a mixture of experts (MoE) architecture with parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods, tailored for consumer hardware to scale up AI solutions in low resource settings while balancing performance and latency tradeoffs. Additionally, our approach leverages related past experiences for similar input time series to efficiently handle both intra-series and inter-series dependencies of non-stationary data with a time-then-space modeling approach, using grouped-query attention, while mitigating the limitations of traditional forecasting techniques in handling distributional shifts. Our approach models predictive uncertainty to improve decision-making. Our framework enables on-premises customization with reduced computational and memory demands, while maintaining inference speed and data privacy/security. Extensive experiments on various real-world datasets demonstrate that our framework provides robust and accurate forecasts, significantly outperforming existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at the ICLR 2024 Workshop on Practical ML for Low Resource Settings(PML4LRS)</p></details> |
| **[Optimal time sampling in physics-informed neural networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18780v2)** | 2024-08-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Physics-informed neural networks (PINN) is a extremely powerful paradigm used to solve equations encountered in scientific computing applications. An important part of the procedure is the minimization of the equation residual which includes, when the equation is time-dependent, a time sampling. It was argued in the literature that the sampling need not be uniform but should overweight initial time instants, but no rigorous explanation was provided for this choice. In the present work we take some prototypical examples and, under standard hypothesis concerning the neural network convergence, we show that the optimal time sampling follows a (truncated) exponential distribution. In particular we explain when is best to use uniform time sampling and when one should not. The findings are illustrated with numerical examples on linear equation, Burgers' equation and the Lorenz system.</p></details> |  |
| **[Real-Time Rendering of Glints in the Presence of Area Lights](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13611v1)** | 2024-08-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many real-world materials are characterized by a glittery appearance. Reproducing this effect in physically based renderings is a challenging problem due to its discrete nature, especially in real-time applications which require a consistently low runtime. Recent work focuses on glittery appearance illuminated by infinitesimally small light sources only. For light sources like the sun this approximation is a reasonable choice. In the real world however, all light sources are fundamentally area light sources. In this paper, we derive an efficient method for rendering glints illuminated by spatially constant diffuse area lights in real time. To this end, we require an adequate estimate for the probability of a single microfacet to be correctly oriented for reflection from the source to the observer. A good estimate is achieved either using linearly transformed cosines (LTC) for large light sources, or a locally constant approximation of the normal distribution for small spherical caps of light directions. To compute the resulting number of reflecting microfacets, we employ a counting model based on the binomial distribution. In the evaluation, we demonstrate the visual accuracy of our approach, which is easily integrated into existing real-time rendering frameworks, especially if they already implement shading for area lights using LTCs and a counting model for glint shading under point and directional illumination. Besides the overhead of the preexisting constituents, our method adds little to no additional overhead.</p></details> |  |
| **[Data Augmentation for Time-Series Classification: An Extensive Empirical Study and Comprehensive Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10060v5)** | 2024-08-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data Augmentation (DA) has become a critical approach in Time Series Classification (TSC), primarily for its capacity to expand training datasets, enhance model robustness, introduce diversity, and reduce overfitting. However, the current landscape of DA in TSC is plagued with fragmented literature reviews, nebulous methodological taxonomies, inadequate evaluative measures, and a dearth of accessible and user-oriented tools. This study addresses these challenges through a comprehensive examination of DA methodologies within the TSC domain.Our research began with an extensive literature review spanning a decade, revealing significant gaps in existing surveys and necessitating a detailed analysis of over 100 scholarly articles to identify more than 60 distinct DA techniques. This rigorous review led to the development of a novel taxonomy tailored to the specific needs of DA in TSC, categorizing techniques into five primary categories: Transformation-Based, Pattern-Based, Generative, Decomposition-Based, and Automated Data Augmentation. This taxonomy is intended to guide researchers in selecting appropriate methods with greater clarity. In response to the lack of comprehensive evaluations of foundational DA techniques, we conducted a thorough empirical study, testing nearly 20 DA strategies across 15 diverse datasets representing all types within the UCR time-series repository. Using ResNet and LSTM architectures, we employed a multifaceted evaluation approach, including metrics such as Accuracy, Method Ranking, and Residual Analysis, resulting in a benchmark accuracy of 84.98 +- 16.41% in ResNet and 82.41 +- 18.71% in LSTM. Our investigation underscored the inconsistent efficacies of DA techniques, for instance, methods like RGWs and Random Permutation significantly improved model performance, whereas others, like EMD, were less effective.</p></details> |  |
| **[ScreenTK: Seamless Detection of Time-Killing Moments Using Continuous Mobile Screen Text and On-Device LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03063v3)** | 2024-08-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Smartphones have become essential to people's digital lives, providing a continuous stream of information and connectivity. However, this constant flow can lead to moments where users are simply passing time rather than engaging meaningfully. This underscores the importance of developing methods to identify these "time-killing" moments, enabling the delivery of important notifications in a way that minimizes interruptions and enhances user engagement. Recent work has utilized screenshots taken every 5 seconds to detect time-killing activities on smartphones. However, this method often misses to capture phone usage between intervals. We demonstrate that up to 50% of time-killing instances go undetected using screenshots, leading to substantial gaps in understanding user behavior. To address this limitation, we propose a method called ScreenTK that detects time-killing moments by leveraging continuous screen text monitoring and on-device large language models (LLMs). Screen text contains more comprehensive information than screenshots and allows LLMs to summarize detailed phone usage. To verify our framework, we conducted experiments with six participants, capturing 1,034 records of different time-killing moments. Initial results show that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art solutions by 38% in our case study.</p></details> |  |
| **[FFT-based surrogate modeling of auxetic metamaterials with real-time prediction of effective elastic properties and swift inverse design](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13532v1)** | 2024-08-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Auxetic structures, known for their negative Poisson's ratio, exhibit effective elastic properties heavily influenced by their underlying structural geometry and base material properties. While periodic homogenization of auxetic unit cells can be used to investigate these properties, it is computationally expensive and limits design space exploration and inverse analysis. In this paper, surrogate models are developed for the real-time prediction of the effective elastic properties of auxetic unit cells with orthogonal voids of different shapes. The unit cells feature orthogonal voids in four distinct shapes, including rectangular, diamond, oval, and peanut-shaped voids, each characterized by specific void diameters. The generated surrogate models accept geometric parameters and the elastic properties of the base material as inputs to predict the effective elastic constants in real-time. This rapid evaluation enables a practical inverse analysis framework for obtaining the optimal design parameters that yield the desired effective response. The fast Fourier transform (FFT)-based homogenization approach is adopted to efficiently generate data for developing the surrogate models, bypassing concerns about periodic mesh generation and boundary conditions typically associated with the finite element method (FEM). The performance of the generated surrogate models is rigorously examined through a train/test split methodology, a parametric study, and an inverse problem. Finally, a graphical user interface (GUI) is developed, offering real-time prediction of the effective tangent stiffness and performing inverse analysis to determine optimal geometric parameters.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learnability with Time-Sharing Computational Resource Concerns](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.02217v5)** | 2024-08-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conventional theoretical machine learning studies generally assume explicitly or implicitly that there are enough or even infinitely supplied computational resources. In real practice, however, computational resources are usually limited, and the performance of machine learning depends not only on how many data have been received, but also on how many data can be handled subject to computational resources available. Note that most current ``intelligent supercomputing'' facilities work like exclusive operating systems, where a fixed amount of resources are allocated to a machine learning task without adaptive scheduling strategies considering important factors such as the learning performance demands and learning process status. In this article, we introduce the notion of machine learning throughput, define Computational Resource Efficient Learning (CoRE-Learning), and present a theoretical framework that takes into account the influence of computational resources in learning theory. This framework can be naturally applied to stream learning where the incoming data streams can be potentially endless with overwhelming size and it is impractical to assume that all received data can be handled in time. It may also provide a theoretical perspective for the design of intelligent supercomputing operating systems.</p></details> |  |

Consequently, the exploration of model architectures remains a perennially trending topic in research. To meet these performance demands, we propose a novel backbone from the perspective of information fusion. Introducing the Basic Probability Assignment (BPA) Module and the Time Evidence Fusion Network (TEFN), based on evidence theory, allows us to achieve superior performance. On the other hand, the perspective of multi-source information fusion effectively improves the accuracy of forecasting. Due to the fact that BPA is generated by fuzzy theory, TEFN also has considerable interpretability. In real data experiments, the TEFN partially achieved state-of-the-art, with low errors comparable to PatchTST, and operating efficiency surpass performance models such as Dlinear. Meanwhile, TEFN has high robustness and small error fluctuations in the random hyperparameter selection. TEFN is not a model that achieves the ultimate in single aspect, but a model that balances performance, accuracy, stability, and interpretability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Time-Series Contrastive Learning against False Negatives and Class Imbalance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11939v2)** | 2024-08-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As an exemplary self-supervised approach for representation learning, time-series contrastive learning has exhibited remarkable advancements in contemporary research. While recent contrastive learning strategies have focused on how to construct appropriate positives and negatives, in this study, we conduct theoretical analysis and find they have overlooked the fundamental issues: false negatives and class imbalance inherent in the InfoNCE loss-based framework. Therefore, we introduce a straightforward modification grounded in the SimCLR framework, universally adaptable to models engaged in the instance discrimination task. By constructing instance graphs to facilitate interactive learning among instances, we emulate supervised contrastive learning via the multiple-instances discrimination task, mitigating the harmful impact of false negatives. Moreover, leveraging the graph structure and few-labeled data, we perform semi-supervised consistency classification and enhance the representative ability of minority classes. We compared our method with the most popular time-series contrastive learning methods on four real-world time-series datasets and demonstrated our significant advantages in overall performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Cinematic Gaussians: Real-Time HDR Radiance Fields with Depth of Field](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07329v3)** | 2024-08-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Radiance field methods represent the state of the art in reconstructing complex scenes from multi-view photos. However, these reconstructions often suffer from one or both of the following limitations: First, they typically represent scenes in low dynamic range (LDR), which restricts their use to evenly lit environments and hinders immersive viewing experiences. Secondly, their reliance on a pinhole camera model, assuming all scene elements are in focus in the input images, presents practical challenges and complicates refocusing during novel-view synthesis. Addressing these limitations, we present a lightweight method based on 3D Gaussian Splatting that utilizes multi-view LDR images of a scene with varying exposure times, apertures, and focus distances as input to reconstruct a high-dynamic-range (HDR) radiance field. By incorporating analytical convolutions of Gaussians based on a thin-lens camera model as well as a tonemapping module, our reconstructions enable the rendering of HDR content with flexible refocusing capabilities. We demonstrate that our combined treatment of HDR and depth of field facilitates real-time cinematic rendering, outperforming the state of the art.</p></details> |  |

Pinatubo eruption resulted in a massive increase of sulfate aerosols in the atmosphere, absorbing radiation and leading to global changes in surface and stratospheric temperatures. A volcanic eruption of this magnitude serves as a natural analog for stratospheric aerosol injection, a proposed solar radiation modification method to combat the warming climate. The impacts of such an event are multifaceted and region-specific. Our goal is to characterize the multivariate and dynamic nature of the climate impacts following the Mt. Pinatubo eruption. We developed a multivariate space-time dynamic linear model to understand the full extent of the spatially- and temporally-varying impacts. Specifically, spatial variation is modeled using a flexible set of basis functions for which the basis coefficients are allowed to vary in time through a vector autoregressive (VAR) structure. This novel model is caste in a Dynamic Linear Model (DLM) framework and estimated via a customized MCMC approach. We demonstrate how the model quantifies the relationships between key atmospheric parameters following the Mt. Pinatubo eruption with reanalysis data from MERRA-2 and highlight when such model is advantageous over univariate models.</p></details> |  |

Current pre-training methods are limited in either unidirectional next-token prediction or randomly masked token prediction. We propose a novel architecture called Bidirectional Timely Generative Pre-trained Transformer (BiTimelyGPT), which pre-trains on biosignals and longitudinal clinical records by both next-token and previous-token prediction in alternating transformer layers. This pre-training task preserves original distribution and data shapes of the time-series. Additionally, the full-rank forward and backward attention matrices exhibit more expressive representation capabilities. Using biosignals and longitudinal clinical records, BiTimelyGPT demonstrates superior performance in predicting neurological functionality, disease diagnosis, and physiological signs. By visualizing the attention heatmap, we observe that the pre-trained BiTimelyGPT can identify discriminative segments from biosignal time-series sequences, even more so after fine-tuning on the task.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Layer Transformers Gradient Can be Approximated in Almost Linear Time](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13233v1)** | 2024-08-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The quadratic computational complexity in the self-attention mechanism of popular transformer architectures poses significant challenges for training and inference, particularly in terms of efficiency and memory requirements. Towards addressing these challenges, this paper introduces a novel fast computation method for gradient calculation in multi-layer transformer models. Our approach enables the computation of gradients for the entire multi-layer transformer model in almost linear time $n^{1+o(1)}$, where $n$ is the input sequence length. This breakthrough significantly reduces the computational bottleneck associated with the traditional quadratic time complexity. Our theory holds for any loss function and maintains a bounded approximation error across the entire model. Furthermore, our analysis can hold when the multi-layer transformer model contains many practical sub-modules, such as residual connection, casual mask, and multi-head attention. By improving the efficiency of gradient computation in large language models, we hope that our work will facilitate the more effective training and deployment of long-context language models based on our theoretical results.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quadratic estimation for stochastic systems in the presence of random parameter matrices, time-correlated additive noise and deception attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13224v1)** | 2024-08-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Networked systems usually face different random uncertainties that make the performance of the least-squares (LS) linear filter decline significantly. For this reason, great attention has been paid to the search for other kinds of suboptimal estimators. Among them, the LS quadratic estimation approach has attracted considerable interest in the scientific community for its balance between computational complexity and estimation accuracy. When it comes to stochastic systems subject to different random uncertainties and deception attacks, the quadratic estimator design has not been deeply studied. In this paper, using covariance information, the LS quadratic filtering and fixed-point smoothing problems are addressed under the assumption that the measurements are perturbed by a time-correlated additive noise, as well as affected by random parameter matrices and exposed to random deception attacks. The use of random parameter matrices covers a wide range of common uncertainties and random failures, thus better reflecting the engineering reality. The signal and observation vectors are augmented by stacking the original vectors with their second-order Kronecker powers; then, the linear estimator of the original signal based on the augmented observations provides the required quadratic estimator. A simulation example illustrates the superiority of the proposed quadratic estimators over the conventional linear ones and the effect of the deception attacks on the estimation performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Saihu: A Common Interface of Worst-Case Delay Analysis Tools for Time-Sensitive Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14565v2)** | 2024-08-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time-sensitive networks, as in the context of IEEE-TSN and IETF-Detnet, require bounds on worst-case delays. Various network analysis tools compute such bounds; these tools are based on different methods and provide delay bounds that are all valid but may differ; furthermore, it is generally not known which tool will provide the best bound. To obtain the best possible bound, users need to implement multiple pieces of code with a different syntax for every tool, which is impractical and error-prone. To address this issue, we present Saihu, a Python interface that integrates the three most frequently used worst-case network analysis tools: xTFA, DiscoDNC, and Panco.

| **[A latent space model for multivariate count data time series analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13162v1)** | 2024-08-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motivated by a dataset of burglaries in Chicago, USA, we introduce a novel framework to analyze time series of count data combining common multivariate time series models with latent position network models. This novel methodology allows us to gain a new latent variable perspective on the crime dataset that we consider, allowing us to disentangle and explain the complex patterns exhibited by the data, while providing a natural time series framework that can be used to make future predictions. Our model is underpinned by two well known statistical approaches: a log-linear vector autoregressive model, which is prominent in the literature on multivariate count time series, and a latent projection model, which is a popular latent variable model for networks. The role of the projection model is to characterize the interaction parameters of the vector autoregressive model, thus uncovering the underlying network that is associated with the pairwise relationships between the time series. Estimation and inferential procedures are performed using an optimization algorithm and a Hamiltonian Monte Carlo procedure for efficient Bayesian inference. We also include a simulation study to illustrate the merits of our methodology in recovering consistent parameter estimates, and in making accurate future predictions for the time series. As we demonstrate in our application to the crime dataset, this new methodology can provide very meaningful model-based interpretations of the data, and it can be generalized to other time series contexts and applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>36 pa...</summary><p>36 pages, 21 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |
| **[Optimal order time discretizations for stochastic semilinear wave equations with multiplicative noise](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13134v1)** | 2024-08-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper is concerned with developing and analyzing two novel implicit temporal discretization methods for the stochastic semilinear wave equations with multiplicative noise. The proposed methods are natural extensions of well-known time-discrete schemes for deterministic wave equations, hence, they are easy to implement. It is proved that both methods are energy-stable. Moreover, the first method is shown to converge with the linear order in the energy norm, while the second method converges with the $\mathcal{O}(\tau^{\frac32})$ order in the $L^2$-norm, which is optimal with respect to the time regularity of the solution to the underlying stochastic PDE. The convergence analyses of both methods, which are different and quite involved, require some novel numerical techniques to overcome difficulties caused by the nonlinear noise term and the interplay between nonlinear drift and diffusion. Numerical experiments are provided to validate the sharpness of the theoretical error estimate results.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, 0 figure, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[Multivariate Time-Series Anomaly Detection based on Enhancing Graph Attention Networks with Topological Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13082v1)** | 2024-08-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unsupervised anomaly detection in time series is essential in industrial applications, as it significantly reduces the need for manual intervention. Multivariate time series pose a complex challenge due to their feature and temporal dimensions. Traditional methods use Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) or Transformers to analyze spatial while RNNs to model temporal dependencies. These methods focus narrowly on one dimension or engage in coarse-grained feature extraction, which can be inadequate for large datasets characterized by intricate relationships and dynamic changes. This paper introduces a novel temporal model built on an enhanced Graph Attention Network (GAT) for multivariate time series anomaly detection called TopoGDN. Our model analyzes both time and feature dimensions from a fine-grained perspective. First, we introduce a multi-scale temporal convolution module to extract detailed temporal features. Additionally, we present an augmented GAT to manage complex inter-feature dependencies, which incorporates graph topology into node features across multiple scales, a versatile, plug-and-play enhancement that significantly boosts the performance of GAT. Our experimental results confirm that our approach surpasses the baseline models on four datasets, demonstrating its potential for widespread application in fields requiring robust anomaly detection. The code is available at https://github.com/ljj-cyber/TopoGDN.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 figures, to be published in CIKM 2024</p></details> |
| **[Pseudo Channel: Time Embedding for Motor Imagery Decoding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15812v2)** | 2024-08-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motor imagery (MI) based EEG represents a frontier in enabling direct neural control of external devices and advancing neural rehabilitation. This study introduces a novel time embedding technique, termed traveling-wave based time embedding, utilized as a pseudo channel to enhance the decoding accuracy of MI-EEG signals across various neural network architectures. Unlike traditional neural network methods that fail to account for the temporal dynamics in MI-EEG in individual difference, our approach captures time-related changes for different participants based on a priori knowledge. Through extensive experimentation with multiple participants, we demonstrate that this method not only improves classification accuracy but also exhibits greater adaptability to individual differences compared to position encoding used in Transformer architecture. Significantly, our results reveal that traveling-wave based time embedding crucially enhances decoding accuracy, particularly for participants typically considered "EEG-illiteracy". As a novel direction in EEG research, the traveling-wave based time embedding not only offers fresh insights for neural network decoding strategies but also expands new avenues for research into attention mechanisms in neuroscience and a deeper understanding of EEG signals.</p></details> | 13 pages, 5 figures |

We call them {\Lambda}-shiftable CBFs where {\Lambda} states the extent by which the CBF can be varied by adding a time-varying function. Moreover, we derive sufficient conditions under which a time-varying CBF can be obtained from a time-invariant one, and we propose a systematic construction method. Advantageous about our approach is that a {\Lambda}-shiftable CBF, once constructed, can be reused for various control objectives. In the end, we relate the class of {\Lambda}-shiftable CBFs to Control Lyapunov Functions (CLF), and we illustrate the application of our results with a relevant simulation example.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 2 figures, accepted for the publication at IEEE CDC 2024</p></details> |

They allow one to reduce equivalence or preorder checking to model checking, and are exactly the formulae in the modal logics characterizing classic behavioural equivalences and preorders for which model checking can be reduced to equivalence or preorder checking. This paper studies the complexity of determining whether a formula is characteristic for some finite, loop-free process in each of the logics providing modal characterizations of the simulation-based semantics in van Glabbeek's branching-time spectrum. Since characteristic formulae in each of those logics are exactly the consistent and prime ones, it presents complexity results for the satisfiability and primality problems, and investigates the boundary between modal logics for which those problems can be solved in polynomial time and those for which they become computationally hard. Amongst other contributions, this article also studies the complexity of constructing characteristic formulae in the modal logics characterizing simulation-based semantics, both when such formulae are presented in explicit form and via systems of equations.</p></details> | 66 pages, 1 figure |
| **[Robust Feature Inference: A Test-time Defense Strategy using Spectral Projections](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11672v2)** | 2024-08-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Test-time defenses are used to improve the robustness of deep neural networks to adversarial examples during inference. However, existing methods either require an additional trained classifier to detect and correct the adversarial samples, or perform additional complex optimization on the model parameters or the input to adapt to the adversarial samples at test-time, resulting in a significant increase in the inference time compared to the base model. In this work, we propose a novel test-time defense strategy called Robust Feature Inference (RFI) that is easy to integrate with any existing (robust) training procedure without additional test-time computation. Based on the notion of robustness of features that we present, the key idea is to project the trained models to the most robust feature space, thereby reducing the vulnerability to adversarial attacks in non-robust directions. We theoretically characterize the subspace of the eigenspectrum of the feature covariance that is the most robust for a generalized additive model. Our extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, tiny ImageNet and ImageNet datasets for several robustness benchmarks, including the state-of-the-art methods in RobustBench show that RFI improves robustness across adaptive and transfer attacks consistently. We also compare RFI with adaptive test-time defenses to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in TMLR (28 pages, 6 figures, 20 tables)</p></details> |

However, the existing road-level traffic prediction has mainly studied how significantly micro traffic events propagate to the adjacent roads in terms of short-term prediction. On the other hand, recent attempts have been made to incorporate regional knowledge such as POIs, road characteristics, and real-time social events to help traffic prediction. However, these studies lack in understandings of different modalities of road-level and region-level spatio-temporal correlations and how to combine such knowledge. This paper proposes a novel method that embeds real-time region-level knowledge using POIs, satellite images, and real-time LTE access traces via a regional spatio-temporal module that consists of dynamic convolution and temporal attention, and conducts bipartite spatial transform attention to convert into road-level knowledge. Then the model ingests this embedded knowledge into a road-level attention-based prediction model. Experimental results on real-world road traffic prediction show that our model outperforms the baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[DutyTTE: Deciphering Uncertainty in Origin-Destination Travel Time Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12809v1)** | 2024-08-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Uncertainty quantification in travel time estimation (TTE) aims to estimate the confidence interval for travel time, given the origin (O), destination (D), and departure time (T). Accurately quantifying this uncertainty requires generating the most likely path and assessing travel time uncertainty along the path. This involves two main challenges: 1) Predicting a path that aligns with the ground truth, and 2) modeling the impact of travel time in each segment on overall uncertainty under varying conditions. We propose DutyTTE to address these challenges. For the first challenge, we introduce a deep reinforcement learning method to improve alignment between the predicted path and the ground truth, providing more accurate travel time information from road segments to improve TTE. For the second challenge, we propose a mixture of experts guided uncertainty quantification mechanism to better capture travel time uncertainty for each segment under varying contexts. Additionally, we calibrate our results using Hoeffding's upper-confidence bound to provide statistical guarantees for the estimated confidence intervals. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method.</p></details> | 7 pages |
| **[Robust Predictions with Ambiguous Time Delays: A Bootstrap Strategy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12801v1)** | 2024-08-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In contemporary data-driven environments, the generation and processing of multivariate time series data is an omnipresent challenge, often complicated by time delays between different time series. These delays, originating from a multitude of sources like varying data transmission dynamics, sensor interferences, and environmental changes, introduce significant complexities. Traditional Time Delay Estimation methods, which typically assume a fixed constant time delay, may not fully capture these variabilities, compromising the precision of predictive models in diverse settings. To address this issue, we introduce the Time Series Model Bootstrap (TSMB), a versatile framework designed to handle potentially varying or even nondeterministic time delays in time series modeling. Contrary to traditional approaches that hinge on the assumption of a single, consistent time delay, TSMB adopts a nonparametric stance, acknowledging and incorporating time delay uncertainties. TSMB significantly bolsters the performance of models that are trained and make predictions using this framework, making it highly suitable for a wide range of dynamic and interconnected data environments.</p></details> |  |

Musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) are a significant concern for workers involved in manual lifting, and traditional methods for posture correction are often inadequate due to delayed feedback and lack of personalized assessment. Our proposed solution integrates AI-driven posture detection, detailed keypoint analysis, risk level determination, and real-time feedback delivered through a user-friendly web interface. The system aims to improve posture, reduce the risk of MSDs, and enhance user engagement. The research involves comprehensive data collection, model training, and iterative development to ensure high accuracy and user satisfaction. The solution's effectiveness is evaluated against existing methodologies, demonstrating significant improvements in real-time feedback and risk assessment. This study contributes to the field by offering a novel approach to posture correction that addresses existing gaps and provides practical, immediate benefits to users.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proce...</summary><p>Proceedings of the 1st International Workshop on Multimedia Computing for Health and Medicine at ACM MM'24</p></details> |

TimeMachine exploits the unique properties of time series data to produce salient contextual cues at multi-scales and leverage an innovative integrated quadruple-Mamba architecture to unify the handling of channel-mixing and channel-independence situations, thus enabling effective selection of contents for prediction against global and local contexts at different scales.

| **[Time-Dependent Blackwell Approachability and Application to Absorbing Games](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04956v2)** | 2024-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Blackwell's approachability (Blackwell, 1954, 1956) is a very general online learning framework where a Decision Maker obtains vector-valued outcomes, and aims at the convergence of the average outcome to a given ``target'' set. Blackwell gave a sufficient condition for the decision maker having a strategy guaranteeing such a convergence against an adversarial environment, as well as what we now call the Blackwell's algorithm, which then ensures convergence. Blackwell's approachability has since been applied to numerous problems, in regret minimization and game theory, in particular. We extend this framework by allowing the outcome function and the inner product to be time-dependent. We establish a general guarantee for the natural extension to this framework of Blackwell's algorithm. In the case where the target set is an orthant, we present a family of time-dependent inner products which yields different convergence speeds for each coordinate of the average outcome. We apply this framework to absorbing games (an important class of stochastic games) for which we construct $\varepsilon$-uniformly optimal strategies using Blackwell's algorithm in a well-chosen auxiliary approachability problem, thereby giving a novel illustration of the relevance of online learning tools for solving games.</p></details> |  |
| **[Benchmarking Counterfactual Interpretability in Deep Learning Models for Time Series Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12666v1)** | 2024-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The popularity of deep learning methods in the time series domain boosts interest in interpretability studies, including counterfactual (CF) methods. CF methods identify minimal changes in instances to alter the model predictions. Despite extensive research, no existing work benchmarks CF methods in the time series domain. Additionally, the results reported in the literature are inconclusive due to the limited number of datasets and inadequate metrics. In this work, we redesign quantitative metrics to accurately capture desirable characteristics in CFs. We specifically redesign the metrics for sparsity and plausibility and introduce a new metric for consistency. Combined with validity, generation time, and proximity, we form a comprehensive metric set. We systematically benchmark 6 different CF methods on 20 univariate datasets and 10 multivariate datasets with 3 different classifiers. Results indicate that the performance of CF methods varies across metrics and among different models. Finally, we provide case studies and a guideline for practical usage.</p></details> | 15 pages, 27 figures |
| **[SST: Multi-Scale Hybrid Mamba-Transformer Experts for Long-Short Range Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14757v2)** | 2024-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite significant progress in time series forecasting, existing forecasters often overlook the heterogeneity between long-range and short-range time series, leading to performance degradation in practical applications. In this work, we highlight the need of distinct objectives tailored to different ranges. We point out that time series can be decomposed into global patterns and local variations, which should be addressed separately in long- and short-range time series. To meet the objectives, we propose a multi-scale hybrid Mamba-Transformer experts model State Space Transformer (SST). SST leverages Mamba as an expert to extract global patterns in coarse-grained long-range time series, and Local Window Transformer (LWT), the other expert to focus on capturing local variations in fine-grained short-range time series. With an input-dependent mechanism, State Space Model (SSM)-based Mamba is able to selectively retain long-term patterns and filter out fluctuations, while LWT employs a local window to enhance locality-awareness capability, thus effectively capturing local variations. To adaptively integrate the global patterns and local variations, a long-short router dynamically adjusts contributions of the two experts. SST achieves superior performance with scaling linearly $O(L)$ on time series length $L$. The comprehensive experiments demonstrate the SST can achieve SOTA results in long-short range time series forecasting while maintaining low memory footprint and computational cost. The code of SST is available at https://github.com/XiongxiaoXu/SST.</p></details> |  |

Our method is founded on the observation that attention difference in the diffusion process exhibits a U-shaped pattern, indicating significant redundancy. We mitigate this by broadcasting attention outputs to subsequent steps in a pyramid style. It applies different broadcast strategies to each attention based on their variance for best efficiency. We further introduce broadcast sequence parallel for more efficient distributed inference. PAB demonstrates superior results across three models compared to baselines, achieving real-time generation for up to 720p videos. We anticipate that our simple yet effective method will serve as a robust baseline and facilitate future research and application for video generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Time arrow without past hypothesis: a toy model explanation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07121v2)** | 2024-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The laws of Physics are time-reversible, making no qualitative distinction between the past and the future -- yet we can only go towards the future. This apparent contradiction is known as the "arrow of time problem". Its current resolution states that the future is the direction of increasing entropy. But entropy can only increase towards the future if it was low in the past, and past low entropy is a very strong assumption to make, because low entropy states are rather improbable, non-generic. Recent works from the Physics literature suggest, however, we may do away with this so-called "past hypothesis", in the presence of reversible dynamical laws featuring expansion. We prove that this can be the case in principle, within a toy model. It consists in graphs upon which particles circulate and interact according to local reversible rules. Some rules locally shrink or expand the graph. We prove that almost all states expand; entropy always increases as a consequence of expansion -- thereby providing a local explanation for the rise of an entropic arrow of time without the need for a past hypothesis. The discrete setting of this toy model allows us to deploy the full rigour of theoretical Computer Science proof techniques. It also allows for the numerical exploration of several physically-motivated variants: a time-symmetric variant; two inflationary variants; and a damping variant -- which slows down thermal death. The fact that all of these models exhibit similar behaviours suggests that local reversible expansion mechanisms constitute a robust recipe for a time arrow without past hypothesis. In this qualitative sense, the explanation may therefore also be relevant at the cosmological level.</p></details> | 21 pages, 19 figures |

Despite their wide application, existing post-processing methods that rely on deep learning models for event recognition in DVS systems face challenges with real-time processing of large sample data volumes, particularly in long-distance applications. To address this issue, we propose to use a four-layer convolutional neural network (CNN) with ResNet as the teacher model for knowledge distillation. This results in a significant improvement in accuracy, from 83.41% to 95.39%, on data from previously untrained environments. Additionally, we propose a novel hardware design based on field-programmable gate arrays (FPGA) to further accelerate model inference. This design replaces multiplication with binary shift operations and quantizes model weights, enabling high parallelism and low latency. Our implementation achieves an inference time of 0.083 ms for a spatial-temporal sample covering a 12.5 m fiber length and 0.256 s time frame. This performance enables real-time signal processing over approximately 38.55 km of fiber, about $2.14\times$ the capability of an Nvidia GTX 4090 GPU. The proposed method greatly enhances the efficiency of vibration pattern recognition, promoting the use of DVS as a smart IoT system.

The proposed approach surpasses previous methods based on recurrent layers by employing a Selective State Space block to encode the input audio. It features a refined technique integrating Feature-wise Linear Modulation and Gated Linear Units to adjust the network dynamically, conditioning the compression's attack and release phases according to external parameters. The proposed architecture is well-suited for low-latency and real-time applications, crucial in live audio processing. The method has been validated on the analog optical compressors TubeTech CL 1B and Teletronix LA-2A, which possess distinct characteristics. Evaluation is performed using quantitative metrics and subjective listening tests, comparing the proposed method with other state-of-the-art models. Results show that our black-box modeling methods outperform all others, achieving accurate emulation of the compression process for both seen and unseen settings during training. We further show a correlation between this accuracy and the sampling density of the control parameters in the dataset and identify settings with fast attack and slow release as the most challenging to emulate.</p></details> |  |

Each component of MSSMs is associated with each cluster. An advantage of the proposed method is that it enables the use of time series models appropriate to the specific time series. This not only improves clustering and prediction accuracy but also enhances the interpretability of the estimated parameters. The parameters of the MSSMs are estimated using stochastic variational inference, a subtype of variational inference. The proposed method estimates the latent variables of an arbitrary state space model by using neural networks with a normalizing flow as a variational estimator. The number of clusters can be estimated using the Bayesian information criterion. In addition, to prevent MSSMs from converging to the local optimum, we propose several optimization tricks, including an additional penalty term called entropy annealing. To our best knowledge, the proposed method is the first computationally feasible one for time series clustering based on general (possibly nonlinear, non-Gaussian) state space models. Experiments on simulated datasets show that the proposed method is effective for clustering, parameter estimation, and estimating the number of clusters.</p></details> | 23 pages, 4 figures |

Multi-instance TLP is a scalable variant of TLP that enables a server to efficiently find solutions to different puzzles provided by a client at once. Nevertheless, existing multi-instance TLPs lack support for (verifiable) homomorphic computation. To address this limitation, we introduce the "Multi-Instance partially Homomorphic TLP" (MH-TLP), a multi-instance TLP supporting efficient verifiable homomorphic linear combinations of puzzles belonging to a client. It ensures anyone can verify the correctness of computations and solutions. Building on MH-TLP, we further propose the "Multi-instance Multi-client verifiable partially Homomorphic TLP" (MMH-TLP). It not only supports all the features of MH-TLP but also allows for verifiable homomorphic linear combinations of puzzles from different clients. Our schemes refrain from using asymmetric-key cryptography for verification and, unlike most homomorphic TLPs, do not require a trusted third party. A comprehensive cost analysis demonstrates that our schemes scale linearly with the number of clients and puzzles.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2406.15070</p></details> |

Graph forecasting networks(GFNs) are well-suited for forecasting MTS data that exhibit spatio-temporal dependencies. However, most prior works of GFN-based methods on MTS forecasting rely on domain-expertise to model the nonlinear dynamics of the system, but neglect the potential to leverage the inherent relational-structural dependencies among time series variables underlying MTS data. On the other hand, contemporary works attempt to infer the relational structure of the complex dependencies between the variables and simultaneously learn the nonlinear dynamics of the interconnected system but neglect the possibility of incorporating domain-specific prior knowledge to improve forecast accuracy. To this end, we propose a hybrid architecture that combines explicit prior knowledge with implicit knowledge of the relational structure within the MTS data. It jointly learns intra-series temporal dependencies and inter-series spatial dependencies by encoding time-conditioned structural spatio-temporal inductive biases to provide more accurate and reliable forecasts. It also models the time-varying uncertainty of the multi-horizon forecasts to support decision-making by providing estimates of prediction uncertainty. The proposed architecture has shown promising results on multiple benchmark datasets and outperforms state-of-the-art forecasting methods by a significant margin. We report and discuss the ablation studies to validate our forecasting architecture.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper accepted at ML4IoT Workshop, International Conference on Learning Representations(ICLR) 2023</p></details> |

OFO does not need an accurate grid topology nor estimated consumption of non-controllable loads, affords fast calculations, and demonstrates robustness to uncertainties due to its feedback-based nature. These characteristics render it particularly suitable for real-time distribution system applications. However, many OFO controllers require centralized communication, which lack robustness to single-point failures. This paper proposes a distributed OFO design based on a nested feedback optimization strategy and analyzes its convergence. Numerical results reveal that the proposed design achieves satisfactory voltage regulation and outperforms other distributed approaches.</p></details> |  |

Existing efforts generally focus on optimizing model parameters or editing semantic representations, which compromise the internal factual knowledge of target LLMs. In addition, hallucinations typically exhibit multifaceted patterns in downstream tasks, limiting the model's holistic performance across tasks. In this paper, we propose a Comparator-driven Decoding-Time (CDT) framework to alleviate the response hallucination. Firstly, we construct hallucinatory and truthful comparators with multi-task fine-tuning samples. In this case, we present an instruction prototype-guided mixture of experts strategy to enhance the ability of the corresponding comparators to capture different hallucination or truthfulness patterns in distinct task instructions. CDT constrains next-token predictions to factuality-robust distributions by contrasting the logit differences between the target LLMs and these comparators. Systematic experiments on multiple downstream tasks show that our framework can significantly improve the model performance and response factuality.</p></details> | <details><summary>Hallu...</summary><p>Hallucination Mitigation in LLMs</p></details> |

These resource managers require resource estimates for each workflow task to be executed on one of the cluster nodes. However, task resource consumption varies significantly between different tasks and for the same task with different inputs. Furthermore, resource consumption also fluctuates during a task's execution. As a result, manually configuring static memory allocations is error-prone, often leading users to overestimate memory usage to avoid costly failures from under-provisioning, which results in significant memory wastage. We propose KS+, a method that predicts a task's memory consumption over time depending on its inputs. For this, KS+ dynamically segments the task execution and predicts the memory required for each segment. Our experimental evaluation shows an average reduction in memory wastage of 38% compared to the best-performing state-of-the-art baseline for two real-world workflows from the popular nf-core repository.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper accepted in 2024 IEEE ReWorDS, eScience</p></details> |

| **[Temporal Ensemble Logic](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14443v1)** | 2024-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Temporal Ensemble Logic (TEL), a monadic, first-order modal logic for linear-time temporal reasoning. TEL includes primitive temporal constructs such as ``always up to $t$ time later'' ($\Box_t$), ``sometimes before $t$ time in the future'' ($\Diamond_t$), and ``$t$-time later'' $\varphi_t$. TEL has been motivated from the requirement for rigor and reproducibility for cohort specification and discovery in clinical and population health research, to fill a gap in formalizing temporal reasoning in biomedicine. In this paper, we first introduce TEL in a general set up, with discrete and dense time as special cases. We then focus on the theoretical development of discrete TEL on the temporal domain of positive integers $\mathbb{N}^+$, denoted as ${\rm TEL}_{\mathbb{N}^+}$. ${\rm TEL}_{\mathbb{N}^+}$ is strictly more expressive than the standard monadic second order logic, characterized by B\"{u}chi automata. We present its formal semantics, a proof system, and provide a proof for the undecidability of the satisfiability of ${\rm TEL}_{\mathbb{N}^+}$. We also discuss expressiveness and decidability fragments for ${\rm TEL}_{\mathbb{N}^+}$, followed by illustrative applications.</p></details> | 47 pages, 2 figures |

However, existing methods are limited by their ability to handle large, complex datasets. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a hybrid approach that combines the strengths of open-source large and small-scale language models (LLMs and LMs) with traditional forecasting methods. We augment traditional methods with dynamic prompting and a grouped-query, multi-head attention mechanism to more effectively capture both intra-series and inter-series dependencies in evolving nonlinear time series data. In addition, we facilitate on-premises customization by fine-tuning smaller open-source LMs for time series trend analysis utilizing descriptions generated by open-source large LMs on consumer-grade hardware using Low-Rank Adaptation with Activation Memory Reduction (LoRA-AMR) technique to reduce computational overhead and activation storage memory demands while preserving inference latency. We combine language model processing for time series trend analysis with traditional time series representation learning method for cross-modal integration, achieving robust and accurate forecasts. The framework effectiveness is demonstrated through extensive experiments on various real-world datasets, outperforming existing methods by significant margins in terms of forecast accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper published at the Deployable AI (DAI) workshop at AAAI-2024</p></details> |
| **[Cascaded Temporal Updating Network for Efficient Video Super-Resolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14244v1)** | 2024-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing video super-resolution (VSR) methods generally adopt a recurrent propagation network to extract spatio-temporal information from the entire video sequences, exhibiting impressive performance. However, the key components in recurrent-based VSR networks significantly impact model efficiency, e.g., the alignment module occupies a substantial portion of model parameters, while the bidirectional propagation mechanism significantly amplifies the inference time. Consequently, developing a compact and efficient VSR method that can be deployed on resource-constrained devices, e.g., smartphones, remains challenging. To this end, we propose a cascaded temporal updating network (CTUN) for efficient VSR. We first develop an implicit cascaded alignment module to explore spatio-temporal correspondences from adjacent frames. Moreover, we propose a unidirectional propagation updating network to efficiently explore long-range temporal information, which is crucial for high-quality video reconstruction. Specifically, we develop a simple yet effective hidden updater that can leverage future information to update hidden features during forward propagation, significantly reducing inference time while maintaining performance. Finally, we formulate all of these components into an end-to-end trainable VSR network. Extensive experimental results show that our CTUN achieves a favorable trade-off between efficiency and performance compared to existing methods. Notably, compared with BasicVSR, our method obtains better results while employing only about 30% of the parameters and running time. The source code and pre-trained models will be available at https://github.com/House-Leo/CTUN.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website: https://github.com/House-Leo/CTUN</p></details> |

Yet, in few scenarios, its lack of visual details compared to daytime visible images, poses a significant challenge for human and machine interpretation. This paper proposes a novel diffusion method, dubbed Temporally Consistent Patch Diffusion Models (TC-DPM), for infrared-to-visible video translation. Our method, extending the Patch Diffusion Model, consists of two key components. Firstly, we propose a semantic-guided denoising, leveraging the strong representations of foundational models. As such, our method faithfully preserves the semantic structure of generated visible images. Secondly, we propose a novel temporal blending module to guide the denoising trajectory, ensuring the temporal consistency between consecutive frames. Experiment shows that TC-PDM outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 35.3% in FVD for infrared-to-visible video translation and by 6.1% in AP50 for day-to-night object detection.

The recency heuristic is one of the key assumptions made by TD($\lambda$), which reinforces recent experiences according to an exponentially decaying weighting. In fact, all other widely used return estimators for TD learning, such as $n$-step returns, satisfy a weaker (i.e., non-monotonic) recency heuristic. Why is the recency heuristic effective for temporal credit assignment? What happens when credit is assigned in a way that violates this heuristic? In this paper, we analyze the specific mathematical implications of adopting the recency heuristic in TD learning. We prove that any return estimator satisfying this heuristic: 1) is guaranteed to converge to the correct value function, 2) has a relatively fast contraction rate, and 3) has a long window of effective credit assignment, yet bounded worst-case variance. We also give a counterexample where on-policy, tabular TD methods violating the recency heuristic diverge. Our results offer some of the first theoretical evidence that credit assignment based on the recency heuristic facilitates learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>RLC 2...</summary><p>RLC 2024. 18 pages, 8 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

| **[Bengali Sign Language Recognition through Hand Pose Estimation using Multi-Branch Spatial-Temporal Attention Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14111v1)** | 2024-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hand gesture-based sign language recognition (SLR) is one of the most advanced applications of machine learning, and computer vision uses hand gestures. Although, in the past few years, many researchers have widely explored and studied how to address BSL problems, specific unaddressed issues remain, such as skeleton and transformer-based BSL recognition. In addition, the lack of evaluation of the BSL model in various concealed environmental conditions can prove the generalized property of the existing model by facing daily life signs. As a consequence, existing BSL recognition systems provide a limited perspective of their generalisation ability as they are tested on datasets containing few BSL alphabets that have a wide disparity in gestures and are easy to differentiate. To overcome these limitations, we propose a spatial-temporal attention-based BSL recognition model considering hand joint skeletons extracted from the sequence of images. The main aim of utilising hand skeleton-based BSL data is to ensure the privacy and low-resolution sequence of images, which need minimum computational cost and low hardware configurations. Our model captures discriminative structural displacements and short-range dependency based on unified joint features projected onto high-dimensional feature space. Specifically, the use of Separable TCN combined with a powerful multi-head spatial-temporal attention architecture generated high-performance accuracy. The extensive experiments with a proposed dataset and two benchmark BSL datasets with a wide range of evaluations, such as intra- and inter-dataset evaluation settings, demonstrated that our proposed models achieve competitive performance with extremely low computational complexity and run faster than existing models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Network Level Spatial Temporal Traffic State Forecasting with Hierarchical Attention LSTM (HierAttnLSTM)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.05760v4)** | 2024-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic state data, such as speed, volume and travel time collected from ubiquitous traffic monitoring sensors require advanced network level analytics for forecasting and identifying significant traffic patterns. This paper leverages diverse traffic state datasets from the Caltrans Performance Measurement System (PeMS) hosted on the open benchmark and achieved promising performance compared to well recognized spatial-temporal models. Drawing inspiration from the success of hierarchical architectures in various Artificial Intelligence (AI) tasks, we integrate cell and hidden states from low-level to high-level Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks with an attention pooling mechanism, similar to human perception systems. The developed hierarchical structure is designed to account for dependencies across different time scales, capturing the spatial-temporal correlations of network-level traffic states, enabling the prediction of traffic states for all corridors rather than a single link or route. The efficiency of designed attention-based LSTM is analyzed by ablation study. Comparative results with baseline LSTM models demonstrate that the Hierarchical Attention LSTM (HierAttnLSTM) model not only provides higher prediction accuracy but also effectively forecasts unusual congestion patterns. Data and code are made publicly available to support reproducible scientific research.</p></details> |  |
| **[LaneTCA: Enhancing Video Lane Detection with Temporal Context Aggregation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13852v1)** | 2024-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In video lane detection, there are rich temporal contexts among successive frames, which is under-explored in existing lane detectors. In this work, we propose LaneTCA to bridge the individual video frames and explore how to effectively aggregate the temporal context. Technically, we develop an accumulative attention module and an adjacent attention module to abstract the long-term and short-term temporal context, respectively. The accumulative attention module continuously accumulates visual information during the journey of a vehicle, while the adjacent attention module propagates this lane information from the previous frame to the current frame. The two modules are meticulously designed based on the transformer architecture. Finally, these long-short context features are fused with the current frame features to predict the lane lines in the current frame. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments are conducted on two prevalent benchmark datasets. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, achieving several new state-of-the-art records. The codes and models are available at https://github.com/Alex-1337/LaneTCA</p></details> |  |
| **[Navigating Spatio-Temporal Heterogeneity: A Graph Transformer Approach for Traffic Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10822v2)** | 2024-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic forecasting has emerged as a crucial research area in the development of smart cities. Although various neural networks with intricate architectures have been developed to address this problem, they still face two key challenges: i) Recent advancements in network designs for modeling spatio-temporal correlations are starting to see diminishing returns in performance enhancements. ii) Additionally, most models do not account for the spatio-temporal heterogeneity inherent in traffic data, i.e., traffic distribution varies significantly across different regions and traffic flow patterns fluctuate across various time slots. To tackle these challenges, we introduce the Spatio-Temporal Graph Transformer (STGormer), which effectively integrates attribute and structure information inherent in traffic data for learning spatio-temporal correlations, and a mixture-of-experts module for capturing heterogeneity along spaital and temporal axes. Specifically, we design two straightforward yet effective spatial encoding methods based on the graph structure and integrate time position encoding into the vanilla transformer to capture spatio-temporal traffic patterns. Additionally, a mixture-of-experts enhanced feedforward neural network (FNN) module adaptively assigns suitable expert layers to distinct patterns via a spatio-temporal gating network, further improving overall prediction accuracy. Experiments on real-world traffic datasets demonstrate that STGormer achieves state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[DTCLMapper: Dual Temporal Consistent Learning for Vectorized HD Map Construction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05518v2)** | 2024-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal information plays a pivotal role in Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) driving scene understanding, which can alleviate the visual information sparsity. However, the indiscriminate temporal fusion method will cause the barrier of feature redundancy when constructing vectorized High-Definition (HD) maps. In this paper, we revisit the temporal fusion of vectorized HD maps, focusing on temporal instance consistency and temporal map consistency learning. To improve the representation of instances in single-frame maps, we introduce a novel method, DTCLMapper. This approach uses a dual-stream temporal consistency learning module that combines instance embedding with geometry maps. In the instance embedding component, our approach integrates temporal Instance Consistency Learning (ICL), ensuring consistency from vector points and instance features aggregated from points. A vectorized points pre-selection module is employed to enhance the regression efficiency of vector points from each instance. Then aggregated instance features obtained from the vectorized points preselection module are grounded in contrastive learning to realize temporal consistency, where positive and negative samples are selected based on position and semantic information. The geometry mapping component introduces Map Consistency Learning (MCL) designed with self-supervised learning. The MCL enhances the generalization capability of our consistent learning approach by concentrating on the global location and distribution constraints of the instances. Extensive experiments on well-recognized benchmarks indicate that the proposed DTCLMapper achieves state-of-the-art performance in vectorized mapping tasks, reaching 61.9% and 65.1% mAP scores on the nuScenes and Argoverse datasets, respectively.

| **[Towards Completeness: A Generalizable Action Proposal Generator for Zero-Shot Temporal Action Localization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13777v1)** | 2024-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To address the zero-shot temporal action localization (ZSTAL) task, existing works develop models that are generalizable to detect and classify actions from unseen categories. They typically develop a category-agnostic action detector and combine it with the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) model to solve ZSTAL. However, these methods suffer from incomplete action proposals generated for \textit{unseen} categories, since they follow a frame-level prediction paradigm and require hand-crafted post-processing to generate action proposals. To address this problem, in this work, we propose a novel model named Generalizable Action Proposal generator (GAP), which can interface seamlessly with CLIP and generate action proposals in a holistic way. Our GAP is built in a query-based architecture and trained with a proposal-level objective, enabling it to estimate proposal completeness and eliminate the hand-crafted post-processing. Based on this architecture, we propose an Action-aware Discrimination loss to enhance the category-agnostic dynamic information of actions. Besides, we introduce a Static-Dynamic Rectifying module that incorporates the generalizable static information from CLIP to refine the predicted proposals, which improves proposal completeness in a generalizable manner. Our experiments show that our GAP achieves state-of-the-art performance on two challenging ZSTAL benchmarks, i.e., Thumos14 and ActivityNet1.3. Specifically, our model obtains significant performance improvement over previous works on the two benchmarks, i.e., +3.2% and +3.4% average mAP, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICPR 2024.

| **[FMI-TAL: Few-shot Multiple Instances Temporal Action Localization by Probability Distribution Learning and Interval Cluster Refinement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13765v1)** | 2024-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The present few-shot temporal action localization model can't handle the situation where videos contain multiple action instances. So the purpose of this paper is to achieve manifold action instances localization in a lengthy untrimmed query video using limited trimmed support videos. To address this challenging problem effectively, we proposed a novel solution involving a spatial-channel relation transformer with probability learning and cluster refinement. This method can accurately identify the start and end boundaries of actions in the query video, utilizing only a limited number of labeled videos. Our proposed method is adept at capturing both temporal and spatial contexts to effectively classify and precisely locate actions in videos, enabling a more comprehensive utilization of these crucial details. The selective cosine penalization algorithm is designed to suppress temporal boundaries that do not include action scene switches. The probability learning combined with the label generation algorithm alleviates the problem of action duration diversity and enhances the model's ability to handle fuzzy action boundaries. The interval cluster can help us get the final results with multiple instances situations in few-shot temporal action localization. Our model achieves competitive performance through meticulous experimentation utilizing the benchmark datasets ActivityNet1.3 and THUMOS14. Our code is readily available at https://github.com/ycwfs/FMI-TAL.</p></details> | 9 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Temporal Divide-and-Conquer Anomaly Actions Localization in Semi-Supervised Videos with Hierarchical Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13643v1)** | 2024-08-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Anomaly action detection and localization play an essential role in security and advanced surveillance systems. However, due to the tremendous amount of surveillance videos, most of the available data for the task is unlabeled or semi-labeled with the video class known, but the location of the anomaly event is unknown. In this work, we target anomaly localization in semi-supervised videos. While the mainstream direction in addressing this task is focused on segment-level multi-instance learning and the generation of pseudo labels, we aim to explore a promising yet unfulfilled direction to solve the problem by learning the temporal relations within videos in order to locate anomaly events. To this end, we propose a hierarchical transformer model designed to evaluate the significance of observed actions in anomalous videos with a divide-and-conquer strategy along the temporal axis. Our approach segments a parent video hierarchically into multiple temporal children instances and measures the influence of the children nodes in classifying the abnormality of the parent video. Evaluating our model on two well-known anomaly detection datasets, UCF-crime and ShanghaiTech, proves its ability to interpret the observed actions within videos and localize the anomalous ones. Our proposed approach outperforms previous works relying on segment-level multiple-instance learning approaches while reaching a promising performance compared to the more recent pseudo-labeling-based approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 27th International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR-2024)</p></details> |

Such 3D information is beneficial for analyzing the bird's behavior and physiological shape, for example by tracking motion, shape, and appearance changes. From a computer vision perspective birds are especially challenging due to their rapid and oftentimes non-rigid motions. We propose an approach to reconstruct the 3D pose and shape from monocular videos of a specific breed of seabird - the common murre. Our approach comprises a full pipeline of detection, tracking, segmentation, and temporally consistent 3D reconstruction. Additionally, we propose a temporal loss that extends current single-image 3D bird pose estimators to the temporal domain. Moreover, we provide a real-world dataset of 10000 frames of video observations on average capture nine birds simultaneously, comprising a large variety of motions and interactions, including a smaller test set with bird-specific keypoint labels. Using our temporal optimization, we achieve state-of-the-art performance for the challenging sequences in our dataset.</p></details> |  |

| **[Long-Term Pre-training for Temporal Action Detection with Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13152v1)** | 2024-08-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal action detection (TAD) is challenging, yet fundamental for real-world video applications. Recently, DETR-based models for TAD have been prevailing thanks to their unique benefits. However, transformers demand a huge dataset, and unfortunately data scarcity in TAD causes a severe degeneration. In this paper, we identify two crucial problems from data scarcity: attention collapse and imbalanced performance. To this end, we propose a new pre-training strategy, Long-Term Pre-training (LTP), tailored for transformers. LTP has two main components: 1) class-wise synthesis, 2) long-term pretext tasks. Firstly, we synthesize long-form video features by merging video snippets of a target class and non-target classes. They are analogous to untrimmed data used in TAD, despite being created from trimmed data. In addition, we devise two types of long-term pretext tasks to learn long-term dependency. They impose long-term conditions such as finding second-to-fourth or short-duration actions. Our extensive experiments show state-of-the-art performances in DETR-based methods on ActivityNet-v1.3 and THUMOS14 by a large margin. Moreover, we demonstrate that LTP significantly relieves the data scarcity issues in TAD.</p></details> |  |
| **[Causally-Aware Spatio-Temporal Multi-Graph Convolution Network for Accurate and Reliable Traffic Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13293v1)** | 2024-08-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate and reliable prediction has profound implications to a wide range of applications. In this study, we focus on an instance of spatio-temporal learning problem--traffic prediction--to demonstrate an advanced deep learning model developed for making accurate and reliable forecast. Despite the significant progress in traffic prediction, limited studies have incorporated both explicit and implicit traffic patterns simultaneously to improve prediction performance. Meanwhile, the variability nature of traffic states necessitates quantifying the uncertainty of model predictions in a statistically principled way; however, extant studies offer no provable guarantee on the statistical validity of confidence intervals in reflecting its actual likelihood of containing the ground truth. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end traffic prediction framework that leverages three primary components to generate accurate and reliable traffic predictions: dynamic causal structure learning for discovering implicit traffic patterns from massive traffic data, causally-aware spatio-temporal multi-graph convolution network (CASTMGCN) for learning spatio-temporal dependencies, and conformal prediction for uncertainty quantification. CASTMGCN fuses several graphs that characterize different important aspects of traffic networks and an auxiliary graph that captures the effect of exogenous factors on the road network. On this basis, a conformal prediction approach tailored to spatio-temporal data is further developed for quantifying the uncertainty in node-wise traffic predictions over varying prediction horizons. Experimental results on two real-world traffic datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms several state-of-the-art models in prediction accuracy; moreover, it generates more efficient prediction regions than other methods while strictly satisfying the statistical validity in coverage.</p></details> |  |

In this study, we introduce functional spatiotemporal Mamba (FST-Mamba), a Mamba-based model designed for discovering neurological biomarkers using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We focus on dynamic functional network connectivity (dFNC) derived from fMRI and propose a hierarchical spatiotemporal Mamba-based network that processes spatial and temporal information separately using Mamba-based encoders. Leveraging the topological uniqueness of the FNC matrix, we introduce a component-wise varied-scale aggregation (CVA) mechanism to aggregate connectivity across individual components within brain networks, enabling the model to capture both inter-component and inter-network information. To better handle the FNC data, we develop a new component-specific scanning order. Additionally, we propose symmetric rotary position encoding (SymRope) to encode the relative positions of each functional connection while considering the symmetric nature of the FNC matrix. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in the proposed FST-Mamba model on various brain-based classification and regression tasks. Our work reveals the substantial potential of attention-free sequence modeling in brain discovery.</p></details> |  |

However, the existing road-level traffic prediction has mainly studied how significantly micro traffic events propagate to the adjacent roads in terms of short-term prediction. On the other hand, recent attempts have been made to incorporate regional knowledge such as POIs, road characteristics, and real-time social events to help traffic prediction. However, these studies lack in understandings of different modalities of road-level and region-level spatio-temporal correlations and how to combine such knowledge. This paper proposes a novel method that embeds real-time region-level knowledge using POIs, satellite images, and real-time LTE access traces via a regional spatio-temporal module that consists of dynamic convolution and temporal attention, and conducts bipartite spatial transform attention to convert into road-level knowledge. Then the model ingests this embedded knowledge into a road-level attention-based prediction model. Experimental results on real-world road traffic prediction show that our model outperforms the baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Context-Aware Temporal Embedding of Objects in Video Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12789v1)** | 2024-08-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In video analysis, understanding the temporal context is crucial for recognizing object interactions, event patterns, and contextual changes over time. The proposed model leverages adjacency and semantic similarities between objects from neighboring video frames to construct context-aware temporal object embeddings. Unlike traditional methods that rely solely on visual appearance, our temporal embedding model considers the contextual relationships between objects, creating a meaningful embedding space where temporally connected object's vectors are positioned in proximity. Empirical studies demonstrate that our context-aware temporal embeddings can be used in conjunction with conventional visual embeddings to enhance the effectiveness of downstream applications. Moreover, the embeddings can be used to narrate a video using a Large Language Model (LLM). This paper describes the intricate details of the proposed objective function to generate context-aware temporal object embeddings for video data and showcases the potential applications of the generated embeddings in video analysis and object classification tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Contrastive Representation Learning for Dynamic Link Prediction in Temporal Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12753v1)** | 2024-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Evolving networks are complex data structures that emerge in a wide range of systems in science and engineering. Learning expressive representations for such networks that encode their structural connectivity and temporal evolution is essential for downstream data analytics and machine learning applications. In this study, we introduce a self-supervised method for learning representations of temporal networks and employ these representations in the dynamic link prediction task. While temporal networks are typically characterized as a sequence of interactions over the continuous time domain, our study focuses on their discrete-time versions. This enables us to balance the trade-off between computational complexity and precise modeling of the interactions. We propose a recurrent message-passing neural network architecture for modeling the information flow over time-respecting paths of temporal networks. The key feature of our method is the contrastive training objective of the model, which is a combination of three loss functions: link prediction, graph reconstruction, and contrastive predictive coding losses. The contrastive predictive coding objective is implemented using infoNCE losses at both local and global scales of the input graphs. We empirically show that the additional self-supervised losses enhance the training and improve the model's performance in the dynamic link prediction task. The proposed method is tested on Enron, COLAB, and Facebook datasets and exhibits superior results compared to existing models.</p></details> | 16 pages, 6 figures |

However, limited communication bandwidth, localization errors and asynchronized capturing time of sensor data, all introduce difficulties to the data fusion of different agents. To some extend, previous works have attempted to reduce the shared data size, mitigate the spatial feature misalignment caused by localization errors and communication delay. However, none of them have considered the asynchronized sensor ticking times, which can lead to dynamic object misplacement of more than one meter during data fusion. In this work, we propose Time-Aligned COoperative Object Detection (TA-COOD), for which we adapt widely used dataset OPV2V and DairV2X with considering asynchronous LiDAR sensor ticking times and build an efficient fully sparse framework with modeling the temporal information of individual objects with query-based techniques. The experiment results confirmed the superior efficiency of our fully sparse framework compared to the state-of-the-art dense models. More importantly, they show that the point-wise observation timestamps of the dynamic objects are crucial for accurate modeling the object temporal context and the predictability of their time-related locations.

Different from the existing fine-tuning approaches that capture temporal information by exploring the relationships among all the frames, our perceiver-based adapter recurrently captures the sequential dynamics alongside the timeline, which could perceive the order change. To obtain the discriminative representations for each class, we extend a textual corpus for each class derived from the large language models (LLMs) and enrich the visual prototypes by integrating the contextual semantic information. Besides, We introduce an unbalanced optimal transport strategy for feature matching that mitigates the impact of class-unrelated features, thereby facilitating more effective decision-making. Experimental results on five FSAR datasets demonstrate that our method set a new benchmark, beating the second-best competitors with large margins.</p></details> | 9 pages, 6 figures |
| **[The 2nd Solution for LSVOS Challenge RVOS Track: Spatial-temporal Refinement for Consistent Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12447v1)** | 2024-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Referring Video Object Segmentation (RVOS) is a challenging task due to its requirement for temporal understanding. Due to the obstacle of computational complexity, many state-of-the-art models are trained on short time intervals. During testing, while these models can effectively process information over short time steps, they struggle to maintain consistent perception over prolonged time sequences, leading to inconsistencies in the resulting semantic segmentation masks. To address this challenge, we take a step further in this work by leveraging the tracking capabilities of the newly introduced Segment Anything Model version 2 (SAM-v2) to enhance the temporal consistency of the referring object segmentation model. Our method achieved a score of 60.40 \mathcal{J\text{\&}F} on the test set of the MeViS dataset, placing 2nd place in the final ranking of the RVOS Track at the ECCV 2024 LSVOS Challenge.</p></details> |  |

First, the similar appearances of objects degrade ReID performance, a challenge that needs to be addressed by existing appearance-based ReID methods. Second, most ReID studies are performed in laboratory settings and do not consider real-world scenarios. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a novel ReID framework that leverages a spatial-temporal fusion network and causal identity matching (CIM). Our framework estimates camera network topology using a proposed adaptive Parzen window and combines appearance features with spatial-temporal cues within the fusion network. This approach has demonstrated outstanding performance across several datasets, including VeRi776, Vehicle-3I, and Market-1501, achieving up to 99.70% rank-1 accuracy and 95.5% mAP. Furthermore, the proposed CIM approach, which dynamically assigns gallery sets based on camera network topology, has further improved ReID accuracy and robustness in real-world settings, evidenced by a 94.95% mAP and a 95.19% F1 score on the Vehicle-3I dataset. The experimental results support the effectiveness of incorporating spatial-temporal information and CIM for real-world ReID scenarios, regardless of the data domain (e.g., vehicle, person).</p></details> |  |
| **[Computer-Aided Fall Recognition Using a Three-Stream Spatial-Temporal GCN Model with Adaptive Feature Aggregation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12211v1)** | 2024-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The prevention of falls is paramount in modern healthcare, particularly for the elderly, as falls can lead to severe injuries or even fatalities. Additionally, the growing incidence of falls among the elderly, coupled with the urgent need to prevent suicide attempts resulting from medication overdose, underscores the critical importance of accurate and efficient fall detection methods. In this scenario, a computer-aided fall detection system is inevitable to save elderly people's lives worldwide. Many researchers have been working to develop fall detection systems. However, the existing fall detection systems often struggle with issues such as unsatisfactory performance accuracy, limited robustness, high computational complexity, and sensitivity to environmental factors due to a lack of effective features. In response to these challenges, this paper proposes a novel three-stream spatial-temporal feature-based fall detection system. Our system incorporates joint skeleton-based spatial and temporal Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) features, joint motion-based spatial and temporal GCN features, and residual connections-based features. Each stream employs adaptive graph-based feature aggregation and consecutive separable convolutional neural networks (Sep-TCN), significantly reducing computational complexity and model parameters compared to prior systems. Experimental results across multiple datasets demonstrate the superior effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed system, with accuracies of 99.51\%, 99.15\%, 99.79\% and 99.85 \% achieved on the ImViA, UR-Fall, Fall-UP and FU-Kinect datasets, respectively. The remarkable performance of our system highlights its superiority, efficiency, and generalizability in real-world fall detection scenarios, offering significant advancements in healthcare and societal well-being.</p></details> |  |
| **[Geolocation Representation from Large Language Models are Generic Enhancers for Spatio-Temporal Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12116v1)** | 2024-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the geospatial domain, universal representation models are significantly less prevalent than their extensive use in natural language processing and computer vision. This discrepancy arises primarily from the high costs associated with the input of existing representation models, which often require street views and mobility data. To address this, we develop a novel, training-free method that leverages large language models (LLMs) and auxiliary map data from OpenStreetMap to derive geolocation representations (LLMGeovec). LLMGeovec can represent the geographic semantics of city, country, and global scales, which acts as a generic enhancer for spatio-temporal learning. Specifically, by direct feature concatenation, we introduce a simple yet effective paradigm for enhancing multiple spatio-temporal tasks including geographic prediction (GP), long-term time series forecasting (LTSF), and graph-based spatio-temporal forecasting (GSTF). LLMGeovec can seamlessly integrate into a wide spectrum of spatio-temporal learning models, providing immediate enhancements. Experimental results demonstrate that LLMGeovec achieves global coverage and significantly boosts the performance of leading GP, LTSF, and GSTF models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Temporal discontinuity trials and randomization: success rates versus design strength](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12098v1)** | 2024-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the following comparative effectiveness scenario. There are two treatments for a particular medical condition: a randomized experiment has demonstrated mediocre effectiveness for the first treatment, while a non-randomized study of the second treatment reports a much higher success rate. On what grounds might one justifiably prefer the second treatment over the first treatment, given only the information from those two studies, including design details? This situation occurs in reality and warrants study. We consider a particular example involving studies of treatments for Crohn's disease. In order to help resolve these cases of asymmetric evidence, we make three contributions and apply them to our example. First, we demonstrate the potential to improve success rates above those found in a randomized trial, given heterogeneous effects. Second, we prove that deliberate treatment assignment can be more efficient than randomization when study results are to be transported to formulate an intervention policy on a wider population. Third, we provide formal conditions under which a temporal-discontinuity design approximates a randomized trial, and we introduce a novel design parameter to inform researchers about the strength of that approximation. Overall, our results indicate that while randomization certainly provides special advantages, other study designs such as temporal-discontinuity designs also have distinct advantages, and can produce valuable evidence that informs treatment decisions and intervention policy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Controllability and Observability of Temporal Hypergraphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12085v1)** | 2024-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Numerous complex systems, such as those arisen in ecological networks, genomic contact networks, and social networks, exhibit higher-order and time-varying characteristics, which can be effectively modeled using temporal hypergraphs. However, analyzing and controlling temporal hypergraphs poses significant challenges due to their inherent time-varying and nonlinear nature, while most existing methods predominantly target static hypergraphs. In this article, we generalize the notions of controllability and observability to temporal hypergraphs by leveraging tensor and nonlinear systems theory. Specifically, we establish tensor-based rank conditions to determine the weak controllability and observability of temporal hypergraphs. The proposed framework is further demonstrated with synthetic and real-world examples.</p></details> | 6 pages, 3 figures |

This multifaceted challenge has recently gained attention within the deep learning domain, facilitated by the availability of extensive, long-term earthquake datasets. Despite significant advancements, existing literature on earthquake nowcasting lacks comprehensive evaluations of pre-trained foundation models and modern deep learning architectures. These architectures, such as transformers or graph neural networks, uniquely focus on different aspects of data, including spatial relationships, temporal patterns, and multi-scale dependencies. This paper addresses the mentioned gap by analyzing different architectures and introducing two innovation approaches called MultiFoundationQuake and GNNCoder. We formulate earthquake nowcasting as a time series forecasting problem for the next 14 days within 0.1-degree spatial bins in Southern California, spanning from 1986 to 2024. Earthquake time series is forecasted as a function of logarithm energy released by quakes. Our comprehensive evaluation employs several key performance metrics, notably Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency and Mean Squared Error, over time in each spatial region. The results demonstrate that our introduced models outperform other custom architectures by effectively capturing temporal-spatial relationships inherent in seismic data. The performance of existing foundation models varies significantly based on the pre-training datasets, emphasizing the need for careful dataset selection. However, we introduce a new general approach termed MultiFoundationPattern that combines a bespoke pattern with foundation model results handled as auxiliary streams. In the earthquake case, the resultant MultiFoundationQuake model achieves the best overall performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 8 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

Recent studies on automating this labor-intensive process through video-to-sound generation face significant challenges. Systems lacking explicit temporal features suffer from poor controllability and alignment, while timestamp-based models require costly and subjective human annotation. We propose Video-Foley, a video-to-sound system using Root Mean Square (RMS) as a temporal event condition with semantic timbre prompts (audio or text). RMS, a frame-level intensity envelope feature closely related to audio semantics, ensures high controllability and synchronization. The annotation-free self-supervised learning framework consists of two stages, Video2RMS and RMS2Sound, incorporating novel ideas including RMS discretization and RMS-ControlNet with a pretrained text-to-audio model. Our extensive evaluation shows that Video-Foley achieves state-of-the-art performance in audio-visual alignment and controllability for sound timing, intensity, timbre, and nuance. Code, model weights, and demonstrations are available on the accompanying website. (https://jnwnlee.github.io/video-foley-demo)</p></details> |  |
| **[SOAP: Enhancing Spatio-Temporal Relation and Motion Information Capturing for Few-Shot Action Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16344v3)** | 2024-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High frame-rate (HFR) videos of action recognition improve fine-grained expression while reducing the spatio-temporal relation and motion information density. Thus, large amounts of video samples are continuously required for traditional data-driven training. However, samples are not always sufficient in real-world scenarios, promoting few-shot action recognition (FSAR) research. We observe that most recent FSAR works build spatio-temporal relation of video samples via temporal alignment after spatial feature extraction, cutting apart spatial and temporal features within samples. They also capture motion information via narrow perspectives between adjacent frames without considering density, leading to insufficient motion information capturing. Therefore, we propose a novel plug-and-play architecture for FSAR called Spatio-tempOral frAme tuPle enhancer (SOAP) in this paper. The model we designed with such architecture refers to SOAP-Net. Temporal connections between different feature channels and spatio-temporal relation of features are considered instead of simple feature extraction. Comprehensive motion information is also captured, using frame tuples with multiple frames containing more motion information than adjacent frames. Combining frame tuples of diverse frame counts further provides a broader perspective. SOAP-Net achieves new state-of-the-art performance across well-known benchmarks such as SthSthV2, Kinetics, UCF101, and HMDB51. Extensive empirical evaluations underscore the competitiveness, pluggability, generalization, and robustness of SOAP.

| **[ST-USleepNet: A Spatial-Temporal Coupling Prominence Network for Multi-Channel Sleep Staging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11884v1)** | 2024-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sleep staging is critical for assessing sleep quality and diagnosing disorders. Recent advancements in artificial intelligence have driven the development of automated sleep staging models, which still face two significant challenges. 1) Simultaneously extracting prominent temporal and spatial sleep features from multi-channel raw signals, including characteristic sleep waveforms and salient spatial brain networks. 2) Capturing the spatial-temporal coupling patterns essential for accurate sleep staging. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework named ST-USleepNet, comprising a spatial-temporal graph construction module (ST) and a U-shaped sleep network (USleepNet). The ST module converts raw signals into a spatial-temporal graph to model spatial-temporal couplings. The USleepNet utilizes a U-shaped structure originally designed for image segmentation. Similar to how image segmentation isolates significant targets, when applied to both raw sleep signals and ST module-generated graph data, USleepNet segments these inputs to extract prominent temporal and spatial sleep features simultaneously. Testing on three datasets demonstrates that ST-USleepNet outperforms existing baselines, and model visualizations confirm its efficacy in extracting prominent sleep features and temporal-spatial coupling patterns across various sleep stages. The code is available at: https://github.com/Majy-Yuji/ST-USleepNet.git.</p></details> |  |
| **[Empowering LLMs with Pseudo-Untrimmed Videos for Audio-Visual Temporal Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16276v2)** | 2024-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in natural language and multimodal domains. By fine-tuning multimodal LLMs with temporal annotations from well-annotated datasets, e.g., dense video captioning datasets, their temporal understanding capacity in video-language tasks can be obtained. However, there is a notable lack of untrimmed audio-visual video datasets with precise temporal annotations for events. This deficiency hinders LLMs from learning the alignment between time, audio-visual events, and text tokens, thus impairing their ability to temporally localize audio-visual events in videos. To address this gap, we introduce PU-VALOR, a comprehensive audio-visual dataset comprising over 114,000 pseudo-untrimmed videos with detailed temporal annotations. PU-VALOR is derived from the large-scale but coarse-annotated audio-visual dataset VALOR, through a subtle method involving event-based video clustering, random temporal scaling, and permutation. By fine-tuning a multimodal LLM on PU-VALOR, we developed AVicuna, a model capable of aligning audio-visual events with temporal intervals and corresponding text tokens. AVicuna excels in temporal localization and time-aware dialogue capabilities. Our experiments demonstrate that AVicuna effectively handles temporal understanding in audio-visual videos and achieves state-of-the-art performance on open-ended video QA, audio-visual QA, and audio-visual event dense localization tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[V2Xum-LLM: Cross-Modal Video Summarization with Temporal Prompt Instruction Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12353v2)** | 2024-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video summarization aims to create short, accurate, and cohesive summaries of longer videos. Despite the existence of various video summarization datasets, a notable limitation is their limited amount of source videos, which hampers the effective training of advanced large vision-language models (VLMs). Additionally, most existing datasets are created for video-to-video summarization, overlooking the contemporary need for multimodal video content summarization. Recent efforts have been made to expand from unimodal to multimodal video summarization, categorizing the task into three sub-tasks based on the summary's modality: video-to-video (V2V), video-to-text (V2T), and a combination of video and text summarization (V2VT). However, the textual summaries in previous multimodal datasets are inadequate. To address these issues, we introduce Instruct-V2Xum, a cross-modal video summarization dataset featuring 30,000 diverse videos sourced from YouTube, with lengths ranging from 40 to 940 seconds and an average summarization ratio of 16.39%. Each video summary in Instruct-V2Xum is paired with a textual summary that references specific frame indexes, facilitating the generation of aligned video and textual summaries. In addition, we propose a new video summarization framework named V2Xum-LLM. V2Xum-LLM, specifically V2Xum-LLaMA in this study, is the first framework that unifies different video summarization tasks into one large language model's (LLM) text decoder and achieves task-controllable video summarization with temporal prompts and task instructions. Experiments show that V2Xum-LLaMA outperforms strong baseline models on multiple video summarization tasks. Furthermore, we propose an enhanced evaluation metric for V2V and V2VT summarization tasks.</p></details> |  |

Through activity-driven temporal networks, we formulate a general framework which models a wide range of adaptive behaviours and mitigation strategies, observed in real populations. We analytically derive the conditions for a widespread diffusion of epidemics in the presence of arbitrary adaptive behaviours, highlighting the crucial role of correlations between agents behaviour in the infected and in the susceptible state. We focus on the effects of sick-leave, comparing the effectiveness of different strategies in reducing the impact of the epidemic and preserving the system operativeness. We show the critical relevance of heterogeneity in individual behavior: in homogeneous networks, all sick-leave strategies are equivalent and poorly effective, while in heterogeneous networks, strategies targeting the most vulnerable nodes are able to effectively mitigate the epidemic, also avoiding a deterioration in system activity and maintaining a low level of absenteeism. Interestingly, with targeted strategies both the minimum of population activity and the maximum of absenteeism anticipate the infection peak, which is effectively flattened and delayed, so that full operativeness is almost restored when the infection peak arrives. We also provide realistic estimates of the model parameters for influenza-like illness, thereby suggesting strategies for managing epidemics and absenteeism in realistic populations.</p></details> | 16 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Exploiting Large Language Models Capabilities for Question Answer-Driven Knowledge Graph Completion Across Static and Temporal Domains](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10819v1)** | 2024-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge graph completion (KGC) aims to identify missing triples in a knowledge graph (KG). This is typically achieved through tasks such as link prediction and instance completion. However, these methods often focus on either static knowledge graphs (SKGs) or temporal knowledge graphs (TKGs), addressing only within-scope triples. This paper introduces a new generative completion framework called Generative Subgraph-based KGC (GS-KGC). GS-KGC employs a question-answering format to directly generate target entities, addressing the challenge of questions having multiple possible answers. We propose a strategy that extracts subgraphs centered on entities and relationships within the KG, from which negative samples and neighborhood information are separately obtained to address the one-to-many problem. Our method generates negative samples using known facts to facilitate the discovery of new information. Furthermore, we collect and refine neighborhood path data of known entities, providing contextual information to enhance reasoning in large language models (LLMs). Our experiments evaluated the proposed method on four SKGs and two TKGs, achieving state-of-the-art Hits@1 metrics on five datasets. Analysis of the results shows that GS-KGC can discover new triples within existing KGs and generate new facts beyond the closed KG, effectively bridging the gap between closed-world and open-world KGC.</p></details> |  |
| **[TDS-CLIP: Temporal Difference Side Network for Image-to-Video Transfer Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10688v1)** | 2024-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, large-scale pre-trained vision-language models (e.g., CLIP), have garnered significant attention thanks to their powerful representative capabilities. This inspires researchers in transferring the knowledge from these large pre-trained models to other task-specific models, e.g., Video Action Recognition (VAR) models, via particularly leveraging side networks to enhance the efficiency of parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT). However, current transferring approaches in VAR tend to directly transfer the frozen knowledge from large pre-trained models to action recognition networks with minimal cost, instead of exploiting the temporal modeling capabilities of the action recognition models themselves. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a memory-efficient Temporal Difference Side Network (TDS-CLIP) to balance knowledge transferring and temporal modeling, avoiding backpropagation in frozen parameter models. Specifically, we introduce a Temporal Difference Adapter (TD-Adapter), which can effectively capture local temporal differences in motion features to strengthen the model's global temporal modeling capabilities. Furthermore, we designed a Side Motion Enhancement Adapter (SME-Adapter) to guide the proposed side network in efficiently learning the rich motion information in videos, thereby improving the side network's ability to capture and learn motion information. Extensive experiments are conducted on three benchmark datasets, including Something-Something V1\&V2, and Kinetics-400. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves competitive performance.</p></details> |  |

The color, shape, and location of moire patterns may differ across video frames, posing a challenge in learning information from adjacent frames and preserving temporal consistency. Previous video demoireing methods heavily rely on well-designed alignment modules, resulting in substantial computational burdens. Recently, Mamba, an improved version of the State Space Model (SSM), has demonstrated significant potential for modeling long-range dependencies with linear complexity, enabling efficient temporal modeling in video demoireing without requiring a specific alignment module. In this paper, we propose a novel alignment-free Raw video demoireing network with frequency-assisted spatio-temporal Mamba (DemMamba). The Spatial Mamba Block (SMB) and Temporal Mamba Block (TMB) are sequentially arranged to facilitate effective intra- and inter-relationship modeling in Raw videos with moire patterns. Within SMB, an Adaptive Frequency Block (AFB) is introduced to aid demoireing in the frequency domain. For TMB, a Channel Attention Block (CAB) is embedded to further enhance temporal information interactions by exploiting the inter-channel relationships among features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed DemMamba surpasses state-of-the-art approaches by 1.3 dB and delivers a superior visual experience.</p></details> |  |

However, current methods often neglect high-order latent collaborative relationships and fail to dynamically adjust feature learning for specific user-service invocations, which are critical for precise feature extraction. Moreover, relying on RNNs to capture QoS evolution limits the ability to detect long-term trends due to challenges in managing long-range dependencies. To address these issues, we propose the Target-Prompt Online Graph Collaborative Learning (TOGCL) framework for temporal QoS prediction. It leverages a dynamic user-service invocation graph to comprehensively model historical interactions. Building on this graph, it develops a target-prompt graph attention network to extract online deep latent features of users and services at each time slice, considering implicit target-neighboring collaborative relationships and historical QoS values. Additionally, a multi-layer Transformer encoder is employed to uncover temporal feature evolution patterns, enhancing temporal QoS prediction. Extensive experiments on the WS-DREAM dataset demonstrate that TOGCL significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple metrics, achieving improvements of up to 38.80\%. These results underscore the effectiveness of TOGCL for temporal QoS prediction.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication.

Integrating both infrastructure and ego-vehicle data through V2X communication, known as vehicle-infrastructure cooperation, has shown considerable advantages in enhancing perception capabilities and addressing corner cases encountered in single-vehicle autonomous driving. However, cooperative perception still faces numerous challenges, including limited communication bandwidth and practical communication interruptions. In this paper, we propose CTCE, a novel framework for cooperative 3D object detection. This framework transmits queries with temporal contexts enhancement, effectively balancing transmission efficiency and performance to accommodate real-world communication conditions. Additionally, we propose a temporal-guided fusion module to further improve performance. The roadside temporal enhancement and vehicle-side spatial-temporal fusion together constitute a multi-level temporal contexts integration mechanism, fully leveraging temporal information to enhance performance. Furthermore, a motion-aware reconstruction module is introduced to recover lost roadside queries due to communication interruptions. Experimental results on V2X-Seq and V2X-Sim datasets demonstrate that CTCE outperforms the baseline QUEST, achieving improvements of 3.8% and 1.3% in mAP, respectively. Experiments under communication interruption conditions validate CTCE's robustness to communication interruptions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE ITSC 2024</p></details> |

Our method flexibly adjusts the temporal intervals between control nodes according to the dynamics of motion and environmental characteristics. This adaptability enhances performance across various motion states and improves robustness in challenging, feature-sparse environments. We validate the effectiveness of our method on multiple datasets across different platforms, achieving accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art LiDAR-only odometry methods. Notably, in scenarios involving aggressive motion and sparse features, our method outperforms existing solutions.</p></details> |  |

However, state-of-the-art temporal action segmentation methods overlook the long tail and fail to recognize tail actions. Existing long-tail methods make class-independent assumptions and struggle to identify tail classes when applied to temporal segmentation frameworks. This work proposes a novel group-wise temporal logit adjustment~(G-TLA) framework that combines a group-wise softmax formulation while leveraging activity information and action ordering for logit adjustment. The proposed framework significantly improves in segmenting tail actions without any performance loss on head actions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ECCV 2024</p></details> |
| **[Expressive Power of Temporal Message Passing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09918v1)** | 2024-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) have recently been adapted to temporal settings, often employing temporal versions of the message-passing mechanism known from GNNs. We divide temporal message passing mechanisms from literature into two main types: global and local, and establish Weisfeiler-Leman characterisations for both. This allows us to formally analyse expressive power of temporal message-passing models. We show that global and local temporal message-passing mechanisms have incomparable expressive power when applied to arbitrary temporal graphs. However, the local mechanism is strictly more expressive than the global mechanism when applied to colour-persistent temporal graphs, whose node colours are initially the same in all time points. Our theoretical findings are supported by experimental evidence, underlining practical implications of our analysis.</p></details> | 18 pages |
| **[sTransformer: A Modular Approach for Extracting Inter-Sequential and Temporal Information for Time-Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09723v1)** | 2024-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, numerous Transformer-based models have been applied to long-term time-series forecasting (LTSF) tasks. However, recent studies with linear models have questioned their effectiveness, demonstrating that simple linear layers can outperform sophisticated Transformer-based models. In this work, we review and categorize existing Transformer-based models into two main types: (1) modifications to the model structure and (2) modifications to the input data. The former offers scalability but falls short in capturing inter-sequential information, while the latter preprocesses time-series data but is challenging to use as a scalable module. We propose $\textbf{sTransformer}$, which introduces the Sequence and Temporal Convolutional Network (STCN) to fully capture both sequential and temporal information. Additionally, we introduce a Sequence-guided Mask Attention mechanism to capture global feature information. Our approach ensures the capture of inter-sequential information while maintaining module scalability. We compare our model with linear models and existing forecasting models on long-term time-series forecasting, achieving new state-of-the-art results. We also conducted experiments on other time-series tasks, achieving strong performance. These demonstrate that Transformer-based structures remain effective and our model can serve as a viable baseline for time-series tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Timo: Towards Better Temporal Reasoning for Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14192v2)** | 2024-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reasoning about time is essential for Large Language Models (LLMs) to understand the world. Previous works focus on solving specific tasks, primarily on time-sensitive question answering. While these methods have proven effective, they cannot generalize to a wider spectrum of temporal reasoning tasks. Therefore, we propose a crucial question: Can we build a universal framework to handle a variety of temporal reasoning tasks? To that end, we systematically study 38 temporal reasoning tasks. Based on the observation that 19 tasks are directly related to mathematics, we first leverage the available mathematical dataset to set a solid foundation for temporal reasoning. However, the in-depth study indicates that focusing solely on mathematical enhancement falls short of addressing pure temporal reasoning tasks. To mitigate this limitation, we propose a simple but effective self-critic temporal optimization method to enhance the model's temporal reasoning capabilities without sacrificing general task abilities. Finally, we develop Timo, a model designed to excel in temporal reasoning at the 7B and 13B scales. Notably, Timo outperforms the counterpart LLMs by 10.0 and 7.6 in average accuracy scores and achieves the new state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance of comparable size. Extensive experiments further validate our framework's effectiveness and its generalization across diverse temporal tasks.

Despite recent advances with transformer-based forecasting models, challenges remain due to the non-stationary, nonlinear characteristics of workload time series and the long-term dependencies. In particular, inconsistent performance between long-term history and near-term forecasts hinders long-range predictions. This paper proposes a novel framework leveraging self-supervised multiscale representation learning to capture both long-term and near-term workload patterns. The long-term history is encoded through multiscale representations while the near-term observations are modeled via temporal flow fusion. These representations of different scales are fused using an attention mechanism and characterized with normalizing flows to handle non-Gaussian/non-linear distributions of time series. Extensive experiments on 9 benchmarks demonstrate superiority over existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proce...</summary><p>Proceedings of the 33rd ACM International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management (CIKM '24), October 21--25, 2024, Boise, ID, USA</p></details> |
| **[Evidence-Based Temporal Fact Verification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15291v2)** | 2024-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated fact verification plays an essential role in fostering trust in the digital space. Despite the growing interest, the verification of temporal facts has not received much attention in the community. Temporal fact verification brings new challenges where cues of the temporal information need to be extracted and temporal reasoning involving various temporal aspects of the text must be applied. In this work, we propose an end-to-end solution for temporal fact verification that considers the temporal information in claims to obtain relevant evidence sentences and harness the power of large language model for temporal reasoning. Recognizing that temporal facts often involve events, we model these events in the claim and evidence sentences. We curate two temporal fact datasets to learn time-sensitive representations that encapsulate not only the semantic relationships among the events, but also their chronological proximity. This allows us to retrieve the top-k relevant evidence sentences and provide the context for a large language model to perform temporal reasoning and outputs whether a claim is supported or refuted by the retrieved evidence sentences. Experiment results demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly enhances the accuracy of temporal claim verification, thereby advancing current state-of-the-art in automated fact verification.</p></details> |  |

Traditional research has focused on deterministic rules governing pairwise interactions, yet the impact of interaction frequency and synchronization in groups on cooperation remains underexplored. Addressing this gap, our work introduces two temporal interaction mechanisms to model the stochastic or periodic participation of individuals in public goods games, acknowledging real-life variances due to exogenous temporal factors and geographical time differences. We consider that the interaction state significantly influences both game payoff calculations and the strategy updating process, offering new insights into the emergence and sustainability of cooperation. Our results indicate that maximum game participation frequency is suboptimal under a stochastic interaction mechanism. Instead, an intermediate activation probability maximizes cooperation, suggesting a vital balance between interaction frequency and inactivity security. Furthermore, local synchronization of interactions within specific areas is shown to be beneficial, as time differences hinder the spread of cross-structures but promote the formation of dense cooperative clusters with smoother boundaries. We also note that stronger clustering in networks, larger group sizes and lower noise increase cooperation. This research contributes to understanding the role of node-based temporality and probabilistic interactions in social dilemmas, offering insights into fostering cooperation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Physical Review E</p></details> |
| **[Directed Exploration in Reinforcement Learning from Linear Temporal Logic](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09495v1)** | 2024-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Linear temporal logic (LTL) is a powerful language for task specification in reinforcement learning, as it allows describing objectives beyond the expressivity of conventional discounted return formulations. Nonetheless, recent works have shown that LTL formulas can be translated into a variable rewarding and discounting scheme, whose optimization produces a policy maximizing a lower bound on the probability of formula satisfaction. However, the synthesized reward signal remains fundamentally sparse, making exploration challenging. We aim to overcome this limitation, which can prevent current algorithms from scaling beyond low-dimensional, short-horizon problems. We show how better exploration can be achieved by further leveraging the LTL specification and casting its corresponding Limit Deterministic B\"uchi Automaton (LDBA) as a Markov reward process, thus enabling a form of high-level value estimation. By taking a Bayesian perspective over LDBA dynamics and proposing a suitable prior distribution, we show that the values estimated through this procedure can be treated as a shaping potential and mapped to informative intrinsic rewards. Empirically, we demonstrate applications of our method from tabular settings to high-dimensional continuous systems, which have so far represented a significant challenge for LTL-based reinforcement learning algorithms.</p></details> |  |

To address these issues, we introduce sLA-tKGF (small-scale language assistant for tKG forecasting), which utilizes Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) aided, custom-trained small-scale language models through a tabula rasa approach from scratch for effective tKG forecasting. Our framework constructs knowledge-infused prompts with relevant historical data from tKGs, web search results, and PLLMs-generated textual descriptions to understand historical entity relationships prior to the target time. It leverages these external knowledge-infused prompts for deeper understanding and reasoning of context-specific semantic and temporal information to zero-shot prompt small-scale language models for more accurate predictions of future events within tKGs. It reduces hallucinations and mitigates distributional shift challenges through comprehending changing trends over time. As a result, it enables more accurate and contextually grounded forecasts of future events while minimizing computational demands. Rigorous empirical studies demonstrate our framework robustness, scalability, and state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on benchmark datasets with interpretable and trustworthy tKG forecasting.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper was accepted at ACM KDD -2024 -- Undergraduate Consortium.

It is receiving renewed interest in the context of, among others, business process modelling that needs robust expressive data models to complement them. None of the proposed temporal conceptual data modelling languages have been tested on understandability and usability by modellers, however, nor is it clear which temporal constraints would be used by modellers or whether the ones included are the relevant temporal constraints. We therefore sought to investigate temporal representations in temporal conceptual data modelling languages, design a, to date, most expressive language, TREND, through small-scale qualitative experiments, and finalise the graphical notation and modelling and understanding in large scale experiments. This involved a series of 11 experiments with over a thousand participants in total, having created 246 temporal conceptual data models. Key outcomes are that choice of label for transition constraints had limited impact, as did extending explanations of the modelling language, but expressing what needs to be modelled in controlled natural language did improve model quality. The experiments also indicate that more training may be needed, in particular guidance for domain experts, to achieve adoption of temporal conceptual data modelling by the community.</p></details> | <details><summary>44 pa...</summary><p>44 pages, 23 figures, 11 tables, submitted to an international journal</p></details> |

Hence, knowledge obtained from Wi-Fi network measurements can be helpful for a more efficient network management. In this paper, we propose a methodology to predict future values of some specific network metrics (e.g. traffic load, transmission failures, etc.). These predictions may be useful for improving the network performance. After data collection and preprocessing, the correlation between each target access point (AP) and its neighbouring APs is estimated. According to these correlations, either an only-temporal or a spatio-temporal based prediction is done. To evaluate the proposed methodology, real measurements are collected from 100 APs deployed in different university buildings for 3 months. Deep Learning (DL) methods (i.e. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Simple Recurrent Neural Network (SRNN), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Transformer) are evaluated and compared for both temporal and spatio-temporal based predictions. Moreover, a hybrid prediction methodology is proposed using a spatial processing based on CNN and a temporal prediction based on RNN. The proposed hybrid methodology provides an improvement in the prediction accuracy at expenses of a slight increase in the Training Computational Time (TCT) and negligible in Prediction Computational Time (PCT).</p></details> | 18 pages, 6 figures |

Conventional pooling methods overlook the preservation of motion information and treat each frame equally. However, in an action sequence, only a few segments of frames carry discriminative information related to the action. This paper presents a novel Joint Motion Adaptive Temporal Pooling (JMAP) method for improving skeleton-based action recognition. Two variants of JMAP, frame-wise pooling and joint-wise pooling, are introduced. The efficacy of JMAP has been validated through experiments on the popular NTU RGB+D 120 and PKU-MMD datasets.</p></details> |  |

Large temporal scale variation of actions is one of the most primary difficulties in TAD. Naturally, multi-scale features have potential in localizing actions of diverse lengths as widely used in object detection. Nevertheless, unlike objects in images, actions have more ambiguity in their boundaries. That is, small neighboring objects are not considered as a large one while short adjoining actions can be misunderstood as a long one. In the coarse-to-fine feature pyramid via pooling, these vague action boundaries can fade out, which we call 'vanishing boundary problem'. To this end, we propose Boundary-Recovering Network (BRN) to address the vanishing boundary problem. BRN constructs scale-time features by introducing a new axis called scale dimension by interpolating multi-scale features to the same temporal length. On top of scale-time features, scale-time blocks learn to exchange features across scale levels, which can effectively settle down the issue. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art on the two challenging benchmarks, ActivityNet-v1.3 and THUMOS14, with remarkably reduced degree of the vanishing boundary problem.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Pattern Recognition Journal</p></details> |

Its solutions hold significant implications across various domains (e.g., ride-hailing, insurance), wherein their application serves to safeguard users and mitigate potential fraudulent activities. Present HuMID solutions often exhibit limitations in adaptability when confronted with lengthy trajectories, consequently incurring substantial computational overhead. Furthermore, their inability to effectively extract crucial local information further impedes their performance. To address this problem, we propose a Siamese Multiple Attention Temporal Convolutional Network (Siamese MA-TCN) to capitalize on the strengths of both TCN architecture and multi-head self-attention, enabling the proficient extraction of both local and long-term dependencies. Additionally, we devise a novel attention mechanism tailored for the efficient aggregation of multi-scale representations derived from our model. Experimental evaluations conducted on two real-world taxi trajectory datasets reveal that our proposed model effectively extracts both local key information and long-term dependencies. These findings highlight the model's outstanding generalization capabilities, demonstrating its robustness and adaptability across datasets of varying sizes.</p></details> | <details><summary>27th ...</summary><p>27th IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC) (ITSC 2024)</p></details> |
| **[Linear Attention is Enough in Spatial-Temporal Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09158v1)** | 2024-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As the most representative scenario of spatial-temporal forecasting tasks, the traffic forecasting task attracted numerous attention from machine learning community due to its intricate correlation both in space and time dimension. Existing methods often treat road networks over time as spatial-temporal graphs, addressing spatial and temporal representations independently. However, these approaches struggle to capture the dynamic topology of road networks, encounter issues with message passing mechanisms and over-smoothing, and face challenges in learning spatial and temporal relationships separately. To address these limitations, we propose treating nodes in road networks at different time steps as independent spatial-temporal tokens and feeding them into a vanilla Transformer to learn complex spatial-temporal patterns, design STformer achieving SOTA. Given its quadratic complexity, we introduce a variant NSTformer based on Nystr$\ddot{o}$m method to approximate self-attention with linear complexity but even slightly better than former in a few cases astonishingly. Extensive experimental results on traffic datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance at an affordable computational cost.

While many studies have focused on predicting stock prices, even advanced models fall short of accurately forecasting them. Additionally, previous studies indicate that individual investors often disregard established investment theories, favoring their personal preferences instead. This presents a challenge for stock recommendation systems, which must not only provide strong investment performance but also respect these individual preferences. To create effective stock recommender systems, three critical elements must be incorporated: 1) individual preferences, 2) portfolio diversification, and 3) the temporal dynamics of the first two. In response, we propose a new model, Portfolio Temporal Graph Network Recommender, PfoTGNRec, which can handle time-varying collaborative signals and incorporates diversification-enhancing sampling. On real-world individual trading data, our approach demonstrates superior performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines, including cutting-edge dynamic embedding models and existing stock recommendation models. Indeed, we show that PfoTGNRec is an effective solution that can balance customer preferences with the need to suggest portfolios with high Return-on-Investment.

| **[Temporal Reversed Training for Spiking Neural Networks with Generalized Spatio-Temporal Representation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09108v1)** | 2024-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have received widespread attention as an ultra-low energy computing paradigm. Recent studies have focused on improving the feature extraction capability of SNNs, but they suffer from inefficient inference and suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective temporal reversed training (TRT) method to optimize the spatio-temporal performance of SNNs and circumvent these problems. We perturb the input temporal data by temporal reversal, prompting the SNN to produce original-reversed consistent output logits and to learn perturbation-invariant representations. For static data without temporal dimension, we generalize this strategy by exploiting the inherent temporal property of spiking neurons for spike feature temporal reversal. In addition, we utilize the lightweight ``star operation" (element-wise multiplication) to hybridize the original and temporally reversed spike firing rates and expand the implicit dimensions, which serves as spatio-temporal regularization to further enhance the generalization of the SNN. Our method involves only an additional temporal reversal operation and element-wise multiplication during training, thus incurring negligible training overhead and not affecting the inference efficiency at all. Extensive experiments on static/neuromorphic object/action recognition, and 3D point cloud classification tasks demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our method. In particular, with only two timesteps, our method achieves 74.77\% and 90.57\% accuracy on ImageNet and ModelNet40, respectively.</p></details> | 15 pages, 8 figures |

However, existing models often face limitations in generalization, struggling with zero-shot prediction on unseen regions and cities, as well as diminished long-term accuracy. This is primarily due to the inherent challenges in handling the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of traffic data, coupled with the significant distribution shift across time and space. In this work, we aim to unlock new possibilities for building versatile, resilient and adaptive spatio-temporal foundation models for traffic prediction. To achieve this goal, we introduce a novel foundation model, named OpenCity, that can effectively capture and normalize the underlying spatio-temporal patterns from diverse data characteristics, facilitating zero-shot generalization across diverse urban environments. OpenCity integrates the Transformer architecture with graph neural networks to model the complex spatio-temporal dependencies in traffic data. By pre-training OpenCity on large-scale, heterogeneous traffic datasets, we enable the model to learn rich, generalizable representations that can be seamlessly applied to a wide range of traffic forecasting scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that OpenCity exhibits exceptional zero-shot predictive performance. Moreover, OpenCity showcases promising scaling laws, suggesting the potential for developing a truly one-for-all traffic prediction solution that can adapt to new urban contexts with minimal overhead.

In this paper, we focus on medical temporal variation modeling, \emph{i.e.,} cuffless blood pressure (BP) monitoring which has great value in cardiovascular healthcare. Although providing a comfortable user experience, such methods are suffering from the demand for a significant amount of realistic data to train an individual model for each subject, especially considering the invasive or obtrusive BP ground-truth measurements. To tackle this challenge, we introduce a novel physics-informed temporal network~(PITN) with adversarial contrastive learning to enable precise BP estimation with very limited data. Specifically, we first enhance the physics-informed neural network~(PINN) with the temporal block for investigating BP dynamics' multi-periodicity for personal cardiovascular cycle modeling and temporal variation. We then employ adversarial training to generate extra physiological time series data, improving PITN's robustness in the face of sparse subject-specific training data. Furthermore, we utilize contrastive learning to capture the discriminative variations of cardiovascular physiologic phenomena. This approach aggregates physiological signals with similar blood pressure values in latent space while separating clusters of samples with dissimilar blood pressure values. Experiments on three widely-adopted datasets with different modailties (\emph{i.e.,} bioimpedance, PPG, millimeter-wave) demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of the proposed methods over previous state-of-the-art approaches.

Their scalar output, however, obfuscates when or what individual future rewards an agent may expect to receive. We address this by modifying an agent's future reward estimator to predict their next N expected rewards, referred to as Temporal Reward Decomposition (TRD). This unlocks novel explanations of agent behaviour. Through TRD we can: estimate when an agent may expect to receive a reward, the value of the reward and the agent's confidence in receiving it; measure an input feature's temporal importance to the agent's action decisions; and predict the influence of different actions on future rewards. Furthermore, we show that DQN agents trained on Atari environments can be efficiently retrained to incorporate TRD with minimal impact on performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages + 3 pages of supplementary material.

The safety risk and urgency of autonomous vehicles in the absence of collision are evaluated. To ensure safety and improve road efficiency, a method of pre-compiling the spatio-temporal trajectory of vehicles is established to eliminate conflicts between vehicles in advance. The calculation method of the safe distance under spatio-temporal conditions is studied, considering vehicle speed differences, vehicle positioning errors, and clock errors. By combining collision acceleration and urgent acceleration, an evaluation model for vehicle conflict risk is constructed. Mainline vehicles that may have conflicts with on-ramp vehicles are identified, and the target gap for on-ramp vehicles is determined. Finally, a cooperative control method is established based on the selected target gap, preparing the vehicle travel path in advance. Taking highway ramp merge as an example, the mainline priority spatio-temporal cooperative control method is proposed and verified through simulation.

In this work, we revisit the widely adopted bi-temporal images-based framework and propose a novel Coarse-grained Temporal Mining Augmented (CTMA) framework. To be specific, given the bi-temporal images, we first transform them into a video using interpolation operations. Then, a set of temporal encoders is adopted to extract the motion features from the obtained video for coarse-grained changed region prediction. Subsequently, we design a novel Coarse-grained Foregrounds Augmented Spatial Encoder module to integrate both global and local information. We also introduce a motion augmented strategy that leverages motion cues as an additional output to aggregate with the spatial features for improved results. Meanwhile, we feed the input image pairs into the ResNet to get the different features and also the spatial blocks for fine-grained feature learning. More importantly, we propose a mask augmented strategy that utilizes coarse-grained changed regions, incorporating them into the decoder blocks to enhance the final changed prediction. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple benchmark datasets fully validated the effectiveness of our proposed framework for remote sensing image change detection.

Existing graph-based representation learning frameworks have made significant strides in developing evolving representations for both entities and relational embeddings. Despite these achievements, there's a notable tendency in these models to inadvertently learn biased data representations and mine spurious correlations, consequently failing to discern the causal relationships between events. This often leads to incorrect predictions based on these false correlations. To address this, we propose an innovative causal enhanced graph representation learning framework for TKGR (named CEGRL-TKGR). This framework introduces causal structures in graph-based representation learning to unveil the essential causal relationships between events, ultimately enhancing task performance. Specifically, we first disentangle the evolutionary representations of entities and relations in a temporal graph sequence into two distinct components, namely causal representations and confounding representations. Then, drawing on causal intervention theory, we advocate the utilization of causal representations for predictions, aiming to mitigate the effects of erroneous correlations caused by confounding features, thus achieving more robust and accurate predictions. Finally, extensive experimental results on six benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our model in the link prediction task.</p></details> |  |
| **[System States Forecasting of Microservices with Dynamic Spatio-Temporal Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07894v1)** | 2024-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the AIOps (Artificial Intelligence for IT Operations) era, accurately forecasting system states is crucial. In microservices systems, this task encounters the challenge of dynamic and complex spatio-temporal relationships among microservice instances, primarily due to dynamic deployments, diverse call paths, and cascading effects among instances. Current time-series forecasting methods, which focus mainly on intrinsic patterns, are insufficient in environments where spatial relationships are critical. Similarly, spatio-temporal graph approaches often neglect the nature of temporal trend, concentrating mostly on message passing between nodes. Moreover, current research in microservices domain frequently underestimates the importance of network metrics and topological structures in capturing the evolving dynamics of systems. This paper introduces STMformer, a model tailored for forecasting system states in microservices environments, capable of handling multi-node and multivariate time series. Our method leverages dynamic network connection data and topological information to assist in modeling the intricate spatio-temporal relationships within the system. Additionally, we integrate the PatchCrossAttention module to compute the impact of cascading effects globally. We have developed a dataset based on a microservices system and conducted comprehensive experiments with STMformer against leading methods. In both short-term and long-term forecasting tasks, our model consistently achieved a 8.6% reduction in MAE(Mean Absolute Error) and a 2.2% reduction in MSE (Mean Squared Error).

Nonetheless, these methods mainly adopt imagepair appearance matching and face challenges of the intrinsic high quadratic complexity of the attention mechanism, resulting in constrained exploitation of temporal information. Inspired by the recently emerged State Space Model Mamba, renowned for its impressive long sequence modeling capabilities and linear computational complexity, this work innovatively proposes a pure Mamba-based framework (MambaVT) to fully exploit spatio-temporal contextual modeling for robust visible-thermal tracking. Specifically, we devise the long-range cross-frame integration component to globally adapt to target appearance variations, and introduce short-term historical trajectory prompts to predict the subsequent target states based on local temporal location clues. Extensive experiments show the significant potential of vision Mamba for RGB-T tracking, with MambaVT achieving state-of-the-art performance on four mainstream benchmarks while requiring lower computational costs. We aim for this work to serve as a simple yet strong baseline, stimulating future research in this field. The code and pre-trained models will be made available.</p></details> |  |
| **[LoAS: Fully Temporal-Parallel Datatflow for Dual-Sparse Spiking Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14073v2)** | 2024-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have gained significant research attention in the last decade due to their potential to drive resource-constrained edge devices. Though existing SNN accelerators offer high efficiency in processing sparse spikes with dense weights, opportunities are less explored in SNNs with sparse weights, i.e., dual-sparsity. In this work, we study the acceleration of dual-sparse SNNs, focusing on their core operation, sparse-matrix-sparse-matrix multiplication (spMspM). We observe that naively running a dual-sparse SNN on existing spMspM accelerators designed for dual-sparse Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) exhibits sub-optimal efficiency. The main challenge is that processing timesteps, a natural property of SNNs, introduces an extra loop to ANN spMspM, leading to longer latency and more memory traffic. To address the problem, we propose a fully temporal-parallel (FTP) dataflow, which minimizes both data movement across timesteps and the end-to-end latency of dual-sparse SNNs. To maximize the efficiency of FTP dataflow, we propose an FTP-friendly spike compression mechanism that efficiently compresses single-bit spikes and ensures contiguous memory access. We further propose an FTP-friendly inner-join circuit that can lower the cost of the expensive prefix-sum circuits with almost no throughput penalty. All the above techniques for FTP dataflow are encapsulated in LoAS, a Low-latency inference Accelerator for dual-sparse SNNs. With FTP dataflow, compression, and inner-join, running dual-sparse SNN workloads on LoAS demonstrates significant speedup (up to $8.51\times$) and energy reduction (up to $3.68\times$) compared to running it on prior dual-sparse accelerators.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to MICRO 2024.

| **[Simultaneous Task Allocation and Planning for Multi-Robots under Hierarchical Temporal Logic Specifications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04003v3)** | 2024-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Research in robotic planning with temporal logic specifications, such as syntactically co-safe Linear Temporal Logic (sc-LTL), has relied on single formulas. However, as task complexity increases, sc-LTL formulas become lengthy, making them difficult to interpret and generate, and straining the computational capacities of planners. To address this, we introduce a hierarchical structure to sc-LTL specifications with both syntax and semantics, proving it to be more expressive than flat counterparts. We conducted a user study that compared the flat sc-LTL with our hierarchical version and found that users could more easily comprehend complex tasks using the hierarchical structure. We develop a search-based approach to synthesize plans for multi-robot systems, achieving simultaneous task allocation and planning. This method approximates the search space by loosely interconnected sub-spaces, each corresponding to an sc-LTL specification. The search primarily focuses on a single sub-space, transitioning to another under conditions determined by the decomposition of automatons. We develop multiple heuristics to significantly expedite the search. Our theoretical analysis, conducted under mild assumptions, addresses completeness and optimality. Compared to existing methods used in various simulators for service tasks, our approach improves planning times while maintaining comparable solution quality.</p></details> | 20 pages, 10 figures |

The dataset comprises pairs of finite-time system traces and corresponding labels, denoting whether the traces demonstrate specific desired behaviors, e.g. whether the ship follows a safe route or not. Our proposed approach leverages decision-tree-based methods to infer Signal Temporal Logic classifiers using primitive formulae. We formulate the inference process as a mixed integer linear programming optimization problem, recursively generating constraints to determine both data classification and tree structure. Applying a max-flow algorithm on the resultant tree transforms the problem into a global optimization challenge, leading to improved classification rates compared to prior methodologies. Moreover, we introduce a technique to reduce the number of constraints by exploiting the symmetry inherent in STL primitives, which enhances the algorithm's time performance and interpretability. To assess our algorithm's effectiveness and classification performance, we conduct three case studies involving two-class, multi-class, and complex formula classification scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Advancing Spatio-Temporal Processing in Spiking Neural Networks through Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07517v1)** | 2024-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficient implementations of spiking neural networks on neuromorphic hardware promise orders of magnitude less power consumption than their non-spiking counterparts. The standard neuron model for spike-based computation on such neuromorphic systems has long been the leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neuron. As a promising advancement, a computationally light augmentation of the LIF neuron model with an adaptation mechanism experienced a recent upswing in popularity, caused by demonstrations of its superior performance on spatio-temporal processing tasks. The root of the superiority of these so-called adaptive LIF neurons however, is not well understood. In this article, we thoroughly analyze the dynamical, computational, and learning properties of adaptive LIF neurons and networks thereof. We find that the frequently observed stability problems during training of such networks can be overcome by applying an alternative discretization method that results in provably better stability properties than the commonly used Euler-Forward method. With this discretization, we achieved a new state-of-the-art performance on common event-based benchmark datasets. We also show that the superiority of networks of adaptive LIF neurons extends to the prediction and generation of complex time series. Our further analysis of the computational properties of networks of adaptive LIF neurons shows that they are particularly well suited to exploit the spatio-temporal structure of input sequences. Furthermore, these networks are surprisingly robust to shifts of the mean input strength and input spike rate, even when these shifts were not observed during training. As a consequence, high-performance networks can be obtained without any normalization techniques such as batch normalization or batch-normalization through time.</p></details> |  |

The weak dependence condition for arrays of random fields is proved to be inherited through transformation and infinite shift. This paves a way to prove the consistency and asymptotic normality of maximum likelihood estimation for dynamic spatio-temporal models (i.e. so-called ultra high-dimensional time series models) when the sample size and/or dimension go to infinity. Especially the asymptotic properties of estimation for network autoregression are obtained under reasonable regularity conditions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Only One Relation Possible? Modeling the Ambiguity in Event Temporal Relation Extraction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07353v1)** | 2024-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Event Temporal Relation Extraction (ETRE) aims to identify the temporal relationship between two events, which plays an important role in natural language understanding. Most previous works follow a single-label classification style, classifying an event pair into either a specific temporal relation (e.g., \textit{Before}, \textit{After}), or a special label \textit{Vague} when there may be multiple possible temporal relations between the pair. In our work, instead of directly making predictions on \textit{Vague}, we propose a multi-label classification solution for ETRE (METRE) to infer the possibility of each temporal relation independently, where we treat \textit{Vague} as the cases when there is more than one possible relation between two events. We design a speculation mechanism to explore the possible relations hidden behind \textit{Vague}, which enables the latent information to be used efficiently. Experiments on TB-Dense, MATRES and UDS-T show that our method can effectively utilize the \textit{Vague} instances to improve the recognition for specific temporal relations and outperforms most state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

It aims to advance the development of countermeasure (CM) to discriminate bonafide and spoofed speech utterances. In this paper, we focus on addressing the problem of open-domain audio deepfake detection, which corresponds directly to the ASVspoof5 Track1 open condition. At first, we comprehensively investigate various CM on ASVspoof5, including data expansion, data augmentation, and self-supervised learning (SSL) features. Due to the high-frequency gaps characteristic of the ASVspoof5 dataset, we introduce Frequency Mask, a data augmentation method that masks specific frequency bands to improve CM robustness. Combining various scale of temporal information with multiple SSL features, our experiments achieved a minDCF of 0.0158 and an EER of 0.55% on the ASVspoof 5 Track 1 evaluation progress set.</p></details> |  |
| **[Weakly Supervised Video Anomaly Detection and Localization with Spatio-Temporal Prompts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05905v2)** | 2024-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current weakly supervised video anomaly detection (WSVAD) task aims to achieve frame-level anomalous event detection with only coarse video-level annotations available. Existing works typically involve extracting global features from full-resolution video frames and training frame-level classifiers to detect anomalies in the temporal dimension. However, most anomalous events tend to occur in localized spatial regions rather than the entire video frames, which implies existing frame-level feature based works may be misled by the dominant background information and lack the interpretation of the detected anomalies. To address this dilemma, this paper introduces a novel method called STPrompt that learns spatio-temporal prompt embeddings for weakly supervised video anomaly detection and localization (WSVADL) based on pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs). Our proposed method employs a two-stream network structure, with one stream focusing on the temporal dimension and the other primarily on the spatial dimension. By leveraging the learned knowledge from pre-trained VLMs and incorporating natural motion priors from raw videos, our model learns prompt embeddings that are aligned with spatio-temporal regions of videos (e.g., patches of individual frames) for identify specific local regions of anomalies, enabling accurate video anomaly detection while mitigating the influence of background information. Without relying on detailed spatio-temporal annotations or auxiliary object detection/tracking, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on three public benchmarks for the WSVADL task.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACMMM2024</p></details> |
| **[GLGait: A Global-Local Temporal Receptive Field Network for Gait Recognition in the Wild](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06834v1)** | 2024-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Gait recognition has attracted increasing attention from academia and industry as a human recognition technology from a distance in non-intrusive ways without requiring cooperation. Although advanced methods have achieved impressive success in lab scenarios, most of them perform poorly in the wild. Recently, some Convolution Neural Networks (ConvNets) based methods have been proposed to address the issue of gait recognition in the wild. However, the temporal receptive field obtained by convolution operations is limited for long gait sequences. If directly replacing convolution blocks with visual transformer blocks, the model may not enhance a local temporal receptive field, which is important for covering a complete gait cycle. To address this issue, we design a Global-Local Temporal Receptive Field Network (GLGait). GLGait employs a Global-Local Temporal Module (GLTM) to establish a global-local temporal receptive field, which mainly consists of a Pseudo Global Temporal Self-Attention (PGTA) and a temporal convolution operation. Specifically, PGTA is used to obtain a pseudo global temporal receptive field with less memory and computation complexity compared with a multi-head self-attention (MHSA). The temporal convolution operation is used to enhance the local temporal receptive field. Besides, it can also aggregate pseudo global temporal receptive field to a true holistic temporal receptive field. Furthermore, we also propose a Center-Augmented Triplet Loss (CTL) in GLGait to reduce the intra-class distance and expand the positive samples in the training stage. Extensive experiments show that our method obtains state-of-the-art results on in-the-wild datasets, $i.e.$, Gait3D and GREW.

In addition to pre-trained video models, contemporary methods utilize pre-trained vision-language models (VLM) to capture detailed characteristics of diverse scenes and objects from video frames. However, as pre-trained on images, VLM may struggle to distinguish action-sensitive patterns from static objects, making it necessary to adapt them to specific data domains for effective feature representation over temporal grounding. We address two primary challenges to achieve this goal. Specifically, to mitigate high adaptation costs, we propose an efficient preliminary in-domain fine-tuning paradigm for feature adaptation, where downstream-adaptive features are learned through several pretext tasks. Furthermore, to integrate action-sensitive information into VLM, we introduce Action-Cue-Injected Temporal Prompt Learning (ActPrompt), which injects action cues into the image encoder of VLM for better discovering action-sensitive patterns. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ActPrompt is an off-the-shelf training framework that can be effectively applied to various SOTA methods, resulting in notable improvements. The complete code used in this study is provided in the supplementary materials.</p></details> | 9 pages, 5 figures |

To achieve this, we exploit a simple proxy task of ordering a shuffled image sequence, with `time' serving as a supervisory signal, since only changes that are monotonic with time can give rise to the correct ordering. We also introduce a transformer-based model for ordering of image sequences of arbitrary length with built-in attribution maps. After training, the model successfully discovers and localizes monotonic changes while ignoring cyclic and stochastic ones. We demonstrate applications of the model in multiple domains covering different scene and object types, discovering both object-level and environmental changes in unseen sequences. We also demonstrate that the attention-based attribution maps function as effective prompts for segmenting the changing regions, and that the learned representations can be used for downstream applications. Finally, we show that the model achieves the state-of-the-art on standard benchmarks for image ordering.</p></details> | <details><summary>ECCV ...</summary><p>ECCV 2024 Oral.

Current approaches usually embed factual knowledge into continuous vector space and apply geometric operations to learn potential patterns in temporal knowledge graphs. However, these methods only adopt a single operation, which may have limitations in capturing the complex temporal dynamics present in temporal knowledge graphs. Therefore, we propose a simple but effective method, i.e. TCompoundE, which is specially designed with two geometric operations, including time-specific and relation-specific operations. We provide mathematical proofs to demonstrate the ability of TCompoundE to encode various relation patterns. Experimental results show that our proposed model significantly outperforms existing temporal knowledge graph embedding models.

However, its potential in the domain of multi-frame 3D object detection remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we present STEMD, a novel end-to-end framework that enhances the DETR-like paradigm for multi-frame 3D object detection by addressing three key aspects specifically tailored for this task. First, to model the inter-object spatial interaction and complex temporal dependencies, we introduce the spatial-temporal graph attention network, which represents queries as nodes in a graph and enables effective modeling of object interactions within a social context. To solve the problem of missing hard cases in the proposed output of the encoder in the current frame, we incorporate the output of the previous frame to initialize the query input of the decoder. Finally, it poses a challenge for the network to distinguish between the positive query and other highly similar queries that are not the best match. And similar queries are insufficiently suppressed and turn into redundant prediction boxes. To address this issue, our proposed IoU regularization term encourages similar queries to be distinct during the refinement. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in handling challenging scenarios, while incurring only a minor additional computational overhead.

However, a systematic approach is still lacking to leverage the information from different types of data, e.g., with different spatial and temporal resolutions, and the combined use of short-term trajectories and long-term statistics. In this work, we build on the recent progress of neural operator and present a data-driven modeling framework called neural dynamical operator that is continuous in both space and time. A key feature of the neural dynamical operator is the resolution-invariance with respect to both spatial and temporal discretizations, without demanding abundant training data in different temporal resolutions. To improve the long-term performance of the calibrated model, we further propose a hybrid optimization scheme that leverages both gradient-based and derivative-free optimization methods and efficiently trains on both short-term time series and long-term statistics. We investigate the performance of the neural dynamical operator with three numerical examples, including the viscous Burgers' equation, the Navier-Stokes equations, and the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation. The results confirm the resolution-invariance of the proposed modeling framework and also demonstrate stable long-term simulations with only short-term time series data. In addition, we show that the proposed model can better predict long-term statistics via the hybrid optimization scheme with a combined use of short-term and long-term data.</p></details> |  |

Recent advancements such as Online Temporal Action Localization (OnTAL), extend this approach to instance-level predictions. However, existing methods mainly focus on short-term context, neglecting historical information. To address this, we introduce the History-Augmented Anchor Transformer (HAT) Framework for OnTAL. By integrating historical context, our framework enhances the synergy between long-term and short-term information, improving the quality of anchor features crucial for classification and localization. We evaluate our model on both procedural egocentric (PREGO) datasets (EGTEA and EPIC) and standard non-PREGO OnTAL datasets (THUMOS and MUSES). Results show that our model outperforms state-of-the-art approaches significantly on PREGO datasets and achieves comparable or slightly superior performance on non-PREGO datasets, underscoring the importance of leveraging long-term history, especially in procedural and egocentric action scenarios.

We represent the robot's geometry as a semialgebraic set defined by polynomial inequalities such that robots with general shapes can be suitably characterized. To address the robot navigation task in obstacle-dense environments, we exploit the free space directly to construct a sequence of free regions, and allocate each waypoint on the trajectory to a specific region. Then, we incorporate a uniform scaling factor for each free region, and formulate a Sums-of-Squares (SOS) optimization problem that renders the containment relationship between the robot and the free space computationally tractable. The SOS optimization problem is further reformulated to a semidefinite program (SDP), and the collision-free constraints are shown to be equivalent to limiting the scaling factor along the entire trajectory. In this context, the robot at a specific configuration is tailored to stay within the free region. Next, to solve the trajectory optimization problem with the proposed safety constraints (which are implicitly dependent on the robot configurations), we derive the analytical solution to the gradient of the minimum scaling factor with respect to the robot configuration. As a result, this seamlessly facilitates the use of gradient-based methods in efficient solving of the trajectory optimization problem. Through a series of simulations and real-world experiments, the proposed trajectory optimization approach is validated in various challenging scenarios, and the results demonstrate its effectiveness in generating collision-free trajectories in dense and intricate environments populated with obstacles.

However, the development and ranking of state-of-the-art (SotA) models are driven by their In-Distribution (ID) performance on individual competition datasets. We present an OoD testing protocol that homogenizes datasets and prediction tasks across two large-scale motion datasets. We introduce a novel prediction algorithm based on polynomial representations for agent trajectory and road geometry on both the input and output sides of the model. With a much smaller model size, training effort, and inference time, we reach near SotA performance for ID testing and significantly improve robustness in OoD testing. Within our OoD testing protocol, we further study two augmentation strategies of SotA models and their effects on model generalization. Highlighting the contrast between ID and OoD performance, we suggest adding OoD testing to the evaluation criteria of trajectory prediction models.</p></details> |  |

Traditional as well as recent data-driven marginal trajectory prediction methods struggle to properly learn non-linear agent-to-agent interactions. We present SSL-Interactions that proposes pretext tasks to enhance interaction modeling for trajectory prediction. We introduce four interaction-aware pretext tasks to encapsulate various aspects of agent interactions: range gap prediction, closest distance prediction, direction of movement prediction, and type of interaction prediction. We further propose an approach to curate interaction-heavy scenarios from datasets. This curated data has two advantages: it provides a stronger learning signal to the interaction model, and facilitates generation of pseudo-labels for interaction-centric pretext tasks. We also propose three new metrics specifically designed to evaluate predictions in interactive scenes. Our empirical evaluations indicate SSL-Interactions outperforms state-of-the-art motion forecasting methods quantitatively with up to 8% improvement, and qualitatively, for interaction-heavy scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IV-2024. 13 pages, 5 figures</p></details> |

However, generating factually consistent responses in knowledge-intensive scenarios remains a challenge due to issues such as hallucination, difficulty in acquiring long-tailed knowledge, and limited memory expansion. This paper introduces SMART, a novel multi-agent framework that leverages external knowledge to enhance the interpretability and factual consistency of LLM-generated responses. SMART comprises four specialized agents, each performing a specific sub-trajectory action to navigate complex knowledge-intensive tasks. We propose a multi-agent co-training paradigm, Long-Short Trajectory Learning, which ensures synergistic collaboration among agents while maintaining fine-grained execution by each agent. Extensive experiments on five knowledge-intensive tasks demonstrate SMART's superior performance compared to widely adopted knowledge internalization and knowledge enhancement methods. Our framework can extend beyond knowledge-intensive tasks to more complex scenarios. Our code is available at https://github.com/yueshengbin/SMART.</p></details> |  |

Several existing deep generative solutions propose learning from real trajectories to generate synthetic ones. Despite the progress, most of them suffer from training stability issues and scale poorly with growing data size. More importantly, they generally lack control mechanisms to steer the generated trajectories based on spatiotemporal constraints such as fixing specific visits. To address such limitations, we formally define the controlled trajectory generation problem with spatiotemporal constraints and propose Geo-Llama. This novel LLM-inspired framework enforces explicit visit constraints in a contextually coherent way. It fine-tunes pre-trained LLMs on trajectories with a visit-wise permutation strategy where each visit corresponds to a time and location. This enables the model to capture the spatiotemporal patterns regardless of visit orders and allows flexible and in-context constraint integration through prompts during generation. Extensive experiments on real-world and synthetic datasets validate the effectiveness of Geo-Llama, demonstrating its versatility and robustness in handling a broad range of constraints to generate more realistic trajectories compared to existing methods.</p></details> |  |

Assuming that the vehicle follows a trajectory that can be uniquely identified by the sequence of control inputs and by some intermittent ranging measurements from known points in the environment, we can model the trajectory as a rigid body subject to rotation and translation in the plane. This way, the localisation problem can be reduced to finding the conditions for the existence of a unique roto-translation of the trajectory from a known reference frame to the world reference frame, given the collected measurements. As discussed in this paper, such conditions can be expressed in terms of the shape of the trajectory, of the layout of the ranging sensors, and of the numbers of measurements collected from each of them. The approach applies to a large class of kinematic models. Focusing on the special case of unicycle kinematics, we provide additional local constructibility results.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 7 figures, This article has been accepted for publication in IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control (2024). content may change prior to final publication</p></details> |
| **[Multi-finger Manipulation via Trajectory Optimization with Differentiable Rolling and Geometric Constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13229v1)** | 2024-08-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Parameterizing finger rolling and finger-object contacts in a differentiable manner is important for formulating dexterous manipulation as a trajectory optimization problem. In contrast to previous methods which often assume simplified geometries of the robot and object or do not explicitly model finger rolling, we propose a method to further extend the capabilities of dexterous manipulation by accounting for non-trivial geometries of both the robot and the object. By integrating the object's Signed Distance Field (SDF) with a sampling method, our method estimates contact and rolling-related variables and includes those in a trajectory optimization framework. This formulation naturally allows for the emergence of finger-rolling behaviors, enabling the robot to locally adjust the contact points. Our method is tested in a peg alignment task and a screwdriver turning task, where it outperforms the baselines in terms of achieving desired object configurations and avoiding dropping the object. We also successfully apply our method to a real-world screwdriver turning task, demonstrating its robustness to the sim2real gap.</p></details> |  |

For periods of time, fish may be far from the receivers, resulting in the absence of observations. The lack of information on the fish's location for extended time periods poses challenges to the understanding of fish movement patterns, and hence, the identification of proper statistical inference frameworks for modeling the trajectories. As the initial step in our methodology, in this paper, we implement an imputation strategy that relies on both Markov chain and Brownian motion principles to enhance our dataset over time. This methodology will be generalizable and applicable to all fish species with similar migration patterns or data with similar structures due to the use of static acoustic receivers.</p></details> |  |

| **[Differentially Private Spatiotemporal Trajectory Synthesis with Retained Data Utility](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12842v1)** | 2024-08-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatiotemporal trajectories collected from GPS-enabled devices are of vital importance to many applications, such as urban planning and traffic analysis. Due to the privacy leakage concerns, many privacy-preserving trajectory publishing methods have been proposed. However, most of them could not strike a good balance between privacy protection and good data utility. In this paper, we propose DP-STTS, a differentially private spatiotemporal trajectory synthesizer with high data utility, which employs a model composed of a start spatiotemporal cube distribution and a 1-order Markov process. Specially, DP-STTS firstly discretizes the raw spatiotemporal trajectories into neighboring cubes, such that the model size is limited and the model's tolerance for noise could be enhanced. Then, a Markov process is utilized for the next location point picking. After adding noise under differential privacy (DP) to the model, synthetic trajectories that preserve essential spatial and temporal characteristics of the real trajectories are generated from the noisy model. Experiments on one real-life dataset demonstrate that DP-STTS provides good data utility. Our code is available at https://github.com/Etherious72/DP-STTS.</p></details> | 6 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Minimizing Movement Delay for Movable Antennas via Trajectory Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12813v1)** | 2024-08-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Movable antennas (MAs) have received increasing attention in wireless communications due to their capability of antenna position adjustment to reconfigure wireless channels. However, moving MAs results in non-negligible delay, which may decrease the effective data transmission time. To reduce the movement delay, we study in this paper a new MA trajectory optimization problem. In particular, given the desired destination positions of multiple MAs, we aim to jointly optimize their associations with the initial MA positions and the trajectories for moving them from their respective initial to destination positions within a given two-dimensional (2D) region, such that the delay of antenna movement is minimized, subject to the inter-MA minimum distance constraints in the movement. However, this problem is a continuous-time mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem that is challenging to solve. To tackle this challenge, we propose a two-stage optimization framework that sequentially optimizes the MAs' position associations and trajectories, respectively. First, we relax the inter-MA distance constraints and optimally solve the resulted delay minimization problem. Next, we check if the obtained MA association and trajectory solutions satisfy the inter-MA distance constraints. If not satisfied, we then employ a successive convex approximation (SCA) algorithm to adjust the MAs' trajectories until they satisfy the given constraints. Simulation results are provided to show the effectiveness of our proposed trajectory optimization method in reducing the movement delay as well as draw useful insights.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages,6 figures, submit to GLOBECOM 2024 Workshop - IRAFWCC</p></details> |
| **[DBHP: Trajectory Imputation in Multi-Agent Sports Using Derivative-Based Hybrid Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10878v2)** | 2024-08-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many spatiotemporal domains handle multi-agent trajectory data, but in real-world scenarios, collected trajectory data are often partially missing due to various reasons. While existing approaches demonstrate good performance in trajectory imputation, they face challenges in capturing the complex dynamics and interactions between agents due to a lack of physical constraints that govern realistic trajectories, leading to suboptimal results. To address this issue, the paper proposes a Derivative-Based Hybrid Prediction (DBHP) framework that can effectively impute multiple agents' missing trajectories. First, a neural network equipped with Set Transformers produces a naive prediction of missing trajectories while satisfying the permutation-equivariance in terms of the order of input agents. Then, the framework makes alternative predictions leveraging velocity and acceleration information and combines all the predictions with properly determined weights to provide final imputed trajectories. In this way, our proposed framework not only accurately predicts position, velocity, and acceleration values but also enforces the physical relationship between them, eventually improving both the accuracy and naturalness of the predicted trajectories. Accordingly, the experiment results about imputing player trajectories in team sports show that our framework significantly outperforms existing imputation baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Shortsighted Navigation: Merging Best View Trajectory Planning with Robot Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12513v1)** | 2024-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Gathering visual information effectively to monitor known environments is a key challenge in robotics. To be as efficient as human surveyors, robotic systems must continuously collect observational data required to complete their survey task. Inspection personnel instinctively know to look at relevant equipment that happens to be ``along the way.'' In this paper, we introduce a novel framework for continuous long-horizon viewpoint planning, for ground robots, applied to tasks involving patrolling, monitoring or visual data gathering in known environments. Our approach to Long Horizon Viewpoint Planning (LHVP), enables the robot to autonomously navigate and collect environmental data optimizing for coverage over the horizon of the patrol. Leveraging a quadruped's mobility and sensory capabilities, our LHVP framework plans patrol paths that account for coupling the viewpoint planner for the arm camera with the mobile base's navigation planner. The viewpath optimization algorithm seeks a balance between comprehensive environmental coverage and dynamically feasible movements, thus ensuring prolonged and effective operation in scenarios including monitoring, security surveillance, and disaster response. We validate our approach through simulations and in the real world and show that our LHVP significantly outperforms naive patrolling methods in terms of area coverage generating information-gathering trajectories for the robot arm. Our results indicate a promising direction for the deployment of mobile robots in long-term, autonomous surveying, and environmental data collection tasks, highlighting the potential of intelligent robotic systems in challenging real-world applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 8 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

However, configuring the skills' parameters for a specific task remains a manual and time-consuming endeavor. Existing approaches for learning or optimizing these parameters often require numerous real-world executions or do not work in dynamic environments. To address these challenges, we propose MuTT, a novel encoder-decoder transformer architecture designed to predict environment-aware executions of robot skills by integrating vision, trajectory, and robot skill parameters. Notably, we pioneer the fusion of vision and trajectory, introducing a novel trajectory projection. Furthermore, we illustrate MuTT's efficacy as a predictor when combined with a model-based robot skill optimizer. This approach facilitates the optimization of robot skill parameters for the current environment, without the need for real-world executions during optimization. Designed for compatibility with any representation of robot skills, MuTT demonstrates its versatility across three comprehensive experiments, showcasing superior performance across two different skill representations.</p></details> |  |

Trajectory optimisation algorithms have proved their utility in a wide variety of tasks, but, like most methods struggle scaling to the high dimensional systems ubiquitous to non-prehensile manipulation in clutter as well as deformable object manipulation. We reason that, during manipulation, different degrees of freedom will become more or less important to the task over time as the system evolves. We leverage this idea to reduce the number of degrees of freedom considered in a trajectory optimisation problem, to reduce planning times. This idea is particularly relevant in the context of model predictive control (MPC) where the cost landscape of the optimisation problem is constantly evolving. We provide simulation results under asynchronous MPC and show our methods are capable of achieving better overall performance due to the decreased policy lag whilst still being able to optimise trajectories effectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 4 figures, accepted to WAFR 2024</p></details> |

This paper introduces a self-optimizing controller, Type-1 fuzzyPID, which leverages dynamic and static system response analysis to overcome the limitations of manual tuning. To account for system uncertainties, an Interval Type-2 fuzzyPID controller is also developed. Both controllers are designed using Matlab/Simulink and tested through trajectory tracking simulations in the CoppeliaSim environment. Additionally, a non-linear model predictive controller(NMPC) is proposed and compared against the fuzzyPID controllers. The impact of tunable parameters on NMPC tracking accuracy is thoroughly examined. We also present plots of the step-response characteristics and noise rejection experiments for each controller. Simulation results validate the precision and effectiveness of NMPC over fuzzyPID controllers while trading computational complexity.

To tackle this challenge, we propose a progressive 3D editing strategy that ensures multi-view consistency via a Trajectory-Anchored Scheme (TAS) with a dual-branch editing mechanism. Specifically, TAS facilitates a tightly coupled iterative process between 2D view editing and 3D updating, preventing error accumulation yielded from text-to-image process. Additionally, we explore the relationship between optimization-based methods and reconstruction-based methods, offering a unified perspective for selecting superior design choice, supporting the rationale behind the designed TAS. We further present a tuning-free View-Consistent Attention Control (VCAC) module that leverages cross-view semantic and geometric reference from the source branch to yield aligned views from the target branch during the editing of 2D views. To validate the effectiveness of our method, we analyze 2D examples to demonstrate the improved consistency with the VCAC module. Further extensive quantitative and qualitative results in text-guided 3D scene editing indicate that our method achieves superior editing quality compared to state-of-the-art methods. We will make the complete codebase publicly available following the conclusion of the review process.</p></details> |  |

Traditional methods often struggle to balance resource conservation, accurate state estimation and precise tracking, resulting in suboptimal performance. This problem is particularly pronounced in environments with large action spaces, where the need for frequent, accurate state data is paramount, yet the capacity for active localization updates is restricted by external limitations. This paper introduces ComTraQ-MPC, a novel framework that combines Deep Q-Networks (DQN) and Model Predictive Control (MPC) to optimize trajectory tracking with constrained active localization updates. The meta-trained DQN ensures adaptive active localization scheduling, while the MPC leverages available state information to improve tracking. The central contribution of this work is their reciprocal interaction: DQN's update decisions inform MPC's control strategy, and MPC's outcomes refine DQN's learning, creating a cohesive, adaptive system. Empirical evaluations in simulated and real-world settings demonstrate that ComTraQ-MPC significantly enhances operational efficiency and accuracy, providing a generalizable and approximately optimal solution for trajectory tracking in complex partially observable environments.</p></details> | * Equal contribution |

Understanding the importance of risk factors measured at a mental health visit can help clinicians evaluate future risk and provide appropriate care during the visit. In prediction settings where data are collected over time, such as in mental health care, it is often of interest to understand both the importance of variables for predicting the response at each time point and the importance summarized over the time series. Building on recent advances in estimation and inference for variable importance measures, we define summaries of variable importance trajectories and corresponding estimators. The same approaches for inference can be applied to these measures regardless of the choice of the algorithm(s) used to estimate the prediction function. We propose a nonparametric efficient estimation and inference procedure as well as a null hypothesis testing procedure that are valid even when complex machine learning tools are used for prediction. Through simulations, we demonstrate that our proposed procedures have good operating characteristics. We use these approaches to analyze electronic health records data from two large health systems to investigate the longitudinal importance of risk factors for suicide attempt to inform future suicide prevention research and clinical workflow.</p></details> | <details><summary>81 pa...</summary><p>81 pages (34 main, 47 supplementary), 8 figures (4 main, 4 supplementary), 29 tables (2 main, 27 supplementary)</p></details> |
| **[Towards reliable real-time trajectory optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10731v1)** | 2024-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motion planning is a key aspect of robotics. A common approach to address motion planning problems is trajectory optimization. Trajectory optimization can represent the high-level behaviors of robots through mathematical formulations. However, current trajectory optimization approaches have two main challenges. Firstly, their solution heavily depends on the initial guess, and they are prone to get stuck in local minima. Secondly, they face scalability limitations by increasing the number of constraints. This thesis endeavors to tackle these challenges by introducing four innovative trajectory optimization algorithms to improve reliability, scalability, and computational efficiency. There are two novel aspects of the proposed algorithms. The first key innovation is remodeling the kinematic constraints and collision avoidance constraints. Another key innovation lies in the design of algorithms that effectively utilize parallel computation on GPU accelerators. By using reformulated constraints and leveraging the computational power of GPUs, the proposed algorithms of this thesis demonstrate significant improvements in efficiency and scalability compared to the existing methods. Parallelization enables faster computation times, allowing for real-time decision-making in dynamic environments. Moreover, the algorithms are designed to adapt to changes in the environment, ensuring robust performance. Extensive benchmarking for each proposed optimizer validates their efficacy. Overall, this thesis makes a significant contribution to the field of trajectory optimization algorithms. It introduces innovative solutions that specifically address the challenges faced by existing methods. The proposed algorithms pave the way for more efficient and robust motion planning solutions in robotics by leveraging parallel computation and specific mathematical structures.</p></details> | <details><summary>PhD T...</summary><p>PhD Thesis, University of Tartu, 2024.

Traditional automated driving systems recalculate the entire trajectory in a changing environment. Instead, a novel approach retains valid trajectory segments, minimizing the need for complete replanning and reducing changes to the original plan. This work introduces a trajectory repairing framework that calculates a feasible evasive trajectory while computing the Feasible Time-to-React (F-TTR), balancing the maintenance of the original plan with safety assurance. The framework employs a binary search algorithm to iteratively create repaired trajectories, guaranteeing both the safety and feasibility of the trajectory repairing result. In contrast to earlier approaches that separated the calculation of safety metrics from trajectory repairing, which resulted in unsuccessful plans for evasive maneuvers, our work has the anytime capability to provide both a Feasible Time-to-React and an evasive trajectory for further execution.</p></details> |  |

Previous rule-based approaches without the integration of semantic information show a limitation in both efficiency and accuracy. Semantic information, such as activity types inferred from Points of Interest (POI) data, can significantly enhance the quality of trajectory mining. However, integrating these insights is challenging, as many POIs have incomplete feature information, and current learning-based POI algorithms require the integrity of datasets to do the classification. In this paper, we introduce a novel pipeline for human travel trajectory mining. Our approach first leverages the strong inferential and comprehension capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to annotate POI with activity types and then uses a Bayesian-based algorithm to infer activity for each stay point in a trajectory. In our evaluation using the OpenStreetMap (OSM) POI dataset, our approach achieves a 93.4% accuracy and a 96.1% F-1 score in POI classification, and a 91.7% accuracy with a 92.3% F-1 score in activity inference.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, accepted for the 27th IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC 2024)</p></details> |

A particularly concerning threat is the vulnerability of CPS to deceptive attacks that degrade system performance while remaining undetected. This paper investigates perfectly undetectable false data injection attacks (FDIAs) targeting the trajectory tracking control of a non-holonomic mobile robot. The proposed attack method utilizes affine transformations of intercepted signals, exploiting weaknesses inherent in the partially linear dynamic properties and symmetry of the nonlinear plant. The feasibility and potential impact of these attacks are validated through experiments using a Turtlebot 3 platform, highlighting the urgent need for sophisticated detection mechanisms and resilient control strategies to safeguard CPS against such threats. Furthermore, a novel approach for detection of these attacks called the state monitoring signature function (SMSF) is introduced. An example SMSF, a carefully designed function resilient to FDIA, is shown to be able to detect the presence of a FDIA through signatures based on systems states.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 17 figures.

Existing benchmarks rely on datasets, which are biased towards more common scenarios, such as cruising, and distance-based metrics that are computed by averaging over all scenarios. Following such a regiment provides a little insight into the properties of the models both in terms of how well they can handle different scenarios and how admissible and diverse their outputs are. There exist a number of complementary metrics designed to measure the admissibility and diversity of trajectories, however, they suffer from biases, such as length of trajectories. In this paper, we propose a new benChmarking paRadIgm for evaluaTing trajEctoRy predIction Approaches (CRITERIA). Particularly, we propose 1) a method for extracting driving scenarios at varying levels of specificity according to the structure of the roads, models' performance, and data properties for fine-grained ranking of prediction models; 2) A set of new bias-free metrics for measuring diversity, by incorporating the characteristics of a given scenario, and admissibility, by considering the structure of roads and kinematic compliancy, motivated by real-world driving constraints. 3) Using the proposed benchmark, we conduct extensive experimentation on a representative set of the prediction models using the large scale Argoverse dataset. We show that the proposed benchmark can produce a more accurate ranking of the models and serve as a means of characterizing their behavior. We further present ablation studies to highlight contributions of different elements that are used to compute the proposed metrics.</p></details> |  |

The low-dimensional signals that capture internal brain states are useful for building brain machine interfaces and understanding the neural computation underlying meaningful behavior. We derive a practical upper bound to the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of inferred neural latent trajectories using Fisher information. We show that the SNR bound is proportional to the overdispersion factor and the Fisher information per neuron. Further numerical experiments show that inference methods that exploit the temporal regularities can achieve higher SNRs that are proportional to the bound. Our results provide insights for fitting models to data, simulating neural responses, and design of experiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This article is accepted for publication in the 2024 European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)</p></details> |

Most modern methods, however, tend to model such processes through at most piecewise-continuous trajectories. To address this, we adopt a way of viewing events not as standalone phenomena but instead as observations of a Gaussian Process, which in turn governs the actor's dynamics. We propose integrating these obtained dynamics, resulting in a continuous-trajectory modification of the widely successful Neural ODE model. Through Gaussian Process theory, we were able to evaluate the uncertainty in an actor's representation, which arises from not observing them between events. This estimate led us to develop a novel, theoretically backed negative feedback mechanism. Empirical studies indicate that our model with Gaussian process interpolation and negative feedback achieves state-of-the-art performance, with improvements up to 20% AUROC against similar architectures.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exact Trajectory Similarity Search With N-tree: An Efficient Metric Index for kNN and Range Queries](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07650v1)** | 2024-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Similarity search is the problem of finding in a collection of objects those that are similar to a given query object. It is a fundamental problem in modern applications and the objects considered may be as diverse as locations in space, text documents, images, twitter messages, or trajectories of moving objects. In this paper we are motivated by the latter application. Trajectories are recorded movements of mobile objects such as vehicles, animals, public transportation, or parts of the human body. We propose a novel distance function called DistanceAvg to capture the similarity of such movements. To be practical, it is necessary to provide indexing for this distance measure. Fortunately we do not need to start from scratch. A generic and unifying approach is metric space, which organizes the set of objects solely by a distance (similarity) function with certain natural properties. Our function DistanceAvg is a metric. Although metric indexes have been studied for decades and many such structures are available, they do not offer the best performance with trajectories. In this paper we propose a new design, which outperforms the best existing indexes for kNN queries and is equally good for range queries. It is especially suitable for expensive distance functions as they occur in trajectory similarity search. In many applications, kNN queries are more practical than range queries as it may be difficult to determine an appropriate search radius. Our index provides exact result sets for the given distance function.</p></details> | 54 pages, 26 figures |

Despite increasing interest, recent works face challenges in achieving aesthetically appealing choreography, primarily for two key issues: multi-dancer collision and single-dancer foot slide. To address these issues, we propose a Trajectory-Controllable Diffusion (TCDiff), a novel approach that harnesses non-overlapping trajectories to facilitate coherent dance movements. Specifically, to tackle dancer collisions, we introduce a Dance-Beat Navigator capable of generating trajectories for multiple dancers based on the music, complemented by a Distance-Consistency loss to maintain appropriate spacing among trajectories within a reasonable threshold. To mitigate foot sliding, we present a Footwork Adaptor that utilizes trajectory displacement from adjacent frames to enable flexible footwork, coupled with a Relative Forward-Kinematic loss to adjust the positioning of individual dancers' root nodes and joints. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art results.</p></details> |  |

The proposed method integrates risk awareness and trajectory planning by leveraging probabilistic models to evaluate the likelihood of collisions with dynamic and static obstacles. The RALTPER focuses on collision avoidance constraints for both the ego vehicle region and the Gaussian-obstacle risk region. Additionally, this work enhances the generalization of both vehicle and obstacle models, making the planner adaptable to a wider range of scenarios. Our approach formulates the planning problem as a nonlinear optimization, solved using the IPOPT solver within the CasADi environment. The planner is evaluated through simulations of various challenging scenarios, including complex, static, mixed environment and narrow single-lane avoidance of pedestrians. Results demonstrate that RALTPER achieves safer and more efficient trajectory planning particularly in navigating narrow areas where a more accurate vehicle profile representation is critical for avoiding collisions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory Planning for Teleoperated Space Manipulators Using Deep Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05460v1)** | 2024-08-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory planning for teleoperated space manipulators involves challenges such as accurately modeling system dynamics, particularly in free-floating modes with non-holonomic constraints, and managing time delays that increase model uncertainty and affect control precision. Traditional teleoperation methods rely on precise dynamic models requiring complex parameter identification and calibration, while data-driven methods do not require prior knowledge but struggle with time delays. A novel framework utilizing deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is introduced to address these challenges. The framework incorporates three methods: Mapping, Prediction, and State Augmentation, to handle delays when delayed state information is received at the master end. The Soft Actor Critic (SAC) algorithm processes the state information to compute the next action, which is then sent to the remote manipulator for environmental interaction. Four environments are constructed using the MuJoCo simulation platform to account for variations in base and target fixation: fixed base and target, fixed base with rotated target, free-floating base with fixed target, and free-floating base with rotated target. Extensive experiments with both constant and random delays are conducted to evaluate the proposed methods. Results demonstrate that all three methods effectively address trajectory planning challenges, with State Augmentation showing superior efficiency and robustness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Nonlinear Propagation of Non-Gaussian Uncertainties: Theory and Applications to Spacecraft Trajectory Design](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05384v1)** | 2024-08-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a novel approach for propagating uncertainties in dynamical systems building on high-order Taylor expansions of the flow and moment-generating functions (MGFs). Unlike prior methods that focus on Gaussian distributions, our approach leverages the relationship between MGFs and distribution moments to extend high-order uncertainty propagation techniques to non-Gaussian scenarios. This significantly broadens the applicability of these methods to a wider range of problems and uncertainty types. High-order moment computations are performed one-off and symbolically, reducing the computational burden of the technique to the calculation of Taylor series coefficients around a nominal trajectory, achieved by efficiently integrating the system's variational equations. Furthermore, the use of the proposed approach in combination with event transition tensors, allows for accurate propagation of uncertainties at specific events, such as the landing surface of a celestial body, the crossing of a predefined Poincar\'e section, or the trigger of an arbitrary event during the propagation. Via numerical simulations we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in various astrodynamics applications, including the unperturbed and perturbed two-body problem, and the circular restricted three-body problem, showing that it accurately propagates non-Gaussian uncertainties both at future times and at event manifolds.</p></details> |  |

Building on prior work, it addresses the multi-robot communication-aware trajectory planning problem using a general optimisation framework that imposes linear constraints on changes in robot positions to ensure communication performance and collision avoidance. In this paper, the optimisation problem is solved distributively by separating the communication performance constraint through an economic approach. Here, the current communication budget is distributed equally among the robots, and the robots are allowed to trade parts of their budgets with each other. The separated optimisation problem is then solved using the consensus alternating direction method of multipliers. The method was verified through simulation in an inspection task problem.</p></details> |  |
| **[TrajCogn: Leveraging LLMs for Cognizing Movement Patterns and Travel Purposes from Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12459v2)** | 2024-08-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal trajectories are crucial in various data mining tasks. It is important to develop a versatile trajectory learning method that performs different tasks with high accuracy. This involves effectively extracting two core aspects of information--movement patterns and travel purposes--from trajectories. However, this is challenging due to limitations in model capacity and the quality and scale of trajectory datasets. Meanwhile, large language models (LLMs) have shown great success in versatility by training on large-scale, high-quality datasets. Given the similarities between trajectories and sentences, there's potential to leverage LLMs to develop an effective trajectory learning method. However, standard LLMs are not designed to handle the unique spatio-temporal features of trajectories and cannot extract movement patterns and travel purposes. To address these challenges, we propose a model called TrajCogn that effectively utilizes LLMs to model trajectories. TrajCogn leverages the strengths of LLMs to create a versatile trajectory learning approach while addressing the limitations of standard LLMs. First, TrajCogn incorporates a novel trajectory semantic embedder that enables LLMs to process spatio-temporal features and extract movement patterns and travel purposes. Second, TrajCogn introduces a new trajectory prompt that integrates these patterns and purposes into LLMs, allowing the model to adapt to various tasks. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets and two representative tasks demonstrate that TrajCogn successfully achieves its design goals.

| **[PTrajM: Efficient and Semantic-rich Trajectory Learning with Pretrained Trajectory-Mamba](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04916v1)** | 2024-08-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vehicle trajectories provide crucial movement information for various real-world applications. To better utilize vehicle trajectories, it is essential to develop a trajectory learning approach that can effectively and efficiently extract rich semantic information, including movement behavior and travel purposes, to support accurate downstream applications. However, creating such an approach presents two significant challenges. First, movement behavior are inherently spatio-temporally continuous, making them difficult to extract efficiently from irregular and discrete trajectory points. Second, travel purposes are related to the functionalities of areas and road segments traversed by vehicles. These functionalities are not available from the raw spatio-temporal trajectory features and are hard to extract directly from complex textual features associated with these areas and road segments. To address these challenges, we propose PTrajM, a novel method capable of efficient and semantic-rich vehicle trajectory learning. To support efficient modeling of movement behavior, we introduce Trajectory-Mamba as the learnable model of PTrajM, which effectively extracts continuous movement behavior while being more computationally efficient than existing structures. To facilitate efficient extraction of travel purposes, we propose a travel purpose-aware pre-training procedure, which enables PTrajM to discern the travel purposes of trajectories without additional computational resources during its embedding process. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets and comparisons with several state-of-the-art trajectory learning methods demonstrate the effectiveness of PTrajM.

Two phonological feature sets, based respectively on generative and articulatory phonology, are used to encode a phonetic target sequence. Different interpolation techniques are compared to generate smooth trajectories in these feature spaces, with a potential optimisation of the target value and timing to capture co-articulation effects. We report the Pearson correlation between a linear projection of the generated trajectories and articulatory data derived from a multi-speaker dataset of electromagnetic articulography (EMA) recordings. A correlation of 0.67 is obtained with an extended feature set based on generative phonology and a linear interpolation technique.

This paper introduces a novel methodology for trajectory forecasting based on state-space dynamic system modeling, which endows agents with models that have tangible physical implications. To enhance the precision of state estimations within the dynamic system, the paper also presents a novel modeling technique for control variables. This technique utilizes a newly introduced model, termed "Mixed Mamba," to derive initial control states, thereby improving the predictive accuracy of these variables. Moverover, the proposed approach ingeniously integrates graph neural networks with state-space models, effectively capturing the complexities of multi-agent interactions. This combination provides a robust and scalable framework for forecasting multi-agent trajectories across a range of scenarios. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that this model outperforms several established benchmarks across various metrics and datasets, highlighting its significant potential to advance trajectory forecasting in autonomous systems.</p></details> |  |

We aim to learn temporal latent representations of the underlying generative process that explain the observed patient disease trajectories in an interpretable and comprehensive way. To enhance the interpretability of these latent temporal processes, we develop a semi-supervised approach for disentangling the latent space using established medical knowledge. By combining the generative approach with medical definitions of different characteristics of SSc, we facilitate the discovery of new aspects of the disease. We show that the learned temporal latent processes can be utilized for further data analysis and clinical hypothesis testing, including finding similar patients and clustering SSc patient trajectories into novel sub-types. Moreover, our method enables personalized online monitoring and prediction of multivariate time series with uncertainty quantification.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Machine Learning for Healthcare 2024. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2311.08149</p></details> |
| **[Grasping Trajectory Optimization with Point Clouds](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05466v2)** | 2024-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a new trajectory optimization method for robotic grasping based on a point-cloud representation of robots and task spaces. In our method, robots are represented by 3D points on their link surfaces. The task space of a robot is represented by a point cloud that can be obtained from depth sensors. Using the point-cloud representation, goal reaching in grasping can be formulated as point matching, while collision avoidance can be efficiently achieved by querying the signed distance values of the robot points in the signed distance field of the scene points. Consequently, a constrained nonlinear optimization problem is formulated to solve the joint motion and grasp planning problem. The advantage of our method is that the point-cloud representation is general to be used with any robot in any environment. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by performing experiments on a tabletop scene and a shelf scene for grasping with a Fetch mobile manipulator and a Franka Panda arm.

While these questions can be studied by employing multiple datasets, it is challenging due to several discrepancies, e.g., in data formats, map resolution, and semantic annotation types. To address these challenges, we introduce UniTraj, a comprehensive framework that unifies various datasets, models, and evaluation criteria, presenting new opportunities for the vehicle trajectory prediction field. In particular, using UniTraj, we conduct extensive experiments and find that model performance significantly drops when transferred to other datasets. However, enlarging data size and diversity can substantially improve performance, leading to a new state-of-the-art result for the nuScenes dataset.

Our goal is to compute suitable trajectories that (1) satisfy the environment-specific traversability constraints and (2) generate human-like paths while navigating in crosswalks, sidewalks, etc. Our formulation uses a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) generative model enhanced with traversability constraints to generate multiple candidate trajectories for global navigation. We use VLMs and a visual prompting approach with their zero-shot ability of semantic understanding and logical reasoning to choose the best trajectory given the contextual information about the task. We evaluate our methods in various outdoor scenes with wheeled robots and compare the performance with other global navigation algorithms. In practice, we observe at least 3.35% improvement in traversability and 20.61% improvement in terms of human-like navigation in generated trajectories in challenging outdoor navigation scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Pose-Aware Self-Supervised Learning with Viewpoint Trajectory Regularization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14973v2)** | 2024-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning visual features from unlabeled images has proven successful for semantic categorization, often by mapping different $views$ of the same object to the same feature to achieve recognition invariance. However, visual recognition involves not only identifying $what$ an object is but also understanding $how$ it is presented. For example, seeing a car from the side versus head-on is crucial for deciding whether to stay put or jump out of the way. While unsupervised feature learning for downstream viewpoint reasoning is important, it remains under-explored, partly due to the lack of a standardized evaluation method and benchmarks. We introduce a new dataset of adjacent image triplets obtained from a viewpoint trajectory, without any semantic or pose labels. We benchmark both semantic classification and pose estimation accuracies on the same visual feature. Additionally, we propose a viewpoint trajectory regularization loss for learning features from unlabeled image triplets. Our experiments demonstrate that this approach helps develop a visual representation that encodes object identity and organizes objects by their poses, retaining semantic classification accuracy while achieving emergent global pose awareness and better generalization to novel objects.

Learning-based methods are currently showing impressive results in simulation-based challenges, with transformer-based architectures technologically leading the way. Ultimately, however, predictions are needed in the real world. In addition to the shifts from simulation to the real world, many vehicle- and country-specific shifts, i.e. differences in sensor systems, fusion and perception algorithms as well as traffic rules and laws, are on the agenda. Since models that can cover all system setups and design domains at once are not yet foreseeable, model adaptation plays a central role. Therefore, a simulation-based study on transfer learning techniques is conducted on basis of a transformer-based model. Furthermore, the study aims to provide insights into possible trade-offs between computational time and performance to support effective transfers into the real world.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in 2024 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV), Jeju Shinhwa World, Jeju Island, Korea, June 2-5, 2024</p></details> |

Such a robot needs to be able to constantly adapt to the surrounding scene based on egocentric vision, and predict the ego motion of the wearer. In this work, we leveraged body-mounted cameras and sensors to anticipate the trajectory of human wearers through complex surroundings. To facilitate research in ego-motion prediction, we have collected a comprehensive walking scene navigation dataset centered on the user's perspective. We then present a method to predict human motion conditioning on the surrounding static scene. Our method leverages a diffusion model to produce a distribution of potential future trajectories, taking into account the user's observation of the environment. To that end, we introduce a compact representation to encode the user's visual memory of the surroundings, as well as an efficient sample-generating technique to speed up real-time inference of a diffusion model. We ablate our model and compare it to baselines, and results show that our model outperforms existing methods on key metrics of collision avoidance and trajectory mode coverage.</p></details> | 13 pages, 9 figures |

In this work, we introduce Stochastic Trajectory Optimization for Demonstration Imitation (STODI), a trajectory optimization framework for robots to imitate the shape of demonstration trajectories with improved dynamic performance. Consistent with the human learning process, demonstration imitation serves as an initial step, while trajectory optimization aims to enhance robot motion performance. By generating random noise and constructing proper cost functions, the STODI effectively explores and exploits generated noisy trajectories while preserving the demonstration shape characteristics. We employ three metrics to measure the similarity of trajectories in both the time and frequency domains to help with demonstration imitation. Theoretical analysis reveals relationships among these metrics, emphasizing the benefits of frequency-domain analysis for specific tasks. Experiments on a 7-DOF robotic arm in the PyBullet simulator validate the efficacy of the STODI framework, showcasing the improved optimization performance and stability compared to previous methods.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose a holistic framework that jointly optimizes the total latency and energy consumption for UAV-assisted fog computing in a three-dimensional spatial domain with varying terrain elevations and dynamic task generations. Our proposed framework considers three important and interdependent modules: attitude control, trajectory planning, and task assignment. We first establish a fuzzy proportional-integral-derivative control model to determine the UAV's attitude. Then, we propose an enhanced Ant Colony System (ACS) based algorithm, that includes a safety value and a decoupling mechanism to overcome the convergence issue in classical ACS, to compute the optimal UAV trajectory. Finally, we design an algorithm based on the Particle Swarm Optimization technique, to determine where each offloaded task should be executed. Under our proposed framework, the outcome of one module would affect the decision-making in one other, providing a holistic perspective of the system and thus leading to improved solutions. We demonstrate by extensive simulation results that our proposed framework can significantly improve the overall performance, measured by latency and energy consumption, compared to existing baseline approaches.</p></details> | 14 pages, 10 figures |

Such manoeuvring flight envelope variations, governed by the aircraft's complex nonlinear dynamics, are unpredictable by pilots and existing flight management systems. To prevent in-flight Loss of Control, post-failure trajectories must be optimal, planned in real-time, avoid terrain, and adhere to the impaired aircraft's reduced manoeuvrability and dynamic constraints. This paper presents a novel real-time trajectory optimization method for impaired aircraft based on a combination of differential flatness theory, the pseudospectral method, nonlinear programming, and inverse dynamics. In the proposed method, which utilizes a high-fidelity nonlinear six degree-of-freedom model, to conform to aircraft's altered dynamics a sequence of trim points is selected from the impaired aircraft's manoeuvring flight envelope based on the chosen optimization criteria, ensuring that the resulting three-dimensional trajectory observes terrain avoidance. Then, the required control inputs are obtained for each manoeuvre in less than a second. The method is applied to the NASA Generic Transport Model with rudder failure near a complex mountainous terrain. Both an optimal one-piece trajectory and a near-optimal piecewise path consisting of several optimal trajectories, are generated in non-real-time and real-time, respectively, and compared.

Existing motion prediction approaches have ample room for improvement, particularly in terms of long-term prediction accuracy and interpretability. In this paper, we address these challenges by proposing LC-LLM, an explainable lane change prediction model that leverages the strong reasoning capabilities and self-explanation abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Essentially, we reformulate the lane change prediction task as a language modeling problem, processing heterogeneous driving scenario information as natural language prompts for LLMs and employing supervised fine-tuning to tailor LLMs specifically for lane change prediction task. Additionally, we finetune the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning to improve prediction transparency and reliability, and include explanatory requirements in the prompts during inference stage. Therefore, our LC-LLM model not only predicts lane change intentions and trajectories but also provides CoT reasoning and explanations for its predictions, enhancing its interpretability. Extensive experiments based on the large-scale highD dataset demonstrate the superior performance and interpretability of our LC-LLM in lane change prediction task. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to utilize LLMs for predicting lane change behavior. Our study shows that LLMs can effectively encode comprehensive interaction information for driving behavior understanding.</p></details> | 12 pages, 9 figures |

Due to a large amount of variability in brain anatomy between different individuals, we hypothesize that leveraging MRI time series can help improve specificity, by treating each patient as their own baseline. Here we turn to conditional variational autoencoders to generate individualized MRI predictions given the subject's age, disease status and one previous scan. Using serial imaging data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, we train a novel architecture to build a latent space distribution which can be sampled from to generate future predictions of changing anatomy. This enables us to extrapolate beyond the dataset and predict MRIs up to 10 years. We evaluated the model on a held-out set from ADNI and an independent dataset (from Open Access Series of Imaging Studies). By comparing to several alternatives, we show that our model produces more individualized images with higher resolution. Further, if an individual already has a follow-up MRI, we demonstrate a usage of our model to compute a likelihood ratio classifier for disease status. In practice, the model may be able to assist in early diagnosis of AD and provide a counterfactual baseline trajectory for treatment effect estimation. Furthermore, it generates a synthetic dataset that can potentially be used for downstream tasks such as anomaly detection and classification.</p></details> | <details><summary>MICCA...</summary><p>MICCAI 2024 LDTM workshop</p></details> |

In particular, the tasks of different types and service requirements in MEC network are offloaded from one UAV to another. To pursue the goal of low-carbon edge computing, we study the problem of minimizing system energy consumption by jointly optimizing computation resource allocation, task scheduling, service placement, and UAV trajectories. Considering the inherent unpredictability associated with task generation and the dynamic nature of wireless fading channels, addressing this problem presents a significant challenge. To overcome this issue, we reformulate the complicated non-convex problem as a Markov decision process and propose a soft actor-critic-based trajectory optimization and resource allocation algorithm to implement a flexible learning strategy. Numerical results illustrate that within a multi-UAV-enabled MEC network, the proposed algorithm effectively reduces the system energy consumption in heterogeneous tasks and services scenarios compared to other baseline solutions.</p></details> | 11 pages, 10 figures |

With the rapid advancement in connected technologies, such as vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication, valuable information from alternate views becomes accessible via wireless networks. The integration of information from alternative views has the potential to overcome the inherent limitations associated with a single viewpoint, such as occlusions and limited field of view. In this work, we introduce V2INet, a novel trajectory prediction framework designed to model multi-view data by extending existing single-view models. Unlike previous approaches where the multi-view data is manually fused or formulated as a separate training stage, our model supports end-to-end training, enhancing both flexibility and performance. Moreover, the predicted multimodal trajectories are calibrated by a post-hoc conformal prediction module to get valid and efficient confidence regions. We evaluated the entire framework using the real-world V2I dataset V2X-Seq.

| **[Optimizing Diffusion Models for Joint Trajectory Prediction and Controllable Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00766v1)** | 2024-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models are promising for joint trajectory prediction and controllable generation in autonomous driving, but they face challenges of inefficient inference steps and high computational demands. To tackle these challenges, we introduce Optimal Gaussian Diffusion (OGD) and Estimated Clean Manifold (ECM) Guidance. OGD optimizes the prior distribution for a small diffusion time $T$ and starts the reverse diffusion process from it. ECM directly injects guidance gradients to the estimated clean manifold, eliminating extensive gradient backpropagation throughout the network. Our methodology streamlines the generative process, enabling practical applications with reduced computational overhead. Experimental validation on the large-scale Argoverse 2 dataset demonstrates our approach's superior performance, offering a viable solution for computationally efficient, high-quality joint trajectory prediction and controllable generation for autonomous driving.

In this process, the complexity of algorithms used for vehicle control has grown significantly. Model Predictive Control (MPC) is a prominent example, which has gained enormous popularity and is now widely used for vehicle motion planning and control. However, safety concerns constrain its practical application, especially since traditional procedures of functional safety (FS), with its universal standard ISO26262, reach their limits. Concomitantly, the new aspect of safety-of-the-intended-function (SOTIF) has moved into the center of attention, whose standard, ISO21448, has only been released in 2022. Thus, experience with SOTIF is low and few case studies are available in industry and research. Hence this paper aims to make two main contributions: (1) an analysis of the SOTIF for a generic MPC-based trajectory planner and (2) an interpretation and concrete application of the generic procedures described in ISO21448 for determining functional insufficiencies (FIs) and triggering conditions (TCs). Particular novelties of the paper include an approach for the out-of-context development of SOTIF-related elements (SOTIF-EooC), a compilation of important FIs and TCs for a MPC-based trajectory planner, and an optimized safety concept based on the identified FIs and TCs for the MPC-based trajectory planner.</p></details> | Extended Version |

We propose an expression exploration framework based on deep symbolic regression (DSR) integrated with a variable intersection selection (VIS) method to find variable combinations that encourage interpretable and parsimonious mathematical expressions. In the exploration learning process, two penalty terms are added to improve the reward function: (i) a complexity penalty to regulate the complexity of the explored expressions to be parsimonious, and (ii) a variable interaction penalty to encourage the expression exploration to focus on variable combinations that can best describe the data. We show the performance of the proposed method to learn several car-following dynamics models and discuss its limitations and future research directions.</p></details> |  |

Nonetheless, the potential of transformer-based diffusion models for effectively generating videos with controllable motion remains an area of limited exploration. This paper introduces Tora, the first trajectory-oriented DiT framework that integrates textual, visual, and trajectory conditions concurrently for video generation. Specifically, Tora consists of a Trajectory Extractor~(TE), a Spatial-Temporal DiT, and a Motion-guidance Fuser~(MGF). The TE encodes arbitrary trajectories into hierarchical spacetime motion patches with a 3D video compression network. The MGF integrates the motion patches into the DiT blocks to generate consistent videos following trajectories. Our design aligns seamlessly with DiT's scalability, allowing precise control of video content's dynamics with diverse durations, aspect ratios, and resolutions. Extensive experiments demonstrate Tora's excellence in achieving high motion fidelity, while also meticulously simulating the movement of the physical world.

Learning-based approaches for multi-agent trajectory prediction, such as primarily relying on graph neural networks, graph transformers, and hypergraph neural networks, have demonstrated outstanding performance on real-world datasets in recent years. However, the hypergraph transformer-based method for trajectory prediction is yet to be explored. Therefore, we present a MultiscAle Relational Transformer (MART) network for multi-agent trajectory prediction. MART is a hypergraph transformer architecture to consider individual and group behaviors in transformer machinery. The core module of MART is the encoder, which comprises a Pair-wise Relational Transformer (PRT) and a Hyper Relational Transformer (HRT). The encoder extends the capabilities of a relational transformer by introducing HRT, which integrates hyperedge features into the transformer mechanism, promoting attention weights to focus on group-wise relations. In addition, we propose an Adaptive Group Estimator (AGE) designed to infer complex group relations in real-world environments. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets (NBA, SDD, and ETH-UCY) demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, enhancing ADE/FDE by 3.9%/11.8% on the NBA dataset.

Due to the intractable growth of non-convex constraints with the number of agents, exploring various homotopy classes that imply different convex domains, is crucial for finding a feasible solution. However, existing methods struggle to explore various homotopy classes efficiently due to combining it with time-consuming precise trajectory solution finding. CSDO, addresses this limitation by separating them into different levels and integrating an efficient Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) algorithm to search homotopy classes. It first searches for a coarse initial guess using a large search step, identifying a specific homotopy class. Subsequent decentralized Quadratic Programming (QP) refinement processes this guess, resolving minor collisions efficiently. Experimental results demonstrate that CSDO outperforms existing MVTP algorithms in large-scale, high-density scenarios, achieving up to 95% success rate in 50m $\times$ 50m random scenarios around one second.

| **[Zero Shot Health Trajectory Prediction Using Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21124v1)** | 2024-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Integrating modern machine learning and clinical decision-making has great promise for mitigating healthcare's increasing cost and complexity. We introduce the Enhanced Transformer for Health Outcome Simulation (ETHOS), a novel application of the transformer deep-learning architecture for analyzing high-dimensional, heterogeneous, and episodic health data. ETHOS is trained using Patient Health Timelines (PHTs)-detailed, tokenized records of health events-to predict future health trajectories, leveraging a zero-shot learning approach. ETHOS represents a significant advancement in foundation model development for healthcare analytics, eliminating the need for labeled data and model fine-tuning. Its ability to simulate various treatment pathways and consider patient-specific factors positions ETHOS as a tool for care optimization and addressing biases in healthcare delivery. Future developments will expand ETHOS' capabilities to incorporate a wider range of data types and data sources. Our work demonstrates a pathway toward accelerated AI development and deployment in healthcare.</p></details> |  |
| **[Acting upon Imagination: when to trust imagined trajectories in model based reinforcement learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.05716v6)** | 2024-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) aims to learn model(s) of the environment dynamics that can predict the outcome of its actions. Forward application of the model yields so called imagined trajectories (sequences of action, predicted state-reward) used to optimize the set of candidate actions that maximize expected reward. The outcome, an ideal imagined trajectory or plan, is imperfect and typically MBRL relies on model predictive control (MPC) to overcome this by continuously re-planning from scratch, incurring thus major computational cost and increasing complexity in tasks with longer receding horizon. We propose uncertainty estimation methods for online evaluation of imagined trajectories to assess whether further planned actions can be trusted to deliver acceptable reward. These methods include comparing the error after performing the last action with the standard expected error and using model uncertainty to assess the deviation from expected outcomes. Additionally, we introduce methods that exploit the forward propagation of the dynamics model to evaluate if the remainder of the plan aligns with expected results and assess the remainder of the plan in terms of the expected reward. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed uncertainty estimation methods by applying them to avoid unnecessary trajectory replanning in a shooting MBRL setting. Results highlight significant reduction on computational costs without sacrificing performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Safe and Non-Conservative Trajectory Planning for Autonomous Driving Handling Unanticipated Behaviors of Traffic Participants](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13396v2)** | 2024-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory planning for autonomous driving is challenging because the unknown future motion of traffic participants must be accounted for, yielding large uncertainty. Stochastic Model Predictive Control (SMPC)-based planners provide non-conservative planning, but do not rule out a (small) probability of collision. We propose a control scheme that yields an efficient trajectory based on SMPC when the traffic scenario allows, still avoiding that the vehicle causes collisions with traffic participants if the latter move according to the prediction assumptions. If some traffic participant does not behave as anticipated, no safety guarantee can be given. Then, our approach yields a trajectory which minimizes the probability of collision, using Constraint Violation Probability Minimization techniques. Our algorithm can also be adapted to minimize the anticipated harm caused by a collision. We provide a thorough discussion of the benefits of our novel control scheme and compare it to a previous approach through numerical simulations from the CommonRoad database.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scene-Specific Trajectory Sets: Maximizing Representation in Motion Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20732v1)** | 2024-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Representing diverse and plausible future trajectories of actors is crucial for motion forecasting in autonomous driving. However, efficiently capturing the true trajectory distribution with a compact set is challenging. In this work, we propose a novel approach for generating scene-specific trajectory sets that better represent the diversity and admissibility of future actor behavior. Our method constructs multiple trajectory sets tailored to different scene contexts, such as intersections and non-intersections, by leveraging map information and actor dynamics. We introduce a deterministic goal sampling algorithm that identifies relevant map regions and generates trajectories conditioned on the scene layout. Furthermore, we empirically investigate various sampling strategies and set sizes to optimize the trade-off between coverage and diversity. Experiments on the Argoverse 2 dataset demonstrate that our scene-specific sets achieve higher plausibility while maintaining diversity compared to traditional single-set approaches. The proposed Recursive In-Distribution Subsampling (RIDS) method effectively condenses the representation space and outperforms metric-driven sampling in terms of trajectory admissibility. Our work highlights the benefits of scene-aware trajectory set generation for capturing the complex and heterogeneous nature of actor behavior in real-world driving scenarios.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces Aircraft Trajectory Segmentation-based Contrastive Coding (ATSCC), a novel self-supervised time series representation learning framework designed to capture semantic information in air traffic trajectory data. The framework leverages the segmentable characteristic of trajectories and ensures consistency within the self-assigned segments. Intensive experiments were conducted on datasets from three different airports, totaling four datasets, comparing the learned representation's performance of downstream classification and clustering with other state-of-the-art representation learning techniques. The results show that ATSCC outperforms these methods by aligning with the labels defined by aeronautical procedures. ATSCC is adaptable to various airport configurations and scalable to incomplete trajectories. This research has expanded upon existing capabilities, achieving these improvements independently without predefined inputs such as airport configurations, maneuvering procedures, or labeled data.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 7 figures.

Typical stochastic mobility models, e.g., random waypoint model and Gauss Markov model, can hardly capture the distribution characteristics of users within real-world areas. State-of-the-art trace-based mobility models and existing learning-based trajectory generation methods, however, are frequently constrained by the inaccessibility of substantial real trajectories due to privacy concerns. In this paper, we harness the intrinsic correlation between street maps and trajectories and develop a novel zero-shot trajectory generation method, named Map2Traj, by exploiting the diffusion model. We incorporate street maps as a condition to consistently pilot the denoising process and train our model on diverse sets of real trajectories from various regions in Xi'an, China, and their corresponding street maps. With solely the street map of an unobserved area, Map2Traj generates synthetic trajectories that not only closely resemble the real-world mobility pattern but also offer comparable efficacy. Extensive experiments validate the efficacy of our proposed method on zero-shot trajectory generation tasks in terms of both trajectory and distribution similarities. In addition, a case study of employing Map2Traj in wireless network optimization is presented to validate its efficacy for downstream applications.</p></details> |  |

SAPI uses an abstract way to represent and encode surrounding environment by utilizing information from real-time map, right-of-way, and surrounding traffic. The proposed model consists of two convolutional network (CNN) and recurrent neural network (RNN)-based encoders and one decoder. A refiner is proposed to conduct a look-back operation inside the model, in order to make full use of raw history trajectory information. We evaluate SAPI on a proprietary dataset collected in real-world intersections through autonomous vehicles. It is demonstrated that SAPI shows promising performance when predicting vehicle trajectories at intersection, and outperforms benchmark methods. The average displacement error(ADE) and final displacement error(FDE) for 6-second prediction are 1.84m and 4.32m respectively. We also show that the proposed model can accurately predict vehicle trajectories in different scenarios.</p></details> |  |

Recent manifold learning-based methods have partially addressed the dimensionality and dataset size issues, but struggle with the complex text-conditional distribution. In this paper we propose a text-based trajectory generation model that attempts to address all three challenges while relying on only a handful of demonstration trajectory data. Our key idea is to leverage recent flow-based models capable of capturing complex conditional distributions, not directly in the high-dimensional trajectory space, but rather in the low-dimensional latent coordinate space of the motion manifold, with deliberately designed regularization terms to ensure smoothness of motions and robustness to text variations. We show that our {\it Motion Manifold Flow Primitive (MMFP)} framework can accurately generate qualitatively distinct motions for a wide range of text inputs, significantly outperforming existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 10 figures, under review</p></details> |

Traditional methods usually perform holistic inference on the trajectories of agents, neglecting the differences in prediction difficulty among agents. This paper proposes a novel Difficulty-Guided Feature Enhancement Network (DGFNet), which leverages the prediction difficulty differences among agents for multi-agent trajectory prediction. Firstly, we employ spatio-temporal feature encoding and interaction to capture rich spatio-temporal features. Secondly, a difficulty-guided decoder is used to control the flow of future trajectories into subsequent modules, obtaining reliable future trajectories. Then, feature interaction and fusion are performed through the future feature interaction module. Finally, the fused agent features are fed into the final predictor to generate the predicted trajectory distributions for multiple participants. Experimental results demonstrate that our DGFNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Argoverse 1\&2 motion forecasting benchmarks. Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of each module. Moreover, compared with SOTA methods, our method balances trajectory prediction accuracy and real-time inference speed.</p></details> |  |

Nevertheless, with the increasing granularity and complexity of vehicle-generated data, the lack of data quality audits raises concerns about multi-party mistrust in trajectory prediction tasks. In response, this paper proposes an asynchronous federated learning data sharing method based on an interpretable reputation quantization mechanism utilizing graph neural network tools. Data providers share data structures under differential privacy constraints to ensure security while reducing redundant data. We implement deep reinforcement learning to categorize vehicles by reputation level, which optimizes the aggregation efficiency of federated learning. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed data sharing scheme not only reinforces the security of the trajectory prediction task but also enhances prediction accuracy.</p></details> |  |

Human trajectory prediction is a noisy process, and no prediction does precisely match any future trajectory. It is therefore approached as a stochastic problem, where the goal is to minimise the error between the true and the predicted trajectory. In this work, we explore the application of metamorphic testing for human trajectory prediction. Metamorphic testing is designed to handle unclear or missing test oracles. It is well-designed for human trajectory prediction, where there is no clear criterion of correct or incorrect human behaviour. Metamorphic relations rely on transformations over source test cases and exploit invariants. A setting well-designed for human trajectory prediction where there are many symmetries of expected human behaviour under variations of the input, e.g. mirroring and rescaling of the input data. We discuss how metamorphic testing can be applied to stochastic human trajectory prediction and introduce the Wasserstein Violation Criterion to statistically assess whether a follow-up test case violates a label-preserving metamorphic relation.</p></details> | <details><summary>MET'2...</summary><p>MET'24: 9th ACM International Workshop on Metamorphic Testing</p></details> |

If the opposing vehicles do not react to the ego vehicle, they can be predicted accurately. However, if there is interaction between the vehicles, the prediction loses its validity. For high interaction, instead of a planning approach that reacts exclusively to the fixed prediction, a trajectory planning approach is required that incorporates the interaction with the opposing vehicles. This paper demonstrates the limitations of a widely used conventional sampling-based approach within a highly interactive blocking scenario. We show that high success rates are achieved for less aggressive blocking behavior but that the collision rate increases with more significant interaction. We further propose a novel Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based trajectory planning approach for racing that explicitly exploits the interaction with the opposing vehicle without requiring a prediction. In contrast to the conventional approach, the RL-based approach achieves high success rates even for aggressive blocking behavior. Furthermore, we propose a novel safety layer (SL) that intervenes when the trajectory generated by the RL-based approach is infeasible. In that event, the SL generates a sub-optimal but feasible trajectory, avoiding termination of the scenario due to a not found valid solution.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, accepted to be published at the 27th IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems, September 24 - 27, 2024, Edmonton, Canada</p></details> |

However, existing methods often struggle to simultaneously satisfy these two critical requirements. To address this issue, this paper proposes a sampling-based trajectory planning method with a hierarchical structure for formation flight in dense obstacle environments. To ensure reliable local sensing information sharing among UAVs, each UAV generates a safe flight corridor (SFC), which is transmitted to the leader UAV. Subsequently, a sampling-based formation guidance path generation method is designed as the front-end strategy, steering the formation to fly in the desired shape safely with the formation connectivity provided by the SFCs. Furthermore, a model predictive path integral (MPPI) based distributed trajectory optimization method is developed as the back-end part, which ensures the smoothness, safety and dynamics feasibility of the executable trajectory. To validate the efficiency of the developed algorithm, comprehensive simulation comparisons are conducted.

However, measuring real-world detouring behavior is challenging due to the need to track the movement of individual vehicles. Recent developments in high-resolution vehicle trajectory data have enabled transportation professionals to observe real-world detouring behaviors without the need to install and maintain hardware such as license plate reading cameras. This paper investigates the feasibility of vehicle probe trajectory data to capture commercial motor vehicle (CMV) detouring behavior under three unique case studies. Before doing so, a validation analysis was conducted to investigate the ability of CMV probe trajectory data to represent overall CMV volumes at well-calibrated count stations near virtual weigh stations (VWS) in Maryland. The validation analysis showed strong positive correlations (above 0.75) at all VWS stations. Upon validating the data, a methodology was applied to assess CMV detour behaviors associated with CMV enforcement activities, congestion avoidance, and incident induced temporary road closures.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at Transportation Research Board Annual Meeting 2024.

Existing methods often focus solely on either language or full trajectory control, lacking precision in synthesizing motions aligned with user-specified trajectories, especially for multi-joint control. To address these issues, we present TLControl, a novel method for realistic human motion synthesis, incorporating both low-level Trajectory and high-level Language semantics controls, through the integration of neural-based and optimization-based techniques. Specifically, we begin with training a VQ-VAE for a compact and well-structured latent motion space organized by body parts. We then propose a Masked Trajectories Transformer (MTT) for predicting a motion distribution conditioned on language and trajectory. Once trained, we use MTT to sample initial motion predictions given user-specified partial trajectories and text descriptions as conditioning. Finally, we introduce a test-time optimization to refine these coarse predictions for precise trajectory control, which offers flexibility by allowing users to specify various optimization goals and ensures high runtime efficiency. Comprehensive experiments show that TLControl significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art in trajectory accuracy and time efficiency, making it practical for interactive and high-quality animation generation.</p></details> |  |

This model can characterize the stubbornness of the human, which measures how strong the human adheres to his preferred trajectory. Accordingly, a static model is introduced indicating a link between the force in haptically coupled human-robot interactions and humans's stubbornness. The introduced stubbornness parameter enables an application-independent reaction of the automation for the cooperative trajectory planning. Simulation results in the context of human-machine cooperation in a care application show that the proposed behavioral model can quantitatively estimate the stubbornness of the interacting human, enabling a more targeted adaptation of the automation to the human behavior.</p></details> |  |
| **[Context-aware Multi-task Learning for Pedestrian Intent and Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17162v1)** | 2024-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The advancement of socially-aware autonomous vehicles hinges on precise modeling of human behavior. Within this broad paradigm, the specific challenge lies in accurately predicting pedestrian's trajectory and intention. Traditional methodologies have leaned heavily on historical trajectory data, frequently overlooking vital contextual cues such as pedestrian-specific traits and environmental factors. Furthermore, there's a notable knowledge gap as trajectory and intention prediction have largely been approached as separate problems, despite their mutual dependence. To bridge this gap, we introduce PTINet (Pedestrian Trajectory and Intention Prediction Network), which jointly learns the trajectory and intention prediction by combining past trajectory observations, local contextual features (individual pedestrian behaviors), and global features (signs, markings etc.). The efficacy of our approach is evaluated on widely used public datasets: JAAD and PIE, where it has demonstrated superior performance over existing state-of-the-art models in trajectory and intention prediction. The results from our experiments and ablation studies robustly validate PTINet's effectiveness in jointly exploring intention and trajectory prediction for pedestrian behaviour modelling. The experimental evaluation indicates the advantage of using global and local contextual features for pedestrian trajectory and intention prediction. The effectiveness of PTINet in predicting pedestrian behavior paves the way for the development of automated systems capable of seamlessly interacting with pedestrians in urban settings.</p></details> |  |

We represent the robot's geometry as a semialgebraic set defined by polynomial inequalities such that robots with general shapes can be suitably characterized. To address the robot navigation task in obstacle-dense environments, we exploit the free space directly to construct a sequence of free regions, and allocate each waypoint on the trajectory to a specific region. Then, we incorporate a uniform scaling factor for each free region, and formulate a Sums-of-Squares (SOS) optimization problem that renders the containment relationship between the robot and the free space computationally tractable. The SOS optimization problem is further reformulated to a semidefinite program (SDP), and the collision-free constraints are shown to be equivalent to limiting the scaling factor along the entire trajectory. In this context, the robot at a specific configuration is tailored to stay within the free region. Next, to solve the trajectory optimization problem with the proposed safety constraints (which are implicitly dependent on the robot configurations), we derive the analytical solution to the gradient of the minimum scaling factor with respect to the robot configuration. As a result, this seamlessly facilitates the use of gradient-based methods in efficient solving of the trajectory optimization problem. Through a series of simulations and real-world experiments, the proposed trajectory optimization approach is validated in various challenging scenarios, and the results demonstrate its effectiveness in generating collision-free trajectories in dense and intricate environments populated with obstacles.

| **[Improving Out-of-Distribution Generalization of Trajectory Prediction for Autonomous Driving via Polynomial Representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13431v2)** | 2024-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robustness against Out-of-Distribution (OoD) samples is a key performance indicator of a trajectory prediction model. However, the development and ranking of state-of-the-art (SotA) models are driven by their In-Distribution (ID) performance on individual competition datasets. We present an OoD testing protocol that homogenizes datasets and prediction tasks across two large-scale motion datasets. We introduce a novel prediction algorithm based on polynomial representations for agent trajectory and road geometry on both the input and output sides of the model. With a much smaller model size, training effort, and inference time, we reach near SotA performance for ID testing and significantly improve robustness in OoD testing. Within our OoD testing protocol, we further study two augmentation strategies of SotA models and their effects on model generalization. Highlighting the contrast between ID and OoD performance, we suggest adding OoD testing to the evaluation criteria of trajectory prediction models.</p></details> |  |

Traditional as well as recent data-driven marginal trajectory prediction methods struggle to properly learn non-linear agent-to-agent interactions. We present SSL-Interactions that proposes pretext tasks to enhance interaction modeling for trajectory prediction. We introduce four interaction-aware pretext tasks to encapsulate various aspects of agent interactions: range gap prediction, closest distance prediction, direction of movement prediction, and type of interaction prediction. We further propose an approach to curate interaction-heavy scenarios from datasets. This curated data has two advantages: it provides a stronger learning signal to the interaction model, and facilitates generation of pseudo-labels for interaction-centric pretext tasks. We also propose three new metrics specifically designed to evaluate predictions in interactive scenes. Our empirical evaluations indicate SSL-Interactions outperforms state-of-the-art motion forecasting methods quantitatively with up to 8% improvement, and qualitatively, for interaction-heavy scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IV-2024. 13 pages, 5 figures</p></details> |

However, generating factually consistent responses in knowledge-intensive scenarios remains a challenge due to issues such as hallucination, difficulty in acquiring long-tailed knowledge, and limited memory expansion. This paper introduces SMART, a novel multi-agent framework that leverages external knowledge to enhance the interpretability and factual consistency of LLM-generated responses. SMART comprises four specialized agents, each performing a specific sub-trajectory action to navigate complex knowledge-intensive tasks. We propose a multi-agent co-training paradigm, Long-Short Trajectory Learning, which ensures synergistic collaboration among agents while maintaining fine-grained execution by each agent. Extensive experiments on five knowledge-intensive tasks demonstrate SMART's superior performance compared to widely adopted knowledge internalization and knowledge enhancement methods. Our framework can extend beyond knowledge-intensive tasks to more complex scenarios. Our code is available at https://github.com/yueshengbin/SMART.</p></details> |  |

Several existing deep generative solutions propose learning from real trajectories to generate synthetic ones. Despite the progress, most of them suffer from training stability issues and scale poorly with growing data size. More importantly, they generally lack control mechanisms to steer the generated trajectories based on spatiotemporal constraints such as fixing specific visits. To address such limitations, we formally define the controlled trajectory generation problem with spatiotemporal constraints and propose Geo-Llama. This novel LLM-inspired framework enforces explicit visit constraints in a contextually coherent way. It fine-tunes pre-trained LLMs on trajectories with a visit-wise permutation strategy where each visit corresponds to a time and location. This enables the model to capture the spatiotemporal patterns regardless of visit orders and allows flexible and in-context constraint integration through prompts during generation. Extensive experiments on real-world and synthetic datasets validate the effectiveness of Geo-Llama, demonstrating its versatility and robustness in handling a broad range of constraints to generate more realistic trajectories compared to existing methods.</p></details> |  |

Assuming that the vehicle follows a trajectory that can be uniquely identified by the sequence of control inputs and by some intermittent ranging measurements from known points in the environment, we can model the trajectory as a rigid body subject to rotation and translation in the plane. This way, the localisation problem can be reduced to finding the conditions for the existence of a unique roto-translation of the trajectory from a known reference frame to the world reference frame, given the collected measurements. As discussed in this paper, such conditions can be expressed in terms of the shape of the trajectory, of the layout of the ranging sensors, and of the numbers of measurements collected from each of them. The approach applies to a large class of kinematic models. Focusing on the special case of unicycle kinematics, we provide additional local constructibility results.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 7 figures, This article has been accepted for publication in IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control (2024). content may change prior to final publication</p></details> |
| **[Multi-finger Manipulation via Trajectory Optimization with Differentiable Rolling and Geometric Constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13229v1)** | 2024-08-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Parameterizing finger rolling and finger-object contacts in a differentiable manner is important for formulating dexterous manipulation as a trajectory optimization problem. In contrast to previous methods which often assume simplified geometries of the robot and object or do not explicitly model finger rolling, we propose a method to further extend the capabilities of dexterous manipulation by accounting for non-trivial geometries of both the robot and the object. By integrating the object's Signed Distance Field (SDF) with a sampling method, our method estimates contact and rolling-related variables and includes those in a trajectory optimization framework. This formulation naturally allows for the emergence of finger-rolling behaviors, enabling the robot to locally adjust the contact points. Our method is tested in a peg alignment task and a screwdriver turning task, where it outperforms the baselines in terms of achieving desired object configurations and avoiding dropping the object. We also successfully apply our method to a real-world screwdriver turning task, demonstrating its robustness to the sim2real gap.</p></details> |  |

For periods of time, fish may be far from the receivers, resulting in the absence of observations. The lack of information on the fish's location for extended time periods poses challenges to the understanding of fish movement patterns, and hence, the identification of proper statistical inference frameworks for modeling the trajectories. As the initial step in our methodology, in this paper, we implement an imputation strategy that relies on both Markov chain and Brownian motion principles to enhance our dataset over time. This methodology will be generalizable and applicable to all fish species with similar migration patterns or data with similar structures due to the use of static acoustic receivers.</p></details> |  |

| **[Differentially Private Spatiotemporal Trajectory Synthesis with Retained Data Utility](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12842v1)** | 2024-08-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatiotemporal trajectories collected from GPS-enabled devices are of vital importance to many applications, such as urban planning and traffic analysis. Due to the privacy leakage concerns, many privacy-preserving trajectory publishing methods have been proposed. However, most of them could not strike a good balance between privacy protection and good data utility. In this paper, we propose DP-STTS, a differentially private spatiotemporal trajectory synthesizer with high data utility, which employs a model composed of a start spatiotemporal cube distribution and a 1-order Markov process. Specially, DP-STTS firstly discretizes the raw spatiotemporal trajectories into neighboring cubes, such that the model size is limited and the model's tolerance for noise could be enhanced. Then, a Markov process is utilized for the next location point picking. After adding noise under differential privacy (DP) to the model, synthetic trajectories that preserve essential spatial and temporal characteristics of the real trajectories are generated from the noisy model. Experiments on one real-life dataset demonstrate that DP-STTS provides good data utility. Our code is available at https://github.com/Etherious72/DP-STTS.</p></details> | 6 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Minimizing Movement Delay for Movable Antennas via Trajectory Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12813v1)** | 2024-08-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Movable antennas (MAs) have received increasing attention in wireless communications due to their capability of antenna position adjustment to reconfigure wireless channels. However, moving MAs results in non-negligible delay, which may decrease the effective data transmission time. To reduce the movement delay, we study in this paper a new MA trajectory optimization problem. In particular, given the desired destination positions of multiple MAs, we aim to jointly optimize their associations with the initial MA positions and the trajectories for moving them from their respective initial to destination positions within a given two-dimensional (2D) region, such that the delay of antenna movement is minimized, subject to the inter-MA minimum distance constraints in the movement. However, this problem is a continuous-time mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem that is challenging to solve. To tackle this challenge, we propose a two-stage optimization framework that sequentially optimizes the MAs' position associations and trajectories, respectively. First, we relax the inter-MA distance constraints and optimally solve the resulted delay minimization problem. Next, we check if the obtained MA association and trajectory solutions satisfy the inter-MA distance constraints. If not satisfied, we then employ a successive convex approximation (SCA) algorithm to adjust the MAs' trajectories until they satisfy the given constraints. Simulation results are provided to show the effectiveness of our proposed trajectory optimization method in reducing the movement delay as well as draw useful insights.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages,6 figures, submit to GLOBECOM 2024 Workshop - IRAFWCC</p></details> |
| **[DBHP: Trajectory Imputation in Multi-Agent Sports Using Derivative-Based Hybrid Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10878v2)** | 2024-08-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many spatiotemporal domains handle multi-agent trajectory data, but in real-world scenarios, collected trajectory data are often partially missing due to various reasons. While existing approaches demonstrate good performance in trajectory imputation, they face challenges in capturing the complex dynamics and interactions between agents due to a lack of physical constraints that govern realistic trajectories, leading to suboptimal results. To address this issue, the paper proposes a Derivative-Based Hybrid Prediction (DBHP) framework that can effectively impute multiple agents' missing trajectories. First, a neural network equipped with Set Transformers produces a naive prediction of missing trajectories while satisfying the permutation-equivariance in terms of the order of input agents. Then, the framework makes alternative predictions leveraging velocity and acceleration information and combines all the predictions with properly determined weights to provide final imputed trajectories. In this way, our proposed framework not only accurately predicts position, velocity, and acceleration values but also enforces the physical relationship between them, eventually improving both the accuracy and naturalness of the predicted trajectories. Accordingly, the experiment results about imputing player trajectories in team sports show that our framework significantly outperforms existing imputation baselines.</p></details> |  |

To be as efficient as human surveyors, robotic systems must continuously collect observational data required to complete their survey task. Inspection personnel instinctively know to look at relevant equipment that happens to be ``along the way.'' In this paper, we introduce a novel framework for continuous long-horizon viewpoint planning, for ground robots, applied to tasks involving patrolling, monitoring or visual data gathering in known environments. Our approach to Long Horizon Viewpoint Planning (LHVP), enables the robot to autonomously navigate and collect environmental data optimizing for coverage over the horizon of the patrol. Leveraging a quadruped's mobility and sensory capabilities, our LHVP framework plans patrol paths that account for coupling the viewpoint planner for the arm camera with the mobile base's navigation planner. The viewpath optimization algorithm seeks a balance between comprehensive environmental coverage and dynamically feasible movements, thus ensuring prolonged and effective operation in scenarios including monitoring, security surveillance, and disaster response. We validate our approach through simulations and in the real world and show that our LHVP significantly outperforms naive patrolling methods in terms of area coverage generating information-gathering trajectories for the robot arm. Our results indicate a promising direction for the deployment of mobile robots in long-term, autonomous surveying, and environmental data collection tasks, highlighting the potential of intelligent robotic systems in challenging real-world applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 8 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

However, configuring the skills' parameters for a specific task remains a manual and time-consuming endeavor. Existing approaches for learning or optimizing these parameters often require numerous real-world executions or do not work in dynamic environments. To address these challenges, we propose MuTT, a novel encoder-decoder transformer architecture designed to predict environment-aware executions of robot skills by integrating vision, trajectory, and robot skill parameters. Notably, we pioneer the fusion of vision and trajectory, introducing a novel trajectory projection. Furthermore, we illustrate MuTT's efficacy as a predictor when combined with a model-based robot skill optimizer. This approach facilitates the optimization of robot skill parameters for the current environment, without the need for real-world executions during optimization. Designed for compatibility with any representation of robot skills, MuTT demonstrates its versatility across three comprehensive experiments, showcasing superior performance across two different skill representations.</p></details> |  |

Trajectory optimisation algorithms have proved their utility in a wide variety of tasks, but, like most methods struggle scaling to the high dimensional systems ubiquitous to non-prehensile manipulation in clutter as well as deformable object manipulation. We reason that, during manipulation, different degrees of freedom will become more or less important to the task over time as the system evolves. We leverage this idea to reduce the number of degrees of freedom considered in a trajectory optimisation problem, to reduce planning times. This idea is particularly relevant in the context of model predictive control (MPC) where the cost landscape of the optimisation problem is constantly evolving. We provide simulation results under asynchronous MPC and show our methods are capable of achieving better overall performance due to the decreased policy lag whilst still being able to optimise trajectories effectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 4 figures, accepted to WAFR 2024</p></details> |

This paper introduces a self-optimizing controller, Type-1 fuzzyPID, which leverages dynamic and static system response analysis to overcome the limitations of manual tuning. To account for system uncertainties, an Interval Type-2 fuzzyPID controller is also developed. Both controllers are designed using Matlab/Simulink and tested through trajectory tracking simulations in the CoppeliaSim environment. Additionally, a non-linear model predictive controller(NMPC) is proposed and compared against the fuzzyPID controllers. The impact of tunable parameters on NMPC tracking accuracy is thoroughly examined. We also present plots of the step-response characteristics and noise rejection experiments for each controller.

To tackle this challenge, we propose a progressive 3D editing strategy that ensures multi-view consistency via a Trajectory-Anchored Scheme (TAS) with a dual-branch editing mechanism. Specifically, TAS facilitates a tightly coupled iterative process between 2D view editing and 3D updating, preventing error accumulation yielded from text-to-image process. Additionally, we explore the relationship between optimization-based methods and reconstruction-based methods, offering a unified perspective for selecting superior design choice, supporting the rationale behind the designed TAS. We further present a tuning-free View-Consistent Attention Control (VCAC) module that leverages cross-view semantic and geometric reference from the source branch to yield aligned views from the target branch during the editing of 2D views. To validate the effectiveness of our method, we analyze 2D examples to demonstrate the improved consistency with the VCAC module. Further extensive quantitative and qualitative results in text-guided 3D scene editing indicate that our method achieves superior editing quality compared to state-of-the-art methods. We will make the complete codebase publicly available following the conclusion of the review process.</p></details> |  |

Traditional methods often struggle to balance resource conservation, accurate state estimation and precise tracking, resulting in suboptimal performance. This problem is particularly pronounced in environments with large action spaces, where the need for frequent, accurate state data is paramount, yet the capacity for active localization updates is restricted by external limitations. This paper introduces ComTraQ-MPC, a novel framework that combines Deep Q-Networks (DQN) and Model Predictive Control (MPC) to optimize trajectory tracking with constrained active localization updates. The meta-trained DQN ensures adaptive active localization scheduling, while the MPC leverages available state information to improve tracking. The central contribution of this work is their reciprocal interaction: DQN's update decisions inform MPC's control strategy, and MPC's outcomes refine DQN's learning, creating a cohesive, adaptive system. Empirical evaluations in simulated and real-world settings demonstrate that ComTraQ-MPC significantly enhances operational efficiency and accuracy, providing a generalizable and approximately optimal solution for trajectory tracking in complex partially observable environments.</p></details> | * Equal contribution |

Understanding the importance of risk factors measured at a mental health visit can help clinicians evaluate future risk and provide appropriate care during the visit. In prediction settings where data are collected over time, such as in mental health care, it is often of interest to understand both the importance of variables for predicting the response at each time point and the importance summarized over the time series. Building on recent advances in estimation and inference for variable importance measures, we define summaries of variable importance trajectories and corresponding estimators. The same approaches for inference can be applied to these measures regardless of the choice of the algorithm(s) used to estimate the prediction function. We propose a nonparametric efficient estimation and inference procedure as well as a null hypothesis testing procedure that are valid even when complex machine learning tools are used for prediction. Through simulations, we demonstrate that our proposed procedures have good operating characteristics. We use these approaches to analyze electronic health records data from two large health systems to investigate the longitudinal importance of risk factors for suicide attempt to inform future suicide prevention research and clinical workflow.</p></details> | <details><summary>81 pa...</summary><p>81 pages (34 main, 47 supplementary), 8 figures (4 main, 4 supplementary), 29 tables (2 main, 27 supplementary)</p></details> |

A common approach to address motion planning problems is trajectory optimization. Trajectory optimization can represent the high-level behaviors of robots through mathematical formulations. However, current trajectory optimization approaches have two main challenges. Firstly, their solution heavily depends on the initial guess, and they are prone to get stuck in local minima. Secondly, they face scalability limitations by increasing the number of constraints. This thesis endeavors to tackle these challenges by introducing four innovative trajectory optimization algorithms to improve reliability, scalability, and computational efficiency. There are two novel aspects of the proposed algorithms. The first key innovation is remodeling the kinematic constraints and collision avoidance constraints. Another key innovation lies in the design of algorithms that effectively utilize parallel computation on GPU accelerators. By using reformulated constraints and leveraging the computational power of GPUs, the proposed algorithms of this thesis demonstrate significant improvements in efficiency and scalability compared to the existing methods. Parallelization enables faster computation times, allowing for real-time decision-making in dynamic environments. Moreover, the algorithms are designed to adapt to changes in the environment, ensuring robust performance. Extensive benchmarking for each proposed optimizer validates their efficacy. Overall, this thesis makes a significant contribution to the field of trajectory optimization algorithms. It introduces innovative solutions that specifically address the challenges faced by existing methods. The proposed algorithms pave the way for more efficient and robust motion planning solutions in robotics by leveraging parallel computation and specific mathematical structures.</p></details> | <details><summary>PhD T...</summary><p>PhD Thesis, University of Tartu, 2024.

Traditional automated driving systems recalculate the entire trajectory in a changing environment. Instead, a novel approach retains valid trajectory segments, minimizing the need for complete replanning and reducing changes to the original plan. This work introduces a trajectory repairing framework that calculates a feasible evasive trajectory while computing the Feasible Time-to-React (F-TTR), balancing the maintenance of the original plan with safety assurance. The framework employs a binary search algorithm to iteratively create repaired trajectories, guaranteeing both the safety and feasibility of the trajectory repairing result. In contrast to earlier approaches that separated the calculation of safety metrics from trajectory repairing, which resulted in unsuccessful plans for evasive maneuvers, our work has the anytime capability to provide both a Feasible Time-to-React and an evasive trajectory for further execution.</p></details> |  |

Previous rule-based approaches without the integration of semantic information show a limitation in both efficiency and accuracy. Semantic information, such as activity types inferred from Points of Interest (POI) data, can significantly enhance the quality of trajectory mining. However, integrating these insights is challenging, as many POIs have incomplete feature information, and current learning-based POI algorithms require the integrity of datasets to do the classification. In this paper, we introduce a novel pipeline for human travel trajectory mining. Our approach first leverages the strong inferential and comprehension capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to annotate POI with activity types and then uses a Bayesian-based algorithm to infer activity for each stay point in a trajectory. In our evaluation using the OpenStreetMap (OSM) POI dataset, our approach achieves a 93.4% accuracy and a 96.1% F-1 score in POI classification, and a 91.7% accuracy with a 92.3% F-1 score in activity inference.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, accepted for the 27th IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC 2024)</p></details> |

A particularly concerning threat is the vulnerability of CPS to deceptive attacks that degrade system performance while remaining undetected. This paper investigates perfectly undetectable false data injection attacks (FDIAs) targeting the trajectory tracking control of a non-holonomic mobile robot. The proposed attack method utilizes affine transformations of intercepted signals, exploiting weaknesses inherent in the partially linear dynamic properties and symmetry of the nonlinear plant. The feasibility and potential impact of these attacks are validated through experiments using a Turtlebot 3 platform, highlighting the urgent need for sophisticated detection mechanisms and resilient control strategies to safeguard CPS against such threats. Furthermore, a novel approach for detection of these attacks called the state monitoring signature function (SMSF) is introduced. An example SMSF, a carefully designed function resilient to FDIA, is shown to be able to detect the presence of a FDIA through signatures based on systems states.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 17 figures.

Existing benchmarks rely on datasets, which are biased towards more common scenarios, such as cruising, and distance-based metrics that are computed by averaging over all scenarios. Following such a regiment provides a little insight into the properties of the models both in terms of how well they can handle different scenarios and how admissible and diverse their outputs are. There exist a number of complementary metrics designed to measure the admissibility and diversity of trajectories, however, they suffer from biases, such as length of trajectories. In this paper, we propose a new benChmarking paRadIgm for evaluaTing trajEctoRy predIction Approaches (CRITERIA). Particularly, we propose 1) a method for extracting driving scenarios at varying levels of specificity according to the structure of the roads, models' performance, and data properties for fine-grained ranking of prediction models; 2) A set of new bias-free metrics for measuring diversity, by incorporating the characteristics of a given scenario, and admissibility, by considering the structure of roads and kinematic compliancy, motivated by real-world driving constraints. 3) Using the proposed benchmark, we conduct extensive experimentation on a representative set of the prediction models using the large scale Argoverse dataset. We show that the proposed benchmark can produce a more accurate ranking of the models and serve as a means of characterizing their behavior. We further present ablation studies to highlight contributions of different elements that are used to compute the proposed metrics.</p></details> |  |

Most modern methods, however, tend to model such processes through at most piecewise-continuous trajectories. To address this, we adopt a way of viewing events not as standalone phenomena but instead as observations of a Gaussian Process, which in turn governs the actor's dynamics. We propose integrating these obtained dynamics, resulting in a continuous-trajectory modification of the widely successful Neural ODE model. Through Gaussian Process theory, we were able to evaluate the uncertainty in an actor's representation, which arises from not observing them between events. This estimate led us to develop a novel, theoretically backed negative feedback mechanism. Empirical studies indicate that our model with Gaussian process interpolation and negative feedback achieves state-of-the-art performance, with improvements up to 20% AUROC against similar architectures.</p></details> |  |

In this paper we are motivated by the latter application. Trajectories are recorded movements of mobile objects such as vehicles, animals, public transportation, or parts of the human body. We propose a novel distance function called DistanceAvg to capture the similarity of such movements. To be practical, it is necessary to provide indexing for this distance measure. Fortunately we do not need to start from scratch. A generic and unifying approach is metric space, which organizes the set of objects solely by a distance (similarity) function with certain natural properties. Our function DistanceAvg is a metric. Although metric indexes have been studied for decades and many such structures are available, they do not offer the best performance with trajectories. In this paper we propose a new design, which outperforms the best existing indexes for kNN queries and is equally good for range queries. It is especially suitable for expensive distance functions as they occur in trajectory similarity search. In many applications, kNN queries are more practical than range queries as it may be difficult to determine an appropriate search radius. Our index provides exact result sets for the given distance function.</p></details> | 54 pages, 26 figures |

Despite increasing interest, recent works face challenges in achieving aesthetically appealing choreography, primarily for two key issues: multi-dancer collision and single-dancer foot slide. To address these issues, we propose a Trajectory-Controllable Diffusion (TCDiff), a novel approach that harnesses non-overlapping trajectories to facilitate coherent dance movements. Specifically, to tackle dancer collisions, we introduce a Dance-Beat Navigator capable of generating trajectories for multiple dancers based on the music, complemented by a Distance-Consistency loss to maintain appropriate spacing among trajectories within a reasonable threshold. To mitigate foot sliding, we present a Footwork Adaptor that utilizes trajectory displacement from adjacent frames to enable flexible footwork, coupled with a Relative Forward-Kinematic loss to adjust the positioning of individual dancers' root nodes and joints. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art results.</p></details> |  |
| **[RALTPER: A Risk-Aware Local Trajectory Planner for Complex Environment with Gaussian Uncertainty](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05838v1)** | 2024-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose a novel Risk-Aware Local Trajectory Planner (RALTPER) for autonomous vehicles in complex environments characterized by Gaussian uncertainty. The proposed method integrates risk awareness and trajectory planning by leveraging probabilistic models to evaluate the likelihood of collisions with dynamic and static obstacles. The RALTPER focuses on collision avoidance constraints for both the ego vehicle region and the Gaussian-obstacle risk region. Additionally, this work enhances the generalization of both vehicle and obstacle models, making the planner adaptable to a wider range of scenarios. Our approach formulates the planning problem as a nonlinear optimization, solved using the IPOPT solver within the CasADi environment. The planner is evaluated through simulations of various challenging scenarios, including complex, static, mixed environment and narrow single-lane avoidance of pedestrians. Results demonstrate that RALTPER achieves safer and more efficient trajectory planning particularly in navigating narrow areas where a more accurate vehicle profile representation is critical for avoiding collisions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory Planning for Teleoperated Space Manipulators Using Deep Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05460v1)** | 2024-08-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory planning for teleoperated space manipulators involves challenges such as accurately modeling system dynamics, particularly in free-floating modes with non-holonomic constraints, and managing time delays that increase model uncertainty and affect control precision. Traditional teleoperation methods rely on precise dynamic models requiring complex parameter identification and calibration, while data-driven methods do not require prior knowledge but struggle with time delays. A novel framework utilizing deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is introduced to address these challenges. The framework incorporates three methods: Mapping, Prediction, and State Augmentation, to handle delays when delayed state information is received at the master end. The Soft Actor Critic (SAC) algorithm processes the state information to compute the next action, which is then sent to the remote manipulator for environmental interaction. Four environments are constructed using the MuJoCo simulation platform to account for variations in base and target fixation: fixed base and target, fixed base with rotated target, free-floating base with fixed target, and free-floating base with rotated target. Extensive experiments with both constant and random delays are conducted to evaluate the proposed methods. Results demonstrate that all three methods effectively address trajectory planning challenges, with State Augmentation showing superior efficiency and robustness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Nonlinear Propagation of Non-Gaussian Uncertainties: Theory and Applications to Spacecraft Trajectory Design](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05384v1)** | 2024-08-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a novel approach for propagating uncertainties in dynamical systems building on high-order Taylor expansions of the flow and moment-generating functions (MGFs). Unlike prior methods that focus on Gaussian distributions, our approach leverages the relationship between MGFs and distribution moments to extend high-order uncertainty propagation techniques to non-Gaussian scenarios. This significantly broadens the applicability of these methods to a wider range of problems and uncertainty types. High-order moment computations are performed one-off and symbolically, reducing the computational burden of the technique to the calculation of Taylor series coefficients around a nominal trajectory, achieved by efficiently integrating the system's variational equations. Furthermore, the use of the proposed approach in combination with event transition tensors, allows for accurate propagation of uncertainties at specific events, such as the landing surface of a celestial body, the crossing of a predefined Poincar\'e section, or the trigger of an arbitrary event during the propagation. Via numerical simulations we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in various astrodynamics applications, including the unperturbed and perturbed two-body problem, and the circular restricted three-body problem, showing that it accurately propagates non-Gaussian uncertainties both at future times and at event manifolds.</p></details> |  |

Building on prior work, it addresses the multi-robot communication-aware trajectory planning problem using a general optimisation framework that imposes linear constraints on changes in robot positions to ensure communication performance and collision avoidance. In this paper, the optimisation problem is solved distributively by separating the communication performance constraint through an economic approach. Here, the current communication budget is distributed equally among the robots, and the robots are allowed to trade parts of their budgets with each other. The separated optimisation problem is then solved using the consensus alternating direction method of multipliers. The method was verified through simulation in an inspection task problem.</p></details> |  |
| **[TrajCogn: Leveraging LLMs for Cognizing Movement Patterns and Travel Purposes from Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12459v2)** | 2024-08-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal trajectories are crucial in various data mining tasks. It is important to develop a versatile trajectory learning method that performs different tasks with high accuracy. This involves effectively extracting two core aspects of information--movement patterns and travel purposes--from trajectories. However, this is challenging due to limitations in model capacity and the quality and scale of trajectory datasets. Meanwhile, large language models (LLMs) have shown great success in versatility by training on large-scale, high-quality datasets. Given the similarities between trajectories and sentences, there's potential to leverage LLMs to develop an effective trajectory learning method. However, standard LLMs are not designed to handle the unique spatio-temporal features of trajectories and cannot extract movement patterns and travel purposes. To address these challenges, we propose a model called TrajCogn that effectively utilizes LLMs to model trajectories. TrajCogn leverages the strengths of LLMs to create a versatile trajectory learning approach while addressing the limitations of standard LLMs. First, TrajCogn incorporates a novel trajectory semantic embedder that enables LLMs to process spatio-temporal features and extract movement patterns and travel purposes. Second, TrajCogn introduces a new trajectory prompt that integrates these patterns and purposes into LLMs, allowing the model to adapt to various tasks. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets and two representative tasks demonstrate that TrajCogn successfully achieves its design goals.

| **[PTrajM: Efficient and Semantic-rich Trajectory Learning with Pretrained Trajectory-Mamba](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04916v1)** | 2024-08-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vehicle trajectories provide crucial movement information for various real-world applications. To better utilize vehicle trajectories, it is essential to develop a trajectory learning approach that can effectively and efficiently extract rich semantic information, including movement behavior and travel purposes, to support accurate downstream applications. However, creating such an approach presents two significant challenges. First, movement behavior are inherently spatio-temporally continuous, making them difficult to extract efficiently from irregular and discrete trajectory points. Second, travel purposes are related to the functionalities of areas and road segments traversed by vehicles. These functionalities are not available from the raw spatio-temporal trajectory features and are hard to extract directly from complex textual features associated with these areas and road segments. To address these challenges, we propose PTrajM, a novel method capable of efficient and semantic-rich vehicle trajectory learning. To support efficient modeling of movement behavior, we introduce Trajectory-Mamba as the learnable model of PTrajM, which effectively extracts continuous movement behavior while being more computationally efficient than existing structures. To facilitate efficient extraction of travel purposes, we propose a travel purpose-aware pre-training procedure, which enables PTrajM to discern the travel purposes of trajectories without additional computational resources during its embedding process. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets and comparisons with several state-of-the-art trajectory learning methods demonstrate the effectiveness of PTrajM.

Two phonological feature sets, based respectively on generative and articulatory phonology, are used to encode a phonetic target sequence. Different interpolation techniques are compared to generate smooth trajectories in these feature spaces, with a potential optimisation of the target value and timing to capture co-articulation effects. We report the Pearson correlation between a linear projection of the generated trajectories and articulatory data derived from a multi-speaker dataset of electromagnetic articulography (EMA) recordings. A correlation of 0.67 is obtained with an extended feature set based on generative phonology and a linear interpolation technique. We discuss the implications of our results for our understanding of the dynamics of biological motion.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted at Interspeech 2024</p></details> |

This paper introduces a novel methodology for trajectory forecasting based on state-space dynamic system modeling, which endows agents with models that have tangible physical implications. To enhance the precision of state estimations within the dynamic system, the paper also presents a novel modeling technique for control variables. This technique utilizes a newly introduced model, termed "Mixed Mamba," to derive initial control states, thereby improving the predictive accuracy of these variables. Moverover, the proposed approach ingeniously integrates graph neural networks with state-space models, effectively capturing the complexities of multi-agent interactions. This combination provides a robust and scalable framework for forecasting multi-agent trajectories across a range of scenarios. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that this model outperforms several established benchmarks across various metrics and datasets, highlighting its significant potential to advance trajectory forecasting in autonomous systems.</p></details> |  |

We aim to learn temporal latent representations of the underlying generative process that explain the observed patient disease trajectories in an interpretable and comprehensive way. To enhance the interpretability of these latent temporal processes, we develop a semi-supervised approach for disentangling the latent space using established medical knowledge. By combining the generative approach with medical definitions of different characteristics of SSc, we facilitate the discovery of new aspects of the disease. We show that the learned temporal latent processes can be utilized for further data analysis and clinical hypothesis testing, including finding similar patients and clustering SSc patient trajectories into novel sub-types. Moreover, our method enables personalized online monitoring and prediction of multivariate time series with uncertainty quantification.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Machine Learning for Healthcare 2024. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2311.08149</p></details> |
| **[Grasping Trajectory Optimization with Point Clouds](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05466v2)** | 2024-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a new trajectory optimization method for robotic grasping based on a point-cloud representation of robots and task spaces. In our method, robots are represented by 3D points on their link surfaces. The task space of a robot is represented by a point cloud that can be obtained from depth sensors. Using the point-cloud representation, goal reaching in grasping can be formulated as point matching, while collision avoidance can be efficiently achieved by querying the signed distance values of the robot points in the signed distance field of the scene points. Consequently, a constrained nonlinear optimization problem is formulated to solve the joint motion and grasp planning problem. The advantage of our method is that the point-cloud representation is general to be used with any robot in any environment. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by performing experiments on a tabletop scene and a shelf scene for grasping with a Fetch mobile manipulator and a Franka Panda arm.

While these questions can be studied by employing multiple datasets, it is challenging due to several discrepancies, e.g., in data formats, map resolution, and semantic annotation types. To address these challenges, we introduce UniTraj, a comprehensive framework that unifies various datasets, models, and evaluation criteria, presenting new opportunities for the vehicle trajectory prediction field. In particular, using UniTraj, we conduct extensive experiments and find that model performance significantly drops when transferred to other datasets. However, enlarging data size and diversity can substantially improve performance, leading to a new state-of-the-art result for the nuScenes dataset. We provide insights into dataset characteristics to explain these findings.

In this context, normalizing flows originating from the field of variational inference are considered for the generation of sampling distributions, as they model transformations of simple to more complex distributions. Accordingly, learning-based normalizing flow models are trained for a more efficient exploration of the input domain for the task at hand.

Our goal is to compute suitable trajectories that (1) satisfy the environment-specific traversability constraints and (2) generate human-like paths while navigating in crosswalks, sidewalks, etc. Our formulation uses a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) generative model enhanced with traversability constraints to generate multiple candidate trajectories for global navigation. We use VLMs and a visual prompting approach with their zero-shot ability of semantic understanding and logical reasoning to choose the best trajectory given the contextual information about the task. We evaluate our methods in various outdoor scenes with wheeled robots and compare the performance with other global navigation algorithms. In practice, we observe at least 3.35% improvement in traversability and 20.61% improvement in terms of human-like navigation in generated trajectories in challenging outdoor navigation scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Pose-Aware Self-Supervised Learning with Viewpoint Trajectory Regularization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14973v2)** | 2024-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning visual features from unlabeled images has proven successful for semantic categorization, often by mapping different $views$ of the same object to the same feature to achieve recognition invariance. However, visual recognition involves not only identifying $what$ an object is but also understanding $how$ it is presented. For example, seeing a car from the side versus head-on is crucial for deciding whether to stay put or jump out of the way. While unsupervised feature learning for downstream viewpoint reasoning is important, it remains under-explored, partly due to the lack of a standardized evaluation method and benchmarks. We introduce a new dataset of adjacent image triplets obtained from a viewpoint trajectory, without any semantic or pose labels. We benchmark both semantic classification and pose estimation accuracies on the same visual feature. Additionally, we propose a viewpoint trajectory regularization loss for learning features from unlabeled image triplets. Our experiments demonstrate that this approach helps develop a visual representation that encodes object identity and organizes objects by their poses, retaining semantic classification accuracy while achieving emergent global pose awareness and better generalization to novel objects. Our dataset and code are available at http://pwang.pw/trajSSL/.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ECCV 2024</p></details> |

Learning-based methods are currently showing impressive results in simulation-based challenges, with transformer-based architectures technologically leading the way. Ultimately, however, predictions are needed in the real world. In addition to the shifts from simulation to the real world, many vehicle- and country-specific shifts, i.e. differences in sensor systems, fusion and perception algorithms as well as traffic rules and laws, are on the agenda. Since models that can cover all system setups and design domains at once are not yet foreseeable, model adaptation plays a central role. Therefore, a simulation-based study on transfer learning techniques is conducted on basis of a transformer-based model. Furthermore, the study aims to provide insights into possible trade-offs between computational time and performance to support effective transfers into the real world.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in 2024 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV), Jeju Shinhwa World, Jeju Island, Korea, June 2-5, 2024</p></details> |

Such a robot needs to be able to constantly adapt to the surrounding scene based on egocentric vision, and predict the ego motion of the wearer. In this work, we leveraged body-mounted cameras and sensors to anticipate the trajectory of human wearers through complex surroundings. To facilitate research in ego-motion prediction, we have collected a comprehensive walking scene navigation dataset centered on the user's perspective. We then present a method to predict human motion conditioning on the surrounding static scene. Our method leverages a diffusion model to produce a distribution of potential future trajectories, taking into account the user's observation of the environment. To that end, we introduce a compact representation to encode the user's visual memory of the surroundings, as well as an efficient sample-generating technique to speed up real-time inference of a diffusion model. We ablate our model and compare it to baselines, and results show that our model outperforms existing methods on key metrics of collision avoidance and trajectory mode coverage.</p></details> | 13 pages, 9 figures |

In this work, we introduce Stochastic Trajectory Optimization for Demonstration Imitation (STODI), a trajectory optimization framework for robots to imitate the shape of demonstration trajectories with improved dynamic performance. Consistent with the human learning process, demonstration imitation serves as an initial step, while trajectory optimization aims to enhance robot motion performance. By generating random noise and constructing proper cost functions, the STODI effectively explores and exploits generated noisy trajectories while preserving the demonstration shape characteristics. We employ three metrics to measure the similarity of trajectories in both the time and frequency domains to help with demonstration imitation. Theoretical analysis reveals relationships among these metrics, emphasizing the benefits of frequency-domain analysis for specific tasks. Experiments on a 7-DOF robotic arm in the PyBullet simulator validate the efficacy of the STODI framework, showcasing the improved optimization performance and stability compared to previous methods.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose a holistic framework that jointly optimizes the total latency and energy consumption for UAV-assisted fog computing in a three-dimensional spatial domain with varying terrain elevations and dynamic task generations. Our proposed framework considers three important and interdependent modules: attitude control, trajectory planning, and task assignment. We first establish a fuzzy proportional-integral-derivative control model to determine the UAV's attitude. Then, we propose an enhanced Ant Colony System (ACS) based algorithm, that includes a safety value and a decoupling mechanism to overcome the convergence issue in classical ACS, to compute the optimal UAV trajectory. Finally, we design an algorithm based on the Particle Swarm Optimization technique, to determine where each offloaded task should be executed. Under our proposed framework, the outcome of one module would affect the decision-making in one other, providing a holistic perspective of the system and thus leading to improved solutions. We demonstrate by extensive simulation results that our proposed framework can significantly improve the overall performance, measured by latency and energy consumption, compared to existing baseline approaches.</p></details> | 14 pages, 10 figures |

Such manoeuvring flight envelope variations, governed by the aircraft's complex nonlinear dynamics, are unpredictable by pilots and existing flight management systems. To prevent in-flight Loss of Control, post-failure trajectories must be optimal, planned in real-time, avoid terrain, and adhere to the impaired aircraft's reduced manoeuvrability and dynamic constraints. This paper presents a novel real-time trajectory optimization method for impaired aircraft based on a combination of differential flatness theory, the pseudospectral method, nonlinear programming, and inverse dynamics. In the proposed method, which utilizes a high-fidelity nonlinear six degree-of-freedom model, to conform to aircraft's altered dynamics a sequence of trim points is selected from the impaired aircraft's manoeuvring flight envelope based on the chosen optimization criteria, ensuring that the resulting three-dimensional trajectory observes terrain avoidance. Then, the required control inputs are obtained for each manoeuvre in less than a second. The method is applied to the NASA Generic Transport Model with rudder failure near a complex mountainous terrain. Both an optimal one-piece trajectory and a near-optimal piecewise path consisting of several optimal trajectories, are generated in non-real-time and real-time, respectively, and compared.

Existing motion prediction approaches have ample room for improvement, particularly in terms of long-term prediction accuracy and interpretability. In this paper, we address these challenges by proposing LC-LLM, an explainable lane change prediction model that leverages the strong reasoning capabilities and self-explanation abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Essentially, we reformulate the lane change prediction task as a language modeling problem, processing heterogeneous driving scenario information as natural language prompts for LLMs and employing supervised fine-tuning to tailor LLMs specifically for lane change prediction task. Additionally, we finetune the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning to improve prediction transparency and reliability, and include explanatory requirements in the prompts during inference stage. Therefore, our LC-LLM model not only predicts lane change intentions and trajectories but also provides CoT reasoning and explanations for its predictions, enhancing its interpretability. Extensive experiments based on the large-scale highD dataset demonstrate the superior performance and interpretability of our LC-LLM in lane change prediction task. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to utilize LLMs for predicting lane change behavior. Our study shows that LLMs can effectively encode comprehensive interaction information for driving behavior understanding.</p></details> | 12 pages, 9 figures |

Due to a large amount of variability in brain anatomy between different individuals, we hypothesize that leveraging MRI time series can help improve specificity, by treating each patient as their own baseline. Here we turn to conditional variational autoencoders to generate individualized MRI predictions given the subject's age, disease status and one previous scan. Using serial imaging data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, we train a novel architecture to build a latent space distribution which can be sampled from to generate future predictions of changing anatomy. This enables us to extrapolate beyond the dataset and predict MRIs up to 10 years. We evaluated the model on a held-out set from ADNI and an independent dataset (from Open Access Series of Imaging Studies). By comparing to several alternatives, we show that our model produces more individualized images with higher resolution. Further, if an individual already has a follow-up MRI, we demonstrate a usage of our model to compute a likelihood ratio classifier for disease status. In practice, the model may be able to assist in early diagnosis of AD and provide a counterfactual baseline trajectory for treatment effect estimation. Furthermore, it generates a synthetic dataset that can potentially be used for downstream tasks such as anomaly detection and classification.</p></details> | <details><summary>MICCA...</summary><p>MICCAI 2024 LDTM workshop</p></details> |

In particular, the tasks of different types and service requirements in MEC network are offloaded from one UAV to another. To pursue the goal of low-carbon edge computing, we study the problem of minimizing system energy consumption by jointly optimizing computation resource allocation, task scheduling, service placement, and UAV trajectories. Considering the inherent unpredictability associated with task generation and the dynamic nature of wireless fading channels, addressing this problem presents a significant challenge. To overcome this issue, we reformulate the complicated non-convex problem as a Markov decision process and propose a soft actor-critic-based trajectory optimization and resource allocation algorithm to implement a flexible learning strategy. Numerical results illustrate that within a multi-UAV-enabled MEC network, the proposed algorithm effectively reduces the system energy consumption in heterogeneous tasks and services scenarios compared to other baseline solutions.</p></details> | 11 pages, 10 figures |

In this study, we focus on a scenario where a connected and autonomous vehicle (CAV) serves as the central agent, utilizing both sensors and communication technologies to perceive its surrounding traffics consisting of autonomous vehicles (AVs), connected vehicles (CVs), and human-driven vehicles (HDVs). Our trajectory prediction task is aimed at all the detected surrounding vehicles. To effectively integrate the multi-source data from both sensor and communication technologies, we propose a deep learning framework called MSMA utilizing a cross-attention module for multi-source data fusion. Vector map data is utilized to provide contextual information. The trajectory dataset is collected in CARLA simulator with synthesized data errors introduced. Numerical experiments demonstrate that in a mixed traffic flow scenario, the integration of data from different sources enhances our understanding of the environment. This notably improves trajectory prediction accuracy, particularly in situations with a high CV market penetration rate. The code is available at: https://github.com/xichennn/MSMA.</p></details> |  |
| **[Conformal Trajectory Prediction with Multi-View Data Integration in Cooperative Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00374v2)** | 2024-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current research on trajectory prediction primarily relies on data collected by onboard sensors of an ego vehicle. With the rapid advancement in connected technologies, such as vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication, valuable information from alternate views becomes accessible via wireless networks. The integration of information from alternative views has the potential to overcome the inherent limitations associated with a single viewpoint, such as occlusions and limited field of view. In this work, we introduce V2INet, a novel trajectory prediction framework designed to model multi-view data by extending existing single-view models. Unlike previous approaches where the multi-view data is manually fused or formulated as a separate training stage, our model supports end-to-end training, enhancing both flexibility and performance. Moreover, the predicted multimodal trajectories are calibrated by a post-hoc conformal prediction module to get valid and efficient confidence regions. We evaluated the entire framework using the real-world V2I dataset V2X-Seq. Our results demonstrate superior performance in terms of Final Displacement Error (FDE) and Miss Rate (MR) using a single GPU.

However, the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) are based on supervised deep learning - which leads to challenges when the distribution of trajectories changes due to such a shock. We provide a neuro-symbolic rule-based framework to conduct error correction and detection of these models to integrate into our movement trajectory platform. We provide a suite of experiments on several recent SOTA models where we show highly accurate error detection, the ability to improve accuracy with a changing test distribution, and accuracy improvement for the base use case in addition to a suite of theoretical properties that informed algorithm development. Specifically, we show an F1 scores for predicting errors of up to 0.984, significant performance increase for out-of distribution accuracy (8.51% improvement over SOTA for zero-shot accuracy), and accuracy improvement over the SOTA model.</p></details> |  |

To tackle these challenges, we introduce Optimal Gaussian Diffusion (OGD) and Estimated Clean Manifold (ECM) Guidance. OGD optimizes the prior distribution for a small diffusion time $T$ and starts the reverse diffusion process from it. ECM directly injects guidance gradients to the estimated clean manifold, eliminating extensive gradient backpropagation throughout the network. Our methodology streamlines the generative process, enabling practical applications with reduced computational overhead. Experimental validation on the large-scale Argoverse 2 dataset demonstrates our approach's superior performance, offering a viable solution for computationally efficient, high-quality joint trajectory prediction and controllable generation for autonomous driving.

In this process, the complexity of algorithms used for vehicle control has grown significantly. Model Predictive Control (MPC) is a prominent example, which has gained enormous popularity and is now widely used for vehicle motion planning and control. However, safety concerns constrain its practical application, especially since traditional procedures of functional safety (FS), with its universal standard ISO26262, reach their limits. Concomitantly, the new aspect of safety-of-the-intended-function (SOTIF) has moved into the center of attention, whose standard, ISO21448, has only been released in 2022. Thus, experience with SOTIF is low and few case studies are available in industry and research. Hence this paper aims to make two main contributions: (1) an analysis of the SOTIF for a generic MPC-based trajectory planner and (2) an interpretation and concrete application of the generic procedures described in ISO21448 for determining functional insufficiencies (FIs) and triggering conditions (TCs). Particular novelties of the paper include an approach for the out-of-context development of SOTIF-related elements (SOTIF-EooC), a compilation of important FIs and TCs for a MPC-based trajectory planner, and an optimized safety concept based on the identified FIs and TCs for the MPC-based trajectory planner.</p></details> | Extended Version |

We propose an expression exploration framework based on deep symbolic regression (DSR) integrated with a variable intersection selection (VIS) method to find variable combinations that encourage interpretable and parsimonious mathematical expressions. In the exploration learning process, two penalty terms are added to improve the reward function: (i) a complexity penalty to regulate the complexity of the explored expressions to be parsimonious, and (ii) a variable interaction penalty to encourage the expression exploration to focus on variable combinations that can best describe the data. We show the performance of the proposed method to learn several car-following dynamics models and discuss its limitations and future research directions.</p></details> |  |

Nonetheless, the potential of transformer-based diffusion models for effectively generating videos with controllable motion remains an area of limited exploration. This paper introduces Tora, the first trajectory-oriented DiT framework that integrates textual, visual, and trajectory conditions concurrently for video generation. Specifically, Tora consists of a Trajectory Extractor~(TE), a Spatial-Temporal DiT, and a Motion-guidance Fuser~(MGF). The TE encodes arbitrary trajectories into hierarchical spacetime motion patches with a 3D video compression network. The MGF integrates the motion patches into the DiT blocks to generate consistent videos following trajectories. Our design aligns seamlessly with DiT's scalability, allowing precise control of video content's dynamics with diverse durations, aspect ratios, and resolutions. Extensive experiments demonstrate Tora's excellence in achieving high motion fidelity, while also meticulously simulating the movement of the physical world.

Learning-based approaches for multi-agent trajectory prediction, such as primarily relying on graph neural networks, graph transformers, and hypergraph neural networks, have demonstrated outstanding performance on real-world datasets in recent years. However, the hypergraph transformer-based method for trajectory prediction is yet to be explored. Therefore, we present a MultiscAle Relational Transformer (MART) network for multi-agent trajectory prediction. MART is a hypergraph transformer architecture to consider individual and group behaviors in transformer machinery. The core module of MART is the encoder, which comprises a Pair-wise Relational Transformer (PRT) and a Hyper Relational Transformer (HRT). The encoder extends the capabilities of a relational transformer by introducing HRT, which integrates hyperedge features into the transformer mechanism, promoting attention weights to focus on group-wise relations. In addition, we propose an Adaptive Group Estimator (AGE) designed to infer complex group relations in real-world environments. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets (NBA, SDD, and ETH-UCY) demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, enhancing ADE/FDE by 3.9%/11.8% on the NBA dataset.

Due to the intractable growth of non-convex constraints with the number of agents, exploring various homotopy classes that imply different convex domains, is crucial for finding a feasible solution. However, existing methods struggle to explore various homotopy classes efficiently due to combining it with time-consuming precise trajectory solution finding. CSDO, addresses this limitation by separating them into different levels and integrating an efficient Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) algorithm to search homotopy classes. It first searches for a coarse initial guess using a large search step, identifying a specific homotopy class. Subsequent decentralized Quadratic Programming (QP) refinement processes this guess, resolving minor collisions efficiently. Experimental results demonstrate that CSDO outperforms existing MVTP algorithms in large-scale, high-density scenarios, achieving up to 95% success rate in 50m $\times$ 50m random scenarios around one second.

We introduce the Enhanced Transformer for Health Outcome Simulation (ETHOS), a novel application of the transformer deep-learning architecture for analyzing high-dimensional, heterogeneous, and episodic health data. ETHOS is trained using Patient Health Timelines (PHTs)-detailed, tokenized records of health events-to predict future health trajectories, leveraging a zero-shot learning approach. ETHOS represents a significant advancement in foundation model development for healthcare analytics, eliminating the need for labeled data and model fine-tuning. Its ability to simulate various treatment pathways and consider patient-specific factors positions ETHOS as a tool for care optimization and addressing biases in healthcare delivery. Future developments will expand ETHOS' capabilities to incorporate a wider range of data types and data sources. Our work demonstrates a pathway toward accelerated AI development and deployment in healthcare.</p></details> |  |
| **[Acting upon Imagination: when to trust imagined trajectories in model based reinforcement learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.05716v6)** | 2024-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) aims to learn model(s) of the environment dynamics that can predict the outcome of its actions. Forward application of the model yields so called imagined trajectories (sequences of action, predicted state-reward) used to optimize the set of candidate actions that maximize expected reward. The outcome, an ideal imagined trajectory or plan, is imperfect and typically MBRL relies on model predictive control (MPC) to overcome this by continuously re-planning from scratch, incurring thus major computational cost and increasing complexity in tasks with longer receding horizon. We propose uncertainty estimation methods for online evaluation of imagined trajectories to assess whether further planned actions can be trusted to deliver acceptable reward. These methods include comparing the error after performing the last action with the standard expected error and using model uncertainty to assess the deviation from expected outcomes. Additionally, we introduce methods that exploit the forward propagation of the dynamics model to evaluate if the remainder of the plan aligns with expected results and assess the remainder of the plan in terms of the expected reward. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed uncertainty estimation methods by applying them to avoid unnecessary trajectory replanning in a shooting MBRL setting. Results highlight significant reduction on computational costs without sacrificing performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Safe and Non-Conservative Trajectory Planning for Autonomous Driving Handling Unanticipated Behaviors of Traffic Participants](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13396v2)** | 2024-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory planning for autonomous driving is challenging because the unknown future motion of traffic participants must be accounted for, yielding large uncertainty. Stochastic Model Predictive Control (SMPC)-based planners provide non-conservative planning, but do not rule out a (small) probability of collision. We propose a control scheme that yields an efficient trajectory based on SMPC when the traffic scenario allows, still avoiding that the vehicle causes collisions with traffic participants if the latter move according to the prediction assumptions. If some traffic participant does not behave as anticipated, no safety guarantee can be given. Then, our approach yields a trajectory which minimizes the probability of collision, using Constraint Violation Probability Minimization techniques. Our algorithm can also be adapted to minimize the anticipated harm caused by a collision. We provide a thorough discussion of the benefits of our novel control scheme and compare it to a previous approach through numerical simulations from the CommonRoad database.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scene-Specific Trajectory Sets: Maximizing Representation in Motion Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20732v1)** | 2024-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Representing diverse and plausible future trajectories of actors is crucial for motion forecasting in autonomous driving. However, efficiently capturing the true trajectory distribution with a compact set is challenging. In this work, we propose a novel approach for generating scene-specific trajectory sets that better represent the diversity and admissibility of future actor behavior. Our method constructs multiple trajectory sets tailored to different scene contexts, such as intersections and non-intersections, by leveraging map information and actor dynamics. We introduce a deterministic goal sampling algorithm that identifies relevant map regions and generates trajectories conditioned on the scene layout. Furthermore, we empirically investigate various sampling strategies and set sizes to optimize the trade-off between coverage and diversity. Experiments on the Argoverse 2 dataset demonstrate that our scene-specific sets achieve higher plausibility while maintaining diversity compared to traditional single-set approaches. The proposed Recursive In-Distribution Subsampling (RIDS) method effectively condenses the representation space and outperforms metric-driven sampling in terms of trajectory admissibility. Our work highlights the benefits of scene-aware trajectory set generation for capturing the complex and heterogeneous nature of actor behavior in real-world driving scenarios.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces Aircraft Trajectory Segmentation-based Contrastive Coding (ATSCC), a novel self-supervised time series representation learning framework designed to capture semantic information in air traffic trajectory data. The framework leverages the segmentable characteristic of trajectories and ensures consistency within the self-assigned segments. Intensive experiments were conducted on datasets from three different airports, totaling four datasets, comparing the learned representation's performance of downstream classification and clustering with other state-of-the-art representation learning techniques. The results show that ATSCC outperforms these methods by aligning with the labels defined by aeronautical procedures. ATSCC is adaptable to various airport configurations and scalable to incomplete trajectories. This research has expanded upon existing capabilities, achieving these improvements independently without predefined inputs such as airport configurations, maneuvering procedures, or labeled data.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 7 figures.

Typical stochastic mobility models, e.g., random waypoint model and Gauss Markov model, can hardly capture the distribution characteristics of users within real-world areas. State-of-the-art trace-based mobility models and existing learning-based trajectory generation methods, however, are frequently constrained by the inaccessibility of substantial real trajectories due to privacy concerns. In this paper, we harness the intrinsic correlation between street maps and trajectories and develop a novel zero-shot trajectory generation method, named Map2Traj, by exploiting the diffusion model. We incorporate street maps as a condition to consistently pilot the denoising process and train our model on diverse sets of real trajectories from various regions in Xi'an, China, and their corresponding street maps. With solely the street map of an unobserved area, Map2Traj generates synthetic trajectories that not only closely resemble the real-world mobility pattern but also offer comparable efficacy. Extensive experiments validate the efficacy of our proposed method on zero-shot trajectory generation tasks in terms of both trajectory and distribution similarities. In addition, a case study of employing Map2Traj in wireless network optimization is presented to validate its efficacy for downstream applications.</p></details> |  |

SAPI uses an abstract way to represent and encode surrounding environment by utilizing information from real-time map, right-of-way, and surrounding traffic. The proposed model consists of two convolutional network (CNN) and recurrent neural network (RNN)-based encoders and one decoder. A refiner is proposed to conduct a look-back operation inside the model, in order to make full use of raw history trajectory information. We evaluate SAPI on a proprietary dataset collected in real-world intersections through autonomous vehicles. It is demonstrated that SAPI shows promising performance when predicting vehicle trajectories at intersection, and outperforms benchmark methods. The average displacement error(ADE) and final displacement error(FDE) for 6-second prediction are 1.84m and 4.32m respectively. We also show that the proposed model can accurately predict vehicle trajectories in different scenarios.</p></details> |  |

Recent manifold learning-based methods have partially addressed the dimensionality and dataset size issues, but struggle with the complex text-conditional distribution. In this paper we propose a text-based trajectory generation model that attempts to address all three challenges while relying on only a handful of demonstration trajectory data. Our key idea is to leverage recent flow-based models capable of capturing complex conditional distributions, not directly in the high-dimensional trajectory space, but rather in the low-dimensional latent coordinate space of the motion manifold, with deliberately designed regularization terms to ensure smoothness of motions and robustness to text variations. We show that our {\it Motion Manifold Flow Primitive (MMFP)} framework can accurately generate qualitatively distinct motions for a wide range of text inputs, significantly outperforming existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 10 figures, under review</p></details> |

Traditional methods usually perform holistic inference on the trajectories of agents, neglecting the differences in prediction difficulty among agents. This paper proposes a novel Difficulty-Guided Feature Enhancement Network (DGFNet), which leverages the prediction difficulty differences among agents for multi-agent trajectory prediction. Firstly, we employ spatio-temporal feature encoding and interaction to capture rich spatio-temporal features. Secondly, a difficulty-guided decoder is used to control the flow of future trajectories into subsequent modules, obtaining reliable future trajectories. Then, feature interaction and fusion are performed through the future feature interaction module. Finally, the fused agent features are fed into the final predictor to generate the predicted trajectory distributions for multiple participants. Experimental results demonstrate that our DGFNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Argoverse 1\&2 motion forecasting benchmarks. Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of each module. Moreover, compared with SOTA methods, our method balances trajectory prediction accuracy and real-time inference speed.</p></details> |  |

Nevertheless, with the increasing granularity and complexity of vehicle-generated data, the lack of data quality audits raises concerns about multi-party mistrust in trajectory prediction tasks. In response, this paper proposes an asynchronous federated learning data sharing method based on an interpretable reputation quantization mechanism utilizing graph neural network tools. Data providers share data structures under differential privacy constraints to ensure security while reducing redundant data. We implement deep reinforcement learning to categorize vehicles by reputation level, which optimizes the aggregation efficiency of federated learning. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed data sharing scheme not only reinforces the security of the trajectory prediction task but also enhances prediction accuracy.</p></details> |  |

Human trajectory prediction is a noisy process, and no prediction does precisely match any future trajectory. It is therefore approached as a stochastic problem, where the goal is to minimise the error between the true and the predicted trajectory. In this work, we explore the application of metamorphic testing for human trajectory prediction. Metamorphic testing is designed to handle unclear or missing test oracles. It is well-designed for human trajectory prediction, where there is no clear criterion of correct or incorrect human behaviour. Metamorphic relations rely on transformations over source test cases and exploit invariants. A setting well-designed for human trajectory prediction where there are many symmetries of expected human behaviour under variations of the input, e.g. mirroring and rescaling of the input data. We discuss how metamorphic testing can be applied to stochastic human trajectory prediction and introduce the Wasserstein Violation Criterion to statistically assess whether a follow-up test case violates a label-preserving metamorphic relation.</p></details> | <details><summary>MET'2...</summary><p>MET'24: 9th ACM International Workshop on Metamorphic Testing</p></details> |

If the opposing vehicles do not react to the ego vehicle, they can be predicted accurately. However, if there is interaction between the vehicles, the prediction loses its validity. For high interaction, instead of a planning approach that reacts exclusively to the fixed prediction, a trajectory planning approach is required that incorporates the interaction with the opposing vehicles. This paper demonstrates the limitations of a widely used conventional sampling-based approach within a highly interactive blocking scenario. We show that high success rates are achieved for less aggressive blocking behavior but that the collision rate increases with more significant interaction. We further propose a novel Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based trajectory planning approach for racing that explicitly exploits the interaction with the opposing vehicle without requiring a prediction. In contrast to the conventional approach, the RL-based approach achieves high success rates even for aggressive blocking behavior. Furthermore, we propose a novel safety layer (SL) that intervenes when the trajectory generated by the RL-based approach is infeasible. In that event, the SL generates a sub-optimal but feasible trajectory, avoiding termination of the scenario due to a not found valid solution.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, accepted to be published at the 27th IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems, September 24 - 27, 2024, Edmonton, Canada</p></details> |

However, existing methods often struggle to simultaneously satisfy these two critical requirements. To address this issue, this paper proposes a sampling-based trajectory planning method with a hierarchical structure for formation flight in dense obstacle environments. To ensure reliable local sensing information sharing among UAVs, each UAV generates a safe flight corridor (SFC), which is transmitted to the leader UAV. Subsequently, a sampling-based formation guidance path generation method is designed as the front-end strategy, steering the formation to fly in the desired shape safely with the formation connectivity provided by the SFCs. Furthermore, a model predictive path integral (MPPI) based distributed trajectory optimization method is developed as the back-end part, which ensures the smoothness, safety and dynamics feasibility of the executable trajectory. To validate the efficiency of the developed algorithm, comprehensive simulation comparisons are conducted.

However, measuring real-world detouring behavior is challenging due to the need to track the movement of individual vehicles. Recent developments in high-resolution vehicle trajectory data have enabled transportation professionals to observe real-world detouring behaviors without the need to install and maintain hardware such as license plate reading cameras. This paper investigates the feasibility of vehicle probe trajectory data to capture commercial motor vehicle (CMV) detouring behavior under three unique case studies. Before doing so, a validation analysis was conducted to investigate the ability of CMV probe trajectory data to represent overall CMV volumes at well-calibrated count stations near virtual weigh stations (VWS) in Maryland. The validation analysis showed strong positive correlations (above 0.75) at all VWS stations. Upon validating the data, a methodology was applied to assess CMV detour behaviors associated with CMV enforcement activities, congestion avoidance, and incident induced temporary road closures.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at Transportation Research Board Annual Meeting 2024.

Existing methods often focus solely on either language or full trajectory control, lacking precision in synthesizing motions aligned with user-specified trajectories, especially for multi-joint control. To address these issues, we present TLControl, a novel method for realistic human motion synthesis, incorporating both low-level Trajectory and high-level Language semantics controls, through the integration of neural-based and optimization-based techniques. Specifically, we begin with training a VQ-VAE for a compact and well-structured latent motion space organized by body parts. We then propose a Masked Trajectories Transformer (MTT) for predicting a motion distribution conditioned on language and trajectory. Once trained, we use MTT to sample initial motion predictions given user-specified partial trajectories and text descriptions as conditioning. Finally, we introduce a test-time optimization to refine these coarse predictions for precise trajectory control, which offers flexibility by allowing users to specify various optimization goals and ensures high runtime efficiency. Comprehensive experiments show that TLControl significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art in trajectory accuracy and time efficiency, making it practical for interactive and high-quality animation generation.</p></details> |  |

This model can characterize the stubbornness of the human, which measures how strong the human adheres to his preferred trajectory. Accordingly, a static model is introduced indicating a link between the force in haptically coupled human-robot interactions and humans's stubbornness. The introduced stubbornness parameter enables an application-independent reaction of the automation for the cooperative trajectory planning. Simulation results in the context of human-machine cooperation in a care application show that the proposed behavioral model can quantitatively estimate the stubbornness of the interacting human, enabling a more targeted adaptation of the automation to the human behavior.</p></details> |  |

Traditional methodologies have leaned heavily on historical trajectory data, frequently overlooking vital contextual cues such as pedestrian-specific traits and environmental factors. Furthermore, there's a notable knowledge gap as trajectory and intention prediction have largely been approached as separate problems, despite their mutual dependence. To bridge this gap, we introduce PTINet (Pedestrian Trajectory and Intention Prediction Network), which jointly learns the trajectory and intention prediction by combining past trajectory observations, local contextual features (individual pedestrian behaviors), and global features (signs, markings etc.). The efficacy of our approach is evaluated on widely used public datasets: JAAD and PIE, where it has demonstrated superior performance over existing state-of-the-art models in trajectory and intention prediction. The results from our experiments and ablation studies robustly validate PTINet's effectiveness in jointly exploring intention and trajectory prediction for pedestrian behaviour modelling. The experimental evaluation indicates the advantage of using global and local contextual features for pedestrian trajectory and intention prediction. The effectiveness of PTINet in predicting pedestrian behavior paves the way for the development of automated systems capable of seamlessly interacting with pedestrians in urban settings.</p></details> |  |

A class of parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) aims to mitigate these computational challenges by selectively fine-tuning only a small fraction of the model parameters. Although computationally efficient, these techniques often fail to match the performance of fully fine-tuned models, primarily due to inherent biases introduced during parameter selection. Traditional selective PEFT techniques use a fixed set of parameters based on a predefined budget (a process also known as unmasking), failing to capture parameter importance dynamically and often ending up exceeding the budget. We introduce $\text{ID}^3$, a novel selective PEFT method that calculates parameter importance continually and dynamically unmasks parameters by balancing exploration and exploitation in parameter selection. Our empirical study on 15 tasks spanning natural language understanding and generative tasks demonstrates the effectiveness of our method compared to fixed-masking-based PEFT techniques. We analytically show that $\text{ID}^3$ reduces the number of gradient updates by a factor of two, enhancing computational efficiency. $\text{ID}^3$ is robust to random initialization of neurons and, therefore, can be seamlessly integrated into existing additive and reparametrization-based PEFT modules such as adapters and LoRA for dynamic sparsification.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 7 tables, 9 figures</p></details> |
| **[Explicit Inductive Inference using Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14467v1)** | 2024-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are reported to hold undesirable attestation bias on inference tasks: when asked to predict if a premise P entails a hypothesis H, instead of considering H's conditional truthfulness entailed by P, LLMs tend to use the out-of-context truth label of H as a fragile proxy. In this paper, we propose a pipeline that exploits this bias to do explicit inductive inference. Our pipeline uses an LLM to transform a premise into a set of attested alternatives, and then aggregate answers of the derived new entailment inquiries to support the original inference prediction. On a directional predicate entailment benchmark, we demonstrate that by applying this simple pipeline, we can improve the overall performance of LLMs on inference and substantially alleviate the impact of their attestation bias.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evaluating Large Language Models on Spatial Tasks: A Multi-Task Benchmarking Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14438v1)** | 2024-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The advent of large language models such as ChatGPT, Gemini, and others has underscored the importance of evaluating their diverse capabilities, ranging from natural language understanding to code generation. However, their performance on spatial tasks has not been comprehensively assessed. This study addresses this gap by introducing a novel multi-task spatial evaluation dataset, designed to systematically explore and compare the performance of several advanced models on spatial tasks. The dataset encompasses twelve distinct task types, including spatial understanding and path planning, each with verified, accurate answers. We evaluated multiple models, including OpenAI's gpt-3.5-turbo, gpt-4o, and ZhipuAI's glm-4, through a two-phase testing approach. Initially, we conducted zero-shot testing, followed by categorizing the dataset by difficulty and performing prompt tuning tests. Results indicate that gpt-4o achieved the highest overall accuracy in the first phase, with an average of 71.3%. Although moonshot-v1-8k slightly underperformed overall, it surpassed gpt-4o in place name recognition tasks. The study also highlights the impact of prompt strategies on model performance in specific tasks. For example, the Chain-of-Thought (COT) strategy increased gpt-4o's accuracy in path planning from 12.4% to 87.5%, while a one-shot strategy enhanced moonshot-v1-8k's accuracy in mapping tasks from 10.1% to 76.3%.</p></details> |  |

CHARTOM consists of specially designed data visualizing charts. Given a chart, a language model needs to not only correctly comprehend the chart (the FACT question) but also judge if the chart will be misleading to a human reader (the MIND question). Both questions have significant societal benefits. We detail the construction of the CHARTOM benchmark including its calibration on human performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Dataset and Benchmark for Hospital Course Summarization with Adapted Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05720v2)** | 2024-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Brief hospital course (BHC) summaries are clinical documents that summarize a patient's hospital stay. While large language models (LLMs) depict remarkable capabilities in automating real-world tasks, their capabilities for healthcare applications such as synthesizing BHCs from clinical notes have not been shown. We introduce a novel pre-processed dataset, the MIMIC-IV-BHC, encapsulating clinical note and brief hospital course (BHC) pairs to adapt LLMs for BHC synthesis. Furthermore, we introduce a benchmark of the summarization performance of two general-purpose LLMs and three healthcare-adapted LLMs. Using clinical notes as input, we apply prompting-based (using in-context learning) and fine-tuning-based adaptation strategies to three open-source LLMs (Clinical-T5-Large, Llama2-13B, FLAN-UL2) and two proprietary LLMs (GPT-3.5, GPT-4). We evaluate these LLMs across multiple context-length inputs using natural language similarity metrics. We further conduct a clinical study with five clinicians, comparing clinician-written and LLM-generated BHCs across 30 samples, focusing on their potential to enhance clinical decision-making through improved summary quality. We observe that the Llama2-13B fine-tuned LLM outperforms other domain-adapted models given quantitative evaluation metrics of BLEU and BERT-Score. GPT-4 with in-context learning shows more robustness to increasing context lengths of clinical note inputs than fine-tuned Llama2-13B. Despite comparable quantitative metrics, the reader study depicts a significant preference for summaries generated by GPT-4 with in-context learning compared to both Llama2-13B fine-tuned summaries and the original summaries, highlighting the need for qualitative clinical evaluation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Synthetic Grid Generator: Synthesizing Large-Scale Power Distribution Grids using Open Street Map](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04923v2)** | 2024-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Nowadays, various stakeholders involved in the analysis of electric power distribution grids face difficulties in the data acquisition related to the grid topology and parameters of grid assets. To mitigate the problem and possibly accelerate the accomplishment of grid studies without access to real data, we propose a novel approach for generating synthetic distribution grids (Syngrids) of (almost) arbitrary size replicating the characteristics of real medium- and low-voltage distribution networks. The method enables large-scale testing without incurring the burden of retrieving and pre-processing real-world data. The proposed algorithm exploits the publicly available information of Open Street Map (OSM). By leveraging geospatial data of real buildings and road networks, the approach allows to construct a Syngrid of chosen size with realistic topology and electrical parameters. It is shown that typical power-flow and short-circuit calculations can be performed on Syngrids ensuring convergence. Within the context of validating the effectiveness of the algorithm and the meaningful similarity of the output to real grids, the topological and electrical characteristics of a Syngrid are compared to their real-world counterparts. Finally, an open-source web platform named as Synthetic Grid Generator (SGG) and based on the proposed algorithm can be used by various stakeholders for the creation of synthetic grids.</p></details> | 8 pages, 8 figures |

However, existing methods are limited by their ability to handle large, complex datasets. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a hybrid approach that combines the strengths of open-source large and small-scale language models (LLMs and LMs) with traditional forecasting methods. We augment traditional methods with dynamic prompting and a grouped-query, multi-head attention mechanism to more effectively capture both intra-series and inter-series dependencies in evolving nonlinear time series data. In addition, we facilitate on-premises customization by fine-tuning smaller open-source LMs for time series trend analysis utilizing descriptions generated by open-source large LMs on consumer-grade hardware using Low-Rank Adaptation with Activation Memory Reduction (LoRA-AMR) technique to reduce computational overhead and activation storage memory demands while preserving inference latency. We combine language model processing for time series trend analysis with traditional time series representation learning method for cross-modal integration, achieving robust and accurate forecasts. The framework effectiveness is demonstrated through extensive experiments on various real-world datasets, outperforming existing methods by significant margins in terms of forecast accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper published at the Deployable AI (DAI) workshop at AAAI-2024</p></details> |
| **[Probing Causality Manipulation of Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14380v1)** | 2024-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown various ability on natural language processing, including problems about causality. It is not intuitive for LLMs to command causality, since pretrained models usually work on statistical associations, and do not focus on causes and effects in sentences. So that probing internal manipulation of causality is necessary for LLMs. This paper proposes a novel approach to probe causality manipulation hierarchically, by providing different shortcuts to models and observe behaviors. We exploit retrieval augmented generation (RAG) and in-context learning (ICL) for models on a designed causality classification task. We conduct experiments on mainstream LLMs, including GPT-4 and some smaller and domain-specific models. Our results suggest that LLMs can detect entities related to causality and recognize direct causal relationships. However, LLMs lack specialized cognition for causality, merely treating them as part of the global semantic of the sentence.</p></details> |  |
| **[Assessing Contamination in Large Language Models: Introducing the LogProber method](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14352v1)** | 2024-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In machine learning, contamination refers to situations where testing data leak into the training set. The issue is particularly relevant for the evaluation of the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs), which are generally trained on gargantuan, and generally opaque, corpora of text scraped from the world wide web. Developing tools to detect contamination is therefore crucial to be able to fairly and properly track the evolution of the performance of LLMs. Most recent works in the field are not tailored to quantify contamination on short sequences of text like we find in psychology questionnaires. In the present paper we introduce LogProber, a novel, efficient, algorithm that we show able to detect contamination using token probability in given sentences. In the second part we investigate the limitations of the method and discuss how different training methods can contaminate models without leaving traces in the token probabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Claim Verification in the Age of Large Language Models: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14317v1)** | 2024-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The large and ever-increasing amount of data available on the Internet coupled with the laborious task of manual claim and fact verification has sparked the interest in the development of automated claim verification systems. Several deep learning and transformer-based models have been proposed for this task over the years. With the introduction of Large Language Models (LLMs) and their superior performance in several NLP tasks, we have seen a surge of LLM-based approaches to claim verification along with the use of novel methods such as Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). In this survey, we present a comprehensive account of recent claim verification frameworks using LLMs. We describe the different components of the claim verification pipeline used in these frameworks in detail including common approaches to retrieval, prompting, and fine-tuning. Finally, we describe publicly available English datasets created for this task.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM-3D Print: Large Language Models To Monitor and Control 3D Printing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14307v1)** | 2024-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Industry 4.0 has revolutionized manufacturing by driving digitalization and shifting the paradigm toward additive manufacturing (AM). Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM), a key AM technology, enables the creation of highly customized, cost-effective products with minimal material waste through layer-by-layer extrusion, posing a significant challenge to traditional subtractive methods. However, the susceptibility of material extrusion techniques to errors often requires expert intervention to detect and mitigate defects that can severely compromise product quality. While automated error detection and machine learning models exist, their generalizability across diverse 3D printer setups, firmware, and sensors is limited, and deep learning methods require extensive labeled datasets, hindering scalability and adaptability. To address these challenges, we present a process monitoring and control framework that leverages pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) alongside 3D printers to detect and address printing defects. The LLM evaluates print quality by analyzing images captured after each layer or print segment, identifying failure modes and querying the printer for relevant parameters. It then generates and executes a corrective action plan. We validated the effectiveness of the proposed framework in identifying defects by comparing it against a control group of engineers with diverse AM expertise. Our evaluation demonstrated that LLM-based agents not only accurately identify common 3D printing errors, such as inconsistent extrusion, stringing, warping, and layer adhesion, but also effectively determine the parameters causing these failures and autonomously correct them without any need for human intervention.</p></details> |  |
| **[BlockPruner: Fine-grained Pruning for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10594v3)** | 2024-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid growth in the size and complexity of large language models (LLMs), the costs associated with their training and inference have escalated significantly. Research indicates that certain layers in LLMs harbor substantial redundancy, and pruning these layers has minimal impact on the overall performance. While various layer pruning methods have been developed based on this insight, they generally overlook the finer-grained redundancies within the layers themselves. In this paper, we delve deeper into the architecture of LLMs and demonstrate that finer-grained pruning can be achieved by targeting redundancies in multi-head attention (MHA) and multi-layer perceptron (MLP) blocks. We propose a novel, training-free structured pruning approach called BlockPruner. Unlike existing layer pruning methods, BlockPruner segments each Transformer layer into MHA and MLP blocks. It then assesses the importance of these blocks using perplexity measures and applies a heuristic search for iterative pruning. We applied BlockPruner to LLMs of various sizes and architectures and validated its performance across a wide range of downstream tasks. Experimental results show that BlockPruner achieves more granular and effective pruning compared to state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Decentralized Singular Value Decomposition for Extremely Large-scale Antenna Array Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14292v1)** | 2024-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this article, the problems of decentralized Singular Value Decomposition (d-SVD) and decentralized Principal Component Analysis (d-PCA) are studied, which are fundamental in various signal processing applications. Two scenarios of d-SVD are considered depending on the availability of the data matrix under consideration. In the first scenario, the matrix of interest is row-wisely available in each local node in the network. In the second scenario, the matrix of interest implicitly forms an outer product generated from two different series of measurements. Combining the lightweight local rational function approximation approach and parallel averaging consensus algorithms, two d-SVD algorithms are proposed to cope with the two aforementioned scenarios. We demonstrate the proposed algorithms with two respective application examples for Extremely Large-scale Antenna Array (ELAA) systems: decentralized sensor localization via low-rank matrix completion and decentralized passive radar detection. Moreover, a non-trivial truncation technique, which employs a representative vector that is orthonormal to the principal signal subspace, is proposed to further reduce the associated communication cost with the d-SVD algorithms. Simulation results show that the proposed d-SVD algorithms converge to the centralized solution with reduced communication cost compared to those facilitated with the state-of-the-art decentralized power method.</p></details> |  |

| **[Pruning Large Language Models with Semi-Structural Adaptive Sparse Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20584v2)** | 2024-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The tremendous success of Large Language Models (LLMs) across various complex tasks relies heavily on their substantial scale, which raises challenges during model deployment due to their large memory consumption. Recently, numerous studies have attempted to compress LLMs using one-shot pruning methods. However, these methods often experience considerable performance degradation on complex language understanding tasks, calling into question the feasibility of pruning in LLMs. To address this issue, we propose a pruning pipeline for semi-structured sparse models via retraining, termed Adaptive Sparse Trainer (AST). Unlike previous one-shot pruning methods, AST incrementally transforms dense models into sparse ones by applying decay to masked weights while allowing the model to adaptively select masks throughout the training process. Furthermore, we observe that using distillation with a dense model as the teacher can prevent the sparse model from falling into local optima and accelerate convergence. In addition, we incorporate extra well-initialized parameters to further enhance model performance with minimal increase in memory footprint. AST can significantly enhance model performance, approaching the level of dense models. When applied to the LLaMA2-7B model, AST reduces the zero-shot accuracy gap between dense and semi-structured sparse models to 1.12% across multiple zero-shot tasks, utilizing less than 0.4% of the pretraining tokens. Our work demonstrates the feasibility of deploying semi-structured sparse large language models and introduces a novel method for achieving highly compressed models when combined with existing quantization techniques.</p></details> |  |

The underlying GSSLBD process produces two sets of $B$-orthonormal generalized Lanczos basis vectors that are also $B$-biorthogonal and a series of bidiagonal matrices whose singular values are taken as the approximations to the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues of $(A,B)$ and the corresponding left and right singular vectors premultiplied with the left and right generalized Lanczos basis matrices form the real and imaginary parts of the associated approximate eigenvectors. A rigorous convergence analysis is made on the desired eigenspaces approaching the Krylov subspaces generated by the GSSLBD process and accuracy estimates are made for the approximate eigenpairs. In finite precision arithmetic, it is shown that the semi-$B$-orthogonality and semi-$B$-biorthogonality of the computed left and right generalized Lanczos vectors suffice to compute the eigenvalues accurately. An efficient partial reorthogonalization strategy is adapted to GSSLBD in order to maintain the desired semi-$B$-orthogonality and semi-$B$-biorthogonality. To be practical, an implicitly restarted GSSLBD algorithm, abbreviated as IRGSSLBD, is developed with partial $B$-reorthogonalizations. Numerical experiments illustrate the robustness and overall efficiency of the IRGSSLBD algorithm.</p></details> | 21 pages |

Traditional static routing algorithms like Dijkstra and A* compute shortest paths but often fail under dynamic conditions. Recent Reinforcement Learning (RL) approaches offer improvements but tend to focus on local optima, risking dead-ends or boundary issues. This paper proposes a novel approach based on causal inference for real-time dynamic path planning, balancing global and local optimality. We first use the static Dijkstra algorithm to compute a globally optimal baseline path. A distributed control strategy then guides vehicles along this path. At intersections, DynamicRouteGPT performs real-time decision-making for local path selection, considering real-time traffic, driving preferences, and unexpected events. DynamicRouteGPT integrates Markov chains, Bayesian inference, and large-scale pretrained language models like Llama3 8B to provide an efficient path planning solution. It dynamically adjusts to traffic scenarios and driver preferences and requires no pre-training, offering broad applicability across road networks. A key innovation is the construction of causal graphs for counterfactual reasoning, optimizing path decisions. Experimental results show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in real-time dynamic path planning for multiple vehicles while providing explainable path selections, offering a novel and efficient solution for complex traffic environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is 12 pages long and represents the initial draft, version 1</p></details> |

However, these systems are often viewed as outdated, requiring extensive maintenance and modernization. Addressing this challenge necessitates innovative tools that can understand and interact with legacy codebases. To this end, we introduce XMainframe, a state-of-the-art large language model (LLM) specifically designed with knowledge of mainframe legacy systems and COBOL codebases. Our solution involves the creation of an extensive data collection pipeline to produce high-quality training datasets, enhancing XMainframe's performance in this specialized domain. Additionally, we present MainframeBench, a comprehensive benchmark for assessing mainframe knowledge, including multiple-choice questions, question answering, and COBOL code summarization. Our empirical evaluations demonstrate that XMainframe consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art LLMs across these tasks. Specifically, XMainframe achieves 30% higher accuracy than DeepSeek-Coder on multiple-choice questions, doubles the BLEU score of Mixtral-Instruct 8x7B on question answering, and scores six times higher than GPT-3.5 on COBOL summarization. Our work highlights the potential of XMainframe to drive significant advancements in managing and modernizing legacy systems, thereby enhancing productivity and saving time for software developers.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploring the Potential of Large Language Models for Heterophilic Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14134v1)** | 2024-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are essential for various graph-based learning tasks. Notably, classical GNN architectures operate under the assumption of homophily, which posits that connected nodes are likely to share similar features. However, this assumption limits the effectiveness of GNNs in handling heterophilic graphs where connected nodes often exhibit dissimilar characteristics. Existing approaches for homophily graphs such as non-local neighbor extension and architectural refinement overlook the rich textual data associated with nodes, which could unlock deeper insights into these heterophilic contexts. With advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs), there is significant promise to enhance GNNs by leveraging the extensive open-world knowledge within LLMs to more effectively interpret and utilize textual data for characterizing heterophilic graphs. In this work, we explore the potential of LLMs for modeling heterophilic graphs and propose a novel two-stage framework: LLM-enhanced edge discriminator and LLM-guided edge reweighting. Specifically, in the first stage, we fine-tune the LLM to better identify homophilic and heterophilic edges based on the textual information of their nodes. In the second stage, we adaptively manage message propagation in GNNs for different edge types based on node features, structures, and heterophilic or homophilic characteristics. To cope with the computational demands when deploying LLMs in practical scenarios, we further explore model distillation techniques to fine-tune smaller, more efficient models that maintain competitive performance. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our framework, demonstrating the feasibility of using LLMs to enhance GNNs for node classification on heterophilic graphs.</p></details> | Under review |

A challenge in LLP arises when the number of instances in a bag (bag size) is numerous, making the traditional LLP methods difficult due to GPU memory limitations. This study aims to develop an LLP method capable of learning from bags with large sizes. In our method, smaller bags (mini-bags) are generated by sampling instances from large-sized bags (original bags), and these mini-bags are used in place of the original bags. However, the proportion of a mini-bag is unknown and differs from that of the original bag, leading to overfitting. To address this issue, we propose a perturbation method for the proportion labels of sampled mini-bags to mitigate overfitting to noisy label proportions. This perturbation is added based on the multivariate hypergeometric distribution, which is statistically modeled. Additionally, loss weighting is implemented to reduce the negative impact of proportions sampled from the tail of the distribution. Experimental results demonstrate that the proportion label perturbation and loss weighting achieve classification accuracy comparable to that obtained without sampling.

Because of special conjugate operation characteristics, time-variant complex conjugate matrix equations need to be transformed into corresponding real field time-variant large-scale linear equations. In this paper, zeroing neural dynamic models based on complex field error (called Con-CZND1) and based on real field error (called Con-CZND2) are proposed for in-depth analysis. Con-CZND1 has fewer elements because of the direct processing of complex matrices. Con-CZND2 needs to be transformed into the real field, with more elements, and its performance is affected by the main diagonal dominance of coefficient matrices. A neural hypercomplex numbers space compressive approximation approach (NHNSCAA) is innovatively proposed. Then Con-CZND1 conj model is constructed. Numerical experiments verify Con-CZND1 conj model effectiveness and highlight NHNSCAA importance.</p></details> |  |

Despite their impressive capabilities, LLMs often exhibit significant performance disparities across different languages and cultural contexts, as demonstrated by various text-only benchmarks. However, current research lacks such benchmarks for multimodal visio-linguistic settings. This work fills this gap by introducing M5, the first comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate LMMs on diverse vision-language tasks within a multilingual and multicultural context. M5 includes eight datasets covering five tasks and $41$ languages, with a focus on underrepresented languages and culturally diverse images. Furthermore, we introduce two novel datasets, M5-VGR and M5-VLOD, including a new Visio-Linguistic Outlier Detection task, in which all evaluated open-source models fail to significantly surpass the random baseline. Through extensive evaluation and analyses, we highlight substantial task-agnostic performance disparities between high- and low-resource languages. Moreover, we show that larger models do not necessarily outperform smaller ones in a multilingual setting.</p></details> |  |
| **[Monkey: Image Resolution and Text Label Are Important Things for Large Multi-modal Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06607v4)** | 2024-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have shown promise in vision-language tasks but struggle with high-resolution input and detailed scene understanding. Addressing these challenges, we introduce Monkey to enhance LMM capabilities. Firstly, Monkey processes input images by dividing them into uniform patches, each matching the size (e.g., 448x448) used in the original training of the well-trained vision encoder. Equipped with individual adapter for each patch, Monkey can handle higher resolutions up to 1344x896 pixels, enabling the detailed capture of complex visual information. Secondly, it employs a multi-level description generation method, enriching the context for scene-object associations. This two-part strategy ensures more effective learning from generated data: the higher resolution allows for a more detailed capture of visuals, which in turn enhances the effectiveness of comprehensive descriptions. Extensive ablative results validate the effectiveness of our designs. Additionally, experiments on 18 datasets further demonstrate that Monkey surpasses existing LMMs in many tasks like Image Captioning and various Visual Question Answering formats. Specially, in qualitative tests focused on dense text question answering, Monkey has exhibited encouraging results compared with GPT4V.

| **[Beyond Detection: Leveraging Large Language Models for Cyber Attack Prediction in IoT Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14045v1)** | 2024-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, numerous large-scale cyberattacks have exploited Internet of Things (IoT) devices, a phenomenon that is expected to escalate with the continuing proliferation of IoT technology. Despite considerable efforts in attack detection, intrusion detection systems remain mostly reactive, responding to specific patterns or observed anomalies. This work proposes a proactive approach to anticipate and mitigate malicious activities before they cause damage. This paper proposes a novel network intrusion prediction framework that combines Large Language Models (LLMs) with Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks. The framework incorporates two LLMs in a feedback loop: a fine-tuned Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) model for predicting network traffic and a fine-tuned Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) for evaluating the predicted traffic. The LSTM classifier model then identifies malicious packets among these predictions. Our framework, evaluated on the CICIoT2023 IoT attack dataset, demonstrates a significant improvement in predictive capabilities, achieving an overall accuracy of 98%, offering a robust solution to IoT cybersecurity challenges.</p></details> |  |

However, despite the fact that data selection has been of utmost importance in vision and natural language processing, little work in robotics has questioned what data such models should actually be trained on. In this work we investigate how to weigh different subsets or ``domains'' of robotics datasets for robot foundation model pre-training. Concrete, we use distributionally robust optimization (DRO) to maximize worst-case performance across all possible downstream domains. Our method, Re-Mix, addresses the wide range of challenges that arise when applying DRO to robotics datasets including variability in action spaces and dynamics across different datasets. Re-Mix employs early stopping, action normalization, and discretization to counteract these issues. Through extensive experimentation on the largest open-source robot manipulation dataset, the Open X-Embodiment dataset, we demonstrate that data curation can have an outsized impact on downstream performance. Specifically, domain weights learned by Re-Mix outperform uniform weights by 38\% on average and outperform human-selected weights by 32\% on datasets used to train existing generalist robot policies, specifically the RT-X models.</p></details> |  |
| **[MLR-Copilot: Autonomous Machine Learning Research based on Large Language Models Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14033v1)** | 2024-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine learning research, crucial for technological advancements and innovation, often faces significant challenges due to its inherent complexity, slow pace of experimentation, and the necessity for specialized expertise. Motivated by this, we present a new systematic framework, autonomous Machine Learning Research with large language models (MLR-Copilot), designed to enhance machine learning research productivity through the automatic generation and implementation of research ideas using Large Language Model (LLM) agents. The framework consists of three phases: research idea generation, experiment implementation, and implementation execution. First, existing research papers are used to generate hypotheses and experimental plans vis IdeaAgent powered by LLMs. Next, the implementation generation phase translates these plans into executables with ExperimentAgent. This phase leverages retrieved prototype code and optionally retrieves candidate models and data. Finally, the execution phase, also managed by ExperimentAgent, involves running experiments with mechanisms for human feedback and iterative debugging to enhance the likelihood of achieving executable research outcomes. We evaluate our framework on five machine learning research tasks and the experimental results show the framework's potential to facilitate the research progress and innovations.</p></details> |  |

Nonetheless, these LLMs present many challenges, particularly in the realm of trustworthiness. Therefore, ensuring the trustworthiness of LLMs emerges as an important topic. This paper introduces TrustLLM, a comprehensive study of trustworthiness in LLMs, including principles for different dimensions of trustworthiness, established benchmark, evaluation, and analysis of trustworthiness for mainstream LLMs, and discussion of open challenges and future directions. Specifically, we first propose a set of principles for trustworthy LLMs that span eight different dimensions. Based on these principles, we further establish a benchmark across six dimensions including truthfulness, safety, fairness, robustness, privacy, and machine ethics. We then present a study evaluating 16 mainstream LLMs in TrustLLM, consisting of over 30 datasets. Our findings firstly show that in general trustworthiness and utility (i.e., functional effectiveness) are positively related. Secondly, our observations reveal that proprietary LLMs generally outperform most open-source counterparts in terms of trustworthiness, raising concerns about the potential risks of widely accessible open-source LLMs. However, a few open-source LLMs come very close to proprietary ones. Thirdly, it is important to note that some LLMs may be overly calibrated towards exhibiting trustworthiness, to the extent that they compromise their utility by mistakenly treating benign prompts as harmful and consequently not responding. Finally, we emphasize the importance of ensuring transparency not only in the models themselves but also in the technologies that underpin trustworthiness. Knowing the specific trustworthy technologies that have been employed is crucial for analyzing their effectiveness.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work is still under work and we welcome your contribution</p></details> |
| **[Probing the Safety Response Boundary of Large Language Models via Unsafe Decoding Path Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10668v3)** | 2024-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are implicit troublemakers. While they provide valuable insights and assist in problem-solving, they can also potentially serve as a resource for malicious activities. Implementing safety alignment could mitigate the risk of LLMs generating harmful responses. We argue that: even when an LLM appears to successfully block harmful queries, there may still be hidden vulnerabilities that could act as ticking time bombs. To identify these underlying weaknesses, we propose to use a cost value model as both a detector and an attacker. Trained on external or self-generated harmful datasets, the cost value model could successfully influence the original safe LLM to output toxic content in decoding process. For instance, LLaMA-2-chat 7B outputs 39.18% concrete toxic content, along with only 22.16% refusals without any harmful suffixes. These potential weaknesses can then be exploited via prompt optimization such as soft prompts on images. We name this decoding strategy: Jailbreak Value Decoding (JVD), emphasizing that seemingly secure LLMs may not be as safe as we initially believe. They could be used to gather harmful data or launch covert attacks.</p></details> |  |
| **[LMM-VQA: Advancing Video Quality Assessment with Large Multimodal Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14008v1)** | 2024-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The explosive growth of videos on streaming media platforms has underscored the urgent need for effective video quality assessment (VQA) algorithms to monitor and perceptually optimize the quality of streaming videos. However, VQA remains an extremely challenging task due to the diverse video content and the complex spatial and temporal distortions, thus necessitating more advanced methods to address these issues. Nowadays, large multimodal models (LMMs), such as GPT-4V, have exhibited strong capabilities for various visual understanding tasks, motivating us to leverage the powerful multimodal representation ability of LMMs to solve the VQA task. Therefore, we propose the first Large Multi-Modal Video Quality Assessment (LMM-VQA) model, which introduces a novel spatiotemporal visual modeling strategy for quality-aware feature extraction. Specifically, we first reformulate the quality regression problem into a question and answering (Q&A) task and construct Q&A prompts for VQA instruction tuning. Then, we design a spatiotemporal vision encoder to extract spatial and temporal features to represent the quality characteristics of videos, which are subsequently mapped into the language space by the spatiotemporal projector for modality alignment. Finally, the aligned visual tokens and the quality-inquired text tokens are aggregated as inputs for the large language model (LLM) to generate the quality score and level. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LMM-VQA achieves state-of-the-art performance across five VQA benchmarks, exhibiting an average improvement of $5\%$ in generalization ability over existing methods. Furthermore, due to the advanced design of the spatiotemporal encoder and projector, LMM-VQA also performs exceptionally well on general video understanding tasks, further validating its effectiveness. Our code will be released at https://github.com/Sueqk/LMM-VQA.</p></details> |  |

Current MLLMs primarily focus on single-image visual understanding, limiting their ability to interpret and integrate information across multiple images. MaVEn addresses this limitation by combining discrete visual symbol sequences, which abstract coarse-grained semantic concepts, with traditional continuous representation sequences that model fine-grained features. This dual approach bridges the semantic gap between visual and textual data, thereby improving the model's ability to process and interpret information from multiple images effectively. Additionally, we design a dynamic reduction mechanism by for long-sequence continuous features to enhance multi-image processing efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that MaVEn significantly enhances MLLMs' understanding in complex multi-image scenarios, while also improving performance in single-image contexts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Semantic Communication based on Large Language Model for Underwater Image Transmission](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12616v2)** | 2024-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Underwater communication is essential for environmental monitoring, marine biology research, and underwater exploration. Traditional underwater communication faces limitations like low bandwidth, high latency, and susceptibility to noise, while semantic communication (SC) offers a promising solution by focusing on the exchange of semantics rather than symbols or bits. However, SC encounters challenges in underwater environments, including semantic information mismatch and difficulties in accurately identifying and transmitting critical information that aligns with the diverse requirements of underwater applications. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Semantic Communication (SC) framework based on Large Language Models (LLMs). Our framework leverages visual LLMs to perform semantic compression and prioritization of underwater image data according to the query from users. By identifying and encoding key semantic elements within the images, the system selectively transmits high-priority information while applying higher compression rates to less critical regions. On the receiver side, an LLM-based recovery mechanism, along with Global Vision ControlNet and Key Region ControlNet networks, aids in reconstructing the images, thereby enhancing communication efficiency and robustness. Our framework reduces the overall data size to 0.8\% of the original. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches, ensuring high-quality, semantically accurate image reconstruction.</p></details> |  |

Three implementation schemes are tried: full fine-tuning of the Bert pretrained model, parameter-efficient fine-tuning of the Bert pretrained model, and self-built language model from scratch. Through the self-built question and answer task dataset, based on the tensorflow and keras deep learning platform framework, the model is constructed and trained to predict the start position and end position of the answer in the bridge design specification given by the user. The experimental results show that full fine-tuning of the Bert pretrained model achieves 100% accuracy in the training-dataset, validation-dataset and test-dataset, and the system can extract the answers from the bridge design specification given by the user to answer various questions of the user; While parameter-efficient fine-tuning of the Bert pretrained model and self-built language model from scratch perform well in the training-dataset, their generalization ability in the test-dataset needs to be improved. The research of this paper provides a useful reference for the development of question answering system in professional field.</p></details> | 10 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Focused Large Language Models are Stable Many-Shot Learners](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13987v1)** | 2024-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In-Context Learning (ICL) enables large language models (LLMs) to achieve rapid task adaptation by learning from demonstrations. With the increase in available context length of LLMs, recent experiments have shown that the performance of ICL does not necessarily scale well in many-shot (demonstration) settings. We theoretically and experimentally confirm that the reason lies in more demonstrations dispersing the model attention from the query, hindering its understanding of key content. Inspired by how humans learn from examples, we propose a training-free method FocusICL, which conducts triviality filtering to avoid attention being diverted by unimportant contents at token-level and operates hierarchical attention to further ensure sufficient attention towards current query at demonstration-level. We also design an efficient hyperparameter searching strategy for FocusICL based on model perplexity of demonstrations. Comprehensive experiments validate that FocusICL achieves an average performance improvement of 5.2% over vanilla ICL and scales well with many-shot demonstrations.</p></details> | 15 pages |

However, their effectiveness in text-related visual tasks remains relatively unexplored. In this paper, we conducted a comprehensive evaluation of Large Multimodal Models, such as GPT4V and Gemini, in various text-related visual tasks including Text Recognition, Scene Text-Centric Visual Question Answering (VQA), Document-Oriented VQA, Key Information Extraction (KIE), and Handwritten Mathematical Expression Recognition (HMER). To facilitate the assessment of Optical Character Recognition (OCR) capabilities in Large Multimodal Models, we propose OCRBench, a comprehensive evaluation benchmark. OCRBench contains 29 datasets, making it the most comprehensive OCR evaluation benchmark available. Furthermore, our study reveals both the strengths and weaknesses of these models, particularly in handling multilingual text, handwritten text, non-semantic text, and mathematical expression recognition. Most importantly, the baseline results presented in this study could provide a foundational framework for the conception and assessment of innovative strategies targeted at enhancing zero-shot multimodal techniques.

| **[AgentMove: Predicting Human Mobility Anywhere Using Large Language Model based Agentic Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13986v1)** | 2024-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human mobility prediction plays a crucial role in various real-world applications. Although deep learning based models have shown promising results over the past decade, their reliance on extensive private mobility data for training and their inability to perform zero-shot predictions, have hindered further advancements. Recently, attempts have been made to apply large language models (LLMs) to mobility prediction task. However, their performance has been constrained by the absence of a systematic design of workflow. They directly generate the final output using LLMs, which limits the potential of LLMs to uncover complex mobility patterns and underestimates their extensive reserve of global geospatial knowledge. In this paper, we introduce AgentMove, a systematic agentic prediction framework to achieve generalized mobility prediction for any cities worldwide. In AgentMove, we first decompose the mobility prediction task into three sub-tasks and then design corresponding modules to complete these subtasks, including spatial-temporal memory for individual mobility pattern mining, world knowledge generator for modeling the effects of urban structure and collective knowledge extractor for capturing the shared patterns among population. Finally, we combine the results of three modules and conduct a reasoning step to generate the final predictions. Extensive experiments on mobility data from two sources in 12 cities demonstrate that AgentMove outperforms the best baseline more than 8% in various metrics and it shows robust predictions with various LLMs as base and also less geographical bias across cities. Codes and data can be found in https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/AgentMove.</p></details> | 13 pages |

We found that pre-existing adversarial attack methodologies exhibit limited transferability and are notably inefficient, particularly when applied to LLMs. In this paper, we analyze the core mechanisms of previous predominant adversarial attack methods, revealing that 1) the distributions of importance score differ markedly among victim models, restricting the transferability; 2) the sequential attack processes induces substantial time overheads. Based on the above two insights, we introduce a new scheme, named TF-Attack, for Transferable and Fast adversarial attacks on LLMs. TF-Attack employs an external LLM as a third-party overseer rather than the victim model to identify critical units within sentences. Moreover, TF-Attack introduces the concept of Importance Level, which allows for parallel substitutions of attacks. We conduct extensive experiments on 6 widely adopted benchmarks, evaluating the proposed method through both automatic and human metrics. Results show that our method consistently surpasses previous methods in transferability and delivers significant speed improvements, up to 20 times faster than earlier attack strategies.</p></details> | 14 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Reformulating Domain Adaptation of Large Language Models as Adapt-Retrieve-Revise: A Case Study on Chinese Legal Domain](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03328v3)** | 2024-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 have recently demonstrated astonishing zero-shot capabilities in general domain tasks, they often generate content with hallucinations in specific domains such as Chinese law, hindering their application in these areas. This is typically due to the absence of training data that encompasses such a specific domain, preventing GPT-4 from acquiring in-domain knowledge. A pressing challenge is that it's not plausible to continue training LLMs of such scale on in-domain data. This paper introduces a simple and effective domain adaptation framework for GPT-4 by reformulating generation as an \textbf{adapt-retrieve-revise} process. The initial step is to \textbf{adapt} an affordable 7B LLM to the target domain by continuing learning on in-domain data. When solving a task, we leverage the adapted LLM to generate a draft answer given a task query. Then, the draft answer will be used to \textbf{retrieve} supporting evidence candidates from an external in-domain knowledge base. Finally, the draft answer and retrieved evidence are concatenated into a whole prompt to let GPT-4 assess the evidence and \textbf{revise} the draft answer to generate the final answer. Our proposal combines the advantages of the efficiency of adapting a smaller 7B model with the evidence-assessing capability of GPT-4 and effectively prevents GPT-4 from generating hallucinatory content. In the zero-shot setting of four Chinese legal tasks, our method improves accuracy by 33.3\% compared to the direct generation by GPT-4. When compared to two stronger retrieval-based baselines, our method outperforms them by 15.4\% and 23.9\%.

However, these steps can introduce hallucinations and accumulate errors. We propose the CoT Rerailer to address these challenges, employing self-consistency and multi-agent debate systems to identify and rectify errors in the reasoning process. The CoT Rerailer first selects the most logically correct Reasoning Path (RP) using consistency checks and critical evaluation by automated agents. It then engages a multi-agent debate system to propose and validate corrections to ensure the generation of an error-free intermediate logical path. The corrected steps are then used to generate a revised reasoning chain to further reduce hallucinations and enhance answer quality. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach across diverse question-answering datasets in various knowledge domains. The CoT Rerailer enhances the reliability of LLM-generated reasoning, contributing to more trustworthy AI driven decision-making processes.</p></details> |  |

To address this, we introduce ConVis, a novel training-free contrastive decoding method. ConVis leverages a text-to-image (T2I) generation model to semantically reconstruct the given image from hallucinated captions. By comparing the contrasting probability distributions produced by the original and reconstructed images, ConVis enables MLLMs to capture visual contrastive signals that penalize hallucination generation. Notably, this method operates purely within the decoding process, eliminating the need for additional data or model updates. Our extensive experiments on five popular benchmarks demonstrate that ConVis effectively reduces hallucinations across various MLLMs, highlighting its potential to enhance model reliability.</p></details> | <details><summary>First...</summary><p>First two authors contributed equally.

| **[Evaluating Attribute Comprehension in Large Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13898v1)** | 2024-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Currently, large vision-language models have gained promising progress on many downstream tasks. However, they still suffer many challenges in fine-grained visual understanding tasks, such as object attribute comprehension. Besides, there have been growing efforts on the evaluations of large vision-language models, but lack of in-depth study of attribute comprehension and the visual language fine-tuning process. In this paper, we propose to evaluate the attribute comprehension ability of large vision-language models from two perspectives: attribute recognition and attribute hierarchy understanding. We evaluate three vision-language interactions, including visual question answering, image-text matching, and image-text cosine similarity. Furthermore, we explore the factors affecting attribute comprehension during fine-tuning. Through a series of quantitative and qualitative experiments, we introduce three main findings: (1) Large vision-language models possess good attribute recognition ability, but their hierarchical understanding ability is relatively limited. (2) Compared to ITC, ITM exhibits superior capability in capturing finer details, making it more suitable for attribute understanding tasks. (3) The attribute information in the captions used for fine-tuning plays a crucial role in attribute understanding. We hope this work can help guide future progress in fine-grained visual understanding of large vision-language models.</p></details> | 15 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Making Large Language Models Better Planners with Reasoning-Decision Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13890v1)** | 2024-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data-driven approaches for autonomous driving (AD) have been widely adopted in the past decade but are confronted with dataset bias and uninterpretability. Inspired by the knowledge-driven nature of human driving, recent approaches explore the potential of large language models (LLMs) to improve understanding and decision-making in traffic scenarios. They find that the pretrain-finetune paradigm of LLMs on downstream data with the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning process can enhance explainability and scene understanding. However, such a popular strategy proves to suffer from the notorious problems of misalignment between the crafted CoTs against the consequent decision-making, which remains untouched by previous LLM-based AD methods. To address this problem, we motivate an end-to-end decision-making model based on multimodality-augmented LLM, which simultaneously executes CoT reasoning and carries out planning results. Furthermore, we propose a reasoning-decision alignment constraint between the paired CoTs and planning results, imposing the correspondence between reasoning and decision-making. Moreover, we redesign the CoTs to enable the model to comprehend complex scenarios and enhance decision-making performance. We dub our proposed large language planners with reasoning-decision alignment as RDA-Driver. Experimental evaluations on the nuScenes and DriveLM-nuScenes benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our RDA-Driver in enhancing the performance of end-to-end AD systems. Specifically, our RDA-Driver achieves state-of-the-art planning performance on the nuScenes dataset with 0.80 L2 error and 0.32 collision rate, and also achieves leading results on challenging DriveLM-nuScenes benchmarks with 0.82 L2 error and 0.38 collision rate.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large Language Models as Carriers of Hidden Messages](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02481v3)** | 2024-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the help of simple fine-tuning, one can artificially embed hidden text into large language models (LLMs). This text is revealed only when triggered by a specific query to the LLM. Two primary applications are LLM fingerprinting and steganography. In the context of LLM fingerprinting, a unique text identifier (fingerprint) is embedded within the model to verify licensing compliance. In the context of steganography, the LLM serves as a carrier for hidden messages that can be disclosed through a chosen trigger question. Our work demonstrates that embedding hidden text in the LLM via fine-tuning, though seemingly secure due to the vast number of potential triggers (any sequence of characters or tokens could serve as a trigger), is susceptible to extraction through analysis of the LLM's output decoding process. We propose an extraction attack called Unconditional Token Forcing (UTF). It is premised on the hypothesis that iteratively feeding each token from the LLM's vocabulary into the model should reveal output sequences with abnormally high token probabilities, indicating potential hidden text candidates. We also present a defense method to hide text in such a way that it is resistant to both UTF and attacks based on sampling decoding methods, which we named Unconditional Token Forcing Confusion (UTFC). To the best of our knowledge, there is no attack method that can extract text hidden with UTFC. UTFC has both benign applications (improving LLM fingerprinting) and malign applications (using LLMs to create covert communication channels).</p></details> | <details><summary>Work ...</summary><p>Work in progress.

However, the effectiveness of this approach remains unclear. This study evaluates the performance of biomedically fine-tuned LLMs against their general-purpose counterparts on a variety of clinical tasks. We evaluated their performance on clinical case challenges from the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) and the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) and on several clinical tasks (e.g., information extraction, document summarization, and clinical coding). Using benchmarks specifically chosen to be likely outside the fine-tuning datasets of biomedical models, we found that biomedical LLMs mostly perform inferior to their general-purpose counterparts, especially on tasks not focused on medical knowledge. While larger models showed similar performance on case tasks (e.g., OpenBioLLM-70B: 66.4% vs. Llama-3-70B-Instruct: 65% on JAMA cases), smaller biomedical models showed more pronounced underperformance (e.g., OpenBioLLM-8B: 30% vs. Llama-3-8B-Instruct: 64.3% on NEJM cases). Similar trends were observed across the CLUE (Clinical Language Understanding Evaluation) benchmark tasks, with general-purpose models often performing better on text generation, question answering, and coding tasks. Our results suggest that fine-tuning LLMs to biomedical data may not provide the expected benefits and may potentially lead to reduced performance, challenging prevailing assumptions about domain-specific adaptation of LLMs and highlighting the need for more rigorous evaluation frameworks in healthcare AI. Alternative approaches, such as retrieval-augmented generation, may be more effective in enhancing the biomedical capabilities of LLMs without compromising their general knowledge.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 3 tables, 1 figure</p></details> |

However, the effective evaluation of alignment for emerging Chinese LLMs is still largely unexplored. To fill in this gap, we introduce AlignBench, a comprehensive multi-dimensional benchmark for evaluating LLMs' alignment in Chinese. We design a human-in-the-loop data curation pipeline, containing eight main categories, 683 real-scenario rooted queries and corresponding human verified references. To ensure the correctness of references, each knowledge-intensive query is accompanied with evidences collected from reliable web sources (including URLs and quotations) by our annotators. For automatic evaluation, our benchmark employs a rule-calibrated multi-dimensional LLM-as-Judge~\cite{zheng2023judging} approach with Chain-of-Thought to generate explanations and final ratings, ensuring high reliability and interpretability. All evaluation code, data, and LLM generations are available at \url{https://github.com/THUDM/AlignBench}.

Despite significant achievements, they rely on enormous training data to acquire a broad spectrum of open-domain knowledge. Besides, their evaluation revolves around open-domain benchmarks like HumanEval, which primarily consist of programming contests. Therefore, it is hard to fully characterize the intricacies and challenges associated with particular domains (e.g., web, game, and math). In this paper, we conduct an in-depth study of the LLMs in domain-specific code generation. Our results demonstrate that LLMs exhibit sub-optimal performance in generating domain-specific code, due to their limited proficiency in utilizing domain-specific libraries. We further observe that incorporating API knowledge as prompts can empower LLMs to generate more professional code. Based on these findings, we further investigate how to effectively incorporate API knowledge into the code generation process. We experiment with three strategies for incorporating domain knowledge, namely, external knowledge inquirer, chain-of-thought prompting, and chain-of-thought fine-tuning. We refer to these strategies as a new code generation approach called DomCoder. Experimental results show that all strategies of DomCoder lead to improvement in the effectiveness of domain-specific code generation under certain settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology (TOSEM 2024)</p></details> |

The extraction of actionable insights from logs is critically dependent on the log parsing process, which converts raw logs into structured formats for downstream analysis. Yet, the complexities of contemporary systems and the dynamic nature of logs pose significant challenges to existing automatic parsing techniques. The emergence of Large Language Models (LLM) offers new horizons. With their expansive knowledge and contextual prowess, LLMs have been transformative across diverse applications. Building on this, we introduce LogParser-LLM, a novel log parser integrated with LLM capabilities. This union seamlessly blends semantic insights with statistical nuances, obviating the need for hyper-parameter tuning and labeled training data, while ensuring rapid adaptability through online parsing. Further deepening our exploration, we address the intricate challenge of parsing granularity, proposing a new metric and integrating human interactions to allow users to calibrate granularity to their specific needs. Our method's efficacy is empirically demonstrated through evaluations on the Loghub-2k and the large-scale LogPub benchmark. In evaluations on the LogPub benchmark, involving an average of 3.6 million logs per dataset across 14 datasets, our LogParser-LLM requires only 272.5 LLM invocations on average, achieving a 90.6% F1 score for grouping accuracy and an 81.1% for parsing accuracy. These results demonstrate the method's high efficiency and accuracy, outperforming current state-of-the-art log parsers, including pattern-based, neural network-based, and existing LLM-enhanced approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM KDD 2024</p></details> |

The motivation behind this exploration stems from the common behavior observed in individuals searching the internet for facts with partial or misleading knowledge. Similar to using web search engines, users may recall fragments of misleading keywords and submit them to an LLM, hoping for a comprehensive response. Our empirical analysis of several LLMs shows the potential danger of these models amplifying misinformation when presented with misleading keywords. Additionally, we thoroughly assess four existing hallucination mitigation strategies to reduce LLMs sycophantic behavior. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of these strategies for generating factually correct statements. Furthermore, our analyses delve into knowledge-probing experiments on factual keywords and different categories of sycophancy mitigation.</p></details> | Findings of ACL 2024 |

The complex hierarchical structure of micrographs often poses challenges for traditional classification methods. In this study, we propose an innovative backbone architecture for analyzing electron micrographs. We create multi-modal representations of the micrographs by tokenizing them into patch sequences and, additionally, representing them as vision graphs, commonly referred to as patch attributed graphs. We introduce the Hierarchical Network Fusion (HNF), a multi-layered network structure architecture that facilitates information exchange between the multi-modal representations and knowledge integration across different patch resolutions. Furthermore, we leverage large language models (LLMs) to generate detailed technical descriptions of nanomaterials as auxiliary information to assist in the downstream task. We utilize a cross-modal attention mechanism for knowledge fusion across cross-domain representations(both image-based and linguistic insights) to predict the nanomaterial category. This multi-faceted approach promises a more comprehensive and accurate representation and classification of micrographs for nanomaterial identification. Our framework outperforms traditional methods, overcoming challenges posed by distributional shifts, and facilitating high-throughput screening.</p></details> | <details><summary>Our p...</summary><p>Our paper is published at the workshop on Robustness of Few-shot and Zero-shot Learning in Foundation Models at NeurIPS 2023</p></details> |

However, such characterization does not take into account the impact of street geometry and the fact that the location of the automotive radars are restricted to the streets as their domain rather than the entire Euclidean plane. In addition, the structure of the streets may change drastically as a vehicle moves out of a city center towards the outskirts. Consequently, not only the radar performance change but also the radar parameters and protocols must be adapted for optimum performance. In this paper, we propose and characterize line and Cox process-based street and point models to analyze large-scale automotive radar networks. We consider the classical Poisson line process (PLP) and the newly introduced Binomial line process (BLP) model to emulate the streets and the corresponding PPP-based Cox process to emulate the vehicular nodes. In particular, the BLP model effectively considers the spatial variation of street geometry across different parts of the city. We derive the effective interference set experienced by an automotive radar, the statistics of distance to interferers, and characterize the detection probability of the ego radar as a function of street and vehicle density. Finally, leveraging the real-world data on urban streets and vehicle density across different cities of the world, we present how the radar performance varies in different parts of the city as well as across different times of the day. Thus, our study equips network operators and automotive manufacturers with essential system design insights to plan and optimize automotive radar networks.</p></details> |  |

Large language model (LLM) has been recently attempted for automatic spreadsheet manipulation but has not yet been investigated in complicated and realistic tasks where reasoning challenges exist (e.g., long horizon manipulation with multi-step reasoning and ambiguous requirements). To bridge the gap with the real-world requirements, we introduce $\textbf{SheetRM}$, a benchmark featuring long-horizon and multi-category tasks with reasoning-dependent manipulation caused by real-life challenges. To mitigate the above challenges, we further propose $\textbf{SheetAgent}$, a novel autonomous agent that utilizes the power of LLMs. SheetAgent consists of three collaborative modules: $\textit{Planner}$, $\textit{Informer}$, and $\textit{Retriever}$, achieving both advanced reasoning and accurate manipulation over spreadsheets without human interaction through iterative task reasoning and reflection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SheetAgent delivers 20-30% pass rate improvements on multiple benchmarks over baselines, achieving enhanced precision in spreadsheet manipulation and demonstrating superior table reasoning abilities.

In addition to these previous works, our algorithm GNN leverages the advantages of graph neural networks and large language models to understand text type values that cannot be understood by PLOD and MOD, thus making the task of predicting outcomes more reliable.

In this paper, we leverage the power and merits of pre-trained large language models (LLMs) to enable automated vulnerability patching using no test input/exploit evidence and without model training/fine-tuning. To elicit LLMs to effectively reason about vulnerable code behaviors, which is essential for quality patch generation, we introduce adaptive prompting on LLMs and instantiate the methodology as LLMPATCH, an automated LLM-based patching system. Our evaluation of LLMPATCH on real-world vulnerable code including zeroday vulnerabilities demonstrates its superior performance to both existing prompting methods and state-of-the-art non-LLM-based techniques (by 98.9% and 65.4% in F1 over the best baseline performance). LLMPATCH has also successfully patched 7 out of 11 zero-day vulnerabilities, including 2 that none of the four baselines compared were able to.</p></details> |  |
| **[Is Sarcasm Detection A Step-by-Step Reasoning Process in Large Language Models?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12725v2)** | 2024-08-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Elaborating a series of intermediate reasoning steps significantly improves the ability of large language models (LLMs) to solve complex problems, as such steps would evoke LLMs to think sequentially. However, human sarcasm understanding is often considered an intuitive and holistic cognitive process, in which various linguistic, contextual, and emotional cues are integrated to form a comprehensive understanding, in a way that does not necessarily follow a step-by-step fashion. To verify the validity of this argument, we introduce a new prompting framework (called SarcasmCue) containing four sub-methods, viz. chain of contradiction (CoC), graph of cues (GoC), bagging of cues (BoC) and tensor of cues (ToC), which elicits LLMs to detect human sarcasm by considering sequential and non-sequential prompting methods. Through a comprehensive empirical comparison on four benchmarks, we highlight three key findings: (1) CoC and GoC show superior performance with more advanced models like GPT-4 and Claude 3.5, with an improvement of 3.5%. (2) ToC significantly outperforms other methods when smaller LLMs are evaluated, boosting the F1 score by 29.7% over the best baseline. (3) Our proposed framework consistently pushes the state-of-the-art (i.e., ToT) by 4.2%, 2.0%, 29.7%, and 58.2% in F1 scores across four datasets. This demonstrates the effectiveness and stability of the proposed framework.</p></details> | 9 pages, 5 figures |

The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) introduces a new dynamic to these practices. Interestingly, the characteristics and potential biases of references recommended by LLMs that entirely rely on their parametric knowledge, and not on search or retrieval-augmented generation, remain unexplored. Here, we analyze these characteristics in an experiment using a dataset from AAAI, NeurIPS, ICML, and ICLR, published after GPT-4's knowledge cut-off date. In our experiment, LLMs are tasked with suggesting scholarly references for the anonymized in-text citations within these papers. Our findings reveal a remarkable similarity between human and LLM citation patterns, but with a more pronounced high citation bias, which persists even after controlling for publication year, title length, number of authors, and venue. The results hold for both GPT-4, and the more capable models GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 where the papers are part of the training data. Additionally, we observe a large consistency between the characteristics of LLM's existing and non-existent generated references, indicating the model's internalization of citation patterns. By analyzing citation graphs, we show that the references recommended are embedded in the relevant citation context, suggesting an even deeper conceptual internalization of the citation networks. While LLMs can aid in citation generation, they may also amplify existing biases, such as the Matthew effect, and introduce new ones, potentially skewing scientific knowledge dissemination.</p></details> | <details><summary>30 pa...</summary><p>30 pages, 13 figures, 4 tables.

While recent research has extended RAG models to complex noisy scenarios, these explorations often confine themselves to limited noise types and presuppose that noise is inherently detrimental to LLMs, potentially deviating from real-world retrieval environments and restricting practical applicability. In this paper, we define seven distinct noise types from a linguistic perspective and establish a Noise RAG Benchmark (NoiserBench), a comprehensive evaluation framework encompassing multiple datasets and reasoning tasks. Through empirical evaluation of eight representative LLMs with diverse architectures and scales, we reveal that these noises can be further categorized into two practical groups: noise that is beneficial to LLMs (aka beneficial noise) and noise that is harmful to LLMs (aka harmful noise). While harmful noise generally impairs performance, beneficial noise may enhance several aspects of model capabilities and overall performance. Our analysis offers insights for developing more robust, adaptable RAG solutions and mitigating hallucinations across diverse retrieval scenarios.</p></details> |  |

However, sarcasm, as a subtle linguistic phenomenon, often employs rhetorical devices like hyperbole and figuration to convey true sentiments and intentions, involving a higher level of abstraction than sentiment analysis. There is growing concern that the argument about LLMs' success may not be fully tenable when considering sarcasm understanding. To address this question, we select eleven SOTA LLMs and eight SOTA pre-trained language models (PLMs) and present comprehensive evaluations on six widely used benchmark datasets through different prompting approaches, i.e., zero-shot input/output (IO) prompting, few-shot IO prompting, chain of thought (CoT) prompting. Our results highlight three key findings: (1) current LLMs underperform supervised PLMs based sarcasm detection baselines across six sarcasm benchmarks. This suggests that significant efforts are still required to improve LLMs' understanding of human sarcasm. (2) GPT-4 consistently and significantly outperforms other LLMs across various prompting methods, with an average improvement of 14.0\%$\uparrow$. Claude 3 and ChatGPT demonstrate the next best performance after GPT-4. (3) Few-shot IO prompting method outperforms the other two methods: zero-shot IO and few-shot CoT. The reason is that sarcasm detection, being a holistic, intuitive, and non-rational cognitive process, is argued not to adhere to step-by-step logical reasoning, making CoT less effective in understanding sarcasm compared to its effectiveness in mathematical reasoning tasks.</p></details> |  |

Successfully disentangling an image into its constituent elements, such as the shape, color, and material properties of the objects of the 3D scene that produced it, requires a comprehensive understanding of the environment. This complexity limits the ability of existing carefully engineered approaches to generalize across domains. Inspired by the zero-shot ability of large language models (LLMs) to generalize to novel contexts, we investigate the possibility of leveraging the broad world knowledge encoded in such models to solve inverse-graphics problems. To this end, we propose the Inverse-Graphics Large Language Model (IG-LLM), an inverse-graphics framework centered around an LLM, that autoregressively decodes a visual embedding into a structured, compositional 3D-scene representation. We incorporate a frozen pre-trained visual encoder and a continuous numeric head to enable end-to-end training. Through our investigation, we demonstrate the potential of LLMs to facilitate inverse graphics through next-token prediction, without the application of image-space supervision. Our analysis enables new possibilities for precise spatial reasoning about images that exploit the visual knowledge of LLMs. We release our code and data at https://ig-llm.is.tue.mpg.de/ to ensure the reproducibility of our investigation and to facilitate future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>TMLR ...</summary><p>TMLR camera-ready; 31 pages; project page: https://ig-llm.is.tue.mpg.de/</p></details> |

To address these challenges, we take a novel approach that leverages large language models (LLMs) to synthesize clinically useful insights from multi-sensor data. We develop chain of thought prompting methods that use LLMs to generate reasoning about how trends in data such as step count and sleep relate to conditions like depression and anxiety. We first demonstrate binary depression classification with LLMs achieving accuracies of 61.1% which exceed the state of the art. While it is not robust for clinical use, this leads us to our key finding: even more impactful and valued than classification is a new human-AI collaboration approach in which clinician experts interactively query these tools and combine their domain expertise and context about the patient with AI generated reasoning to support clinical decision-making. We find models like GPT-4 correctly reference numerical data 75% of the time, and clinician participants express strong interest in using this approach to interpret self-tracking data.</p></details> |  |

However, both the precision and accuracy of these search techniques is limited by the presence or absence of specific keywords, making literature review akin to searching for needles in a haystack. We present vitaLITy 2, a solution that uses a Large Language Model or LLM-based approach to identify semantically relevant literature in a textual embedding space.

In this paper, we introduce a precise and quantitative law that governs the learning of contextualized token embeddings through intermediate layers in pre-trained LLMs for next-token prediction. Our findings reveal that each layer contributes equally to enhancing prediction accuracy, from the lowest to the highest layer -- a universal phenomenon observed across a diverse array of open-source LLMs, built on architectures such as Transformer, RWKV, and Mamba. We demonstrate that this law offers new perspectives and insights to inform and guide practices in LLM development and applications, including model scaling, pre-training tasks, and information flow. Overall, our law enables more fine-grained approaches to the design, training, and interpretation of LLMs through scrutinizing their internal data processing mechanisms.</p></details> |  |

In response, we present a comprehensive text prompt that, given a tabular dataset and an NL query about the dataset, generates an analytic specification including (detected) data attributes, (inferred) analytic tasks, and (recommended) visualizations. This specification captures key aspects of the query translation process, affording both explainability and debuggability. For instance, it provides mappings from the detected entities to the corresponding phrases in the input query, as well as the specific visual design principles that determined the visualization recommendations. Moreover, unlike prior LLM-based approaches, our prompt supports conversational interaction and ambiguity detection capabilities. In this paper, we detail the iterative process of curating our prompt, present a preliminary performance evaluation using GPT-4, and discuss the strengths and limitations of LLMs at various stages of query translation. The prompt is open-source and integrated into NL4DV, a popular Python-based natural language toolkit for visualization, which can be accessed at https://nl4dv.github.io.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 3 figures.

LalaEval proposes a comprehensive suite of end-to-end protocols that cover five main components including domain specification, criteria establishment, benchmark dataset creation, construction of evaluation rubrics, and thorough analysis and interpretation of evaluation outcomes. This initiative aims to fill a crucial research gap by providing a systematic methodology for conducting standardized human evaluations within specific domains, a practice that, despite its widespread application, lacks substantial coverage in the literature and human evaluation are often criticized to be less reliable due to subjective factors, so standardized procedures adapted to the nuanced requirements of specific domains or even individual organizations are in great need. Furthermore, the paper demonstrates the framework's application within the logistics industry, presenting domain-specific evaluation benchmarks, datasets, and a comparative analysis of LLMs for the logistics domain use, highlighting the framework's capacity to elucidate performance differences and guide model selection and development for domain-specific LLMs. Through real-world deployment, the paper underscores the framework's effectiveness in advancing the field of domain-specific LLM evaluation, thereby contributing significantly to the ongoing discussion on LLMs' practical utility and performance in domain-specific applications.</p></details> |  |

So far, researchers have been the main powerhouse behind hypothesis generation by painstaking data analysis and thinking (also known as the Eureka moment). In this paper, we examine the potential of large language models (LLMs) to generate hypotheses. We focus on hypothesis generation based on data (i.e., labeled examples). To enable LLMs to handle arbitrarily long contexts, we generate initial hypotheses from a small number of examples and then update them iteratively to improve the quality of hypotheses. Inspired by multi-armed bandits, we design a reward function to inform the exploitation-exploration tradeoff in the update process. Our algorithm is able to generate hypotheses that enable much better predictive performance than few-shot prompting in classification tasks, improving accuracy by 31.7% on a synthetic dataset and by 13.9%, 3.3% and, 24.9% on three real-world datasets. We also outperform supervised learning by 12.8% and 11.2% on two challenging real-world datasets. Furthermore, we find that the generated hypotheses not only corroborate human-verified theories but also uncover new insights for the tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, 6 figures, code link: https://github.com/ChicagoHAI/hypothesis_generation</p></details> |

The largest of these experiments (in 2022) has attracted over 100 million users who collaborated and competed to produce elaborate artworks that together provide a unique view of the shared interests connecting the diverse communities on Reddit. The user activity traces resulting from these experiments enable us to analyze how online users engage, collaborate, and compete online at an unprecedented scale. However, this requires labeling millions of updates made during the experiments according to their intended artwork. This paper characterizes large-scale activity traces from r/place with a focus on dynamics around successful and failed artworks. To achieve this goal, we propose a dynamic graph clustering algorithm to label artworks by leveraging visual and user-level features. %In the first phase of the algorithm, updates within a snapshot of the experiment are grouped based on proximity, color, and user embeddings. In the second phase, clusters across snapshots are merged via an efficient approximation for the set cover problem. We apply the proposed algorithm to the 2017 edition of r/place and show that it outperforms an existing baseline in terms of accuracy and running time. Moreover, we use our algorithm to identify key factors that distinguish successful from failed artworks in terms of user engagement, collaboration, and competition.</p></details> | 8 pages, 8 figures |

Developed with a focus on real-world engineering challenges, DesignQA uniquely combines multimodal data-including textual design requirements, CAD images, and engineering drawings-derived from the Formula SAE student competition. Different from many existing MLLM benchmarks, DesignQA contains document-grounded visual questions where the input image and input document come from different sources. The benchmark features automatic evaluation metrics and is divided into segments-Rule Comprehension, Rule Compliance, and Rule Extraction-based on tasks that engineers perform when designing according to requirements. We evaluate state-of-the-art models (at the time of writing) like GPT-4o, GPT-4, Claude-Opus, Gemini-1.0, and LLaVA-1.5 against the benchmark, and our study uncovers the existing gaps in MLLMs' abilities to interpret complex engineering documentation. The MLLMs tested, while promising, struggle to reliably retrieve relevant rules from the Formula SAE documentation, face challenges in recognizing technical components in CAD images, and encounter difficulty in analyzing engineering drawings. These findings underscore the need for multimodal models that can better handle the multifaceted questions characteristic of design according to technical documentation. This benchmark sets a foundation for future advancements in AI-supported engineering design processes. DesignQA is publicly available at: https://github.com/anniedoris/design_qa/.</p></details> |  |

These textual features are combined with quantitative features and input into a Causality-Driven Feature Generator. An Optuna-optimized Bi-LSTM model is then used to forecast the EUR/USD exchange rate. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms benchmark models, reducing MAE by 10.69% and RMSE by 9.56% compared to the best performing baseline. Results also show the benefits of data fusion, with the combination of unstructured and structured data yielding higher accuracy than structured data alone. Furthermore, feature selection using the top 12 important quantitative features combined with the textual features proves most effective. The proposed IUS framework and Optuna-Bi-LSTM model provide a powerful new approach for exchange rate forecasting through multi-source data integration.</p></details> |  |

While their ability to automate difficult reasoning processes required to handle protocols at that scale is impressive, there remains a gap in the modeling languages used. In particular, providing support for writing and maintaining large protocol specifications. This work attempts to fill this gap by introducing a high-level protocol modeling language, called Tamgram, with a formal semantics that can be translated to the multiset rewriting semantics of Tamarin. Tamgram supports writing native Tamarin code directly, but also allows for easier structuring of large specifications through various high-level constructs, in particular those needed to manipulate states in protocols. We prove the soundness and the completeness of Tamgram with respect to the trace semantics of Tamarin, discuss different translation strategies, and identify an optimal strategy that yields performance comparable to manually coded Tamarin specifications. Finally we show the practicality of Tamgram with a set of small case studies and one large scale case study.</p></details> |  |

The integration of external knowledge from Large Language Models (LLMs) presents a promising avenue for improving healthcare predictions. However, LLM analyses may exhibit significant variance due to ambiguity problems and inconsistency issues, hindering their effective utilization. To address these challenges, we propose IntelliCare, a novel framework that leverages LLMs to provide high-quality patient-level external knowledge and enhance existing EHR models. Concretely, IntelliCare identifies patient cohorts and employs task-relevant statistical information to augment LLM understanding and generation, effectively mitigating the ambiguity problem. Additionally, it refines LLM-derived knowledge through a hybrid approach, generating multiple analyses and calibrating them using both the EHR model and perplexity measures. Experimental evaluations on three clinical prediction tasks across two large-scale EHR datasets demonstrate that IntelliCare delivers significant performance improvements to existing methods, highlighting its potential in advancing personalized healthcare predictions and decision support systems.</p></details> |  |

Despite significant progress, a fundamental challenge remains: balancing the accuracy of personalized health alerts with stringent privacy protection in HAS environments constrained by resources. To address this issue, we introduce a uniform framework, LLM-HAS, which incorporates Large Language Models (LLM) into HAS to significantly boost the accuracy, ensure user privacy, and enhance personalized health service, while also improving the subjective quality of experience (QoE) for users. Our innovative framework leverages a Mixture of Experts (MoE) approach, augmented with LLM, to analyze users' personalized preferences and potential health risks from additional textual job descriptions. This analysis guides the selection of specialized Deep Reinforcement Learning (DDPG) experts, tasked with making precise health alerts. Moreover, LLM-HAS can process Conversational User Feedback, which not only allows fine-tuning of DDPG but also deepen user engagement, thereby enhancing both the accuracy and personalization of health management strategies. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the LLM-HAS framework, highlighting its potential as a groundbreaking approach for employing generative AI (GAI) to provide highly accurate and reliable alerts.</p></details> |  |

Some researchers also exploit and enhance the detection performance using pre-trained large foundation models. However, we think these detectors may only get sub-optimal results because the large models they use are not specifically designed for vehicles. In addition, their results heavily rely on visual features, and seldom of they consider the alignment between the vehicle's semantic information and visual representations. In this work, we propose a new vehicle detection paradigm based on a pre-trained foundation vehicle model (VehicleMAE) and a large language model (T5), termed VFM-Det. It follows the region proposal-based detection framework and the features of each proposal can be enhanced using VehicleMAE. More importantly, we propose a new VAtt2Vec module that predicts the vehicle semantic attributes of these proposals and transforms them into feature vectors to enhance the vision features via contrastive learning. Extensive experiments on three vehicle detection benchmark datasets thoroughly proved the effectiveness of our vehicle detector. Specifically, our model improves the baseline approach by $+5.1\%$, $+6.2\%$ on the $AP_{0.5}$, $AP_{0.75}$ metrics, respectively, on the Cityscapes dataset.The source code of this work will be released at https://github.com/Event-AHU/VFM-Det.</p></details> | In Peer Review |
| **[Performance Law of Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09895v2)** | 2024-08-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Guided by the belief of the scaling law, large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance in recent years. However, scaling law only gives a qualitative estimation of loss, which is influenced by various factors such as model architectures, data distributions, tokenizers, and computation precision. Thus, estimating the real performance of LLMs with different training settings rather than loss may be quite useful in practical development. In this article, we present an empirical equation named "Performance Law" to directly predict the MMLU score of an LLM, which is a widely used metric to indicate the general capability of LLMs in real-world conversations and applications. Based on only a few key hyperparameters of the LLM architecture and the size of training data, we obtain a quite accurate MMLU prediction of various LLMs with diverse sizes and architectures developed by different organizations in different years. Performance law can be used to guide the choice of LLM architecture and the effective allocation of computational resources without extensive experiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Perso...</summary><p>Personal opinions of the authors</p></details> |

As ELAA employs a multitude of antennas operating at higher frequencies, users are typically situated in the near-field region where the spherical wavefront propagates. The near-field beam training in ELAA requires both angle and distance information, which inevitably leads to a significant increase in the beam training overhead. To address this problem, we propose a near-field beam training method based on deep learning. We use a convolutional neural network (CNN) to efficiently learn channel characteristics from historical data by strategically selecting padding and kernel sizes. The negative value of the user average achievable rate is utilized as the loss function to optimize the beamformer. This method maximizes multi-user networks' achievable rate without predefined beam codebooks. Upon deployment, the model requires solely the pre-estimated channel state information (CSI) to derive the optimal beamforming vector. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves a more stable beamforming gain and significantly improves performance compared to the traditional beam training method. Furthermore, owing to the inherent traits of deep learning methodologies, this approach substantially diminishes the near-field beam training overhead.</p></details> |  |

By integrating the Qwen2-0.5B-Instruct language model with the InternViT-300M-448px visual model, Vintern-1B is optimized for a range of applications, including optical character recognition (OCR), document extraction, and general question-answering in Vietnamese context. The model is fine-tuned on an extensive dataset of over 3 million image-question-answer pairs, achieving robust performance and reliable results across multiple Vietnamese language benchmarks like OpenViVQA and ViTextVQA. Vintern-1B is small enough to fit into various on-device applications easily. Additionally, we have open-sourced several Vietnamese vision question answering (VQA) datasets for text and diagrams, created with Gemini 1.5 Flash.

Then a cost-effective and efficient in-context learning based method is employed to prevent LLMs from utilizing dataset biases during generation. Experimental results show that CAL can effectively recognize typical biased instances and induce various bias patterns for debiasing LLMs.</p></details> | ACL main conference |

However, next-location predictors require a significant amount of individual-level information that may be scarce or unavailable in some scenarios (e.g., cold-start). Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown good generalization and reasoning capabilities and are rich in geographical knowledge, allowing us to believe that these models can act as zero-shot next-location predictors. We tested more than 15 LLMs on three real-world mobility datasets and we found that LLMs can obtain accuracies up to 36.2%, a significant relative improvement of almost 640% when compared to other models specifically designed for human mobility. We also test for data contamination and explored the possibility of using LLMs as text-based explainers for next-location prediction, showing that, regardless of the model size, LLMs can explain their decision.</p></details> |  |

In recent years, conceptual entities -- interpretable, language-independent features linked to external knowledge resources -- have been used in place of word-level tokens, as words typically require extensive language processing with a minimal assurance of interpretability. However, current literature is limited when it comes to exploring purely entity-driven neural topic modeling. For instance, despite the advantages of using entities for eliciting thematic structure, it is unclear whether current techniques are compatible with these sparsely organised, information-dense conceptual units. In this work, we explore entity-based neural topic modeling and propose a novel topic clustering approach using bimodal vector representations of entities. Concretely, we extract these latent representations from large language models and graph neural networks trained on a knowledge base of symbolic relations, in order to derive the most salient aspects of these conceptual units. Analysis of coherency metrics confirms that our approach is better suited to working with entities in comparison to state-of-the-art models, particularly when using graph-based embeddings trained on a knowledge base.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 1 figure.

They have made remarkable progress in computer vision tasks by aligning text modality with vision inputs. There are also endeavors to incorporate multi-vision sensors beyond RGB, including thermal, depth, and medical X-ray images. However, we observe that current LVLMs view images taken from multi-vision sensors as if they were in the same RGB domain without considering the physical characteristics of multi-vision sensors. They fail to convey the fundamental multi-vision sensor information from the dataset and the corresponding contextual knowledge properly. Consequently, alignment between the information from the actual physical environment and the text is not achieved correctly, making it difficult to answer complex sensor-related questions that consider the physical environment. In this paper, we aim to establish a multi-vision Sensor Perception And Reasoning benchmarK called SPARK that can reduce the fundamental multi-vision sensor information gap between images and multi-vision sensors. We generated 6,248 vision-language test samples to investigate multi-vision sensory perception and multi-vision sensory reasoning on physical sensor knowledge proficiency across different formats, covering different types of sensor-related questions. We utilized these samples to assess ten leading LVLMs. The results showed that most models displayed deficiencies in multi-vision sensory reasoning to varying extents.

Despite these achievements, a notable challenge persists: it is difficult to precisely reconstruct specific objects from large scenes. Current scene reconstruction techniques frequently result in the loss of object detail textures and are unable to reconstruct object portions that are occluded or unseen in views. To address this challenge, we delve into the meticulous 3D reconstruction of specific objects within large scenes and propose a framework termed OMEGAS: Object Mesh Extraction from Large Scenes Guided by Gaussian Segmentation. Specifically, we proposed a novel 3D target segmentation technique based on 2D Gaussian Splatting, which segments 3D consistent target masks in multi-view scene images and generates a preliminary target model. Moreover, to reconstruct the unseen portions of the target, we propose a novel target replenishment technique driven by large-scale generative diffusion priors. We demonstrate that our method can accurately reconstruct specific targets from large scenes, both quantitatively and qualitatively. Our experiments show that OMEGAS significantly outperforms existing reconstruction methods across various scenarios. Our project page is at: https://github.com/CrystalWlz/OMEGAS</p></details> |  |

The emergence of LLM has introduced innovative methodologies across diverse fields, including the natural sciences. Researchers aim to implement automated, concurrent process driven by LLM to supplant conventional manual, repetitive and labor-intensive work. In the domain of spectral analysis and detection, it is imperative for researchers to autonomously acquire pertinent knowledge across various research objects, which encompasses the spectroscopic techniques and the chemometric methods that are employed in experiments and analysis. Paradoxically, despite the recognition of spectroscopic detection as an effective analytical method, the fundamental process of knowledge retrieval remains both time-intensive and repetitive. In response to this challenge, we first introduced the Spectral Detection and Analysis Based Paper(SDAAP) dataset, which is the first open-source textual knowledge dataset for spectral analysis and detection and contains annotated literature data as well as corresponding knowledge instruction data. Subsequently, we also designed an automated Q\&A framework based on the SDAAP dataset, which can retrieve relevant knowledge and generate high-quality responses by extracting entities in the input as retrieval parameters. It is worth noting that: within this framework, LLM is only used as a tool to provide generalizability, while RAG technique is used to accurately capture the source of the knowledge.This approach not only improves the quality of the generated responses, but also ensures the traceability of the knowledge. Experimental results show that our framework generates responses with more reliable expertise compared to the baseline.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages,10 figures,3 tables</p></details> |

However, the fine-tuning of such models with vision-language data often leads to a diminution of their natural language processing (NLP) capabilities. To avoid this performance degradation, a straightforward solution is to freeze the language model while developing multimodal competencies. Unfortunately, previous works have not attained satisfactory outcomes. Building on the strategy of freezing the language model, we conduct thorough structural exploration and introduce the Inner-Adaptor Architecture (IAA). Specifically, the architecture incorporates multiple multimodal adaptors at varying depths within the large language model to facilitate direct interaction with the inherently text-oriented transformer layers, thereby enabling the frozen language model to acquire multimodal capabilities. Unlike previous approaches of freezing language models that require large-scale aligned data, our proposed architecture is able to achieve superior performance on small-scale datasets. We conduct extensive experiments to improve the general multimodal capabilities and visual grounding abilities of the MLLM. Our approach remarkably outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods across various vision-language benchmarks without sacrificing performance on NLP tasks.

According to Gartner's prediction, the use of AI technology for automated IT operations has become a new trend. Large language models (LLMs) that have exhibited remarkable capabilities in NLP-related tasks, are showing great potential in the field of AIOps, such as in aspects of root cause analysis of failures, generation of operations and maintenance scripts, and summarizing of alert information. Nevertheless, the performance of current LLMs in Ops tasks is yet to be determined. In this paper, we present OpsEval, a comprehensive task-oriented Ops benchmark designed for LLMs. For the first time, OpsEval assesses LLMs' proficiency in various crucial scenarios at different ability levels. The benchmark includes 7184 multi-choice questions and 1736 question-answering (QA) formats in English and Chinese. By conducting a comprehensive performance evaluation of the current leading large language models, we show how various LLM techniques can affect the performance of Ops, and discussed findings related to various topics, including model quantification, QA evaluation, and hallucination issues. To ensure the credibility of our evaluation, we invite dozens of domain experts to manually review our questions. At the same time, we have open-sourced 20% of the test QA to assist current researchers in preliminary evaluations of their OpsLLM models. The remaining 80% of the data, which is not disclosed, is used to eliminate the issue of the test set leakage.

Existing MLLMs typically follow a two-step process in their pipelines: first, extracting visual tokens independently for each input image, and then aligning these visual tokens from different images with the Large Language Model (LLM) in its textual feature space. However, the independent extraction of visual tokens for each image may result in different semantics being prioritized for different images in the first step, leading to a lack of preservation of linking information among images for subsequent LLM analysis. This issue becomes more serious in scenarios where significant variations exist among the images (e.g., visual storytelling). To address this challenge, we introduce Semantic Alignment for Multi-modal large language models (SAM). By involving the bidirectional semantic guidance between different images in the visual-token extraction process, SAM aims to enhance the preservation of linking information for coherent analysis and align the semantics of different images before feeding them into LLM. As the test bed, we propose a large-scale dataset named MmLINK consisting of 69K samples. Different from most existing datasets for MLLMs fine-tuning, our MmLINK dataset comprises multi-modal instructions with significantly diverse images. Extensive experiments on the group captioning task and the storytelling task prove the effectiveness of our SAM model, surpassing the state-of-the-art methods by a large margin (+37% for group captioning and +22% for storytelling on CIDEr score).

Traditional visual spatial relationship classification (VSRC) methods typically output the spatial relationship between two objects in an image, often neglecting world knowledge and lacking general language capabilities. In this paper, we propose a Large Language-and-Vision Assistant for Visual Spatial Description, named LLaVA-VSD, which is designed for the classification, description, and open-ended description of visual spatial relationships. Specifically, the model first constructs a VSD instruction-following dataset using given figure-caption pairs for the three tasks. It then employs LoRA to fine-tune a Large Language and Vision Assistant for VSD, which has 13 billion parameters and supports high-resolution images. Finally, a large language model (Qwen-2) is used to refine the generated sentences, enhancing their diversity and accuracy. LLaVA-VSD demonstrates excellent multimodal conversational capabilities and can follow open-ended instructions to assist with inquiries about object relationships in images.</p></details> |  |

However, these models often exhibit limited generalization capabilities and face challenges in improving in domain accuracy. Recent research has explored using large language models (LLMs) as retrievers, achieving SOTA performance across various tasks. Despite these advancements, the specific benefits of LLMs over traditional retrievers and the impact of different LLM configurations, such as parameter sizes, pretraining duration, and alignment processes on retrieval tasks remain unclear. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive empirical study on a wide range of retrieval tasks, including in domain accuracy, data efficiency, zero shot generalization, lengthy retrieval, instruction based retrieval, and multi task learning. We evaluate over 15 different backbone LLMs and non LLMs. Our findings reveal that larger models and extensive pretraining consistently enhance in domain accuracy and data efficiency. Additionally, larger models demonstrate significant potential in zero shot generalization, lengthy retrieval, instruction based retrieval, and multi task learning. These results underscore the advantages of LLMs as versatile and effective backbone encoders in dense retrieval, providing valuable insights for future research and development in this field.</p></details> | Submitted to EMNLP24 |

Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising technique for collaboratively training AI models while preserving data privacy. However, FL faces challenges such as high communication overhead and substantial computational demands, particularly for neural network (NN) models. To address these issues, we propose an integrated federated split learning and hyperdimensional computing (FSL-HDC) framework for emerging foundation models. This novel approach reduces communication costs, computation load, and privacy risks, making it particularly suitable for resource-constrained edge devices in the Metaverse, ensuring real-time responsive interactions. Additionally, we introduce an optimization algorithm that concurrently optimizes transmission power and bandwidth to minimize the maximum transmission time among all users to the server. The simulation results based on the MNIST dataset indicate that FSL-HDC achieves an accuracy rate of approximately 87.5%, which is slightly lower than that of FL-HDC. However, FSL-HDC exhibits a significantly faster convergence speed, approximately 3.733x that of FSL-NN, and demonstrates robustness to non-IID data distributions. Moreover, our proposed optimization algorithm can reduce the maximum transmission time by up to 64% compared with the baseline.</p></details> |  |
| **[Foundation Models for Music: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14340v1)** | 2024-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, foundation models (FMs) such as large language models (LLMs) and latent diffusion models (LDMs) have profoundly impacted diverse sectors, including music. This comprehensive review examines state-of-the-art (SOTA) pre-trained models and foundation models in music, spanning from representation learning, generative learning and multimodal learning. We first contextualise the significance of music in various industries and trace the evolution of AI in music. By delineating the modalities targeted by foundation models, we discover many of the music representations are underexplored in FM development. Then, emphasis is placed on the lack of versatility of previous methods on diverse music applications, along with the potential of FMs in music understanding, generation and medical application. By comprehensively exploring the details of the model pre-training paradigm, architectural choices, tokenisation, finetuning methodologies and controllability, we emphasise the important topics that should have been well explored, like instruction tuning and in-context learning, scaling law and emergent ability, as well as long-sequence modelling etc. A dedicated section presents insights into music agents, accompanied by a thorough analysis of datasets and evaluations essential for pre-training and downstream tasks. Finally, by underscoring the vital importance of ethical considerations, we advocate that following research on FM for music should focus more on such issues as interpretability, transparency, human responsibility, and copyright issues.

Nevertheless, directly predicting the coordinates of objects in 3D space from monocular images poses challenges. Therefore, an effective solution involves transforming monocular images into LiDAR-like representations and employing a LiDAR-based 3D object detector to predict the 3D coordinates of objects. The key step in this method is accurately converting the monocular image into a reliable point cloud form. In this paper, we present VFMM3D, an innovative framework that leverages the capabilities of Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) to accurately transform single-view images into LiDAR point cloud representations. VFMM3D utilizes the Segment Anything Model (SAM) and Depth Anything Model (DAM) to generate high-quality pseudo-LiDAR data enriched with rich foreground information. Specifically, the Depth Anything Model (DAM) is employed to generate dense depth maps. Subsequently, the Segment Anything Model (SAM) is utilized to differentiate foreground and background regions by predicting instance masks. These predicted instance masks and depth maps are then combined and projected into 3D space to generate pseudo-LiDAR points. Finally, any object detectors based on point clouds can be utilized to predict the 3D coordinates of objects. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on two challenging 3D object detection datasets, KITTI and Waymo. Our VFMM3D establishes a new state-of-the-art performance on both datasets. Additionally, experimental results demonstrate the generality of VFMM3D, showcasing its seamless integration into various LiDAR-based 3D object detectors.</p></details> | 11 pages, 4 figures |

This paper presents ShapeMamba-EM, a specialized fine-tuning method for 3D EM segmentation, which employs adapters for long-range dependency modeling and an encoder for local shape description within the original foundation model. This approach effectively addresses the unique volumetric and morphological complexities of EM data. Tested over a wide range of EM images, covering five segmentation tasks and 10 datasets, ShapeMamba-EM outperforms existing methods, establishing a new standard in EM image segmentation and enhancing the understanding of neural tissue architecture.</p></details> |  |

However, graph learning has predominantly focused on single-graph models, tailored to specific tasks or datasets, lacking the ability to transfer learned knowledge to different domains. This limitation stems from the inherent complexity and diversity of graph structures, along with the different feature and label spaces specific to graph data. In this paper, we recognize text as an effective unifying medium and employ Text-Attributed Graphs (TAGs) to leverage this potential. We present our UniGraph framework, designed to learn a foundation model for TAGs, which is capable of generalizing to unseen graphs and tasks across diverse domains. Unlike single-graph models that use pre-computed node features of varying dimensions as input, our approach leverages textual features for unifying node representations, even for graphs such as molecular graphs that do not naturally have textual features. We propose a novel cascaded architecture of Language Models (LMs) and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) as backbone networks. Additionally, we propose the first pre-training algorithm specifically designed for large-scale self-supervised learning on TAGs, based on Masked Graph Modeling. We introduce graph instruction tuning using Large Language Models (LLMs) to enable zero-shot prediction ability. Our comprehensive experiments across various graph learning tasks and domains demonstrate the model's effectiveness in self-supervised representation learning on unseen graphs, few-shot in-context transfer, and zero-shot transfer, even surpassing or matching the performance of GNNs that have undergone supervised training on target datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Text2Seg: Remote Sensing Image Semantic Segmentation via Text-Guided Visual Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.10597v2)** | 2024-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Remote sensing imagery has attracted significant attention in recent years due to its instrumental role in global environmental monitoring, land usage monitoring, and more. As image databases grow each year, performing automatic segmentation with deep learning models has gradually become the standard approach for processing the data. Despite the improved performance of current models, certain limitations remain unresolved. Firstly, training deep learning models for segmentation requires per-pixel annotations. Given the large size of datasets, only a small portion is fully annotated and ready for training. Additionally, the high intra-dataset variance in remote sensing data limits the transfer learning ability of such models. Although recently proposed generic segmentation models like SAM have shown promising results in zero-shot instance-level segmentation, adapting them to semantic segmentation is a non-trivial task. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel method named Text2Seg for remote sensing semantic segmentation. Text2Seg overcomes the dependency on extensive annotations by employing an automatic prompt generation process using different visual foundation models (VFMs), which are trained to understand semantic information in various ways. This approach not only reduces the need for fully annotated datasets but also enhances the model's ability to generalize across diverse datasets. Evaluations on four widely adopted remote sensing datasets demonstrate that Text2Seg significantly improves zero-shot prediction performance compared to the vanilla SAM model, with relative improvements ranging from 31% to 225%. Our code is available at https://github.com/Douglas2Code/Text2Seg.</p></details> | 10 pages, 3 figures |

While their proficiency in two-view correspondence has been explored, their effectiveness in long-term correspondence within complex environments remains unexplored. To address this, we evaluate the geometric awareness of visual foundation models in the context of point tracking: (i) in zero-shot settings, without any training; (ii) by probing with low-capacity layers; (iii) by fine-tuning with Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA). Our findings indicate that features from Stable Diffusion and DINOv2 exhibit superior geometric correspondence abilities in zero-shot settings. Furthermore, DINOv2 achieves performance comparable to supervised models in adaptation settings, demonstrating its potential as a strong initialization for correspondence learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>ECCV ...</summary><p>ECCV 2024 - Emergent Visual Abilities and Limits of Foundation Models (EVAL-FoMo) Workshop</p></details> |

Some researchers also exploit and enhance the detection performance using pre-trained large foundation models. However, we think these detectors may only get sub-optimal results because the large models they use are not specifically designed for vehicles. In addition, their results heavily rely on visual features, and seldom of they consider the alignment between the vehicle's semantic information and visual representations. In this work, we propose a new vehicle detection paradigm based on a pre-trained foundation vehicle model (VehicleMAE) and a large language model (T5), termed VFM-Det. It follows the region proposal-based detection framework and the features of each proposal can be enhanced using VehicleMAE. More importantly, we propose a new VAtt2Vec module that predicts the vehicle semantic attributes of these proposals and transforms them into feature vectors to enhance the vision features via contrastive learning. Extensive experiments on three vehicle detection benchmark datasets thoroughly proved the effectiveness of our vehicle detector. Specifically, our model improves the baseline approach by $+5.1\%$, $+6.2\%$ on the $AP_{0.5}$, $AP_{0.75}$ metrics, respectively, on the Cityscapes dataset.The source code of this work will be released at https://github.com/Event-AHU/VFM-Det.</p></details> | In Peer Review |

With the advent of foundation models (FMs), contemporary segmentation methodologies have embarked on a new epoch by either adapting FMs (e.g., CLIP, Stable Diffusion, DINO) for image segmentation or developing dedicated segmentation foundation models (e.g., SAM). These approaches not only deliver superior segmentation performance, but also herald newfound segmentation capabilities previously unseen in deep learning context. However, current research in image segmentation lacks a detailed analysis of distinct characteristics, challenges, and solutions associated with these advancements. This survey seeks to fill this gap by providing a thorough review of cutting-edge research centered around FM-driven image segmentation. We investigate two basic lines of research -- generic image segmentation (i.e., semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, panoptic segmentation), and promptable image segmentation (i.e., interactive segmentation, referring segmentation, few-shot segmentation) -- by delineating their respective task settings, background concepts, and key challenges. Furthermore, we provide insights into the emergence of segmentation knowledge from FMs like CLIP, Stable Diffusion, and DINO. An exhaustive overview of over 300 segmentation approaches is provided to encapsulate the breadth of current research efforts. Subsequently, we engage in a discussion of open issues and potential avenues for future research. We envisage that this fresh, comprehensive, and systematic survey catalyzes the evolution of advanced image segmentation systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>A com...</summary><p>A comprehensive survey of image segmentation in foundation model era (work in progress)</p></details> |

This paper investigates the capabilities of ChatGPT-4V and Gemini Pro for Street View Imagery, Built Environment, and Interior by evaluating their performance across various tasks. The assessments include street furniture identification, pedestrian and car counts, and road width measurement in Street View Imagery; building function classification, building age analysis, building height analysis, and building structure classification in the Built Environment; and interior room classification, interior design style analysis, interior furniture counts, and interior length measurement in Interior. The results reveal proficiency in length measurement, style analysis, question answering, and basic image understanding, but highlight limitations in detailed recognition and counting tasks. While zero-shot learning shows potential, performance varies depending on the problem domains and image complexities. This study provides new insights into the strengths and weaknesses of multimodal foundation models for practical challenges in Street View Imagery, Built Environment, and Interior. Overall, the findings demonstrate foundational multimodal intelligence, emphasizing the potential of FMs to drive forward interdisciplinary applications at the intersection of computer vision and language.</p></details> |  |

Unlike language or image foundation models, many video foundation models are evaluated with differing parameters (such as sampling rate, number of frames, pretraining steps, etc.), making fair and robust comparisons challenging. Therefore, we present a carefully designed evaluation framework for measuring two core capabilities of video comprehension: appearance and motion understanding. Our findings reveal that existing video foundation models, whether text-supervised like UMT or InternVideo2, or self-supervised like V-JEPA, exhibit limitations in at least one of these capabilities. As an alternative, we introduce TWLV-I, a new video foundation model that constructs robust visual representations for both motion- and appearance-based videos. Based on the average top-1 accuracy of linear probing on five action recognition benchmarks, pretrained only on publicly accessible datasets, our model shows a 4.6%p improvement compared to V-JEPA (ViT-L) and a 7.7%p improvement compared to UMT (ViT-L). Even when compared to much larger models, our model demonstrates a 7.2%p improvement compared to DFN (ViT-H), a 2.7%p improvement compared to V-JEPA (ViT-H) and a 2.8%p improvement compared to InternVideo2 (ViT-g). We provide embedding vectors obtained by TWLV-I from videos of several commonly used video benchmarks, along with evaluation source code that can directly utilize these embeddings.

Despite previous attempts to decode face recognition features into detailed images, we find that common high-resolution datasets (e.g. FFHQ) lack sufficient identities to reconstruct any subject. To that end, we meticulously upsample a significant portion of the WebFace42M database, the largest public dataset for face recognition (FR). Arc2Face builds upon a pretrained Stable Diffusion model, yet adapts it to the task of ID-to-face generation, conditioned solely on ID vectors. Deviating from recent works that combine ID with text embeddings for zero-shot personalization of text-to-image models, we emphasize on the compactness of FR features, which can fully capture the essence of the human face, as opposed to hand-crafted prompts. Crucially, text-augmented models struggle to decouple identity and text, usually necessitating some description of the given face to achieve satisfactory similarity. Arc2Face, however, only needs the discriminative features of ArcFace to guide the generation, offering a robust prior for a plethora of tasks where ID consistency is of paramount importance. As an example, we train a FR model on synthetic images from our model and achieve superior performance to existing synthetic datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>ECCV ...</summary><p>ECCV 2024 (Oral), 29 pages, 20 figures.

ENBED uses a sub-quadratic implementation of attention to develop an efficient model capable of sequence-to-sequence transformations, generalizing previous genomic models with encoder-only or decoder-only architectures. We use Masked Language Modeling to pre-train the foundation model using reference genome sequences and apply it in the following downstream tasks: (1) identification of enhancers, promotors and splice sites, (2) recognition of sequences containing base call mismatches and insertion/deletion errors, an advantage over tokenization schemes involving multiple base pairs, which lose the ability to analyze with byte-level precision, (3) identification of biological function annotations of genomic sequences, and (4) generating mutations of the Influenza virus using the encoder-decoder architecture and validating them against real-world observations.

We introduce a workflow that leverages existing computer vision FMs, fine-tuning them for geoscientific tasks, reducing development costs while enhancing accuracy. Through experiments, we demonstrate this workflow's effectiveness in broad applications to process and interpret geoscientific data of lunar images, seismic data, DAS arrays and so on.

However, current TFMs treat cells as independent samples and ignore the taxonomic relationships between cell types, which are available in cell ontology graphs. We argue that effectively leveraging this ontology information during the TFM pre-training can improve learning biologically meaningful gene co-expression patterns while preserving TFM as a general purpose foundation model for downstream zero-shot and fine-tuning tasks. To this end, we present \textbf{s}ingle \textbf{c}ell, \textbf{Cell}-\textbf{o}ntology guided TFM scCello. We introduce cell-type coherence loss and ontology alignment loss, which are minimized along with the masked gene expression prediction loss during the pre-training. The novel loss component guide scCello to learn the cell-type-specific representation and the structural relation between cell types from the cell ontology graph, respectively. We pre-trained scCello on 22 million cells from CellxGene database leveraging their cell-type labels mapped to the cell ontology graph from Open Biological and Biomedical Ontology Foundry.

However, these models struggle to detect general obstacles not included in the fixed category set due to their variability and numerous edge cases. To address this issue, we propose a combination of multimodal foundational model-based obstacle segmentation with traditional unsupervised computational geometry-based outlier detection. Our approach operates offline, allowing us to leverage non-causality, and utilizes training-free methods. This enables the detection of general obstacles in 3D without the need for expensive retraining. To overcome the limitations of publicly available obstacle detection datasets, we collected and annotated our dataset, which includes various obstacles even in distant regions.</p></details> |  |

While this approach leverages vast amounts of unlabeled data, we have discovered a significant issue: features extracted from these self-supervised models tend to cluster by individual WSIs, a phenomenon we term WSI-specific feature collapse. This problem can potentially limit the model's generalization ability and performance on various downstream tasks. To address this issue, we introduce EXAONEPath, a novel foundational model trained on patches that have undergone stain normalization. Stain normalization helps reduce color variability arising from different laboratories and scanners, enabling the model to learn more consistent features. EXAONEPath is trained using 285,153,903 patches extracted from a total of 34,795 WSIs. Our experiments demonstrate that EXAONEPath significantly mitigates the feature collapse problem, indicating that the model has learned more generalized features rather than overfitting to individual WSI characteristics. We compared EXAONEPath with state-of-the-art models across six downstream task datasets, and our results show that EXAONEPath achieves superior performance relative to the number of WSIs used and the model's parameter count. This suggests that the application of stain normalization has substantially improved the model's efficiency and generalization capabilities.</p></details> | License updated |

This multifaceted challenge has recently gained attention within the deep learning domain, facilitated by the availability of extensive, long-term earthquake datasets. Despite significant advancements, existing literature on earthquake nowcasting lacks comprehensive evaluations of pre-trained foundation models and modern deep learning architectures. These architectures, such as transformers or graph neural networks, uniquely focus on different aspects of data, including spatial relationships, temporal patterns, and multi-scale dependencies. This paper addresses the mentioned gap by analyzing different architectures and introducing two innovation approaches called MultiFoundationQuake and GNNCoder. We formulate earthquake nowcasting as a time series forecasting problem for the next 14 days within 0.1-degree spatial bins in Southern California, spanning from 1986 to 2024. Earthquake time series is forecasted as a function of logarithm energy released by quakes. Our comprehensive evaluation employs several key performance metrics, notably Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency and Mean Squared Error, over time in each spatial region. The results demonstrate that our introduced models outperform other custom architectures by effectively capturing temporal-spatial relationships inherent in seismic data. The performance of existing foundation models varies significantly based on the pre-training datasets, emphasizing the need for careful dataset selection. However, we introduce a new general approach termed MultiFoundationPattern that combines a bespoke pattern with foundation model results handled as auxiliary streams.

More recently, these workflows have been significantly augmented with the advent of large language models (LLMs) and systems of LLM-driven agents capable of utilizing pre-trained models to make predictions in the context of more complex research tasks. While effective, there is still room for substantial improvement within the agentic systems on the retrieval of salient information for material design tasks. Moreover, alternative uses of predictive deep learning models, such as leveraging their latent representations to facilitate cross-modal retrieval augmented generation within agentic systems to enable task-specific materials design, has remained unexplored. Herein, we demonstrate that large, pre-trained chemistry foundation models can serve as a basis for enabling semantic chemistry information retrieval for both small-molecules, complex polymeric materials, and reactions. Additionally, we show the use of chemistry foundation models in conjunction with image models such as OpenCLIP facilitate unprecedented queries and information retrieval across multiple characterization data domains.

Deep learning models have advanced ETS modeling by effectively capturing sequence dependence. Nevertheless, learning a generic representation of ETS data for various applications remains challenging due to the inherently complex hierarchical structure of ETS data. Moreover, ETS data exhibits intricate temporal dependencies and is suscepti ble to the influence of exogenous variables. Furthermore, different instances exhibit diverse electricity consumption behavior. In this paper, we propose a foundation model PowerPM to model ETS data, providing a large-scale, off-the-shelf model for power systems. PowerPM consists of a temporal encoder and a hierarchical encoder. The temporal encoder captures both temporal dependencies in ETS data, considering exogenous variables. The hierarchical encoder models the correlation between hierarchy. Furthermore, PowerPM leverages a novel self-supervised pretraining framework consisting of masked ETS modeling and dual-view contrastive learning, which enable PowerPM to capture temporal dependency within ETS windows and aware the discrepancy across ETS windows, providing two different perspectives to learn generic representation. Our experiments involve five real world scenario datasets, comprising private and public data. Through pre-training on massive ETS data, PowerPM achieves SOTA performance on diverse downstream tasks within the private dataset. Impressively, when transferred to the public datasets, PowerPM maintains its superiority, showcasing its remarkable generalization ability across various tasks and domains.

State-of-the-art methods typically employ fully supervised approaches, necessitating a huge labeled dataset acquired through expensive LiDAR sensors and meticulous voxel-wise labeling by human annotators. The resource-intensive nature of this annotating process significantly hampers the application and scalability of these methods. We introduce a novel semi-supervised framework to alleviate the dependency on densely annotated data. Our approach leverages 2D foundation models to generate essential 3D scene geometric and semantic cues, facilitating a more efficient training process. Our framework exhibits notable properties: (1) Generalizability, applicable to various 3D semantic scene completion approaches, including 2D-3D lifting and 3D-2D transformer methods. (2) Effectiveness, as demonstrated through experiments on SemanticKITTI and NYUv2, wherein our method achieves up to 85% of the fully-supervised performance using only 10% labeled data. This approach not only reduces the cost and labor associated with data annotation but also demonstrates the potential for broader adoption in camera-based systems for 3D semantic occupancy prediction.</p></details> |  |

While these models perform benchmark-leading on common language tasks and show exemplary task-independent emergent abilities, transferring them to novel out-of-domain tasks is only insufficiently explored. The implications of the statistical black-box approach - stochastic parrots - are prominently criticized in the language model research community; however, the significance for novel generative tasks is not. This work investigates the alignment between personalized language models and survey participants on a Moral Foundation Theory questionnaire. We adapt text-to-text models to different political personas and survey the questionnaire repetitively to generate a synthetic population of persona and model combinations. Analyzing the intra-group variance and cross-alignment shows significant differences across models and personas. Our findings indicate that adapted models struggle to represent the survey-captured assessment of political ideologies. Thus, using language models to mimic social interactions requires measurable improvements in in-context optimization or parameter manipulation to align with psychological and sociological stereotypes. Without quantifiable alignment, generating politically nuanced content remains unfeasible. To enhance these representations, we propose a testable framework to generate agents based on moral value statements for future research.</p></details> | 8 pages, 6 tables |

OCT acquisition is fast, non-invasive, affordable, and scalable. Due to its broad applicability, massive numbers of OCT images have been accumulated in routine exams, making it possible to train large-scale foundation models that can generalize to various diagnostic tasks using OCT images. Nevertheless, existing foundation models for OCT only consider 2D image slices, overlooking the rich 3D structure. Here, we present OCTCube, a 3D foundation model pre-trained on 26,605 3D OCT volumes encompassing 1.62 million 2D OCT images. OCTCube is developed based on 3D masked autoencoders and exploits FlashAttention to reduce the larger GPU memory usage caused by modeling 3D volumes. OCTCube outperforms 2D models when predicting 8 retinal diseases in both inductive and cross-dataset settings, indicating that utilizing the 3D structure in the model instead of 2D data results in significant improvement. OCTCube further shows superior performance on cross-device prediction and when predicting systemic diseases, such as diabetes and hypertension, further demonstrating its strong generalizability. Finally, we propose a contrastive-self-supervised-learning-based OCT-IR pre-training framework (COIP) for cross-modality analysis on OCT and infrared retinal (IR) images, where the OCT volumes are embedded using OCTCube. We demonstrate that COIP enables accurate alignment between OCT and IR en face images. Collectively, OCTCube, a 3D OCT foundation model, demonstrates significantly better performance against 2D models on 27 out of 29 tasks and comparable performance on the other two tasks, paving the way for AI-based retinal disease diagnosis.</p></details> |  |

However, there remains a need to evaluate how these models perform when prompted with commonplace queries compared to domain-specific queries, which may be useful for benchmarking prior to fine-tuning for domain-specific downstream tasks. This study evaluates LLMs, specifically Gemma-2B and Gemma-7B, across diverse domains, including cybersecurity, medicine, and finance, compared to common knowledge queries. This study utilizes a comprehensive methodology to assess foundational models, which includes problem formulation, data analysis, and the development of ThroughCut, a novel outlier detection technique that automatically identifies response throughput outliers based on their conciseness. This methodological rigor enhances the credibility of the presented evaluation frameworks. This study focused on assessing inference time, response length, throughput, quality, and resource utilization and investigated the correlations between these factors. The results indicate that model size and types of prompts used for inference significantly influenced response length and quality. In addition, common prompts, which include various types of queries, generate diverse and inconsistent responses at irregular intervals. In contrast, domain-specific prompts consistently generate concise responses within a reasonable time. Overall, this study underscores the need for comprehensive evaluation frameworks to enhance the reliability of benchmarking procedures in multidomain AI research.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 figures, 2 tables, and algorithms</p></details> |
| **[Affordances-Oriented Planning using Foundation Models for Continuous Vision-Language Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05890v2)** | 2024-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLM-based agents have demonstrated impressive zero-shot performance in vision-language navigation (VLN) task. However, existing LLM-based methods often focus only on solving high-level task planning by selecting nodes in predefined navigation graphs for movements, overlooking low-level control in navigation scenarios. To bridge this gap, we propose AO-Planner, a novel Affordances-Oriented Planner for continuous VLN task. Our AO-Planner integrates various foundation models to achieve affordances-oriented low-level motion planning and high-level decision-making, both performed in a zero-shot setting. Specifically, we employ a Visual Affordances Prompting (VAP) approach, where the visible ground is segmented by SAM to provide navigational affordances, based on which the LLM selects potential candidate waypoints and plans low-level paths towards selected waypoints. We further propose a high-level PathAgent which marks planned paths into the image input and reasons the most probable path by comprehending all environmental information. Finally, we convert the selected path into 3D coordinates using camera intrinsic parameters and depth information, avoiding challenging 3D predictions for LLMs. Experiments on the challenging R2R-CE and RxR-CE datasets show that AO-Planner achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance (8.8% improvement on SPL). Our method can also serve as a data annotator to obtain pseudo-labels, distilling its waypoint prediction ability into a learning-based predictor. This new predictor does not require any waypoint data from the simulator and achieves 47% SR competing with supervised methods. We establish an effective connection between LLM and 3D world, presenting novel prospects for employing foundation models in low-level motion control.</p></details> |  |
| **[ViLReF: A Chinese Vision-Language Retinal Foundation Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10894v1)** | 2024-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Subtle semantic differences in retinal image and text data present great challenges for pre-training visual-language models. Moreover, false negative samples, i.e., image-text pairs having the same semantics but incorrectly regarded as negatives, disrupt the visual-language pre-training process and affect the model's learning ability. This work aims to develop a retinal foundation model, called ViLReF, by pre-training on a paired dataset comprising 451,956 retinal images and corresponding diagnostic text reports. In our vision-language pre-training strategy, we leverage expert knowledge to facilitate the extraction of labels and propose a novel constraint, the Weighted Similarity Coupling Loss, to adjust the speed of pushing sample pairs further apart dynamically within the feature space. Furthermore, we employ a batch expansion module with dynamic memory queues, maintained by momentum encoders, to supply extra samples and compensate for the vacancies caused by eliminating false negatives. Extensive experiments are conducted on multiple datasets for downstream classification and segmentation tasks. The experimental results demonstrate the powerful zero-shot and transfer learning capabilities of ViLReF, verifying the effectiveness of our pre-training strategy. Our ViLReF model is available at: https://github.com/T6Yang/ViLReF.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Glucose Patterns to Health Outcomes: A Generalizable Foundation Model for Continuous Glucose Monitor Data Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11876v1)** | 2024-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in self-supervised learning enabled novel medical AI models, known as foundation models (FMs) that offer great potential for characterizing health from diverse biomedical data. Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) provides rich, temporal data on glycemic patterns, but its full potential for predicting broader health outcomes remains underutilized. Here, we present GluFormer, a generative foundation model on biomedical temporal data based on a transformer architecture, and trained on over 10 million CGM measurements from 10,812 non-diabetic individuals. We tokenized the CGM training data and trained GluFormer using next token prediction in a generative, autoregressive manner. We demonstrate that GluFormer generalizes effectively to 15 different external datasets, including 4936 individuals across 5 different geographical regions, 6 different CGM devices, and several metabolic disorders, including normoglycemic, prediabetic, and diabetic populations, as well as those with gestational diabetes and obesity. GluFormer produces embeddings which outperform traditional CGM analysis tools, and achieves high Pearson correlations in predicting clinical parameters such as HbA1c, liver-related parameters, blood lipids, and sleep-related indices. Notably, GluFormer can also predict onset of future health outcomes even 4 years in advance. We also show that CGM embeddings from pre-intervention periods in Randomized Clinical Trials (RCTs) outperform other methods in predicting primary and secondary outcomes. When integrating dietary data into GluFormer, we show that the enhanced model can accurately generate CGM data based only on dietary intake data, simulate outcomes of dietary interventions, and predict individual responses to specific foods. Overall, we show that GluFormer accurately predicts health outcomes which generalize across different populations metabolic conditions.</p></details> |  |

The narrative and unstructured nature of clinical notes is a major obstacle for healthcare intelligentization. We address a critical problem of structuring clinical notes into clinical data, according to international interoperability standards. We collect and annotate data for three subtasks, namely, international patient summary, clinical impression and medical encounter. We then supervised fine-tuned a state-of-the-art LLM using public and credentialed clinical data. The training is orchestrated in a way that the target model can first support basic clinical tasks such as abbreviation expansion and temporal information extraction, and then learn to perform more complex downstream clinical tasks. Moreover, we address several modeling challenges in the healthcare context, e.g., extra long context window. Our blind pairwise evaluation shows that SoftTiger outperforms other popular open-source models and GPT-3.5, comparable to Gemini-pro, with a mild gap from GPT-4. We believe that LLMs may become a step-stone towards healthcare digitalization and democratization. Therefore, we publicly release SoftTiger models at scales of 13 billion and 70 billion parameters, as well as datasets and code for our innovative scalable evaluation, hopefully, making a significant contribution to the healthcare industry.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI 2024 Spring Symposium on Clinical Foundation Models, Stanford University, Stanford, California</p></details> |

Traditional methods are labor-intensive and prone to human error. Digital pathology, which converts glass slides into high-resolution digital images for analysis by computer algorithms, revolutionizes the field by enhancing diagnostic accuracy, consistency, and efficiency through automated image analysis and large-scale data processing. Foundational transformer pretraining is crucial for developing robust, generalizable models as it enables learning from vast amounts of unannotated data. This paper introduces the Hibou family of foundational vision transformers for pathology, leveraging the DINOv2 framework to pretrain two model variants, Hibou-B and Hibou-L, on a proprietary dataset of over 1 million whole slide images (WSIs) representing diverse tissue types and staining techniques. Our pretrained models demonstrate superior performance on both patch-level and slide-level benchmarks, surpassing existing state-of-the-art methods. Notably, Hibou-L achieves the highest average accuracy across multiple benchmark datasets.

However, current approaches often struggle to effectively extract generalizable insights, frequently requiring extensive fine-tuning and limiting their versatility. Graph foundation models offer a transformative solution, with the potential to learn robust, generalizable representations from graph data. This enables more effective and adaptable applications across a wide spectrum of tasks and domains. In this work, we investigate a unified graph model, AnyGraph, designed to handle key challenges: i) Structure Heterogenity. Addressing distribution shift in graph structural information; ii) Feature Heterogenity. Handling diverse feature representation spaces across graph datasets; iii) Fast Adaptation. Efficiently adapting the model to new graph domains; iv) Scaling Law Emergence. Enabling the model to exhibit scaling law behavior, where its performance scales favorably with the amount of data and parameter sizes. To tackle these critical challenges, we build the AnyGraph upon a Graph Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture. This approach empowers the model to effectively manage both the in-domain and cross-domain distribution shift concerning structure-level and feature-level heterogeneity. Furthermore, a lightweight graph expert routing mechanism is proposed to facilitate AnyGraph's fast adaptability to new data and domains. Our extensive experiments on diverse 38 graph datasets have demonstrated the strong zero-shot learning performance of AnyGraph across diverse graph domains with significant distribution shift. Furthermore, we have validated the model's fast adaptation ability and scaling law emergence, showcasing its versatility.</p></details> |  |

Current AI foundation models, although advanced by leveraging large and heterogeneous data, are often constrained by their size and data integration, limiting their effectiveness in addressing the full range of Earth system prediction challenges. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the Oak Ridge Base Foundation Model for Earth System Predictability (ORBIT), an advanced vision transformer model that scales up to 113 billion parameters using a novel hybrid tensor-data orthogonal parallelism technique. As the largest model of its kind, ORBIT surpasses the current climate AI foundation model size by a thousandfold. Performance scaling tests conducted on the Frontier supercomputer have demonstrated that ORBIT achieves 684 petaFLOPS to 1.6 exaFLOPS sustained throughput, with scaling efficiency maintained at 41% to 85% across 49,152 AMD GPUs. These breakthroughs establish new advances in AI-driven climate modeling and demonstrate promise to significantly improve the Earth system predictability.</p></details> |  |

The challenge is the lack of labeled data for the training of foundation model. To handle this issue, a CLIP-style retinal image foundation model is developed in this paper. Our foundation model, RET-CLIP, is specifically trained on a dataset of 193,865 patients to extract general features of color fundus photographs (CFPs), employing a tripartite optimization strategy to focus on left eye, right eye, and patient level to reflect real-world clinical scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RET-CLIP outperforms existing benchmarks across eight diverse datasets spanning four critical diagnostic categories: diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, multiple disease diagnosis, and multi-label classification of multiple diseases, which demonstrate the performance and generality of our foundation model.

However, this approach introduces an urgent problem: current deep learning models are predominantly serial, meaning that as the number of network layers increases, so do the training and inference times. This is unacceptable if deep learning is to continue advancing. Therefore, this paper proposes a deep learning parallelization strategy based on the Universal Approximation Theorem (UAT). From this foundation, we designed a parallel network called Para-Former to test our theory. Unlike traditional serial models, the inference time of Para-Former does not increase with the number of layers, significantly accelerating the inference speed of multi-layer networks. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of this network.</p></details> |  |

In this landscape, cyber deception emerges as a critical component of our defense strategy against increasingly sophisticated attacks. This chapter aims to highlight the pivotal role of game-theoretic models and foundation models (FMs) in analyzing, designing, and implementing cyber deception tactics. Game models (GMs) serve as a foundational framework for modeling diverse adversarial interactions, allowing us to encapsulate both adversarial knowledge and domain-specific insights. Meanwhile, FMs serve as the building blocks for creating tailored machine learning models suited to given applications. By leveraging the synergy between GMs and FMs, we can advance proactive and automated cyber defense mechanisms by not only securing our networks against attacks but also enhancing their resilience against well-planned operations. This chapter discusses the games at the tactical, operational, and strategic levels of warfare, delves into the symbiotic relationship between these methodologies, and explores relevant applications where such a framework can make a substantial impact in cybersecurity. The chapter discusses the promising direction of the multi-agent neurosymbolic conjectural learning (MANSCOL), which allows the defender to predict adversarial behaviors, design adaptive defensive deception tactics, and synthesize knowledge for the operational level synthesis and adaptation. FMs serve as pivotal tools across various functions for MANSCOL, including reinforcement learning, knowledge assimilation, formation of conjectures, and contextual representation. This chapter concludes with a discussion of the challenges associated with FMs and their application in the domain of cybersecurity.</p></details> | <details><summary>40 pa...</summary><p>40 pages, 7 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

But do their capabilities change depending on the input modality? In this work, we propose $\textbf{IsoBench}$, a benchmark dataset containing problems from four major areas: math, science, algorithms, and games. Each example is presented with multiple $\textbf{isomorphic representations}$ of inputs, such as visual, textual, and mathematical presentations. IsoBench provides fine-grained feedback to diagnose performance gaps caused by the form of the representation. Across various foundation models, we observe that on the same problem, models have a consistent preference towards textual representations. Most prominently, when evaluated on all IsoBench problems, Claude-3 Opus performs 28.7 points worse when provided with images instead of text; similarly, GPT-4 Turbo is 18.7 points worse and Gemini Pro is 14.9 points worse.

To apply transformers across different data modalities, practitioners have to make specific clever data-modality-dependent constructions. In this paper, we propose Sampling Foundational Transformer (SFT) that can work on multiple data modalities (e.g., point cloud, graph, and sequence) and constraints (e.g., rotational-invariant). The existence of such model is important as contemporary foundational modeling requires operability on multiple data sources. For efficiency on large number of tokens, our model relies on our context aware sampling-without-replacement mechanism for both linear asymptotic computational complexity and real inference time gain. For efficiency, we rely on our newly discovered pseudoconvex formulation of transformer layer to increase model's convergence rate. As a model working on multiple data modalities, SFT has achieved competitive results on many benchmarks, while being faster in inference, compared to other very specialized models.</p></details> |  |

To address these constraints, this study introduces a novel knowledge injection approach, FedKIM, designed to scale the medical foundation model within a federated learning framework. FedKIM leverages lightweight local models to extract healthcare knowledge from private data and integrates this knowledge into a centralized foundation model using a designed adaptive Multitask Multimodal Mixture Of Experts (M3OE) module. This method not only preserves privacy but also enhances the model's ability to handle complex medical tasks involving multiple modalities.

By leveraging a cross-silo federated learning approach, FEDMEKI circumvents the issues associated with centralized data collection, which is often prohibited under health regulations like the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) in the USA. The platform is meticulously designed to handle multi-site, multi-modal, and multi-task medical data, which includes 7 medical modalities, including images, signals, texts, laboratory test results, vital signs, input variables, and output variables. The curated dataset to validate FEDMEKI covers 8 medical tasks, including 6 classification tasks (lung opacity detection, COVID-19 detection, electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormal detection, mortality prediction, sepsis prediction, and enlarged cardiomediastinum detection) and 2 generation tasks (medical visual question answering (MedVQA) and ECG noise clarification). This comprehensive dataset is partitioned across several clients to facilitate the decentralized training process under 16 benchmark approaches. FEDMEKI not only preserves data privacy but also enhances the capability of medical foundation models by allowing them to learn from a broader spectrum of medical knowledge without direct data exposure, thereby setting a new benchmark in the application of foundation models within the healthcare sector.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Neurips 2024 DB Track</p></details> |

Few-shot segmentation (FSS) methods show promise but often require retraining on the target domain and struggle to generalize across different modalities. Similarly, adapting foundation models like the Segment Anything Model (SAM) for medical imaging has limitations, including the need for finetuning and domain-specific adaptation. To address these issues, we propose a novel method that adapts DINOv2 and Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM 2) for retrieval-augmented few-shot medical image segmentation. Our approach uses DINOv2's feature as query to retrieve similar samples from limited annotated data, which are then encoded as memories and stored in memory bank. With the memory attention mechanism of SAM 2, the model leverages these memories as conditions to generate accurate segmentation of the target image. We evaluated our framework on three medical image segmentation tasks, demonstrating superior performance and generalizability across various modalities without the need for any retraining or finetuning. Overall, this method offers a practical and effective solution for few-shot medical image segmentation and holds significant potential as a valuable annotation tool in clinical applications.</p></details> |  |

However, existing models often face limitations in generalization, struggling with zero-shot prediction on unseen regions and cities, as well as diminished long-term accuracy. This is primarily due to the inherent challenges in handling the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of traffic data, coupled with the significant distribution shift across time and space. In this work, we aim to unlock new possibilities for building versatile, resilient and adaptive spatio-temporal foundation models for traffic prediction. To achieve this goal, we introduce a novel foundation model, named OpenCity, that can effectively capture and normalize the underlying spatio-temporal patterns from diverse data characteristics, facilitating zero-shot generalization across diverse urban environments. OpenCity integrates the Transformer architecture with graph neural networks to model the complex spatio-temporal dependencies in traffic data. By pre-training OpenCity on large-scale, heterogeneous traffic datasets, we enable the model to learn rich, generalizable representations that can be seamlessly applied to a wide range of traffic forecasting scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that OpenCity exhibits exceptional zero-shot predictive performance. Moreover, OpenCity showcases promising scaling laws, suggesting the potential for developing a truly one-for-all traffic prediction solution that can adapt to new urban contexts with minimal overhead. We made our proposed OpenCity model open-source and it is available at the following link: https://github.com/HKUDS/OpenCity.</p></details> | 12 pages |

However, developing generalized artificial intelligence models for medical data often requires a large number of labeled images representing various disease signs, and most models are typically task-specific, focusing on major retinal diseases. In this study, we developed a Fundus-Specific Pretrained Model (Image+Fundus), a supervised artificial intelligence model trained to detect abnormalities in fundus images. A total of 57,803 images were used to develop this pretrained model, which achieved superior performance across various downstream tasks, indicating that our proposed model outperforms other general methods. Our Image+Fundus model offers a generalized approach to improve model performance while reducing the number of labeled datasets required. Additionally, it provides more disease-specific insights into fundus images, with visualizations generated by our model. These disease-specific foundation models are invaluable in enhancing the performance and efficiency of deep learning models in the field of fundus imaging.</p></details> | 10 pages, 4 figures |

However, is it truly necessary to involve such vast amounts of data in pre-training, consuming extensive computational resources? This paper introduces data-effective learning, aiming to use data in the most impactful way to pre-train foundation models. This involves strategies that focus on data quality rather than quantity, ensuring the data used for training has high informational value. Data-effective learning plays a profound role in accelerating foundation model training, reducing computational costs, and saving data storage, which is very important as the volume of medical data in recent years has grown beyond many people's expectations. However, due to the lack of standards and comprehensive benchmarks, research on medical data-effective learning is poorly studied. To address this gap, our paper introduces a comprehensive benchmark specifically for evaluating data-effective learning in the medical field. This benchmark includes a dataset with millions of data samples from 31 medical centers (DataDEL), a baseline method for comparison (MedDEL), and a new evaluation metric (NormDEL) to objectively measure data-effective learning performance. Our extensive experimental results show the baseline MedDEL can achieve performance comparable to the original large dataset with only 5% of the data. Establishing such an open data-effective learning benchmark is crucial for the medical foundation model research community because it facilitates efficient data use, promotes collaborative breakthroughs, and fosters the development of cost-effective, scalable, and impactful healthcare solutions.</p></details> |  |

However, recent research questions this traditional notion, exploring whether an increase in pre-training data always leads to enhanced model performance. To address this issue, data-effective learning approaches have been introduced. However, current methods in this area lack a clear standard for sample selection. Our experiments reveal that by maximizing V-information, sample selection can be framed as an optimization problem, enabling effective improvement in model performance even with fewer samples. Under this guidance, we develop an optimal data-effective learning method (OptiDEL) to maximize V-information. The OptiDEL method generates hard samples to achieve or even exceed the performance of models trained on the full dataset while using substantially less data. We compare the OptiDEL method with state-of-the-art approaches finding that OptiDEL consistently outperforms existing approaches across different datasets, with foundation models trained on only 5% of the pre-training data surpassing the performance of those trained on the full dataset.</p></details> |  |

While depth and normal are geometrically related and highly complimentary, they present distinct challenges. SoTA monocular depth methods achieve zero-shot generalization by learning affine-invariant depths, which cannot recover real-world metrics. Meanwhile, SoTA normal estimation methods have limited zero-shot performance due to the lack of large-scale labeled data. To tackle these issues, we propose solutions for both metric depth estimation and surface normal estimation. For metric depth estimation, we show that the key to a zero-shot single-view model lies in resolving the metric ambiguity from various camera models and large-scale data training. We propose a canonical camera space transformation module, which explicitly addresses the ambiguity problem and can be effortlessly plugged into existing monocular models. For surface normal estimation, we propose a joint depth-normal optimization module to distill diverse data knowledge from metric depth, enabling normal estimators to learn beyond normal labels. Equipped with these modules, our depth-normal models can be stably trained with over 16 million of images from thousands of camera models with different-type annotations, resulting in zero-shot generalization to in-the-wild images with unseen camera settings. Our method enables the accurate recovery of metric 3D structures on randomly collected internet images, paving the way for plausible single-image metrology.

Ontologies are a well-known strategy for addressing such challenges, though given the complexity of the phenomenon, there are risks of reintroducing the interoperability challenges at the level of ontology representations. In the interest of avoiding such pitfalls, we introduce and defend characterizations of digital twins within the context of the Common Core Ontologies, an extension of the widely-used Basic Formal Ontology. We provide a set of definitions and design patterns relevant to the domain of digital twins, highlighted by illustrative use cases of digital twins and their physical counterparts. In doing so, we provide a foundation on which to build more sophisticated ontological content related and connected to digital twins.</p></details> | 14 |
| **[SpectralEarth: Training Hyperspectral Foundation Models at Scale](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08447v1)** | 2024-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models have triggered a paradigm shift in computer vision and are increasingly being adopted in remote sensing, particularly for multispectral imagery. Yet, their potential in hyperspectral imaging (HSI) remains untapped due to the absence of comprehensive and globally representative hyperspectral datasets. To close this gap, we introduce SpectralEarth, a large-scale multi-temporal dataset designed to pretrain hyperspectral foundation models leveraging data from the Environmental Mapping and Analysis Program (EnMAP). SpectralEarth comprises 538,974 image patches covering 415,153 unique locations from more than 11,636 globally distributed EnMAP scenes spanning two years of archive. Additionally, 17.5% of these locations include multiple timestamps, enabling multi-temporal HSI analysis. Utilizing state-of-the-art self-supervised learning (SSL) algorithms, we pretrain a series of foundation models on SpectralEarth. We integrate a spectral adapter into classical vision backbones to accommodate the unique characteristics of HSI. In tandem, we construct four downstream datasets for land-cover and crop-type mapping, providing benchmarks for model evaluation. Experimental results support the versatility of our models, showcasing their generalizability across different tasks and sensors. We also highlight computational efficiency during model fine-tuning. The dataset, models, and source code will be made publicly available.</p></details> |  |
| **[BAPLe: Backdoor Attacks on Medical Foundational Models using Prompt Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07440v2)** | 2024-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical foundation models are gaining prominence in the medical community for their ability to derive general representations from extensive collections of medical image-text pairs. Recent research indicates that these models are susceptible to backdoor attacks, which allow them to classify clean images accurately but fail when specific triggers are introduced. However, traditional backdoor attacks necessitate a considerable amount of additional data to maliciously pre-train a model. This requirement is often impractical in medical imaging applications due to the usual scarcity of data. Inspired by the latest developments in learnable prompts, this work introduces a method to embed a backdoor into the medical foundation model during the prompt learning phase. By incorporating learnable prompts within the text encoder and introducing imperceptible learnable noise trigger to the input images, we exploit the full capabilities of the medical foundation models (Med-FM). Our method, BAPLe, requires only a minimal subset of data to adjust the noise trigger and the text prompts for downstream tasks, enabling the creation of an effective backdoor attack. Through extensive experiments with four medical foundation models, each pre-trained on different modalities and evaluated across six downstream datasets, we demonstrate the efficacy of our approach. BAPLe achieves a high backdoor success rate across all models and datasets, outperforming the baseline backdoor attack methods. Our work highlights the vulnerability of Med-FMs towards backdoor attacks and strives to promote the safe adoption of Med-FMs before their deployment in real-world applications.

Although sufficient data exists for some well-studied medical tasks, there remains a long tail of clinically relevant tasks with poor data availability. Recently, numerous foundation models have demonstrated high suitability for few-shot learning (FSL) and zero-shot learning (ZSL), potentially making them more accessible to practitioners. However, it remains unclear which foundation model performs best on FSL medical image analysis tasks and what the optimal methods are for learning from limited data. We conducted a comprehensive benchmark study of ZSL and FSL using 16 pretrained foundation models on 19 diverse medical imaging datasets. Our results indicate that BiomedCLIP, a model pretrained exclusively on medical data, performs best on average for very small training set sizes, while very large CLIP models pretrained on LAION-2B perform best with slightly more training samples. However, simply fine-tuning a ResNet-18 pretrained on ImageNet performs similarly with more than five training examples per class. Our findings also highlight the need for further research on foundation models specifically tailored for medical applications and the collection of more datasets to train these models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as an oral presentation in MICCAI 2024 2nd International Workshop on Foundation Models for General Medical AI</p></details> |

Traditional TSF foundation models rely heavily on numerical data fitting. In contrast, the human brain is inherently skilled at processing visual information, prefer predicting future trends by observing visualized sequences. From a biomimetic perspective, utilizing models to directly process numerical sequences might not be the most effective route to achieving Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). This paper proposes ViTime, a novel Visual Intelligence-based foundation model for TSF. ViTime overcomes the limitations of numerical time series data fitting by utilizing visual data processing paradigms and employs a innovative data synthesis method during training, called Real Time Series (RealTS). Experiments on a diverse set of previously unseen forecasting datasets demonstrate that ViTime achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance, even surpassing the best individually trained supervised models in some situations. These findings suggest that visual intelligence can significantly enhance time series analysis and forecasting, paving the way for more advanced and versatile models in the field.

These capabilities make FMs a valuable tool for a variety of tasks, including biomedical reasoning, hypothesis generation, and interpreting complex imaging data. In this review paper, we address the unique challenges associated with establishing an ethical and trustworthy biomedical AI ecosystem, with a particular focus on the development of FMs and their downstream applications. We explore strategies that can be implemented throughout the biomedical AI pipeline to effectively tackle these challenges, ensuring that these FMs are translated responsibly into clinical and translational settings. Additionally, we emphasize the importance of key stewardship and co-design principles that not only ensure robust regulation but also guarantee that the interests of all stakeholders, especially those involved in or affected by these clinical and translational applications are adequately represented. We aim to empower the biomedical AI community to harness these models responsibly and effectively. As we navigate this exciting frontier, our collective commitment to ethical stewardship, co-design, and responsible translation will be instrumental in ensuring that the evolution of FMs truly enhances patient care and medical decision making, ultimately leading to a more equitable and trustworthy biomedical AI ecosystem.</p></details> | 3 figures, 3 tables |
| **[A Novel Computational and Modeling Foundation for Automatic Coherence Assessment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00598v2)** | 2024-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Coherence is an essential property of well-written texts, that refers to the way textual units relate to one another. In the era of generative AI, coherence assessment is essential for many NLP tasks; summarization, generation, long-form question-answering, and more. However, in NLP {coherence} is an ill-defined notion, not having a formal definition or evaluation metrics, that would allow for large-scale automatic and systematic coherence assessment. To bridge this gap, in this work we employ the formal linguistic definition of \citet{Reinhart:1980} of what makes a discourse coherent, consisting of three conditions -- {\em cohesion, consistency} and {\em relevance} -- and formalize these conditions as respective computational tasks. We hypothesize that (i) a model trained on all of these tasks will learn the features required for coherence detection, and that (ii) a joint model for all tasks will exceed the performance of models trained on each task individually. On two benchmarks for coherence scoring rated by humans, one containing 500 automatically-generated short stories and another containing 4k real-world texts, our experiments confirm that jointly training on the proposed tasks leads to better performance on each task compared with task-specific models, and to better performance on assessing coherence overall, compared with strong baselines. We conclude that the formal and computational setup of coherence as proposed here provides a solid foundation for advanced methods of large-scale automatic assessment of coherence.</p></details> |  |

However, it is unclear if these models are robust to distribution shifts, and how their performance and generalization capabilities vary under changes in data distribution. In this project we strive to answer the question "Are vision-language foundational models robust to distribution shifts like human perception?" Specifically, we consider a diverse range of vision-language models and compare how the performance of these systems is affected by corruption based distribution shifts (such as \textit{motion blur, fog, snow, gaussian noise}) commonly found in practical real-world scenarios. We analyse the generalization capabilities qualitatively and quantitatively on zero-shot image classification task under aforementioned distribution shifts.

This study introduces a novel approach towards the creation of medical foundation models by integrating a large-scale multi-modal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) dataset derived from 41,400 participants in its own. Our method involves a novel two-stage pretraining approach using vision transformers. The first stage is dedicated to encoding anatomical structures in generally healthy brains, identifying key features such as shapes and sizes of different brain regions. The second stage concentrates on spatial information, encompassing aspects like location and the relative positioning of brain structures. We rigorously evaluate our model, BrainFounder, using the Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS) challenge and Anatomical Tracings of Lesions After Stroke v2.0 (ATLAS v2.0) datasets. BrainFounder demonstrates a significant performance gain, surpassing the achievements of the previous winning solutions using fully supervised learning. Our findings underscore the impact of scaling up both the complexity of the model and the volume of unlabeled training data derived from generally healthy brains, which enhances the accuracy and predictive capabilities of the model in complex neuroimaging tasks with MRI. The implications of this research provide transformative insights and practical applications in healthcare and make substantial steps towards the creation of foundation models for Medical AI.

These agents are postulated to excel across a myriad of tasks, potentially approaching general artificial intelligence. However, existing benchmarks fail to sufficiently challenge or showcase the full potential of LMMs in complex, real-world environments. To address this gap, we introduce VisualAgentBench (VAB), a comprehensive and pioneering benchmark specifically designed to train and evaluate LMMs as visual foundation agents across diverse scenarios, including Embodied, Graphical User Interface, and Visual Design, with tasks formulated to probe the depth of LMMs' understanding and interaction capabilities. Through rigorous testing across nine proprietary LMM APIs and eight open models, we demonstrate the considerable yet still developing agent capabilities of these models. Additionally, VAB constructs a trajectory training set constructed through hybrid methods including Program-based Solvers, LMM Agent Bootstrapping, and Human Demonstrations, promoting substantial performance improvements in LMMs through behavior cloning. Our work not only aims to benchmark existing models but also provides a solid foundation for future development into visual foundation agents.

In the future of space robotics, we see three core challenges which motivate the use of a foundation model adapted to space-based applications: 1) Scalability of ground-in-the-loop operations; 2) Generalizing prior knowledge to novel environments; and 3) Multi-modality in tasks and sensor data. Therefore, as a first-step towards building a foundation model for space-based applications, we automatically label the AI4Mars dataset to curate a language annotated dataset of visual-question-answer tuples. We fine-tune a pretrained LLaVA checkpoint on this dataset to endow a vision-language model with the ability to perform spatial reasoning and navigation on Mars' surface. In this work, we demonstrate that 1) existing vision-language models are deficient visual reasoners in space-based applications, and 2) fine-tuning a vision-language model on extraterrestrial data significantly improves the quality of responses even with a limited training dataset of only a few thousand samples.</p></details> |  |

The three key factors in pretraining foundation models are the pretraining method, the size of the pretraining dataset, and the number of model parameters. Recently, research in the remote sensing field has focused primarily on the pretraining method and the size of the dataset, with limited emphasis on the number of model parameters. This paper addresses this gap by examining the effect of increasing the number of model parameters on the performance of foundation models in downstream tasks such as rotated object detection and semantic segmentation. We pretrained foundation models with varying numbers of parameters, including 86M, 605.26M, 1.3B, and 2.4B, to determine whether performance in downstream tasks improved with an increase in parameters. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first billion-scale foundation model in the remote sensing field. Furthermore, we propose an effective method for scaling up and fine-tuning a vision transformer in the remote sensing field. To evaluate general performance in downstream tasks, we employed the DOTA v2.0 and DIOR-R benchmark datasets for rotated object detection, and the Potsdam and LoveDA datasets for semantic segmentation. Experimental results demonstrated that, across all benchmark datasets and downstream tasks, the performance of the foundation models and data efficiency improved as the number of parameters increased. Moreover, our models achieve the state-of-the-art performance on several datasets including DIOR-R, Postdam, and LoveDA.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This manuscript is the accepted version for IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing (IEEE J-STARS)</p></details> |

Generalist AI holds the potential to address these limitations due to its versatility in interpreting different data types and generating tailored outputs for diverse needs. However, existing biomedical generalist AI solutions are typically heavyweight and closed source to researchers, practitioners, and patients. Here, we propose BiomedGPT, the first open-source and lightweight vision-language foundation model, designed as a generalist capable of performing various biomedical tasks. BiomedGPT achieved state-of-the-art results in 16 out of 25 experiments while maintaining a computing-friendly model scale. We also conducted human evaluations to assess the capabilities of BiomedGPT in radiology visual question answering, report generation, and summarization. BiomedGPT exhibits robust prediction ability with a low error rate of 3.8% in question answering, satisfactory performance with an error rate of 8.3% in writing complex radiology reports, and competitive summarization ability with a nearly equivalent preference score to human experts.

Despite their success, current retinal foundation models are generally restricted to a single imaging modality, such as Color Fundus Photography (CFP) or Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT), limiting their versatility. Moreover, these models may struggle to fully leverage expert annotations and overlook the valuable domain knowledge essential for domain-specific representation learning. To overcome these limitations, we introduce UrFound, a retinal foundation model designed to learn universal representations from both multimodal retinal images and domain knowledge. UrFound is equipped with a modality-agnostic image encoder and accepts either CFP or OCT images as inputs. To integrate domain knowledge into representation learning, we encode expert annotation in text supervision and propose a knowledge-guided masked modeling strategy for model pre-training. It involves reconstructing randomly masked patches of retinal images while predicting masked text tokens conditioned on the corresponding retinal image. This approach aligns multimodal images and textual expert annotations within a unified latent space, facilitating generalizable and domain-specific representation learning. Experimental results demonstrate that UrFound exhibits strong generalization ability and data efficiency when adapting to various tasks in retinal image analysis. By training on ~180k retinal images, UrFound significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art retinal foundation model trained on up to 1.6 million unlabelled images across 8 public retinal datasets.

However, evaluating MLLMs in low-level visual perception and understanding remains a yet-to-explore domain. To this end, we design benchmark settings to emulate human language responses related to low-level vision: the low-level visual perception (A1) via visual question answering related to low-level attributes (e.g. clarity, lighting); and the low-level visual description (A2), on evaluating MLLMs for low-level text descriptions. Furthermore, given that pairwise comparison can better avoid ambiguity of responses and has been adopted by many human experiments, we further extend the low-level perception-related question-answering and description evaluations of MLLMs from single images to image pairs. Specifically, for perception (A1), we carry out the LLVisionQA+ dataset, comprising 2,990 single images and 1,999 image pairs each accompanied by an open-ended question about its low-level features; for description (A2), we propose the LLDescribe+ dataset, evaluating MLLMs for low-level descriptions on 499 single images and 450 pairs. Additionally, we evaluate MLLMs on assessment (A3) ability, i.e. predicting score, by employing a softmax-based approach to enable all MLLMs to generate quantifiable quality ratings, tested against human opinions in 7 image quality assessment (IQA) datasets. With 24 MLLMs under evaluation, we demonstrate that several MLLMs have decent low-level visual competencies on single images, but only GPT-4V exhibits higher accuracy on pairwise comparisons than single image evaluations (like humans). We hope that our benchmark will motivate further research into uncovering and enhancing these nascent capabilities of MLLMs. Datasets will be available at https://github.com/Q-Future/Q-Bench.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by TPAMI. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2309.14181</p></details> |

Traditional automatic segmentation methods often lack generalizability when applied to unseen datasets. Recently, the success of foundation models (FMs) has provided a more generalizable solution, potentially enabling the segmentation of any cell type. In this study, we perform a large-scale evaluation of three widely used state-of-the-art (SOTA) cell nuclei foundation models (Cellpose, StarDist, and CellViT). Specifically, we created a highly diverse evaluation dataset consisting of 2,542 kidney whole slide images (WSIs) collected from both human and rodent sources, encompassing various tissue types, sizes, and staining methods. To our knowledge, this is the largest-scale evaluation of its kind to date. Our quantitative analysis of the prediction distribution reveals a persistent performance gap in kidney pathology. Among the evaluated models, CellViT demonstrated superior performance in segmenting nuclei in kidney pathology. However, none of the foundation models are perfect; a performance gap remains in general nuclei segmentation for kidney pathology.</p></details> |  |

Conventional task-specific ECG analysis models require large numbers of expensive ECG annotations or associated labels to train. Transfer learning techniques have been shown to improve generalization and reduce reliance on labeled data. We present ECG-FM, an open foundation model for ECG analysis, and conduct a comprehensive study performed on a dataset of 1.66 million ECGs sourced from both publicly available and private institutional sources. ECG-FM adopts a transformer-based architecture and is pretrained on 2.5 million samples using ECG-specific augmentations and contrastive learning, as well as a continuous signal masking objective. Our transparent evaluation includes a diverse range of downstream tasks, where we predict ECG interpretation labels, reduced left ventricular ejection fraction, and abnormal cardiac troponin. Affirming ECG-FM's effectiveness as a foundation model, we demonstrate how its command of contextual information results in strong performance, rich pretrained embeddings, and reliable interpretability. Due to a lack of open-weight practices, we highlight how ECG analysis is lagging behind other medical machine learning subfields in terms of foundation model adoption.

Recently, vision foundation models such as CLIP have gained significant attention, helping the vision community advance in finding robust, generalizable feature representations. With the majority of researchers within the wearable community relying on vision modalities to overcome the limited expressiveness of wearable data and accurately label their to-be-released benchmark datasets offline, we propose a novel, clustering-based annotation pipeline to significantly reduce the amount of data that needs to be annotated by a human annotator. We show that using our approach, the annotation of centroid clips suffices to achieve average labelling accuracies close to 90% across three publicly available HAR benchmark datasets. Using the weakly annotated datasets, we further demonstrate that we can match the accuracy scores of fully-supervised deep learning classifiers across all three benchmark datasets.

However, a key hurdle in achieving this goal lies in the robots' ability to manipulate objects in their unstructured surrounding environments according to different tasks. The learning-based approach is considered an effective way to address generalization. The impressive performance of foundation models in the fields of computer vision and natural language suggests the potential of embedding foundation models into manipulation tasks as a viable path toward achieving general manipulation capability. However, we believe achieving general manipulation capability requires an overarching framework akin to auto driving. This framework should encompass multiple functional modules, with different foundation models assuming distinct roles in facilitating general manipulation capability. This survey focuses on the contributions of foundation models to robot learning for manipulation. We propose a comprehensive framework and detail how foundation models can address challenges in each module of the framework.

Inspired by this progress, we explore the potential of foundation models for time-series forecasting in smart agriculture, a field often plagued by limited data availability. Specifically, this work presents a novel application of $\texttt{TimeGPT}$, a state-of-the-art (SOTA) time-series foundation model, to predict soil water potential ($\psi_\mathrm{soil}$), a key indicator of field water status that is typically used for irrigation advice. Traditionally, this task relies on a wide array of input variables. We explore $\psi_\mathrm{soil}$'s ability to forecast $\psi_\mathrm{soil}$ in: ($i$) a zero-shot setting, ($ii$) a fine-tuned setting relying solely on historic $\psi_\mathrm{soil}$ measurements, and ($iii$) a fine-tuned setting where we also add exogenous variables to the model. We compare $\texttt{TimeGPT}$'s performance to established SOTA baseline models for forecasting $\psi_\mathrm{soil}$. Our results demonstrate that $\texttt{TimeGPT}$ achieves competitive forecasting accuracy using only historical $\psi_\mathrm{soil}$ data, highlighting its remarkable potential for agricultural applications. This research paves the way for foundation time-series models for sustainable development in agriculture by enabling forecasting tasks that were traditionally reliant on extensive data collection and domain expertise.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, accepted at KDD '24 - Fragile Earth Workshop https://openreview.net/forum?id=GZBGhi4JfE</p></details> |
| **[The Foundations of Tokenization: Statistical and Computational Concerns](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11606v2)** | 2024-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tokenization - the practice of converting strings of characters over an alphabet into sequences of tokens over a vocabulary - is a critical yet under-theorized step in the NLP pipeline. Notably, it remains the only major step not fully integrated into widely used end-to-end neural models. This paper aims to address this theoretical gap by laying the foundations of tokenization from a formal perspective. By articulating and extending basic properties about the category of stochastic maps, we propose a unified framework for representing and analyzing tokenizer models. This framework allows us to establish general conditions for the use of tokenizers. In particular, we formally establish the necessary and sufficient conditions for a tokenizer model to preserve the consistency of statistical estimators. Additionally, we discuss statistical and computational concerns crucial for the design and implementation of tokenizer models. The framework and results advanced in this paper represent a step toward a robust theoretical foundation for neural language modeling.</p></details> |  |

However, capturing high-resolution ground truth canopy height using LiDAR is expensive and not available globally. An efficient alternative is to train a canopy height estimator to operate on single-view remotely sensed imagery. The primary obstacle to this approach is that these methods require significant training data to generalize well globally and across uncommon edge cases. Recent monocular depth estimation foundation models have show strong zero-shot performance even for complex scenes. In this paper we leverage the representations learned by these models to transfer to the remote sensing domain for measuring canopy height. Our findings suggest that our proposed Depth Any Canopy, the result of fine-tuning the Depth Anything v2 model for canopy height estimation, provides a performant and efficient solution, surpassing the current state-of-the-art with superior or comparable performance using only a fraction of the computational resources and parameters. Furthermore, our approach requires less than \$1.30 in compute and results in an estimated carbon footprint of 0.14 kgCO2.

Our contributions are (1) generalizing the theory of causal abstraction from mechanism replacement (i.e., hard and soft interventions) to arbitrary mechanism transformation (i.e., functionals from old mechanisms to new mechanisms), (2) providing a flexible, yet precise formalization for the core concepts of modular features, polysemantic neurons, and graded faithfulness, and (3) unifying a variety of mechanistic interpretability methodologies in the common language of causal abstraction, namely activation and path patching, causal mediation analysis, causal scrubbing, causal tracing, circuit analysis, concept erasure, sparse autoencoders, differential binary masking, distributed alignment search, and activation steering.</p></details> |  |
| **[Anatomical Foundation Models for Brain MRIs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07079v1)** | 2024-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep Learning (DL) in neuroimaging has become increasingly relevant for detecting neurological conditions and neurodegenerative disorders. One of the most predominant biomarkers in neuroimaging is represented by brain age, which has been shown to be a good indicator for different conditions, such as Alzheimer's Disease. Using brain age for pretraining DL models in transfer learning settings has also recently shown promising results, especially when dealing with data scarcity of different conditions. On the other hand, anatomical information of brain MRIs (e.g. cortical thickness) can provide important information for learning good representations that can be transferred to many downstream tasks. In this work, we propose AnatCL, an anatomical foundation model for brain MRIs that i.) leverages anatomical information with a weakly contrastive learning approach and ii.) achieves state-of-the-art performances in many different downstream tasks. To validate our approach we consider 12 different downstream tasks for diagnosis classification, and prediction of 10 different clinical assessment scores.</p></details> | 12 pages |

Traditionally reliant on manual interpretation and task-specific models, remote sensing has been significantly enhanced by the advent of foundation models--large-scale, pre-trained AI models capable of performing a wide array of tasks with unprecedented accuracy and efficiency. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of foundation models in the remote sensing domain, covering models released between June 2021 and June 2024. We categorize these models based on their applications in computer vision and domain-specific tasks, offering insights into their architectures, pre-training datasets, and methodologies. Through detailed performance comparisons, we highlight emerging trends and the significant advancements achieved by these foundation models. Additionally, we discuss the technical challenges, practical implications, and future research directions, addressing the need for high-quality data, computational resources, and improved model generalization. Our research also finds that pre-training methods, particularly self-supervised learning techniques like contrastive learning and masked autoencoders, significantly enhance the performance and robustness of foundation models in remote sensing tasks such as scene classification, object detection, and other applications. This survey aims to serve as a resource for researchers and practitioners by providing a panorama of advances and promising pathways for continued development and application of foundation models in remote sensing.</p></details> |  |
| **[Tool Learning with Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08354v3)** | 2024-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Humans possess an extraordinary ability to create and utilize tools, allowing them to overcome physical limitations and explore new frontiers. With the advent of foundation models, AI systems have the potential to be equally adept in tool use as humans. This paradigm, i.e., tool learning with foundation models, combines the strengths of specialized tools and foundation models to achieve enhanced accuracy, efficiency, and automation in problem-solving. Despite its immense potential, there is still a lack of a comprehensive understanding of key challenges, opportunities, and future endeavors in this field. To this end, we present a systematic investigation of tool learning in this paper. We first introduce the background of tool learning, including its cognitive origins, the paradigm shift of foundation models, and the complementary roles of tools and models. Then we recapitulate existing tool learning research into tool-augmented and tool-oriented learning. We formulate a general tool learning framework: starting from understanding the user instruction, models should learn to decompose a complex task into several subtasks, dynamically adjust their plan through reasoning, and effectively conquer each sub-task by selecting appropriate tools. We also discuss how to train models for improved tool-use capabilities and facilitate the generalization in tool learning. Considering the lack of a systematic tool learning evaluation in prior works, we experiment with 18 representative tools and show the potential of current foundation models in skillfully utilizing tools. Finally, we discuss several open problems that require further investigation for tool learning. In general, we hope this paper could inspire future research in integrating tools with foundation models.</p></details> |  |

The advent of Whole Slide Scanners and the development of deep learning technologies have significantly advanced the field, leading to extensive research and development in pathology AI (Artificial Intelligence). These advancements have contributed to reducing the workload of pathologists and supporting decision-making in treatment plans. Recently, large-scale AI models known as Foundation Models (FMs), which are more accurate and applicable to a wide range of tasks compared to traditional AI, have emerged, and expanded their application scope in the healthcare field. Numerous FMs have been developed in pathology, and there are reported cases of their application in various tasks, such as disease diagnosis, rare cancer diagnosis, patient survival prognosis prediction, biomarker expression prediction, and the scoring of immunohistochemical expression intensity. However, several challenges remain for the clinical application of FMs, which healthcare professionals, as users, must be aware of. Research is ongoing to address these challenges. In the future, it is expected that the development of Generalist Medical AI, which integrates pathology FMs with FMs from other medical domains, will progress, leading to the effective utilization of AI in real clinical settings to promote precision and personalized medicine.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 1 figure, 3 tables</p></details> |

We also discuss the operations involved in both design-time and run-time phases, providing a comprehensive view of architectural design and operational characteristics. By unifying and detailing these classifications, our taxonomy aims to improve the design of foundation-model-based agents. Additionally, the paper establishes a decision model that guides critical design and runtime decisions, offering a structured approach to enhance the development of foundation-model-based agents.

Therefore, we introduce VisionUnite, a novel vision-language foundation model for ophthalmology enhanced with clinical knowledge. VisionUnite has been pretrained on an extensive dataset comprising 1.24 million image-text pairs, and further refined using our proposed MMFundus dataset, which includes 296,379 high-quality fundus image-text pairs and 889,137 simulated doctor-patient dialogue instances. Our experiments indicate that VisionUnite outperforms existing generative foundation models such as GPT-4V and Gemini Pro. It also demonstrates diagnostic capabilities comparable to junior ophthalmologists. VisionUnite performs well in various clinical scenarios including open-ended multi-disease diagnosis, clinical explanation, and patient interaction, making it a highly versatile tool for initial ophthalmic disease screening. VisionUnite can also serve as an educational aid for junior ophthalmologists, accelerating their acquisition of knowledge regarding both common and rare ophthalmic conditions. VisionUnite represents a significant advancement in ophthalmology, with broad implications for diagnostics, medical education, and understanding of disease mechanisms.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimizing Cox Models with Stochastic Gradient Descent: Theoretical Foundations and Practical Guidances](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02839v1)** | 2024-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Optimizing Cox regression and its neural network variants poses substantial computational challenges in large-scale studies. Stochastic gradient descent (SGD), known for its scalability in model optimization, has recently been adapted to optimize Cox models. Unlike its conventional application, which typically targets a sum of independent individual loss, SGD for Cox models updates parameters based on the partial likelihood of a subset of data. Despite its empirical success, the theoretical foundation for optimizing Cox partial likelihood with SGD is largely underexplored. In this work, we demonstrate that the SGD estimator targets an objective function that is batch-size-dependent. We establish that the SGD estimator for the Cox neural network (Cox-NN) is consistent and achieves the optimal minimax convergence rate up to a polylogarithmic factor. For Cox regression, we further prove the $\sqrt{n}$-consistency and asymptotic normality of the SGD estimator, with variance depending on the batch size. Furthermore, we quantify the impact of batch size on Cox-NN training and its effect on the SGD estimator's asymptotic efficiency in Cox regression. These findings are validated by extensive numerical experiments and provide guidance for selecting batch sizes in SGD applications. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of SGD in a real-world application where GD is unfeasible due to the large scale of data.</p></details> |  |
| **[PathoDuet: Foundation Models for Pathological Slide Analysis of H&E and IHC Stains](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09894v2)** | 2024-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large amounts of digitized histopathological data display a promising future for developing pathological foundation models via self-supervised learning methods. Foundation models pretrained with these methods serve as a good basis for downstream tasks. However, the gap between natural and histopathological images hinders the direct application of existing methods. In this work, we present PathoDuet, a series of pretrained models on histopathological images, and a new self-supervised learning framework in histopathology. The framework is featured by a newly-introduced pretext token and later task raisers to explicitly utilize certain relations between images, like multiple magnifications and multiple stains. Based on this, two pretext tasks, cross-scale positioning and cross-stain transferring, are designed to pretrain the model on Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) images and transfer the model to immunohistochemistry (IHC) images, respectively. To validate the efficacy of our models, we evaluate the performance over a wide variety of downstream tasks, including patch-level colorectal cancer subtyping and whole slide image (WSI)-level classification in H&E field, together with expression level prediction of IHC marker, tumor identification and slide-level qualitative analysis in IHC field. The experimental results show the superiority of our models over most tasks and the efficacy of proposed pretext tasks.

| **[A Multimodal Knowledge-enhanced Whole-slide Pathology Foundation Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15362v2)** | 2024-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Remarkable strides in computational pathology have been made in the task-agnostic foundation model that advances the performance of a wide array of downstream clinical tasks. Despite the promising performance, there are still several challenges. First, prior works have resorted to either vision-only or vision-captions data, disregarding invaluable pathology reports and gene expression profiles which respectively offer distinct knowledge for versatile clinical applications. Second, the current progress in pathology FMs predominantly concentrates on the patch level, where the restricted context of patch-level pretraining fails to capture whole-slide patterns. Here we curated the largest multimodal dataset consisting of H\&E diagnostic whole slide images and their associated pathology reports and RNA-Seq data, resulting in 26,169 slide-level modality pairs from 10,275 patients across 32 cancer types. To leverage these data for CPath, we propose a novel whole-slide pretraining paradigm which injects multimodal knowledge at the whole-slide context into the pathology FM, called Multimodal Self-TAught PRetraining (mSTAR). The proposed paradigm revolutionizes the workflow of pretraining for CPath, which enables the pathology FM to acquire the whole-slide context. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to incorporate multimodal knowledge at the slide level for enhancing pathology FMs, expanding the modelling context from unimodal to multimodal knowledge and from patch-level to slide-level. To systematically evaluate the capabilities of mSTAR, extensive experiments including slide-level unimodal and multimodal applications, are conducted across 7 diverse types of tasks on 43 subtasks, resulting in the largest spectrum of downstream tasks. The average performance in various slide-level applications consistently demonstrates significant performance enhancements for mSTAR compared to SOTA FMs.</p></details> | 45 pages, 9 figures |

Some common limitations in MOT are varying object appearances, occlusions, or crowded scenes. To address these challenges, machine learning methods have been extensively deployed, leveraging large datasets, sophisticated models, and substantial computational resources. Due to practical limitations, access to the above is not always an option. However, with the recent release of foundation models by prominent AI companies, pretrained models have been trained on vast datasets and resources using state-of-the-art methods. This work tries to leverage one such foundation model, called DINOv2, through using knowledge distillation. The proposed method uses a teacher-student architecture, where DINOv2 is the teacher and the FairMOT backbone HRNetv2 W18 is the student. The results imply that although the proposed method shows improvements in certain scenarios, it does not consistently outperform the original FairMOT model. These findings highlight the potential and limitations of applying foundation models in knowledge</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is an MSc thesis by Niels Faber, supervised by the two other authors</p></details> |

However, the fast-growing capabilities and autonomy have also raised significant concerns about responsible AI and AI safety. Recently, there have been increasing attention toward implementing guardrails to ensure the runtime behavior of FM-based systems is safe and responsible. Given the early stage of FMs and their applications (such as agents), the design of guardrails have not yet been systematically studied. It remains underexplored which software qualities should be considered when designing guardrails and how these qualities can be ensured from a software architecture perspective. Therefore, in this paper, we present a taxonomy for guardrails to classify and compare the characteristics and design options of guardrails. Our taxonomy is organized into three main categories: the motivation behind adopting runtime guardrails, the quality attributes to consider, and the design options available. This taxonomy provides structured and concrete guidance for making architectural design decisions when designing guardrails and highlights trade-offs arising from the design decisions.</p></details> | 15 Pages |
| **[Towards A Generalizable Pathology Foundation Model via Unified Knowledge Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18449v2)** | 2024-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models pretrained on large-scale datasets are revolutionizing the field of computational pathology (CPath). The generalization ability of foundation models is crucial for the success in various downstream clinical tasks. However, current foundation models have only been evaluated on a limited type and number of tasks, leaving their generalization ability and overall performance unclear. To address this gap, we established a most comprehensive benchmark to evaluate the performance of off-the-shelf foundation models across six distinct clinical task types, encompassing a total of 39 specific tasks. Our findings reveal that existing foundation models excel at certain task types but struggle to effectively handle the full breadth of clinical tasks. To improve the generalization of pathology foundation models, we propose a unified knowledge distillation framework consisting of both expert and self knowledge distillation, where the former allows the model to learn from the knowledge of multiple expert models, while the latter leverages self-distillation to enable image representation learning via local-global alignment. Based on this framework, a Generalizable Pathology Foundation Model (GPFM) is pretrained on a large-scale dataset consisting of 190 million images from around 86,000 public H&E whole slides across 34 major tissue types. Evaluated on the established benchmark, GPFM achieves an impressive average rank of 1.36, with 29 tasks ranked 1st, while the the second-best model, UNI, attains an average rank of 2.96, with only 4 tasks ranked 1st. The superior generalization of GPFM demonstrates its exceptional modeling capabilities across a wide range of clinical tasks, positioning it as a new cornerstone for feature representation in CPath.</p></details> |  |
| **[Telecom Foundation Models: Applications, Challenges, and Future Trends](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03964v1)** | 2024-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Telecom networks are becoming increasingly complex, with diversified deployment scenarios, multi-standards, and multi-vendor support. The intricate nature of the telecom network ecosystem presents challenges to effectively manage, operate, and optimize networks. To address these hurdles, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been widely adopted to solve different tasks in telecom networks. However, these conventional AI models are often designed for specific tasks, rely on extensive and costly-to-collect labeled data that require specialized telecom expertise for development and maintenance. The AI models usually fail to generalize and support diverse deployment scenarios and applications. In contrast, Foundation Models (FMs) show effective generalization capabilities in various domains in language, vision, and decision-making tasks. FMs can be trained on multiple data modalities generated from the telecom ecosystem and leverage specialized domain knowledge. Moreover, FMs can be fine-tuned to solve numerous specialized tasks with minimal task-specific labeled data and, in some instances, are able to leverage context to solve previously unseen problems. At the dawn of 6G, this paper investigates the potential opportunities of using FMs to shape the future of telecom technologies and standards. In particular, the paper outlines a conceptual process for developing Telecom FMs (TFMs) and discusses emerging opportunities for orchestrating specialized TFMs for network configuration, operation, and maintenance. Finally, the paper discusses the limitations and challenges of developing and deploying TFMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Importance of Downstream Networks in Digital Pathology Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17804v3)** | 2024-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Digital pathology has significantly advanced disease detection and pathologist efficiency through the analysis of gigapixel whole-slide images (WSI). In this process, WSIs are first divided into patches, for which a feature extractor model is applied to obtain feature vectors, which are subsequently processed by an aggregation model to predict the respective WSI label. With the rapid evolution of representation learning, numerous new feature extractor models, often termed foundational models, have emerged. Traditional evaluation methods rely on a static downstream aggregation model setup, encompassing a fixed architecture and hyperparameters, a practice we identify as potentially biasing the results. Our study uncovers a sensitivity of feature extractor models towards aggregation model configurations, indicating that performance comparability can be skewed based on the chosen configurations. By accounting for this sensitivity, we find that the performance of many current feature extractor models is notably similar. We support this insight by evaluating seven feature extractor models across three different datasets with 162 different aggregation model configurations. This comprehensive approach provides a more nuanced understanding of the feature extractors' sensitivity to various aggregation model configurations, leading to a fairer and more accurate assessment of new foundation models in digital pathology.</p></details> |  |
| **[Boosting Gaze Object Prediction via Pixel-level Supervision from Vision Foundation Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01044v1)** | 2024-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Gaze object prediction (GOP) aims to predict the category and location of the object that a human is looking at. Previous methods utilized box-level supervision to identify the object that a person is looking at, but struggled with semantic ambiguity, ie, a single box may contain several items since objects are close together. The Vision foundation model (VFM) has improved in object segmentation using box prompts, which can reduce confusion by more precisely locating objects, offering advantages for fine-grained prediction of gaze objects. This paper presents a more challenging gaze object segmentation (GOS) task, which involves inferring the pixel-level mask corresponding to the object captured by human gaze behavior. In particular, we propose that the pixel-level supervision provided by VFM can be integrated into gaze object prediction to mitigate semantic ambiguity. This leads to our gaze object detection and segmentation framework that enables accurate pixel-level predictions. Different from previous methods that require additional head input or ignore head features, we propose to automatically obtain head features from scene features to ensure the model's inference efficiency and flexibility in the real world. Moreover, rather than directly fuse features to predict gaze heatmap as in existing methods, which may overlook spatial location and subtle details of the object, we develop a space-to-object gaze regression method to facilitate human-object gaze interaction. Specifically, it first constructs an initial human-object spatial connection, then refines this connection by interacting with semantically clear features in the segmentation branch, ultimately predicting a gaze heatmap for precise localization. Extensive experiments on GOO-Synth and GOO-Real datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.</p></details> | Accepted by ECCV2024 |

There is a wide variety of knowledge patterns embedded in the graph data, such as node properties and clusters, which are crucial to learning generalized representations for GFMs. However, existing surveys of GFMs have several shortcomings: they lack comprehensiveness regarding the most recent progress, have unclear categorization of self-supervised methods, and take a limited architecture-based perspective that is restricted to only certain types of graph models. As the ultimate goal of GFMs is to learn generalized graph knowledge, we provide a comprehensive survey of self-supervised GFMs from a novel knowledge-based perspective. We propose a knowledge-based taxonomy, which categorizes self-supervised graph models by the specific graph knowledge utilized. Our taxonomy consists of microscopic (nodes, links, etc.), mesoscopic (context, clusters, etc.), and macroscopic knowledge (global structure, manifolds, etc.). It covers a total of 9 knowledge categories and more than 25 pretext tasks for pre-training GFMs, as well as various downstream task generalization strategies. Such a knowledge-based taxonomy allows us to re-examine graph models based on new architectures more clearly, such as graph language models, as well as provide more in-depth insights for constructing GFMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 7 figures; work in progress</p></details> |

The more popular ones, such as Chat-GPT, are trained on large amounts of Internet data. However, it is becoming apparent that this data is likely to be exhausted soon, and technology companies are looking for new sources of data to train the next generation of foundation models. Reinforcement learning, RAG, prompt engineering and cognitive modelling are often used to fine-tune and augment the behaviour of foundation models. These techniques have been used to replicate people, such as Caryn Marjorie. These chatbots are not based on people's actual emotional and physiological responses to their environment, so they are, at best, a surface-level approximation to the characters they are imitating. To address these issues, we have developed a recording rig that captures what the wearer is seeing and hearing as well as their skin conductance (GSR), facial expression and brain state (14 channel EEG). AI algorithms are used to process this data into a rich picture of the environment and internal states of the subject. Foundation models trained on this data could replicate human behaviour much more accurately than the personality models that have been developed so far. This type of model has many potential applications, including recommendation, personal assistance, GAN systems, dating and recruitment. This paper gives some background to this work and describes the recording rig and preliminary tests of its functionality. It then suggests how a new type of foundation model could be created from the data captured by the rig and outlines some applications. Data gathering and model training are expensive, so we are currently working on the launch of a start-up that could raise funds for the next stage of the project.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 5 figures, 3 tables. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2408.00030</p></details> |

The more popular ones, such as Chat-GPT, are trained on large amounts of data from the Internet, and then reinforcement learning, RAG, prompt engineering and cognitive modelling are used to fine-tune and augment their behavior. This technology has been used to create models of individual people, such as Caryn Marjorie. However, these chatbots are not based on people's actual emotional and physiological responses to their environment, so they are, at best, surface-level approximations to the characters they are imitating. This paper describes how a new type of foundation model - a first-person foundation model - could be created from recordings of what a person sees and hears as well as their emotional and physiological reactions to these stimuli. A first-person foundation model would map environmental stimuli to a person's emotional and physiological states, and map a person's emotional and physiological states to their behavior. First-person foundation models have many exciting applications, including a new type of recommendation engine, personal assistants, generative adversarial networks, dating and recruitment. To obtain training data for a first-person foundation model, we have developed a recording rig that captures what the wearer is seeing and hearing as well as their emotional and physiological states.

The integration of the two has garnered significant attention from the AI research community. In this work, we attempt to provide an in-depth and comprehensive evaluation of the performance of MFM s on embodied task planning, aiming to shed light on their capabilities and limitations in this domain. To this end, based on the characteristics of embodied task planning, we first develop a systematic evaluation framework, which encapsulates four crucial capabilities of MFMs: object understanding, spatio-temporal perception, task understanding, and embodied reasoning. Following this, we propose a new benchmark, named MFE-ETP, characterized its complex and variable task scenarios, typical yet diverse task types, task instances of varying difficulties, and rich test case types ranging from multiple embodied question answering to embodied task reasoning. Finally, we offer a simple and easy-to-use automatic evaluation platform that enables the automated testing of multiple MFMs on the proposed benchmark. Using the benchmark and evaluation platform, we evaluated several state-of-the-art MFMs and found that they significantly lag behind human-level performance. The MFE-ETP is a high-quality, large-scale, and challenging benchmark relevant to real-world tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Benchmarking Histopathology Foundation Models for Ovarian Cancer Bevacizumab Treatment Response Prediction from Whole Slide Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20596v1)** | 2024-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bevacizumab is a widely studied targeted therapeutic drug used in conjunction with standard chemotherapy for the treatment of recurrent ovarian cancer. While its administration has shown to increase the progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with advanced stage ovarian cancer, the lack of identifiable biomarkers for predicting patient response has been a major roadblock in its effective adoption towards personalized medicine. In this work, we leverage the latest histopathology foundation models trained on large-scale whole slide image (WSI) datasets to extract ovarian tumor tissue features for predicting bevacizumab response from WSIs. Our extensive experiments across a combination of different histopathology foundation models and multiple instance learning (MIL) strategies demonstrate capability of these large models in predicting bevacizumab response in ovarian cancer patients with the best models achieving an AUC score of 0.86 and an accuracy score of 72.5%. Furthermore, our survival models are able to stratify high- and low-risk cases with statistical significance (p < 0.05) even among the patients with the aggressive subtype of high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma. This work highlights the utility of histopathology foundation models for the task of ovarian bevacizumab response prediction from WSIs. The high-attention regions of the WSIs highlighted by these models not only aid the model explainability but also serve as promising imaging biomarkers for treatment prognosis.</p></details> |  |
| **[The GPT Dilemma: Foundation Models and the Shadow of Dual-Use](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20442v1)** | 2024-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper examines the dual-use challenges of foundation models and the consequent risks they pose for international security. As artificial intelligence (AI) models are increasingly tested and deployed across both civilian and military sectors, distinguishing between these uses becomes more complex, potentially leading to misunderstandings and unintended escalations among states. The broad capabilities of foundation models lower the cost of repurposing civilian models for military uses, making it difficult to discern another state's intentions behind developing and deploying these models. As military capabilities are increasingly augmented by AI, this discernment is crucial in evaluating the extent to which a state poses a military threat. Consequently, the ability to distinguish between military and civilian applications of these models is key to averting potential military escalations. The paper analyzes this issue through four critical factors in the development cycle of foundation models: model inputs, capabilities, system use cases, and system deployment. This framework helps elucidate the points at which ambiguity between civilian and military applications may arise, leading to potential misperceptions. Using the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty as a case study, this paper proposes several strategies to mitigate the associated risks. These include establishing red lines for military competition, enhancing information-sharing protocols, employing foundation models to promote international transparency, and imposing constraints on specific weapon platforms. By managing dual-use risks effectively, these strategies aim to minimize potential escalations and address the trade-offs accompanying increasingly general AI models.</p></details> |  |
