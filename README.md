| **[Characteristic function-based tests for spatial randomness](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07946v1)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a new type of test for complete spatial randomness that applies to mapped point patterns in a rectangle or a cube of any dimension. This is the first test of its kind to be based on characteristic functions and utilizes a weighted L2-distance between the empirical and uniform characteristic functions. It is simple to calculate and does not require adjusting for edge effects. An efficient algorithm is developed to find the asymptotic null distribution of the test statistic under the Cauchy weight function. In a simulation, our test shows varying sensitivity to different levels of spatial interaction depending on the scale parameter of the Cauchy weight function. Tests with different parameter values can be combined to create a Bonferroni-corrected omnibus test, which is almost always more powerful than the popular L-test and the Clark-Evans test for detecting heterogeneous and aggregated alternatives, although less powerful than the L-test for detecting regular alternatives. The simplicity of empirical characteristic function makes it straightforward to extend our test to non-rectangular or sparsely sampled point patterns.</p></details> | 24 pages, 4 figures |

While MLLMs have been extensively studied for visual semantic understanding tasks, their ability to perform precise and quantitative spatial-temporal understanding in real-world applications remains largely unexamined, leading to uncertain prospects. To evaluate models' Spatial-Temporal Intelligence, we introduce STI-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs' spatial-temporal understanding through challenging tasks such as estimating and predicting the appearance, pose, displacement, and motion of objects. Our benchmark encompasses a wide range of robot and vehicle operations across desktop, indoor, and outdoor scenarios. The extensive experiments reveals that the state-of-the-art MLLMs still struggle in real-world spatial-temporal understanding, especially in tasks requiring precise distance estimation and motion analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[Two-stage Estimators for Spatial Confounding with Point-Referenced Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09358v3)** | 2025-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Public health data are often spatially dependent, but standard spatial regression methods can suffer from bias and invalid inference when the independent variable is associated with spatially-correlated residuals. This could occur if, for example, there is an unmeasured environmental contaminant associated with the independent and outcome variables in a spatial regression analysis. Geoadditive structural equation modeling (gSEM), in which an estimated spatial trend is removed from both the explanatory and response variables before estimating the parameters of interest, has previously been proposed as a solution, but there has been little investigation of gSEM's properties with point-referenced data. We link gSEM to results on double machine learning and semiparametric regression based on two-stage procedures. We propose using these semiparametric estimators for spatial regression using Gaussian processes with Mat\`ern covariance to estimate the spatial trends, and term this class of estimators Double Spatial Regression (DSR). We derive regularity conditions for root-$n$ asymptotic normality and consistency and closed-form variance estimation, and show that in simulations where standard spatial regression estimators are highly biased and have poor coverage, DSR can mitigate bias more effectively than competitors and obtain nominal coverage.</p></details> |  |
| **[A spatial hypergraph model to smoothly interpolate between pairwise graphs and hypergraphs to study higher-order structures](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12688v2)** | 2025-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a spatial graph and hypergraph model that smoothly interpolates between a graph with purely pairwise edges and a graph where all connections are in large hyperedges. The key component is a spatial clustering resolution parameter that varies between assigning all the vertices in a spatial region to individual clusters, resulting in the pairwise case, to assigning all the vertices in a spatial region to a single cluster, which results in the large hyperedge case. An important outcome of this model is that the spatial structure is invariant to the choice of hyperedges. Consequently, this model enables us to study clustering coefficients, graph diffusion, and epidemic spread and how their behavior changes as a function of the higher-order structure in the network with a fixed spatial substrate. We hope that our model will find future uses to distill or explain other behaviors in higher-order networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, 17 figures, preprint for PloS One Submission.

| **[SVG-IR: Spatially-Varying Gaussian Splatting for Inverse Rendering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06815v1)** | 2025-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reconstructing 3D assets from images, known as inverse rendering (IR), remains a challenging task due to its ill-posed nature. 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated impressive capabilities for novel view synthesis (NVS) tasks. Methods apply it to relighting by separating radiance into BRDF parameters and lighting, yet produce inferior relighting quality with artifacts and unnatural indirect illumination due to the limited capability of each Gaussian, which has constant material parameters and normal, alongside the absence of physical constraints for indirect lighting. In this paper, we present a novel framework called Spatially-vayring Gaussian Inverse Rendering (SVG-IR), aimed at enhancing both NVS and relighting quality. To this end, we propose a new representation-Spatially-varying Gaussian (SVG)-that allows per-Gaussian spatially varying parameters. This enhanced representation is complemented by a SVG splatting scheme akin to vertex/fragment shading in traditional graphics pipelines. Furthermore, we integrate a physically-based indirect lighting model, enabling more realistic relighting. The proposed SVG-IR framework significantly improves rendering quality, outperforming state-of-the-art NeRF-based methods by 2.5 dB in peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and surpassing existing Gaussian-based techniques by 3.5 dB in relighting tasks, all while maintaining a real-time rendering speed.</p></details> |  |
| **[Show and Tell: Visually Explainable Deep Neural Nets via Spatially-Aware Concept Bottleneck Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20134v3)** | 2025-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern deep neural networks have now reached human-level performance across a variety of tasks. However, unlike humans they lack the ability to explain their decisions by showing where and telling what concepts guided them. In this work, we present a unified framework for transforming any vision neural network into a spatially and conceptually interpretable model. We introduce a spatially-aware concept bottleneck layer that projects "black-box" features of pre-trained backbone models into interpretable concept maps, without requiring human labels. By training a classification layer over this bottleneck, we obtain a self-explaining model that articulates which concepts most influenced its prediction, along with heatmaps that ground them in the input image. Accordingly, we name this method "Spatially-Aware and Label-Free Concept Bottleneck Model" (SALF-CBM). Our results show that the proposed SALF-CBM: (1) Outperforms non-spatial CBM methods, as well as the original backbone, on a variety of classification tasks; (2) Produces high-quality spatial explanations, outperforming widely used heatmap-based methods on a zero-shot segmentation task; (3) Facilitates model exploration and debugging, enabling users to query specific image regions and refine the model's decisions by locally editing its concept maps.</p></details> |  |
| **[STaR: Seamless Spatial-Temporal Aware Motion Retargeting with Penetration and Consistency Constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06504v1)** | 2025-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motion retargeting seeks to faithfully replicate the spatio-temporal motion characteristics of a source character onto a target character with a different body shape. Apart from motion semantics preservation, ensuring geometric plausibility and maintaining temporal consistency are also crucial for effective motion retargeting. However, many existing methods prioritize either geometric plausibility or temporal consistency. Neglecting geometric plausibility results in interpenetration while neglecting temporal consistency leads to motion jitter. In this paper, we propose a novel sequence-to-sequence model for seamless Spatial-Temporal aware motion Retargeting (STaR), with penetration and consistency constraints. STaR consists of two modules: (1) a spatial module that incorporates dense shape representation and a novel limb penetration constraint to ensure geometric plausibility while preserving motion semantics, and (2) a temporal module that utilizes a temporal transformer and a novel temporal consistency constraint to predict the entire motion sequence at once while enforcing multi-level trajectory smoothness. The seamless combination of the two modules helps us achieve a good balance between the semantic, geometric, and temporal targets. Extensive experiments on the Mixamo and ScanRet datasets demonstrate that our method produces plausible and coherent motions while significantly reducing interpenetration rates compared with other approaches.</p></details> | 12 pages, 9 figures; |
| **[Isotropy testing in spatial point patterns: nonparametric versus parametric replication under misspecification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19633v2)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Several hypothesis testing methods have been proposed to validate the assumption of isotropy in spatial point patterns. A majority of these methods are characterised by an unknown distribution of the test statistic under the null hypothesis of isotropy. Parametric approaches to approximating the distribution involve simulation of patterns from a user-specified isotropic model. Alternatively, nonparametric replicates of the test statistic under isotropy can be used to waive the need for specifying a model. In this paper, we first present a general framework which allows for the integration of a selected nonparametric replication method into isotropy testing. We then conduct a large simulation study comprising application-like scenarios to assess the performance of tests with different parametric and nonparametric replication methods. In particular, we explore distortions in test size and power caused by model misspecification, and demonstrate the advantages of nonparametric replication in such scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 13 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[MM-STFlowNet: A Transportation Hub-Oriented Multi-Mode Passenger Flow Prediction Method via Spatial-Temporal Dynamic Graph Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06325v1)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate and refined passenger flow prediction is essential for optimizing the collaborative management of multiple collection and distribution modes in large-scale transportation hubs. Traditional methods often focus only on the overall passenger volume, neglecting the interdependence between different modes within the hub. To address this limitation, we propose MM-STFlowNet, a comprehensive multi-mode prediction framework grounded in dynamic spatial-temporal graph modeling. Initially, an integrated temporal feature processing strategy is implemented using signal decomposition and convolution techniques to address data spikes and high volatility. Subsequently, we introduce the Spatial-Temporal Dynamic Graph Convolutional Recurrent Network (STDGCRN) to capture detailed spatial-temporal dependencies across multiple traffic modes, enhanced by an adaptive channel attention mechanism. Finally, the self-attention mechanism is applied to incorporate various external factors, further enhancing prediction accuracy. Experiments on a real-world dataset from Guangzhounan Railway Station in China demonstrate that MM-STFlowNet achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly during peak periods, providing valuable insight for transportation hub management.</p></details> |  |
| **[How to Enable LLM with 3D Capacity? A Survey of Spatial Reasoning in LLM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05786v1)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D spatial understanding is essential in real-world applications such as robotics, autonomous vehicles, virtual reality, and medical imaging. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs), having demonstrated remarkable success across various domains, have been leveraged to enhance 3D understanding tasks, showing potential to surpass traditional computer vision methods. In this survey, we present a comprehensive review of methods integrating LLMs with 3D spatial understanding. We propose a taxonomy that categorizes existing methods into three branches: image-based methods deriving 3D understanding from 2D visual data, point cloud-based methods working directly with 3D representations, and hybrid modality-based methods combining multiple data streams. We systematically review representative methods along these categories, covering data representations, architectural modifications, and training strategies that bridge textual and 3D modalities. Finally, we discuss current limitations, including dataset scarcity and computational challenges, while highlighting promising research directions in spatial perception, multi-modal fusion, and real-world applications.</p></details> | 9 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Security Risks in Vision-Based Beam Prediction: From Spatial Proxy Attacks to Feature Refinement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05222v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid evolution towards the sixth-generation (6G) networks demands advanced beamforming techniques to address challenges in dynamic, high-mobility scenarios, such as vehicular communications. Vision-based beam prediction utilizing RGB camera images emerges as a promising solution for accurate and responsive beam selection. However, reliance on visual data introduces unique vulnerabilities, particularly susceptibility to adversarial attacks, thus potentially compromising beam accuracy and overall network reliability. In this paper, we conduct the first systematic exploration of adversarial threats specifically targeting vision-based mmWave beam selection systems. Traditional white-box attacks are impractical in this context because ground-truth beam indices are inaccessible and spatial dynamics are complex. To address this, we propose a novel black-box adversarial attack strategy, termed Spatial Proxy Attack (SPA), which leverages spatial correlations between user positions and beam indices to craft effective perturbations without requiring access to model parameters or labels. To counteract these adversarial vulnerabilities, we formulate an optimization framework aimed at simultaneously enhancing beam selection accuracy under clean conditions and robustness against adversarial perturbations. We introduce a hybrid deep learning architecture integrated with a dedicated Feature Refinement Module (FRM), designed to systematically filter irrelevant, noisy and adversarially perturbed visual features. Evaluations using standard backbone models such as ResNet-50 and MobileNetV2 demonstrate that our proposed method significantly improves performance, achieving up to an +21.07\% gain in Top-K accuracy under clean conditions and a 41.31\% increase in Top-1 adversarial robustness compared to different baseline models.</p></details> |  |
| **[ABCDWaveNet: Advancing Robust Road Ponding Detection in Fog through Dynamic Frequency-Spatial Synergy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05112v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Road ponding presents a significant threat to vehicle safety, particularly in adverse fog conditions, where reliable detection remains a persistent challenge for Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS). To address this, we propose ABCDWaveNet, a novel deep learning framework leveraging Dynamic Frequency-Spatial Synergy for robust ponding detection in fog. The core of ABCDWaveNet achieves this synergy by integrating dynamic convolution for adaptive feature extraction across varying visibilities with a wavelet-based module for synergistic frequency-spatial feature enhancement, significantly improving robustness against fog interference. Building on this foundation, ABCDWaveNet captures multi-scale structural and contextual information, subsequently employing an Adaptive Attention Coupling Gate (AACG) to adaptively fuse global and local features for enhanced accuracy. To facilitate realistic evaluations under combined adverse conditions, we introduce the Foggy Low-Light Puddle dataset. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ABCDWaveNet establishes new state-of-the-art performance, achieving significant Intersection over Union (IoU) gains of 3.51%, 1.75%, and 1.03% on the Foggy-Puddle, Puddle-1000, and our Foggy Low-Light Puddle datasets, respectively. Furthermore, its processing speed of 25.48 FPS on an NVIDIA Jetson AGX Orin confirms its suitability for ADAS deployment. These findings underscore the effectiveness of the proposed Dynamic Frequency-Spatial Synergy within ABCDWaveNet, offering valuable insights for developing proactive road safety solutions capable of operating reliably in challenging weather conditions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Agent Journey Beyond RGB: Unveiling Hybrid Semantic-Spatial Environmental Representations for Vision-and-Language Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06465v4)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Navigating unseen environments based on natural language instructions remains difficult for egocentric agents in Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN). Existing approaches primarily rely on RGB images for environmental representation, underutilizing latent textual semantic and spatial cues and leaving the modality gap between instructions and scarce environmental representations unresolved. Intuitively, humans inherently ground semantic knowledge within spatial layouts during indoor navigation. Inspired by this, we propose a versatile Semantic Understanding and Spatial Awareness (SUSA) architecture to encourage agents to ground environment from diverse perspectives. SUSA includes a Textual Semantic Understanding (TSU) module, which narrows the modality gap between instructions and environments by generating and associating the descriptions of environmental landmarks in agent's immediate surroundings. Additionally, a Depth-enhanced Spatial Perception (DSP) module incrementally constructs a depth exploration map, enabling a more nuanced comprehension of environmental layouts. Experiments demonstrate that SUSA's hybrid semantic-spatial representations effectively enhance navigation performance, setting new state-of-the-art performance across three VLN benchmarks (REVERIE, R2R, and SOON). The source code will be publicly available.</p></details> | <details><summary>A tec...</summary><p>A technical report consisting of 16 pages, 12 figures, 11 tables</p></details> |
| **[Learning Spatial-Semantic Features for Robust Video Object Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07760v2)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tracking and segmenting multiple similar objects with distinct or complex parts in long-term videos is particularly challenging due to the ambiguity in identifying target components and the confusion caused by occlusion, background clutter, and changes in appearance or environment over time. In this paper, we propose a robust video object segmentation framework that learns spatial-semantic features and discriminative object queries to address the above issues. Specifically, we construct a spatial-semantic block comprising a semantic embedding component and a spatial dependency modeling part for associating global semantic features and local spatial features, providing a comprehensive target representation. In addition, we develop a masked cross-attention module to generate object queries that focus on the most discriminative parts of target objects during query propagation, alleviating noise accumulation to ensure effective long-term query propagation. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark data sets, including the DAVIS2017 test (\textbf{87.8\%}), YoutubeVOS 2019 (\textbf{88.1\%}), MOSE val (\textbf{74.0\%}), and LVOS test (\textbf{73.0\%}), and demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization capacity of our model.

| **[Memory-efficient Low-latency Remote Photoplethysmography through Temporal-Spatial State Space Duality](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01774v2)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG), enabling non-contact physiological monitoring through facial light reflection analysis, faces critical computational bottlenecks as deep learning introduces performance gains at the cost of prohibitive resource demands. This paper proposes ME-rPPG, a memory-efficient algorithm built on temporal-spatial state space duality, which resolves the trilemma of model scalability, cross-dataset generalization, and real-time constraints. Leveraging a transferable state space, ME-rPPG efficiently captures subtle periodic variations across facial frames while maintaining minimal computational overhead, enabling training on extended video sequences and supporting low-latency inference. Achieving cross-dataset MAEs of 5.38 (MMPD), 0.70 (VitalVideo), and 0.25 (PURE), ME-rPPG outperforms all baselines with improvements ranging from 21.3% to 60.2%. Our solution enables real-time inference with only 3.6 MB memory usage and 9.46 ms latency -- surpassing existing methods by 19.5%-49.7% accuracy and 43.2% user satisfaction gains in real-world deployments. The code and demos are released for reproducibility on https://health-hci-group.github.io/ME-rPPG-demo/.</p></details> |  |
| **[NuScenes-SpatialQA: A Spatial Understanding and Reasoning Benchmark for Vision-Language Models in Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03164v2)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong potential for autonomous driving tasks. However, their spatial understanding and reasoning-key capabilities for autonomous driving-still exhibit significant limitations. Notably, none of the existing benchmarks systematically evaluate VLMs' spatial reasoning capabilities in driving scenarios. To fill this gap, we propose NuScenes-SpatialQA, the first large-scale ground-truth-based Question-Answer (QA) benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the spatial understanding and reasoning capabilities of VLMs in autonomous driving. Built upon the NuScenes dataset, the benchmark is constructed through an automated 3D scene graph generation pipeline and a QA generation pipeline. The benchmark systematically evaluates VLMs' performance in both spatial understanding and reasoning across multiple dimensions. Using this benchmark, we conduct extensive experiments on diverse VLMs, including both general and spatial-enhanced models, providing the first comprehensive evaluation of their spatial capabilities in autonomous driving. Surprisingly, the experimental results show that the spatial-enhanced VLM outperforms in qualitative QA but does not demonstrate competitiveness in quantitative QA. In general, VLMs still face considerable challenges in spatial understanding and reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Data Spatial Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15812v4)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a novel programming model, Data Spatial Programming, which extends the semantics of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) by introducing new class-like constructs called archetypes. These archetypes encapsulate the topological relationships between data entities and the execution flow in a structured manner, enabling more expressive and semantically rich computations over interconnected data structures or finite states. By formalizing the relationships between data elements in this topological space, our approach allows for more intuitive modeling of complex systems where a topology of connections is formed for the underlying computational model. This paradigm addresses limitations in traditional OOP when representing a wide range of problems in computer science such as agent-based systems, social networks, processing on relational data, neural networks, distributed systems, finite state machines, and other spatially-oriented computational problems.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, 40 pages with appendix</p></details> |
| **[Classification of ADHD and Healthy Children Using EEG Based Multi-Band Spatial Features Enhancement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04664v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a common neurodevelopmental disorder in children, characterized by difficulties in attention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity. Early and accurate diagnosis of ADHD is critical for effective intervention and management. Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals have emerged as a non-invasive and efficient tool for ADHD detection due to their high temporal resolution and ability to capture neural dynamics. In this study, we propose a method for classifying ADHD and healthy children using EEG data from the benchmark dataset. There were 61 children with ADHD and 60 healthy children, both boys and girls, aged 7 to 12. The EEG signals, recorded from 19 channels, were processed to extract Power Spectral Density (PSD) and Spectral Entropy (SE) features across five frequency bands, resulting in a comprehensive 190-dimensional feature set. To evaluate the classification performance, a Support Vector Machine (SVM) with the RBF kernel demonstrated the best performance with a mean cross-validation accuracy of 99.2\% and a standard deviation of 0.0079, indicating high robustness and precision. These results highlight the potential of spatial features in conjunction with machine learning for accurately classifying ADHD using EEG data. This work contributes to developing non-invasive, data-driven tools for early diagnosis and assessment of ADHD in children.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Scale Diffusion: Enhancing Spatial Layout in High-Resolution Panoramic Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18830v2)** | 2025-04-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have recently gained recognition for generating diverse and high-quality content, especially in image synthesis. These models excel not only in creating fixed-size images but also in producing panoramic images. However, existing methods often struggle with spatial layout consistency when producing high-resolution panoramas due to the lack of guidance on the global image layout. This paper introduces the Multi-Scale Diffusion (MSD), an optimized framework that extends the panoramic image generation framework to multiple resolution levels. Our method leverages gradient descent techniques to incorporate structural information from low-resolution images into high-resolution outputs. Through comprehensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations against prior work, we demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the coherence of high-resolution panorama generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Point, the Vision and the Text: Does Point Cloud Boost Spatial Reasoning of Large Language Models?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04540v1)** | 2025-04-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D Large Language Models (LLMs) leveraging spatial information in point clouds for 3D spatial reasoning attract great attention. Despite some promising results, the role of point clouds in 3D spatial reasoning remains under-explored. In this work, we comprehensively evaluate and analyze these models to answer the research question: \textit{Does point cloud truly boost the spatial reasoning capacities of 3D LLMs?} We first evaluate the spatial reasoning capacity of LLMs with different input modalities by replacing the point cloud with the visual and text counterparts. We then propose a novel 3D QA (Question-answering) benchmark, ScanReQA, that comprehensively evaluates models' understanding of binary spatial relationships. Our findings reveal several critical insights: 1) LLMs without point input could even achieve competitive performance even in a zero-shot manner; 2) existing 3D LLMs struggle to comprehend the binary spatial relationships; 3) 3D LLMs exhibit limitations in exploiting the structural coordinates in point clouds for fine-grained spatial reasoning. We think these conclusions can help the next step of 3D LLMs and also offer insights for foundation models in other modalities. We release datasets and reproducible codes in the anonymous project page: https://3d-llm.xyz.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatial-Geometry Enhanced 3D Dynamic Snake Convolutional Neural Network for Hyperspectral Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04463v1)** | 2025-04-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep neural networks face several challenges in hyperspectral image classification, including complex and sparse ground object distributions, small clustered structures, and elongated multi-branch features that often lead to missing detections. To better adapt to ground object distributions and achieve adaptive dynamic feature responses while skipping redundant information, this paper proposes a Spatial-Geometry Enhanced 3D Dynamic Snake Network (SG-DSCNet) based on an improved 3D-DenseNet model. The network employs Dynamic Snake Convolution (DSCConv), which introduces deformable offsets to enhance kernel flexibility through constrained self-learning, thereby improving regional perception of ground objects. Additionally, we propose a multi-view feature fusion strategy that generates multiple morphological kernel templates from DSCConv to observe target structures from different perspectives and achieve efficient feature fusion through summarizing key characteristics. This dynamic approach enables the model to focus more flexibly on critical spatial structures when processing different regions, rather than relying on fixed receptive fields of single static kernels. The DSC module enhances model representation capability through dynamic kernel aggregation without increasing network depth or width. Experimental results demonstrate superior performance on the IN, UP, and KSC datasets, outperforming mainstream hyperspectral classification methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[STPro: Spatial and Temporal Progressive Learning for Weakly Supervised Spatio-Temporal Grounding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20678v2)** | 2025-04-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work we study Weakly Supervised Spatio-Temporal Video Grounding (WSTVG), a challenging task of localizing subjects spatio-temporally in videos using only textual queries and no bounding box supervision. Inspired by recent advances in vision-language foundation models, we investigate their utility for WSTVG, leveraging their zero-shot grounding capabilities. However, we find that a simple adaptation lacks essential spatio-temporal grounding abilities. To bridge this gap, we introduce Tubelet Referral Grounding (TRG), which connects textual queries to tubelets to enable spatio-temporal predictions. Despite its promise, TRG struggles with compositional action understanding and dense scene scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose STPro, a novel progressive learning framework with two key modules: (1) Sub-Action Temporal Curriculum Learning (SA-TCL), which incrementally builds compositional action understanding, and (2) Congestion-Guided Spatial Curriculum Learning (CG-SCL), which adapts the model to complex scenes by spatially increasing task difficulty. STPro achieves state-of-the-art results on three benchmark datasets, with improvements of 1.0% on VidSTG-Declarative and 3.0% on HCSTVG-v1.</p></details> | CVPR'25 Conference |
| **[RoboSpatial: Teaching Spatial Understanding to 2D and 3D Vision-Language Models for Robotics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16537v4)** | 2025-04-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial understanding is a crucial capability that enables robots to perceive their surroundings, reason about their environment, and interact with it meaningfully. In modern robotics, these capabilities are increasingly provided by vision-language models. However, these models face significant challenges in spatial reasoning tasks, as their training data are based on general-purpose image datasets that often lack sophisticated spatial understanding. For example, datasets frequently do not capture reference frame comprehension, yet effective spatial reasoning requires understanding whether to reason from ego-, world-, or object-centric perspectives. To address this issue, we introduce RoboSpatial, a large-scale dataset for spatial understanding in robotics. It consists of real indoor and tabletop scenes, captured as 3D scans and egocentric images, and annotated with rich spatial information relevant to robotics. The dataset includes 1M images, 5k 3D scans, and 3M annotated spatial relationships, and the pairing of 2D egocentric images with 3D scans makes it both 2D- and 3D- ready. Our experiments show that models trained with RoboSpatial outperform baselines on downstream tasks such as spatial affordance prediction, spatial relationship prediction, and robot manipulation.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025 (Oral); Project Website: https://chanh.ee/RoboSpatial</p></details> |
| **[Spatially-Heterogeneous Causal Bayesian Networks for Seismic Multi-Hazard Estimation: A Variational Approach with Gaussian Processes and Normalizing Flows](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04013v1)** | 2025-04-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Post-earthquake hazard and impact estimation are critical for effective disaster response, yet current approaches face significant limitations. Traditional models employ fixed parameters regardless of geographical context, misrepresenting how seismic effects vary across diverse landscapes, while remote sensing technologies struggle to distinguish between co-located hazards. We address these challenges with a spatially-aware causal Bayesian network that decouples co-located hazards by modeling their causal relationships with location-specific parameters. Our framework integrates sensing observations, latent variables, and spatial heterogeneity through a novel combination of Gaussian Processes with normalizing flows, enabling us to capture how same earthquake produces different effects across varied geological and topographical features. Evaluations across three earthquakes demonstrate Spatial-VCBN achieves Area Under the Curve (AUC) improvements of up to 35.2% over existing methods. These results highlight the critical importance of modeling spatial heterogeneity in causal mechanisms for accurate disaster assessment, with direct implications for improving emergency response resource allocation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Going green across boundaries: Spatial effects of environmental policies on tourism flows](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03608v1)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study investigates the relationship between environmental sustainability policies and tourism flows across Italian provinces using a Spatial Durbin Error Model (SDEM) within a gravity framework. By incorporating both public and corporate environmental initiatives, the analysis highlights the direct and spatial spillover effects of sustainability measures on tourism demand. The findings indicate that corporate-led initiatives, such as ecocertifications and green investments, exert a stronger direct influence on tourism flows compared to public measures, underscoring the visibility and immediate impact of private sector actions. However, both types of initiatives generate significant positive spatial spillovers, suggesting that sustainability efforts extend beyond local boundaries. These results demonstrate the interconnected nature of regional tourism systems and emphasize the critical role of coordinated sustainability policies in fostering tourism growth while promoting environmental protection.

Specifically, our work explores to provide a general representation to boost the temporal matching ability in various downstream tracking tasks. To achieve this, we firstly find that a simple extension of MAE, which randomly masks out frame patches in videos and reconstruct the frame pixels, heavily relies on spatial cues while ignoring temporal relations for frame reconstruction, thus leading to sub-optimal temporal matching representations. To alleviate this, we propose DropMAE, which adaptively performs spatial-attention dropout in the frame reconstruction to facilitate temporal correspondence learning in videos. We obtain several important findings with DropMAE: 1) DropMAE is a strong and efficient temporal matching learner, which achieves better fine-tuning results on matching-based tasks than the ImageNet-based MAE with 2x faster pre-training speed. 2) DropMAE is effective for different tracking tasks, i.e., object-level matching tasks including VOT and VOS, dense tracking tasks including optical flow estimation and tracking any point (TAP), and even 3D tracking in the different modality of point cloud data. Since none exists, we build ViT-based trackers for different downstream tracking tasks, and our pre-trained DropMAE model can be directly loaded in these ViT-based trackers for fine-tuning without further modifications. Experiments on 6 downstream tracking tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of DropMAE as a general pre-trained representation for diverse tracking tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exten...</summary><p>Extension of DropMAE for 6 temporal matching-based downstream tasks</p></details> |

Compared to previous work, our Flow MAtching Postprocessing (FMAP) better represents the correlation structures of the observations distribution, while also improving marginal performance at the stations. FMAP generates forecasts that are not bound to what is already modeled by the underlying gridded prediction and can infer new correlation structures from data. The resulting model can generate an arbitrary number of forecasts from a limited number of numerical simulations, allowing for low-cost forecasting systems. A single training is sufficient to perform postprocessing at multiple lead times, in contrast with other methods which use multiple trained networks at generation time. This work details our methodology, including a spatial attention transformer backbone trained within a flow matching generative modeling framework. FMAP shows promising performance in experiments on the EUPPBench dataset, forecasting surface temperature and wind gust values at station locations in western Europe up to five-day lead times.</p></details> | 16 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Coherent Disaggregation and Uncertainty Quantification for Spatially Misaligned Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10584v3)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial misalignment problems arise from both data aggregation and attempts to align misaligned data, leading to information loss. We propose a Bayesian disaggregation framework that links misaligned data to a continuous domain model using an iteratively linearised integration method via integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA). The framework supports point pattern and aggregated count models under four covariate field scenarios: \textit{Raster at Full Resolution (RastFull), Raster Aggregation (RastAgg), Polygon Aggregation (PolyAgg), and Point Values (PointVal)}. The first three involve aggregation, while the latter two have incomplete fields. For PolyAgg and PointVal, we estimate the full covariate field using \textit{Value Plugin, Joint Uncertainty, and Uncertainty Plugin} methods, with the latter two accounting for uncertainty propagation. These methods demonstrate superior performance, and remain more robust even under model misspecification (i.e.\ modelling a nonlinear field as linear). In landslide studies, landslide occurrences are often aggregated into counts based on slope units, reducing spatial detail. The results indicate that point pattern observations and full-resolution covariate fields should be prioritized. For incomplete fields, methods incorporating uncertainty propagation are preferred. This framework supports landslide susceptibility and other spatial mapping, integrating seamlessly with INLA-extension packages.</p></details> | 103 pages |
| **[Electromyography-Based Gesture Recognition: Hierarchical Feature Extraction for Enhanced Spatial-Temporal Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03221v1)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hand gesture recognition using multichannel surface electromyography (sEMG) is challenging due to unstable predictions and inefficient time-varying feature enhancement. To overcome the lack of signal based time-varying feature problems, we propose a lightweight squeeze-excitation deep learning-based multi stream spatial temporal dynamics time-varying feature extraction approach to build an effective sEMG-based hand gesture recognition system. Each branch of the proposed model was designed to extract hierarchical features, capturing both global and detailed spatial-temporal relationships to ensure feature effectiveness. The first branch, utilizing a Bidirectional-TCN (Bi-TCN), focuses on capturing long-term temporal dependencies by modelling past and future temporal contexts, providing a holistic view of gesture dynamics. The second branch, incorporating a 1D Convolutional layer, separable CNN, and Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) block, efficiently extracts spatial-temporal features while emphasizing critical feature channels, enhancing feature relevance. The third branch, combining a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) and Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM), captures bidirectional temporal relationships and time-varying patterns. Outputs from all branches are fused using concatenation to capture subtle variations in the data and then refined with a channel attention module, selectively focusing on the most informative features while improving computational efficiency. The proposed model was tested on the Ninapro DB2, DB4, and DB5 datasets, achieving accuracy rates of 96.41%, 92.40%, and 93.34%, respectively. These results demonstrate the capability of the system to handle complex sEMG dynamics, offering advancements in prosthetic limb control and human-machine interface technologies with significant implications for assistive technologies.</p></details> |  |

However, while these models can generate realistic captions, they often struggle with providing precise instructions, particularly when it comes to localizing and disambiguating objects in complex 3D environments. This capability is critical as MLLMs become more integrated with collaborative robotic systems. In scenarios where a target object is surrounded by similar objects (distractors), robots must deliver clear, spatially-aware instructions to guide humans effectively. We refer to this challenge as contextual object localization and disambiguation, which imposes stricter constraints than conventional 3D dense captioning, especially regarding ensuring target exclusivity. In response, we propose simple yet effective techniques to enhance the model's ability to localize and disambiguate target objects. Our approach not only achieves state-of-the-art performance on conventional metrics that evaluate sentence similarity, but also demonstrates improved 3D spatial understanding through 3D visual grounding model.</p></details> | ICRA 2025 |

Building on DSP's paradigm shift from data-to-compute to compute-to-data, we formalize additional intrinsic language constructs that abstract persistent state, multi-user contexts, multiple entry points, and cross-machine distribution for applications. By introducing a globally accessible root node and treating walkers as potential entry points, we demonstrate how programs can be written once and executed across scales, from single-user to multi-user, from local to distributed, without modification. These extensions allow developers to focus on domain logic while delegating runtime concerns of persistence, multi-user support, distribution, and API interfacing to the execution environment. Our approach makes scale-agnostic programming a natural extension of the topological semantics of DSP, allowing applications to seamlessly transition from single-user to multi-user scenarios, from ephemeral to persistent execution contexts, and from local to distributed execution environments.</p></details> | 16 pages |
| **[An Anytime Valid Test for Complete Spatial Randomness](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02960v1)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A relevant question when analyzing spatial point patterns is that of spatial randomness. More specifically, before any model can be fit to a point pattern a first step is to test the data for departures from complete spatial randomness (CSR). Traditional techniques employ distance or quadrat counts based methods to test for CSR based on batched data. In this paper, we consider the practical scenario of testing for CSR when the data are available sequentially (i.e., online). We present a sequential testing methodology called as {\em PRe-process} that is based on e-values and is a fast, efficient and nonparametric method. Simulation experiments with the truth departing from CSR in two different scenarios show that the method is effective in capturing inhomogeneity over time. Two real data illustrations considering lung cancer cases in the Chorley-Ribble area, England from 1974 - 1983 and locations of earthquakes in the state of Oklahoma, USA from 2000 - 2011 demonstrate the utility of the PRe-process in sequential testing of CSR.</p></details> |  |
| **[SAT: Dynamic Spatial Aptitude Training for Multimodal Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07755v2)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reasoning about motion and space is a fundamental cognitive capability that is required by multiple real-world applications. While many studies highlight that large multimodal language models (MLMs) struggle to reason about space, they only focus on static spatial relationships, and not dynamic awareness of motion and space, i.e., reasoning about the effect of egocentric and object motions on spatial relationships. Manually annotating such object and camera movements is expensive. Hence, we introduce SAT, a simulated spatial aptitude training dataset comprising both static and dynamic spatial reasoning across 175K question-answer (QA) pairs and 20K scenes. Complementing this, we also construct a small (150 image-QAs) yet challenging dynamic spatial test set using real-world images. Leveraging our SAT datasets and 6 existing static spatial benchmarks, we systematically investigate what improves both static and dynamic spatial awareness. Our results reveal that simulations are surprisingly effective at imparting spatial aptitude to MLMs that translate to real images. We show that perfect annotations in simulation are more effective than existing approaches of pseudo-annotating real images. For instance, SAT training improves a LLaVA-13B model by an average 11% and a LLaVA-Video-7B model by an average 8% on multiple spatial benchmarks, including our real-image dynamic test set and spatial reasoning on long videos -- even outperforming some large proprietary models. While reasoning over static relationships improves with synthetic training data, there is still considerable room for improvement for dynamic reasoning questions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project webpage: https://arijitray.com/SAT/</p></details> |

Multiplexed imaging technologies enable high-resolution spatial characterization of the TME, yet statistical methods for analyzing multi-subject spatial tissue data remain limited. We propose a Bayesian hierarchical model for inferring spatial dependencies in multiplexed imaging datasets across multiple subjects. Our model represents the TME as a multivariate log-Gaussian Cox process, where spatial intensity functions of different cell types are governed by a latent multivariate Gaussian process. By pooling information across subjects, we estimate spatial correlation functions that capture within-type and cross-type dependencies, enabling interpretable inference about disease-specific cellular organization. We validate our method using simulations, demonstrating robustness to latent factor specification and spatial resolution. We apply our approach to two multiplexed imaging datasets: pancreatic cancer and colorectal cancer, revealing distinct spatial organization patterns across disease subtypes and highlighting tumor-immune interactions that differentiate immune-permissive and immune-exclusive microenvironments. These findings provide insight into mechanisms of immune evasion and may inform novel therapeutic strategies. Our approach offers a principled framework for modeling spatial dependencies in multi-subject data, with broader applicability to spatially resolved omics and imaging studies. An R package, available online, implements our methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Noise Calibration and Spatial-Frequency Interactive Network for STEM Image Enhancement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02555v1)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM) enables the observation of atomic arrangements at sub-angstrom resolution, allowing for atomically resolved analysis of the physical and chemical properties of materials. However, due to the effects of noise, electron beam damage, sample thickness, etc, obtaining satisfactory atomic-level images is often challenging. Enhancing STEM images can reveal clearer structural details of materials. Nonetheless, existing STEM image enhancement methods usually overlook unique features in the frequency domain, and existing datasets lack realism and generality. To resolve these issues, in this paper, we develop noise calibration, data synthesis, and enhancement methods for STEM images. We first present a STEM noise calibration method, which is used to synthesize more realistic STEM images. The parameters of background noise, scan noise, and pointwise noise are obtained by statistical analysis and fitting of real STEM images containing atoms. Then we use these parameters to develop a more general dataset that considers both regular and random atomic arrangements and includes both HAADF and BF mode images. Finally, we design a spatial-frequency interactive network for STEM image enhancement, which can explore the information in the frequency domain formed by the periodicity of atomic arrangement. Experimental results show that our data is closer to real STEM images and achieves better enhancement performances together with our network.

Early studies always encounter trade-offs related to sampling rate, bandwidth, field of view, and the simplicity of the optical path. Recent advances in event camera hardware show good potential for its application in visual sound recovery, because of its superior ability in capturing high-frequency signals. However, existing event-based vibration recovery methods are still sub-optimal for sound recovery. In this work, we propose a novel pipeline for non-contact sound recovery, fully utilizing spatial-temporal information from the event stream. We first generate a large training set using a novel simulation pipeline. Then we designed a network that leverages the sparsity of events to capture spatial information and uses Mamba to model long-term temporal information. Lastly, we train a spatial aggregation block to aggregate information from different locations to further improve signal quality. To capture event signals caused by sound waves, we also designed an imaging system using a laser matrix to enhance the gradient and collected multiple data sequences for testing. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world data demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Our p...</summary><p>Our project page: https://yyzq1.github.io/EvMic/</p></details> |

Recent approaches have introduced Region-Language Alignment (RLA) to enhance CLIP's performance in dense multimodal tasks by aligning regional visual representations with corresponding text inputs. However, we find that CLIP ViTs fine-tuned with RLA suffer from notable loss in spatial awareness, which is crucial for dense prediction tasks. To address this, we propose the Spatial Correlation Distillation (SCD) framework, which preserves CLIP's inherent spatial structure and mitigates the above degradation. To further enhance spatial correlations, we introduce a lightweight Refiner that extracts refined correlations directly from CLIP before feeding them into SCD, based on an intriguing finding that CLIP naturally captures high-quality dense features. Together, these components form a robust distillation framework that enables CLIP ViTs to integrate both visual-language and visual-centric improvements, achieving state-of-the-art results across various open-vocabulary dense prediction benchmarks.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |

Using this finding, we derive a discrete stochastic maximal \(L^p\)-regularity estimate for a spatial semidiscretization. Furthermore, we provide a nearly optimal pathwise uniform convergence estimate for this spatial semidiscretization under a wide range of spatial \(L^q\)-norms.</p></details> |  |

We describe toric codes as quantum counterparts of classical two-dimensional spatially-coupled (2D-SC) codes, and introduce spatially-coupled quantum LDPC (SC-QLDPC) codes as a generalization. We use the convolutional structure to represent the parity check matrix of a 2D-SC code as a polynomial in two indeterminates, and derive an algebraic condition that is both necessary and sufficient for a 2D-SC code to be a stabilizer code. This algebraic framework facilitates the construction of new code families. While not the focus of this paper, we note that small memory facilitates physical connectivity of qubits, and it enables local encoding and low-latency windowed decoding. In this paper, we use the algebraic framework to optimize short cycles in the Tanner graph of 2D-SC hypergraph product (HGP) codes that arise from short cycles in either component code. While prior work focuses on QLDPC codes with rate less than 1/10, we construct 2D-SC HGP codes with small memories, higher rates (about 1/3), and superior thresholds.</p></details> | <details><summary>36 pa...</summary><p>36 pages, 10 figures.

The proposed approach explicitly accounts for additive manufacturing uncertainties by modeling material porosity as a spatially correlated stochastic field within a multiphase finite element formulation. A risk-averse objective function, incorporating statistical moments of the design objective, is employed in conjunction with chance constraints that enforce mechanical stability by restricting the probability of exceeding critical stress thresholds. To mitigate the prohibitively high computational cost associated with the large-dimensional uncertainty space and Monte Carlo estimations of the objective function's statistical moments, a second-order Taylor expansion is utilized as a control variate. Furthermore, a continuation-based smoothing strategy is introduced to address the non-differentiability of the chance constraints, ensuring compatibility with gradient-based optimization. The resulting framework achieves computational scalability, remaining agnostic to the dimensionality of the stochastic design space. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated through numerical experiments on two- and three-dimensional thermal break systems for building insulation. The results highlight the framework's capability to solve large-scale, chance-constrained optimal design problems governed by finite element models with uncertain design parameter spaces reaching dimensions in the hundreds of thousands.</p></details> |  |

| **[Benchmarking the Spatial Robustness of DNNs via Natural and Adversarial Localized Corruptions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01632v1)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The robustness of DNNs is a crucial factor in safety-critical applications, particularly in complex and dynamic environments where localized corruptions can arise. While previous studies have evaluated the robustness of semantic segmentation (SS) models under whole-image natural or adversarial corruptions, a comprehensive investigation into the spatial robustness of dense vision models under localized corruptions remained underexplored. This paper fills this gap by introducing specialized metrics for benchmarking the spatial robustness of segmentation models, alongside with an evaluation framework to assess the impact of localized corruptions. Furthermore, we uncover the inherent complexity of characterizing worst-case robustness using a single localized adversarial perturbation. To address this, we propose region-aware multi-attack adversarial analysis, a method that enables a deeper understanding of model robustness against adversarial perturbations applied to specific regions. The proposed metrics and analysis were evaluated on 15 segmentation models in driving scenarios, uncovering key insights into the effects of localized corruption in both natural and adversarial forms. The results reveal that models respond to these two types of threats differently; for instance, transformer-based segmentation models demonstrate notable robustness to localized natural corruptions but are highly vulnerable to adversarial ones and vice-versa for CNN-based models. Consequently, we also address the challenge of balancing robustness to both natural and adversarial localized corruptions by means of ensemble models, thereby achieving a broader threat coverage and improved reliability for dense vision tasks.</p></details> | Under review |

Despite recent progress by large language models (LLMs) across various domains, these models often fail to extend their knowledge to novel compositional scenarios, revealing notable limitations in systematic generalization. There has been an ongoing debate about whether neural networks possess the capacity for systematic generalization, with recent studies suggesting that meta-learning approaches designed for compositionality can significantly enhance this ability. However, these insights have largely been confined to linguistic problems, leaving their applicability to other tasks an open question. In this study, we extend the approach of meta-learning for compositionality to the domain of abstract spatial reasoning. To this end, we introduce $\textit{SYGAR}$-a dataset designed to evaluate the capacity of models to systematically generalize from known geometric transformations (e.g., translation, rotation) of two-dimensional objects to novel combinations of these transformations (e.g., translation+rotation). Our results show that a transformer-based encoder-decoder model, trained via meta-learning for compositionality, can systematically generalize to previously unseen transformation compositions, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art LLMs, including o3-mini, GPT-4o, and Gemini 2.0 Flash, which fail to exhibit similar systematic behavior. Our findings highlight the effectiveness of meta-learning in promoting systematicity beyond linguistic tasks, suggesting a promising direction toward more robust and generalizable models.</p></details> | 30 pages, 14 figures |

Spatial join is a crucial database operation that identifies pairs of objects from two spatial datasets based on spatial relationships. Due to the intensive computational demands, spatial joins are often executed in a distributed manner across clusters. However, current systems fail to recognize similarities in the partitioning of spatial data, leading to redundant computations and increased overhead. Recently, incorporating machine learning optimizations into database operations has enhanced efficiency in traditional joins by predicting optimal strategies. However, applying these optimizations to spatial joins poses challenges due to the complex nature of spatial relationships and the variability of spatial data. This paper introduces SOLAR, scalable distributed spatial joins through learning-based optimization. SOLAR operates through offline and online phases. In the offline phase, it learns balanced spatial partitioning based on the similarities between datasets in query workloads seen so far. In the online phase, when a new join query is received, SOLAR evaluates the similarity between the datasets in the new query and the already-seen workloads using the trained learning model. Then, it decides to either reuse an existing partitioner, avoiding unnecessary computational overhead, or partition from scratch. Our extensive experimental evaluation on real-world datasets demonstrates that SOLAR achieves up to 3.6X speedup in overall join runtime and 2.71X speedup in partitioning time compared to state-of-the-art systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, current in submission to VLDB</p></details> |

Existing enhancement methods primarily focus on spatial-domain processing, neglecting the frequency domain's potential to capture global color distributions and long-range dependencies. To address these limitations, we propose FUSION, a dual-domain deep learning framework that jointly leverages spatial and frequency domain information. FUSION independently processes each RGB channel through multi-scale convolutional kernels and adaptive attention mechanisms in the spatial domain, while simultaneously extracting global structural information via FFT-based frequency attention. A Frequency Guided Fusion module integrates complementary features from both domains, followed by inter-channel fusion and adaptive channel recalibration to ensure balanced color distributions. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets (UIEB, EUVP, SUIM-E) demonstrate that FUSION achieves state-of-the-art performance, consistently outperforming existing methods in reconstruction fidelity (highest PSNR of 23.717 dB and SSIM of 0.883 on UIEB), perceptual quality (lowest LPIPS of 0.112 on UIEB), and visual enhancement metrics (best UIQM of 3.414 on UIEB), while requiring significantly fewer parameters (0.28M) and lower computational complexity, demonstrating its suitability for real-time underwater imaging applications.</p></details> |  |

Current surrogate models fall short in the flexibility of point- or region-based predictions as the entire field reconstruction is required for each parameter setting, hence hindering the efficiency of parameter space exploration. Limitations exist in capturing physical attribute distributions and pinpointing optimal parameter configurations. In this work, we propose Explorable INR, a novel implicit neural representation-based surrogate model, designed to facilitate exploration and allow point-based spatial queries without computing full-scale field data. In addition, to further address computational bottlenecks of spatial exploration, we utilize probabilistic affine forms (PAFs) for uncertainty propagation through Explorable INR to obtain statistical summaries, facilitating various ensemble analysis and visualization tasks that are expensive with existing models. Furthermore, we reformulate the parameter exploration problem as optimization tasks using gradient descent and KL divergence minimization that ensures scalability. We demonstrate that the Explorable INR with the proposed approach for spatial and parameter exploration can significantly reduce computation and memory costs while providing effective ensemble analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics (TVCG)</p></details> |

As the cornerstone for AI agents that function in the physical realm, video-based visual-spatial intelligence (VSI) emerges as one of the most pivotal reasoning capabilities of MLLMs. This work conducts a first, in-depth study on improving the visual-spatial reasoning of MLLMs via R1-Zero-like training. Technically, we first identify that the visual-spatial reasoning capacities of small- to medium-sized Qwen2-VL models cannot be activated via Chain of Thought (CoT) prompts. We then incorporate GRPO training for improved visual-spatial reasoning, using the carefully curated VSI-100k dataset, following DeepSeek-R1-Zero. During the investigation, we identify the necessity to keep the KL penalty (even with a small value) in GRPO. With just 120 GPU hours, our vsGRPO-2B model, fine-tuned from Qwen2-VL-2B, can outperform the base model by 12.1% and surpass GPT-4o. Moreover, our vsGRPO-7B model, fine-tuned from Qwen2-VL-7B, achieves performance comparable to that of the best open-source model LLaVA-NeXT-Video-72B. Additionally, we compare vsGRPO to supervised fine-tuning and direct preference optimization baselines and observe strong performance superiority.

However, most existing methods address these tasks independently, overlooking their inherent correlation and failing to exploit shared feature representations for mutual enhancement. Furthermore, the diverse spectral,spatial, and scale characteristics of buildings pose additional challenges in jointly modeling spatial-spectral multi-scale features and effectively balancing precision and recall. The limited synergy between spatial and spectral representations often results in reduced detection accuracy and incomplete change localization.To address these challenges, we propose a Multi-Scale Spatial-Spectral Feature Cooperative Dual-Task Network (MSSFC-Net) for joint building extraction and change detection in remote sensing images. The framework integrates both tasks within a unified architecture, leveraging their complementary nature to simultaneously extract building and change features. Specifically,a Dual-branch Multi-scale Feature Extraction module (DMFE) with Spatial-Spectral Feature Collaboration (SSFC) is designed to enhance multi-scale representation learning, effectively capturing shallow texture details and deep semantic information, thus improving building extraction performance. For temporal feature aggregation, we introduce a Multi-scale Differential Fusion Module (MDFM) that explicitly models the interaction between differential and dual-temporal features. This module refines the network's capability to detect large-area changes and subtle structural variations in buildings. Extensive experiments conducted on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that MSSFC-Net achieves superior performance in both building extraction and change detection tasks, effectively improving detection accuracy while maintaining completeness.</p></details> |  |

However, they are primarily based on reconstructing pixel-level details on natural videos which have substantial temporal redundancy, limiting their capability for semantic representation and sufficient encoding of motion dynamics. To address these issues, this paper introduces a novel SSL approach for video representation learning, dubbed as SMILE, by infusing both spatial and motion semantics. In SMILE, we leverage image-language pretrained models, such as CLIP, to guide the learning process with their high-level spatial semantics. We enhance the representation of motion by introducing synthetic motion patterns in the training data, allowing the model to capture more complex and dynamic content. Furthermore, using SMILE, we establish a new self-supervised video learning paradigm capable of learning strong video representations without requiring any natural video data. We have carried out extensive experiments on 7 datasets with various downstream scenarios. SMILE surpasses current state-of-the-art SSL methods, showcasing its effectiveness in learning more discriminative and generalizable video representations.

Prior works typically express spatial information through textual representations of coordinates, resulting in semantic gaps between visual coordinate representations and textual descriptions. This oversight hinders the accurate transmission of spatial information and increases the expressive burden. To address this, we propose a novel Marker-based Prompt learning framework (MPDrive), which represents spatial coordinates by concise visual markers, ensuring linguistic expressive consistency and enhancing the accuracy of both visual perception and spatial expression in AD-VQA. Specifically, we create marker images by employing a detection expert to overlay object regions with numerical labels, converting complex textual coordinate generation into straightforward text-based visual marker predictions. Moreover, we fuse original and marker images as scene-level features and integrate them with detection priors to derive instance-level features. By combining these features, we construct dual-granularity visual prompts that stimulate the LLM's spatial perception capabilities. Extensive experiments on the DriveLM and CODA-LM datasets show that MPDrive achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly in cases requiring sophisticated spatial understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2025</p></details> |
| **[Hybrid Global-Local Representation with Augmented Spatial Guidance for Zero-Shot Referring Image Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00356v1)** | 2025-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in zero-shot referring image segmentation (RIS), driven by models such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM) and CLIP, have made substantial progress in aligning visual and textual information. Despite these successes, the extraction of precise and high-quality mask region representations remains a critical challenge, limiting the full potential of RIS tasks. In this paper, we introduce a training-free, hybrid global-local feature extraction approach that integrates detailed mask-specific features with contextual information from the surrounding area, enhancing mask region representation. To further strengthen alignment between mask regions and referring expressions, we propose a spatial guidance augmentation strategy that improves spatial coherence, which is essential for accurately localizing described areas. By incorporating multiple spatial cues, this approach facilitates more robust and precise referring segmentation. Extensive experiments on standard RIS benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing zero-shot RIS models, achieving substantial performance gains. We believe our approach advances RIS tasks and establishes a versatile framework for region-text alignment, offering broader implications for cross-modal understanding and interaction.

However, it is commonly assumed that the relationships between dependent and independent variables are linear. To overcome this limitation, we propose an Artificial Geographically Weighted Neural Network (AGWNN), a novel framework that integrates geographically weighted techniques with neural networks to capture complex nonlinear spatial relationships. Central to this framework is the Geographically Weighted Layer (GWL), a specialized component designed to encode spatial heterogeneity within the neural network architecture. To rigorously evaluate the performance of AGWNN, we conducted comprehensive experiments using both simulated datasets and real-world case studies. Our results demonstrate that AGWNN significantly outperforms traditional GWR and standard Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) in terms of model fitting accuracy. Notably, AGWNN excels in modeling intricate nonlinear relationships and effectively identifies complex spatial heterogeneity patterns, offering a robust and versatile tool for advanced spatial analysis.</p></details> |  |

Recently, holographic multiple-input multiple-output (HMIMO) and meta-surface technology have attracted attention as technologies that maximize space utilization for 6G mobile communications. However, studies on HMIMO communications are still in an initial stage and its fundamental limits are yet to be unveiled. It is well known that the Fourier transform relationship can be obtained using a lens in the optical field, but research to apply it to the mobile communication field is in the early stages. In this paper, we show that the Fourier transform relationship between signals can be obtained when two metasurfaces are aligned or unaligned, and analyze the transmission and reception power, and the maximum number of spatial multimodes that can be transmitted. In addition, to reduce transmission complexity, we propose a spatial multimode transmission system using three metasurfaces and analyze signal characteristics on the meta-surfaces. In numerical results, we provide the performance of spatial multimode transmission in case of using rectangular and Gaussian signals.</p></details> |  |

We develop a hierarchical multi-armed bandit (MAB) framework that efficiently selects APs for simultaneous transmissions across various network topologies, demonstrating reinforcement learning's promise in Wi-Fi settings.

Here, we present a novel in-situ spatiotemporal sequence detector that leverages vertical NAND storage to achieve massively parallel pattern detection. By encoding each cell with two single-transistor-based multi-level cell (MLC) memory elements, such as ferroelectric field-effect transistors (FeFETs), and mapping a pixel's temporal sequence onto consecutive word lines (WLs), we enable direct temporal pattern detection within NAND strings. Each NAND string serves as a dedicated reference for a single pixel, while different blocks store patterns for distinct pixels, allowing large-scale spatial-temporal pattern recognition via simple direct bit-line (BL) sensing, a well-established operation in vertical NAND storage. We experimentally validate our approach at both the cell and array levels, demonstrating that vertical NAND-based detector achieves more than six orders of magnitude improvement in energy efficiency and more than three orders of magnitude reduction in latency compared to conventional CPU-based methods. These findings establish vertical NAND storage as a scalable and energy-efficient solution for next-generation neuromorphic vision processing.</p></details> | 26 pages, 7 figures |

Existing approaches typically emphasize fine-grained extraction of visual features and capturing global information. However, they often overlook the complementary role of textual information in enhancing visual semantics and face challenges in precisely locating objects that are most relevant to the image context. To address these challenges, this paper presents a semantic-spatial feature fusion with dynamic graph refinement (SFDR) method, which integrates the semantic-spatial feature fusion (SSFF) and dynamic graph feature refinement (DGFR) modules. The SSFF module utilizes a multi-level feature representation strategy by leveraging pre-trained CLIP features, grid features, and ROI features to integrate rich semantic and spatial information. In the DGFR module, a graph attention network captures the relationships between feature nodes, while a dynamic weighting mechanism prioritizes objects that are most relevant to the current scene and suppresses less significant ones. Therefore, the proposed SFDR method significantly enhances the quality of the generated descriptions. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Interactive lenses for spatial data, particularly, challenge designers to conceive design strategies to support the analysis of high-density, multifaceted data with spatial referents. Despite their relevance, there is a lack of systematic understanding regarding the various design elements that compose spatially-embedded lens visualizations. To fill in this gap, we unify these components under a common hood in the form of a design space, which we propose in this paper. Building our knowledge on top of the initial insights gained from Tominski et al.'s survey [57], we construct a design space spanning 7 dimensions through our analysis of 45 papers published in the visualization community over the past 15 years. We describe each design dimension through representative examples and examine the range of design choices available within each, discussing their benefits and pitfalls that affect lens performance and usability. In doing so, we offer a cohesive catalog of considerations for designers-both when examining existing lenses and when conceptualizing novel spatially-embedded lens visualizations. We conclude by shedding light on regions of the design space that remain largely understudied, revealing open opportunities for future research.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we rethink that the redundancy in inversion-based image editing exists in both the spatial and temporal dimensions, such as the unnecessary computation in unedited regions and the redundancy in the inversion progress. To tackle these challenges, we propose a practical framework, named EEdit, to achieve efficient image editing. Specifically, we introduce three techniques to solve them one by one. For spatial redundancy, spatial locality caching is introduced to compute the edited region and its neighboring regions while skipping the unedited regions, and token indexing preprocessing is designed to further accelerate the caching. For temporal redundancy, inversion step skipping is proposed to reuse the latent for efficient editing. Our experiments demonstrate an average of 2.46 $\times$ acceleration without performance drop in a wide range of editing tasks including prompt-guided image editing, dragging and image composition.

While supervised methods trained on synthetic noise (e.g., Gaussian/Poisson) suffer from out-of-distribution generalization issues, existing self-supervised approaches degrade under real FMI noise due to oversimplified noise assumptions and computationally intensive deep architectures. In this paper, we propose Fluorescence Micrograph to Self (FM2S), a zero-shot denoiser that achieves efficient FMI denoising through three key innovations: 1) A noise injection module that ensures training data sufficiency through adaptive Poisson-Gaussian synthesis while preserving spatial correlation and global statistics of FMI noise for robust model generalization; 2) A two-stage progressive learning strategy that first recovers structural priors via pre-denoised targets then refines high-frequency details through noise distribution alignment; 3) An ultra-lightweight network (3.5k parameters) enabling rapid convergence with 270$\times$ faster training and inference than SOTAs. Extensive experiments across FMI datasets demonstrate FM2S's superiority: It outperforms CVF-SID by 1.4dB PSNR on average while requiring 0.1% parameters of AP-BSN. Notably, FM2S maintains stable performance across varying noise levels, proving its practicality for microscopy platforms with diverse sensor characteristics.

However, the substantial cost of storage and transmission of vanilla 3DGS hinders its further application (hundreds of megabytes or even gigabytes for a single scene). Motivated by the achievements of prediction in video compression, we introduce the prediction technique into the anchor-based Gaussian representation to effectively reduce the bit rate. Specifically, we propose a spatial condition-based prediction module to utilize the grid-captured scene information for prediction, with a residual compensation strategy designed to learn the missing fine-grained information. Besides, to further compress the residual, we propose an instance-aware hyper prior, developing a structure-aware and instance-aware entropy model. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our prediction-based compression framework and each technical component. Even compared with SOTA compression method, our framework still achieves a bit rate savings of 24.42 percent.

However, the exact characteristics of spatial immersion in the context of visual storytelling remain vague. For example, what are the common design patterns of data stories with spatial immersion? How do they affect the reader's experience? To gain a deeper understanding of the subject, we collected 23 distinct data stories with spatial immersion, and identified six design patterns, such as cinematic camera shots and transitions, intuitive data representations, realism, naturally moving elements, direct manipulation of camera or visualization, and dynamic dimension. Subsequently, we designed four data stories and conducted a crowdsourced user study comparing three design variations (static, animated, and immersive). Our results suggest that data stories with the design patterns for spatial immersion are more interesting and persuasive than static or animated ones, but no single condition was deemed more understandable or trustworthy.</p></details> |  |

Despite this, we observe that the semantic ambiguity between spatial and temporal domains significantly degrades the synthesis stability for the dynamic faces. We argue that aligning the semantic features from spatial and temporal domains is a promising approach to stabilizing facial motion. To achieve this, we propose a Spatial-Temporal Semantic Alignment (STSA) method, which introduces a dual-path alignment mechanism and a differentiable semantic representation. The former leverages a Consistent Information Learning (CIL) module to maximize the mutual information at multiple scales, thereby reducing the manifold differences between spatial and temporal domains. The latter utilizes probabilistic heatmap as ambiguity-tolerant guidance to avoid the abnormal dynamics of the synthesized faces caused by slight semantic jittering. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed STSA, especially in terms of image quality and synthesis stability.

Although advances in deep learning have enabled automatic classification of coral reef conditions, conventional deep models struggle to achieve high performance when processing complex underwater ecological images. Vision foundation models, known for their high accuracy and cross-domain generalizability, offer promising solutions. However, fine-tuning these models requires substantial computational resources and results in high carbon emissions. To address these challenges, adapter learning methods such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) have emerged as a solution. This study introduces an approach integrating the DINOv2 vision foundation model with the LoRA fine-tuning method. The approach leverages multi-temporal field images collected through underwater surveys at 15 dive sites at Koh Tao, Thailand, with all images labeled according to universal standards used in citizen science-based conservation programs. The experimental results demonstrate that the DINOv2-LoRA model achieved superior accuracy, with a match ratio of 64.77%, compared to 60.34% achieved by the best conventional model. Furthermore, incorporating LoRA reduced the trainable parameters from 1,100M to 5.91M. Transfer learning experiments conducted under different temporal and spatial settings highlight the exceptional generalizability of DINOv2-LoRA across different seasons and sites. This study is the first to explore the efficient adaptation of foundation models for multi-label classification of coral reef conditions under multi-temporal and multi-spatial settings. The proposed method advances the classification of coral reef conditions and provides a tool for monitoring, conserving, and managing coral reef ecosystems.</p></details> |  |

To prevent the accumulation of a backlog, this decoder must process syndromes from the quantum device at a faster rate than they are generated. Most prior work on real time decoding has focused on an isolated logical qubit encoded in the surface code. However, for surface code, quantum programs of utility will require multi-qubit interactions performed via lattice surgery. A large merged patch can arise during lattice surgery -- possibly as large as the entire device. This puts a significant strain on a real time decoder, which must decode errors on this merged patch and maintain the level of fault-tolerance that it achieves on isolated logical qubits. These requirements are relaxed by using spatially parallel decoding, which can be accomplished by dividing the physical qubits on the device into multiple overlapping groups and assigning a decoder module to each. We refer to this approach as spatially parallel windows. While previous work has explored similar ideas, none have addressed system-specific considerations pertinent to the task or the constraints from using hardware accelerators. In this work, we demonstrate how to configure spatially parallel windows, so that the scheme (1) is compatible with hardware accelerators, (2) supports general lattice surgery operations, (3) maintains the fidelity of the logical qubits, and (4) meets the throughput requirement for real time decoding. Furthermore, our results reveal the importance of optimally choosing the buffer width to achieve a balance between accuracy and throughput -- a decision that should be influenced by the device's physical noise.</p></details> | <details><summary>Updat...</summary><p>Update to journal version.

Specifically, despite impressive results shown by the mass literature, developers often find it hard to ensure the safe deployment of these learning-based perception models. Attributing the challenge to the lack of safety-oriented metrics, we hereby present uncompromising spatial constraints (USC), which characterize a simple yet important localization requirement demanding the predictions to fully cover the objects when seen from the autonomous vehicle. The constraints, as we formulate using the perspective and bird's-eye views, can be naturally reflected by quantitative measures, such that having an object detector with a higher score implies a lower risk of collision. Finally, beyond model evaluation, we incorporate the quantitative measures into common loss functions to enable safety-oriented fine-tuning for existing models. With experiments using the nuScenes dataset and a closed-loop simulation, our work demonstrates such considerations of safety notions at the perception level not only improve model performances beyond accuracy but also allow for a more direct linkage to actual system safety.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ITSC 2024, 8 pages (IEEE double column format), 7 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

A two-step procedure is employed. Firstly, marginal location-specific distributions are jointly modelled. Secondly, a spatial dependency structure is learned to ensure spatial coherence among these distributions. To learn marginal distributions over rainfall values, we introduce joint generalised neural models which expand generalised linear models with a deep neural network to parameterise a distribution over the outcome space. To understand the spatial dependency structure of the data, a censored latent Gaussian copula model is presented and trained via scoring rules. Leveraging the underlying spatial structure, we construct a distance matrix between locations, transformed into a covariance matrix by a Gaussian Process Kernel depending on a small set of parameters. To estimate these parameters, we propose a general framework for the estimation of Gaussian copulas employing scoring rules as a measure of divergence between distributions. Uniting our two contributions, namely the joint generalised neural model and the censored latent Gaussian copulas into a single model, our probabilistic approach generates forecasts on short to long-term durations, suitable for locations outside the training set. We demonstrate its efficacy using a large UK rainfall data set, outperforming existing methods.</p></details> | 28 pages, 8 figures |

The DAG can be used to devise fast algorithms for posterior sampling of the latent process, but these may exhibit pathological behavior in estimating covariance parameters. In this article, we introduce gridding and parameter expansion methods to improve the practical performance of MCMC algorithms in terms of effective sample size per unit time (ESS/s). Gridding is a model-based strategy that reduces the number of expensive operations necessary during MCMC on irregularly spaced data. Parameter expansion reduces dependence in posterior samples in spatial regression for high resolution data. These two strategies lead to computational gains in the big data settings on which we focus. We consider popular constructions of univariate spatial processes based on Mat\'ern covariance functions and multivariate coregionalization models for Gaussian outcomes in extensive analyses of synthetic datasets comparing with alternative methods. We demonstrate effectiveness of our proposed methods in a forestry application using remotely sensed data from NASA's Goddard LiDAR, Hyper-Spectral, and Thermal imager (G-LiHT).</p></details> |  |

However, while the existing methods have been continuously focusing on several challenges, such as "missing objects" and "mismatched attributes," another critical issue of "mislocated objects" remains where generated spatial positions fail to align with text prompts. Surprisingly, ensuring such seemingly basic functionality remains challenging in popular T2I models due to the inherent difficulty of imposing explicit spatial guidance via text forms. To address this, we propose STORM (Spatial Transport Optimization by Repositioning Attention Map), a novel training-free approach for spatially coherent T2I synthesis. STORM employs Spatial Transport Optimization (STO), rooted in optimal transport theory, to dynamically adjust object attention maps for precise spatial adherence, supported by a Spatial Transport (ST) Cost function that enhances spatial understanding. Our analysis shows that integrating spatial awareness is most effective in the early denoising stages, while later phases refine details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that STORM surpasses existing methods, effectively mitigating mislocated objects while improving missing and mismatched attributes, setting a new benchmark for spatial alignment in T2I synthesis.</p></details> | CVPR2025 |

While approaches such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and rule-based reward mechanisms demonstrate promise in text and image domains, their application to video understanding remains limited. This paper presents a systematic exploration of Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) with GRPO for video MLLMs, aiming to enhance spatio-temporal perception while maintaining general capabilities. Our experiments reveal that RFT is highly data-efficient for task-specific improvements. Through multi-task RFT on spatio-temporal perception objectives with limited samples, we develop VideoChat-R1, a powerful video MLLM that achieves state-of-the-art performance on spatio-temporal perception tasks without sacrificing chat ability, while exhibiting emerging spatio-temporal reasoning abilities. Compared to Qwen2.5-VL-7B, VideoChat-R1 boosts performance several-fold in tasks like temporal grounding (+31.8) and object tracking (+31.2). Additionally, it significantly improves on general QA benchmarks such as VideoMME (+0.9), MVBench (+1.0), and Perception Test (+0.9). Our findings underscore the potential of RFT for specialized task enhancement of Video MLLMs. We hope our work offers valuable insights for future RL research in video MLLMs.</p></details> |  |

The key challenge of accurate prediction is how to model the complex spatio-temporal dependencies and adapt to the inherent dynamics in data. Traditional Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) often struggle with static adjacency matrices that introduce domain bias or learnable matrices that may be overfitting to specific patterns. This challenge becomes more complex when considering Multi-Task Learning (MTL). While MTL has the potential to enhance prediction accuracy through task synergies, it can also face significant hurdles due to task interference. To overcome these challenges, this study introduces a novel MTL framework, Dynamic Group-wise Spatio-Temporal Multi-Task Learning (DG-STMTL). DG-STMTL proposes a hybrid adjacency matrix generation module that combines static matrices with dynamic ones through a task-specific gating mechanism. We also introduce a group-wise GCN module to enhance the modelling capability of spatio-temporal dependencies. We conduct extensive experiments on two real-world datasets to evaluate our method. Results show that our method outperforms other state-of-the-arts, indicating its effectiveness and robustness.</p></details> |  |

Traditional models often rely on parametric kernels, limiting their ability to capture heterogeneous, nonstationary dynamics. Recent innovations integrate deep neural architectures -- either by modeling the conditional intensity function directly or by learning flexible, data-driven influence kernels, substantially broadening their expressive power. This article reviews the development of the deep influence kernel approach, which enjoys statistical explainability, since the influence kernel remains in the model to capture the spatiotemporal propagation of event influence and its impact on future events, while also possessing strong expressive power, thereby benefiting from both worlds. We explain the main components in developing deep kernel point processes, leveraging tools such as functional basis decomposition and graph neural networks to encode complex spatial or network structures, as well as estimation using both likelihood-based and likelihood-free methods, and address computational scalability for large-scale data. We also discuss the theoretical foundation of kernel identifiability. Simulated and real-data examples highlight applications to crime analysis, earthquake aftershock prediction, and sepsis prediction modeling, and we conclude by discussing promising directions for the field.</p></details> |  |

However, it is well known for neglecting structural connections and causality in ROI interactions. Also, FC becomes much more noisy in the short spatio-temporal sliding-window subsequences of fMRI. Effective Connectome (EC) is proposed as a directional alternative, but is difficult to accurately estimate. Furthermore, for optimal GNN performance, usually only a small percentage of the strongest connections are selected as sparse edges, resulting in oversimplification of complex brain connections. To tackle these challenges, we propose the Spatio-Temporal Node Attention Graph Neural Network (STNAGNN) as a data-driven alternative that combines sparse predefined FC with dense data-driven spatio-temporal connections, allowing for flexible and spatio-temporal learning of ROI interaction patterns.</p></details> |  |
| **[SpaceVLLM: Endowing Multimodal Large Language Model with Spatio-Temporal Video Grounding Capability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13983v2)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made remarkable progress in either temporal or spatial localization. However, they struggle to perform spatio-temporal video grounding. This limitation stems from two major challenges. Firstly, it is difficult to extract accurate spatio-temporal information of each frame in the video. Secondly, the substantial number of visual tokens makes it challenging to precisely map visual tokens of each frame to their corresponding spatial coordinates. To address these issues, we introduce SpaceVLLM, a MLLM endowed with spatio-temporal video grounding capability. Specifically, we adopt a set of interleaved Spatio-Temporal Aware Queries to capture temporal perception and dynamic spatial information. Moreover, we propose a Query-Guided Space Decoder to establish a corresponding connection between the queries and spatial coordinates. Additionally, due to the lack of spatio-temporal datasets, we construct the Unified Spatio-Temporal Grounding (Uni-STG) dataset, comprising 480K instances across three tasks. This dataset fully exploits the potential of MLLM to simultaneously facilitate localization in both temporal and spatial dimensions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SpaceVLLM achieves the state-of-the-art performance across 11 benchmarks covering temporal, spatial, spatio-temporal and video understanding tasks, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach. Our code, datasets and model will be released.</p></details> |  |

Inspired by recent advances in vision-language foundation models, we investigate their utility for WSTVG, leveraging their zero-shot grounding capabilities. However, we find that a simple adaptation lacks essential spatio-temporal grounding abilities. To bridge this gap, we introduce Tubelet Referral Grounding (TRG), which connects textual queries to tubelets to enable spatio-temporal predictions. Despite its promise, TRG struggles with compositional action understanding and dense scene scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose STPro, a novel progressive learning framework with two key modules: (1) Sub-Action Temporal Curriculum Learning (SA-TCL), which incrementally builds compositional action understanding, and (2) Congestion-Guided Spatial Curriculum Learning (CG-SCL), which adapts the model to complex scenes by spatially increasing task difficulty. STPro achieves state-of-the-art results on three benchmark datasets, with improvements of 1.0% on VidSTG-Declarative and 3.0% on HCSTVG-v1.</p></details> | CVPR'25 Conference |
| **[DP-LET: An Efficient Spatio-Temporal Network Traffic Prediction Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03792v1)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurately predicting spatio-temporal network traffic is essential for dynamically managing computing resources in modern communication systems and minimizing energy consumption. Although spatio-temporal traffic prediction has received extensive research attention, further improvements in prediction accuracy and computational efficiency remain necessary. In particular, existing decomposition-based methods or hybrid architectures often incur heavy overhead when capturing local and global feature correlations, necessitating novel approaches that optimize accuracy and complexity. In this paper, we propose an efficient spatio-temporal network traffic prediction framework, DP-LET, which consists of a data processing module, a local feature enhancement module, and a Transformer-based prediction module. The data processing module is designed for high-efficiency denoising of network data and spatial decoupling. In contrast, the local feature enhancement module leverages multiple Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs) to capture fine-grained local features. Meanwhile, the prediction module utilizes a Transformer encoder to model long-term dependencies and assess feature relevance. A case study on real-world cellular traffic prediction demonstrates the practicality of DP-LET, which maintains low computational complexity while achieving state-of-the-art performance, significantly reducing MSE by 31.8% and MAE by 23.1% compared to baseline models.</p></details> | 6 pages |
| **[Distributionally Robust Predictive Runtime Verification under Spatio-Temporal Logic Specifications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02964v1)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cyber-physical systems designed in simulators, often consisting of multiple interacting agents, behave differently in the real-world. We would like to verify these systems during runtime when they are deployed. Thus, we propose robust predictive runtime verification (RPRV) algorithms for: (1) general stochastic CPS under signal temporal logic (STL) tasks, and (2) stochastic multi-agent systems (MAS) under spatio-temporal logic tasks. The RPRV problem presents the following challenges: (1) there may not be sufficient data on the behavior of the deployed CPS, (2) predictive models based on design phase system trajectories may encounter distribution shift during real-world deployment, and (3) the algorithms need to scale to the complexity of MAS and be applicable to spatio-temporal logic tasks. To address these challenges, we assume knowledge of an upper bound on the statistical distance (in terms of an f-divergence) between the trajectory distributions of the system at deployment and design time. We are motivated by our prior work [1, 2] where we proposed an accurate and an interpretable RPRV algorithm for general CPS, which we here extend to the MAS setting and spatio-temporal logic tasks. Specifically, we use a learned predictive model to estimate the system behavior at runtime and robust conformal prediction to obtain probabilistic guarantees by accounting for distribution shifts. Building on [1], we perform robust conformal prediction over the robust semantics of spatio-temporal reach and escape logic (STREL) to obtain centralized RPRV algorithms for MAS. We empirically validate our results in a drone swarm simulator, where we show the scalability of our RPRV algorithms to MAS and analyze the impact of different trajectory predictors on the verification result. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first statistically valid algorithms for MAS under distribution shift.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2311.09482</p></details> |
| **[Towards Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning based Traffic Signal Control through Spatio-temporal Hypergraphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11014v2)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic signal control systems (TSCSs) are integral to intelligent traffic management, fostering efficient vehicle flow. Traditional approaches often simplify road networks into standard graphs, which results in a failure to consider the dynamic nature of traffic data at neighboring intersections, thereby neglecting higher-order interconnections necessary for real-time control. To address this, we propose a novel TSCS framework to realize intelligent traffic control. This framework collaborates with multiple neighboring edge computing servers to collect traffic information across the road network. To elevate the efficiency of traffic signal control, we have crafted a multi-agent soft actor-critic (MA-SAC) reinforcement learning algorithm. Within this algorithm, individual agents are deployed at each intersection with a mandate to optimize traffic flow across the road network collectively. Furthermore, we introduce hypergraph learning into the critic network of MA-SAC to enable the spatio-temporal interactions from multiple intersections in the road network. This method fuses hypergraph and spatio-temporal graph structures to encode traffic data and capture the complex spatio-temporal correlations between multiple intersections. Our empirical evaluation, tested on varied datasets, demonstrates the superiority of our framework in minimizing average vehicle travel times and sustaining high-throughput performance. This work facilitates the development of more intelligent urban traffic management solutions.

| **[Decoding Covert Speech from EEG Using a Functional Areas Spatio-Temporal Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03762v1)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Covert speech involves imagining speaking without audible sound or any movements. Decoding covert speech from electroencephalogram (EEG) is challenging due to a limited understanding of neural pronunciation mapping and the low signal-to-noise ratio of the signal. In this study, we developed a large-scale multi-utterance speech EEG dataset from 57 right-handed native English-speaking subjects, each performing covert and overt speech tasks by repeating the same word in five utterances within a ten-second duration. Given the spatio-temporal nature of the neural activation process during speech pronunciation, we developed a Functional Areas Spatio-temporal Transformer (FAST), an effective framework for converting EEG signals into tokens and utilizing transformer architecture for sequence encoding. Our results reveal distinct and interpretable speech neural features by the visualization of FAST-generated activation maps across frontal and temporal brain regions with each word being covertly spoken, providing new insights into the discriminative features of the neural representation of covert speech. This is the first report of such a study, which provides interpretable evidence for speech decoding from EEG. The code for this work has been made public at https://github.com/Jiang-Muyun/FAST</p></details> |  |
| **[DRAN: A Distribution and Relation Adaptive Network for Spatio-temporal Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01531v1)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate predictions of spatio-temporal systems' states are crucial for tasks such as system management, control, and crisis prevention. However, the inherent time variance of spatio-temporal systems poses challenges to achieving accurate predictions whenever stationarity is not granted. To address non-stationarity frameworks, we propose a Distribution and Relation Adaptive Network (DRAN) capable of dynamically adapting to relation and distribution changes over time. While temporal normalization and de-normalization are frequently used techniques to adapt to distribution shifts, this operation is not suitable for the spatio-temporal context as temporal normalization scales the time series of nodes and possibly disrupts the spatial relations among nodes. In order to address this problem, we develop a Spatial Factor Learner (SFL) module that enables the normalization and de-normalization process in spatio-temporal systems. To adapt to dynamic changes in spatial relationships among sensors, we propose a Dynamic-Static Fusion Learner (DSFL) module that effectively integrates features learned from both dynamic and static relations through an adaptive fusion ratio mechanism. Furthermore, we introduce a Stochastic Learner to capture the noisy components of spatio-temporal representations. Our approach outperforms state of the art methods in weather prediction and traffic flows forecasting tasks. Experimental results show that our SFL efficiently preserves spatial relationships across various temporal normalization operations. Visualizations of the learned dynamic and static relations demonstrate that DSFL can capture both local and distant relationships between nodes. Moreover, ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of each component.</p></details> | 15 pages, 9 figures |

Such data occurs widely, ranging from the scientific and medical domains to the industrial and environmental domains. When the properties in time series exhibit spatial variations, we often call the data spatio-temporal. As part of the continued digitalization of processes throughout society, increasingly large volumes of time series and spatio-temporal data are available. In this tutorial, we focus on data-driven decision making with such data, e.g., enabling greener and more efficient transportation based on traffic time series forecasting. The tutorial adopts the holistic paradigm of ``data-governance-analytics-decision.'' We first introduce the data foundation of time series and spatio-temporal data, which is often heterogeneous. Next, we discuss data governance methods that aim to improve data quality. We then cover data analytics, focusing on the ``AGREE'' principles: Automation, Generalization, Robustness, Explainability, and Efficiency. We finally cover data-driven decision making strategies and briefly discuss promising research directions. We hope that the tutorial will serve as a primary resource for researchers and practitioners who are interested in value creation from time series and spatio-temporal data.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted by ICDE 2025</p></details> |
| **[AttentiveGRU: Recurrent Spatio-Temporal Modeling for Advanced Radar-Based BEV Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00559v1)** | 2025-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bird's-eye view (BEV) object detection has become important for advanced automotive 3D radar-based perception systems. However, the inherently sparse and non-deterministic nature of radar data limits the effectiveness of traditional single-frame BEV paradigms. In this paper, we addresses this limitation by introducing AttentiveGRU, a novel attention-based recurrent approach tailored for radar constraints, which extracts individualized spatio-temporal context for objects by dynamically identifying and fusing temporally correlated structures across present and memory states. By leveraging the consistency of object's latent representation over time, our approach exploits temporal relations to enrich feature representations for both stationary and moving objects, thereby enhancing detection performance and eliminating the need for externally providing or estimating any information about ego vehicle motion. Our experimental results on the public nuScenes dataset show a significant increase in mAP for the car category by 21% over the best radar-only submission. Further evaluations on an additional dataset demonstrate notable improvements in object detection capabilities, underscoring the applicability and effectiveness of our method.</p></details> |  |

Additionally, SNN possess a crucial characteristic, namely the ability to process spatio-temporal information. However, this ability is constrained by both internal and external factors in practical applications, thereby affecting the performance of SNN. Firstly, the internal issue of SNN lies in the inherent limitations of their network structure and neuronal model, which result in the network adopting a unified processing approach for information of different temporal dimensions when processing input data containing complex temporal information. Secondly, the external issue of SNN stems from the direct encoding method commonly adopted by directly trained SNN, which uses the same feature map for input at each time step, failing to fully exploit the spatio-temporal characteristics of SNN. To address these issues, this paper proposes an Unconstrained Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (ULIF) neuronal model that allows for learning different membrane potential parameters at different time steps, thereby enhancing SNN' ability to process information of different temporal dimensions. Additionally, this paper presents a hybrid encoding scheme aimed at solving the problem of direct encoding lacking temporal dimension information. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed methods effectively improve the overall performance of SNN in object detection and object recognition tasks. related code is available at https://github.com/hhx0320/ASNN.</p></details> |  |
| **[EventMamba: Enhancing Spatio-Temporal Locality with State Space Models for Event-Based Video Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19721v3)** | 2025-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Leveraging its robust linear global modeling capability, Mamba has notably excelled in computer vision. Despite its success, existing Mamba-based vision models have overlooked the nuances of event-driven tasks, especially in video reconstruction. Event-based video reconstruction (EBVR) demands spatial translation invariance and close attention to local event relationships in the spatio-temporal domain. Unfortunately, conventional Mamba algorithms apply static window partitions and standard reshape scanning methods, leading to significant losses in local connectivity. To overcome these limitations, we introduce EventMamba--a specialized model designed for EBVR tasks. EventMamba innovates by incorporating random window offset (RWO) in the spatial domain, moving away from the restrictive fixed partitioning. Additionally, it features a new consistent traversal serialization approach in the spatio-temporal domain, which maintains the proximity of adjacent events both spatially and temporally. These enhancements enable EventMamba to retain Mamba's robust modeling capabilities while significantly preserving the spatio-temporal locality of event data. Comprehensive testing on multiple datasets shows that EventMamba markedly enhances video reconstruction, drastically improving computation speed while delivering superior visual quality compared to Transformer-based methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[UniFlow: A Foundation Model for Unified Urban Spatio-Temporal Flow Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12972v3)** | 2025-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Urban spatio-temporal flow prediction, encompassing traffic flows and crowd flows, is crucial for optimizing city infrastructure and managing traffic and emergency responses. Traditional approaches have relied on separate models tailored to either grid-based data, representing cities as uniform cells, or graph-based data, modeling cities as networks of nodes and edges. In this paper, we build UniFlow, a foundational model for general urban flow prediction that unifies both grid-based and graphbased data. We first design a multi-view spatio-temporal patching mechanism to standardize different data into a consistent sequential format and then introduce a spatio-temporal transformer architecture to capture complex correlations and dynamics. To leverage shared spatio-temporal patterns across different data types and facilitate effective cross-learning, we propose SpatioTemporal Memory Retrieval Augmentation (ST-MRA). By creating structured memory modules to store shared spatio-temporal patterns, ST-MRA enhances predictions through adaptive memory retrieval. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniFlow outperforms existing models in both grid-based and graph-based flow prediction, excelling particularly in scenarios with limited data availability, showcasing its superior performance and broad applicability.

The hurdles to enhancing this capability include extensive manual labor, the lack of spatio-temporal compositionality in existing data and the absence of explicit reasoning supervision. In this paper, we propose STEP, a novel graph-guided self-training method that enables Video-LLMs to generate reasoning-rich fine-tuning data from any raw videos to improve itself. Specifically, we first induce Spatio-Temporal Scene Graph (STSG) representation of diverse videos to capture fine-grained, multi-granular video semantics. Then, the STSGs guide the derivation of multi-step reasoning Question-Answer (QA) data with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) rationales. Both answers and rationales are integrated as training objective, aiming to enhance model's reasoning abilities by supervision over explicit reasoning steps. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of STEP across models of varying scales, with a significant 21.3\% improvement in tasks requiring three or more reasoning steps. Furthermore, it achieves superior performance with a minimal amount of self-generated rationale-enriched training samples in both compositional reasoning and comprehensive understanding benchmarks, highlighting the broad applicability and vast potential.</p></details> |  |

Built upon the powerful Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architecture, JavisDiT is able to generate high-quality audio and video content simultaneously from open-ended user prompts. To ensure optimal synchronization, we introduce a fine-grained spatio-temporal alignment mechanism through a Hierarchical Spatial-Temporal Synchronized Prior (HiST-Sypo) Estimator. This module extracts both global and fine-grained spatio-temporal priors, guiding the synchronization between the visual and auditory components. Furthermore, we propose a new benchmark, JavisBench, consisting of 10,140 high-quality text-captioned sounding videos spanning diverse scenes and complex real-world scenarios. Further, we specifically devise a robust metric for evaluating the synchronization between generated audio-video pairs in real-world complex content. Experimental results demonstrate that JavisDiT significantly outperforms existing methods by ensuring both high-quality generation and precise synchronization, setting a new standard for JAVG tasks.

However, existing multi-sensor fusion research predominantly integrates complementary context from multiple images rather than videos. This primarily stems from two factors: 1) the scarcity of large-scale multi-sensor video datasets, limiting research in video fusion, and 2) the inherent difficulty of jointly modeling spatial and temporal dependencies in a unified framework. This paper proactively compensates for the dilemmas. First, we construct M3SVD, a benchmark dataset with $220$ temporally synchronized and spatially registered infrared-visible video pairs comprising 153,797 frames, filling the data gap for the video fusion community. Secondly, we propose VideoFusion, a multi-modal video fusion model that fully exploits cross-modal complementarity and temporal dynamics to generate spatio-temporally coherent videos from (potentially degraded) multi-modal inputs. Specifically, 1) a differential reinforcement module is developed for cross-modal information interaction and enhancement, 2) a complete modality-guided fusion strategy is employed to adaptively integrate multi-modal features, and 3) a bi-temporal co-attention mechanism is devised to dynamically aggregate forward-backward temporal contexts to reinforce cross-frame feature representations. Extensive experiments reveal that VideoFusion outperforms existing image-oriented fusion paradigms in sequential scenarios, effectively mitigating temporal inconsistency and interference.</p></details> |  |

VT migration is an effective way that migrates the VT when the locations of physical entities keep changing to maintain seamless immersive VT services. However, an efficient VT migration is challenging due to the rapid movement of vehicles, dynamic workloads of Roadside Units (RSUs), and heterogeneous resources of the RSUs. To achieve efficient migration decisions and a minimum latency for the VT migration, we propose a multi-agent split Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) framework combined with spatio-temporal trajectory generation. In this framework, multiple split DRL agents utilize split architecture to efficiently determine VT migration decisions. Furthermore, we propose a spatio-temporal trajectory generation algorithm based on trajectory datasets and road network data to simulate vehicle trajectories, enhancing the generalization of the proposed scheme for managing VT migration in dynamic network environments. Finally, experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme not only enhances the Quality of Experience (QoE) by 29% but also reduces the computational parameter count by approximately 25% while maintaining similar performances, enhancing users' immersive experiences in vehicular metaverses.</p></details> |  |

Our approach combines Bayesian Structural Time Series for modeling marginal crop yields, ensuring a more robust quantification of uncertainty given the typically short historical records. To capture dynamic dependencies between regions, we develop a time-varying conditional copula model, where the copula parameter evolves over time as a function of its previous lag and extreme weather covariates. Unlike traditional approaches that treat climatic factors as fixed inputs, we incorporate dynamic Generalized Extreme Value models to characterize extreme weather events, enabling a more accurate reflection of their impact on crop yields. Furthermore, to ensure scalability for large-scale applications, we build on the existing Partitioning Around Medoids clustering algorithm and introduce a novel dissimilarity measure that integrates both spatial and copula-based dependence, enabling an effective reduction of the dimensionality in the dependence structure.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches face a trilemma: diffusion-based methods achieve high visual fidelity but suffer from prohibitive computational costs, while GAN-based solutions sacrifice lip-sync accuracy or dental details for real-time performance. We present MuseTalk, a novel two-stage training framework that resolves this trade-off through latent space optimization and spatio-temporal data sampling strategy. Our key innovations include: (1) During the Facial Abstract Pretraining stage, we propose Informative Frame Sampling to temporally align reference-source pose pairs, eliminating redundant feature interference while preserving identity cues. (2) In the Lip-Sync Adversarial Finetuning stage, we employ Dynamic Margin Sampling to spatially select the most suitable lip-movement-promoting regions, balancing audio-visual synchronization and dental clarity. (3) MuseTalk establishes an effective audio-visual feature fusion framework in the latent space, delivering 30 FPS output at 256*256 resolution on an NVIDIA V100 GPU. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MuseTalk outperforms state-of-the-art methods in visual fidelity while achieving comparable lip-sync accuracy. %The codes and models will be made publicly available upon acceptance.

Recent advances have improved the spatial reasoning ability of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) by introducing large-scale data, but these models still struggle to analyze kinematic elements like traveled distance and speed of moving objects. To bridge this gap, we construct a spatio-temporal reasoning dataset and benchmark involving kinematic instruction tuning, referred to as STKit and STKit-Bench. They consist of real-world videos with 3D annotations, detailing object motion dynamics: traveled distance, speed, movement direction, inter-object distance comparisons, and relative movement direction. To further scale such data construction to videos without 3D labels, we propose an automatic pipeline to generate pseudo-labels using 4D reconstruction in real-world scale. With our kinematic instruction tuning data for spatio-temporal reasoning, we present ST-VLM, a VLM enhanced for spatio-temporal reasoning, which exhibits outstanding performance on STKit-Bench. Furthermore, we show that ST-VLM generalizes robustly across diverse domains and tasks, outperforming baselines on other spatio-temporal benchmarks (eg, ActivityNet, TVQA+). Finally, by integrating learned spatio-temporal reasoning with existing abilities, ST-VLM enables complex multi-step reasoning. Project page: https://ikodoh.github.io/ST-VLM.</p></details> |  |

However, real-world visual relationships often exhibit a long-tailed distribution, causing existing methods for tasks like Video Scene Graph Generation (VidSGG) and Scene Graph Anticipation (SGA) to produce biased scene graphs. To this end, we propose ImparTail, a novel training framework that leverages loss masking and curriculum learning to mitigate bias in the generation and anticipation of spatio-temporal scene graphs. Unlike prior methods that add extra architectural components to learn unbiased estimators, we propose an impartial training objective that reduces the dominance of head classes during learning and focuses on underrepresented tail relationships. Our curriculum-driven mask generation strategy further empowers the model to adaptively adjust its bias mitigation strategy over time, enabling more balanced and robust estimations. To thoroughly assess performance under various distribution shifts, we also introduce two new tasks Robust Spatio-Temporal Scene Graph Generation and Robust Scene Graph Anticipation offering a challenging benchmark for evaluating the resilience of STSG models. Extensive experiments on the Action Genome dataset demonstrate the superior unbiased performance and robustness of our method compared to existing baselines.</p></details> | CVPR 2025 |

Compared to its predecessor SV4D, SV4D 2.0 is more robust to occlusions and large motion, generalizes better to real-world videos, and produces higher-quality outputs in terms of detail sharpness and spatio-temporal consistency. We achieve this by introducing key improvements in multiple aspects: 1) network architecture: eliminating the dependency of reference multi-views and designing blending mechanism for 3D and frame attention, 2) data: enhancing quality and quantity of training data, 3) training strategy: adopting progressive 3D-4D training for better generalization, and 4) 4D optimization: handling 3D inconsistency and large motion via 2-stage refinement and progressive frame sampling.

However, relation modeling between different image patches exhibits significant variations. For instance, background regions dominated by target-irrelevant information require reduced attention allocation, while foreground, particularly boundary areas, need to be be emphasized. A single model may not effectively handle all kinds of relation modeling simultaneously. In this paper, we propose a novel tracker called SPMTrack based on mixture-of-experts tailored for visual tracking task (TMoE), combining the capability of multiple experts to handle diverse relation modeling more flexibly. Benefiting from TMoE, we extend relation modeling from image pairs to spatio-temporal context, further improving tracking accuracy with minimal increase in model parameters. Moreover, we employ TMoE as a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method, substantially reducing trainable parameters, which enables us to train SPMTrack of varying scales efficiently and preserve the generalization ability of pretrained models to achieve superior performance.

Despite its importance, conventional LVEF estimation remains time-consuming and operator-dependent. Recent deep learning advancements have enhanced automation, yet many existing models are computationally demanding, hindering their feasibility for real-time clinical applications. Additionally, the interplay between spatial and temporal features is crucial for accurate estimation but is often overlooked. In this work, we propose Echo-E$^3$Net, an efficient Endo-Epi spatio-temporal network tailored for LVEF estimation. Our method introduces the Endo-Epi Cardial Border Detector (E$^2$CBD) module, which enhances feature extraction by leveraging spatial and temporal landmark cues. Complementing this, the Endo-Epi Feature Aggregator (E$^2$FA) distills statistical descriptors from backbone feature maps, refining the final EF prediction. These modules, along with a multi-component loss function tailored to align with the clinical definition of EF, collectively enhance spatial-temporal representation learning, ensuring robust and efficient EF estimation. We evaluate Echo-E$^3$Net on the EchoNet-Dynamic dataset, achieving a RMSE of 5.15 and an R$^2$ score of 0.82, setting a new benchmark in efficiency with 6.8 million parameters and only 8.49G Flops. Our model operates without pre-training, data augmentation, or ensemble methods, making it well-suited for real-time point-of-care ultrasound (PoCUS) applications.

| **[Whenever, Wherever: Towards Orchestrating Crowd Simulations with Spatio-Temporal Spawn Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16639v1)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Realistic crowd simulations are essential for immersive virtual environments, relying on both individual behaviors (microscopic dynamics) and overall crowd patterns (macroscopic characteristics). While recent data-driven methods like deep reinforcement learning improve microscopic realism, they often overlook critical macroscopic features such as crowd density and flow, which are governed by spatio-temporal spawn dynamics, namely, when and where agents enter a scene. Traditional methods, like random spawn rates, stochastic processes, or fixed schedules, are not guaranteed to capture the underlying complexity or lack diversity and realism. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach called nTPP-GMM that models spatio-temporal spawn dynamics using Neural Temporal Point Processes (nTPPs) that are coupled with a spawn-conditional Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) for agent spawn and goal positions. We evaluate our approach by orchestrating crowd simulations of three diverse real-world datasets with nTPP-GMM. Our experiments demonstrate the orchestration with nTPP-GMM leads to realistic simulations that reflect real-world crowd scenarios and allow crowd analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[Assessment of Spatio-Temporal Predictors in the Presence of Missing and Heterogeneous Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.01701v2)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning approaches achieve outstanding predictive performance in modeling modern data, despite the increasing complexity and scale. However, evaluating the quality of predictive models becomes more challenging, as traditional statistical assumptions often no longer hold. In particular, spatio-temporal data exhibit dependencies across both time and space, often involving nonlinear dynamics, non-stationarities, and missing observations. As a result, advanced predictors such as spatio-temporal graph neural networks require novel evaluation methodologies. This paper introduces a residual correlation analysis framework designed to assess the optimality of spatio-temporal predictive neural models, particularly in scenarios with incomplete and heterogeneous data. By leveraging the principle that residual correlation indicates information not captured by the model, this framework serves as a powerful tool to identify and localize regions in space and time where model performance can be improved. A key advantage of the proposed approach is its ability to operate under minimal assumptions, enabling robust evaluation of deep learning models applied to multivariate time series, even in the presence of missing and heterogeneous data. The methodology employs tailored spatio-temporal graphs to encode sparse spatial and temporal dependencies within the data and utilizes asymptotically distribution-free summary statistics to pinpoint time intervals and spatial regions where the model underperforms. The effectiveness of the proposed residual analysis is demonstrated through validation on both synthetic and real-world scenarios involving state-of-the-art predictive models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Copula-based spatio-temporal modeling of air pollutant data incorporating covariate dependencies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15935v1)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Elevated levels of PM10 are known to cause severe respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, and, in extreme cases, cancer and mortality. Despite various reduction policies implemented across different sectors, PM10 concentrations in South Korea continue to exceed the annual recommended limits set by the World Health Organization. Spatio-temporal PM10 concentrations may exhibit both spatial and temporal dependencies. Additionally, interactions between PM10 and environmental factors can further influence the variability in PM10. Therefore, this study proposes a method that incorporates the spatio-temporal neighbors of covariates alongside those of PM10 by adopting an approach that explains spatio-temporal interactions through spatio-temporal neighbors. Vine copulas are used to integrate the pairwise dependence structures between a given location and its surrounding spatio-temporal neighbors. We applied the model to weekly average PM10 data from South Korea in 2019, using PM2.5 and CO as covariates. Given that all three variables exhibited skewness, we assumed the Gumbel and Generalized Extreme Value distributions as marginal distributions. The proposed model outperformed a traditional Bayesian spatio-temporal model, a kriging method, and an alternative copula-based approach, particularly in predicting the top 5% of extreme values, by effectively capturing tail dependencies crucial for extreme value analysis. This study highlights the importance of utilizing vine copulas to effectively model diverse dependency structures in spatio-temporal data while simultaneously accommodating spatial and temporal dimensions, including spatio-temporal dependencies among covariates. The results underscore the broader applicability of the proposed approach to other fields where complex dependency structures are present.</p></details> |  |
| **[BlockDance: Reuse Structurally Similar Spatio-Temporal Features to Accelerate Diffusion Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15927v1)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have demonstrated impressive generation capabilities, particularly with recent advancements leveraging transformer architectures to improve both visual and artistic quality. However, Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) continue to encounter challenges related to low inference speed, primarily due to the iterative denoising process. To address this issue, we propose BlockDance, a training-free approach that explores feature similarities at adjacent time steps to accelerate DiTs. Unlike previous feature-reuse methods that lack tailored reuse strategies for features at different scales, BlockDance prioritizes the identification of the most structurally similar features, referred to as Structurally Similar Spatio-Temporal (STSS) features. These features are primarily located within the structure-focused blocks of the transformer during the later stages of denoising. BlockDance caches and reuses these highly similar features to mitigate redundant computation, thereby accelerating DiTs while maximizing consistency with the generated results of the original model. Furthermore, considering the diversity of generated content and the varying distributions of redundant features, we introduce BlockDance-Ada, a lightweight decision-making network tailored for instance-specific acceleration. BlockDance-Ada dynamically allocates resources and provides superior content quality. Both BlockDance and BlockDance-Ada have proven effective across various generation tasks and models, achieving accelerations between 25% and 50% while maintaining generation quality.</p></details> | Accepted by CVPR2025 |
| **[Causal Deciphering and Inpainting in Spatio-Temporal Dynamics via Diffusion Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19608v3)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal (ST) prediction has garnered a De facto attention in earth sciences, such as meteorological prediction, human mobility perception. However, the scarcity of data coupled with the high expenses involved in sensor deployment results in notable data imbalances. Furthermore, models that are excessively customized and devoid of causal connections further undermine the generalizability and interpretability. To this end, we establish a causal framework for ST predictions, termed CaPaint, which targets to identify causal regions in data and endow model with causal reasoning ability in a two-stage process. Going beyond this process, we utilize the back-door adjustment to specifically address the sub-regions identified as non-causal in the upstream phase. Specifically, we employ a novel image inpainting technique. By using a fine-tuned unconditional Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) as the generative prior, we in-fill the masks defined as environmental parts, offering the possibility of reliable extrapolation for potential data distributions. CaPaint overcomes the high complexity dilemma of optimal ST causal discovery models by reducing the data generation complexity from exponential to quasi-linear levels. Extensive experiments conducted on five real-world ST benchmarks demonstrate that integrating the CaPaint concept allows models to achieve improvements ranging from 4.3% to 77.3%. Moreover, compared to traditional mainstream ST augmenters, CaPaint underscores the potential of diffusion models in ST enhancement, offering a novel paradigm for this field.

| **[Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks for Infant Language Acquisition Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14341v1)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting the words that a child is going to learn next can be useful for boosting language acquisition, and such predictions have been shown to be possible with both neural network techniques (looking at changes in the vocabulary state over time) and graph model (looking at data pertaining to the relationships between words). However, these models do not fully capture the complexity of the language learning process of an infant when used in isolation. In this paper, we examine how a model of language acquisition for infants and young children can be constructed and adapted for use in a Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (STGCN), taking into account the different types of linguistic relationships that occur during child language learning. We introduce a novel approach for predicting child vocabulary acquisition, and evaluate the efficacy of such a model with respect to the different types of linguistic relationships that occur during language acquisition, resulting in insightful observations on model calibration and norm selection. An evaluation of this model found that the mean accuracy of models for predicting new words when using sensorimotor relationships (0.733) and semantic relationships (0.729) were found to be superior to that observed with a 2-layer Feed-forward neural network. Furthermore, the high recall for some relationships suggested that some relationships (e.g. visual) were superior in identifying a larger proportion of relevant words that a child should subsequently learn than others (such as auditory).</p></details> |  |

In the human language system, experimental studies have observed clusters for syntactic and semantic categories, but the mechanisms underlying this functional organization remain unclear. Here, building on work from the vision literature, we develop TopoLM, a transformer language model with an explicit two-dimensional spatial representation of model units. By combining a next-token prediction objective with a spatial smoothness loss, representations in this model assemble into clusters that correspond to semantically interpretable groupings of text and closely match the functional organization in the brain's language system. TopoLM successfully predicts the emergence of the spatio-functional organization of a cortical language system as well as the organization of functional clusters selective for fine-grained linguistic features empirically observed in human cortex. Our results suggest that the functional organization of the human language system is driven by a unified spatial objective, and provide a functionally and spatially aligned model of language processing in the brain.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatio-Temporal Distortion Aware Omnidirectional Video Super-Resolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11506v2)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Omnidirectional video (ODV) provides an immersive visual experience and is widely utilized in virtual reality and augmented reality. However, restricted capturing devices and transmission bandwidth lead to low-resolution ODVs. Video super-resolution (SR) is proposed to enhance resolution, but practical ODV spatial projection distortions and temporal flickering are not well addressed directly applying existing methods. To achieve better ODV-SR reconstruction, we propose a Spatio-Temporal Distortion Aware Network (STDAN) oriented to ODV characteristics. Specifically, a spatially continuous distortion modulation module is introduced to improve discrete projection distortions. Next, we design an interlaced multi-frame reconstruction mechanism to refine temporal consistency across frames. Furthermore, we incorporate latitude-saliency adaptive weights during training to concentrate on regions with higher texture complexity and human-watching interest. In general, we explore inference-free and real-world viewing matched strategies to provide an application-friendly method on a novel ODV-SR dataset with practical scenarios. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed STDAN over state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Human-Centric Video Anomaly Detection Through Spatio-Temporal Pose Tokenization and Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15185v2)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) presents a significant challenge in computer vision, particularly due to the unpredictable and infrequent nature of anomalous events, coupled with the diverse and dynamic environments in which they occur. Human-centric VAD, a specialized area within this domain, faces additional complexities, including variations in human behavior, potential biases in data, and substantial privacy concerns related to human subjects. These issues complicate the development of models that are both robust and generalizable. To address these challenges, recent advancements have focused on pose-based VAD, which leverages human pose as a high-level feature to mitigate privacy concerns, reduce appearance biases, and minimize background interference. In this paper, we introduce SPARTA, a novel transformer-based architecture designed specifically for human-centric pose-based VAD. SPARTA introduces an innovative Spatio-Temporal Pose and Relative Pose (ST-PRP) tokenization method that produces an enriched representation of human motion over time. This approach ensures that the transformer's attention mechanism captures both spatial and temporal patterns simultaneously, rather than focusing on only one aspect. The addition of the relative pose further emphasizes subtle deviations from normal human movements. The architecture's core, a novel Unified Encoder Twin Decoders (UETD) transformer, significantly improves the detection of anomalous behaviors in video data. Extensive evaluations across multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that SPARTA consistently outperforms existing methods, establishing a new state-of-the-art in pose-based VAD.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches, including spatio-temporal graph convolutional networks (ST-GCNs), often face high memory demands and struggle to capture complex spatio-temporal dependencies, limiting their efficiency in clinical applications. To address these challenges, we introduce DynSTG-Mamba (Dynamic Spatio-Temporal Graph Mamba), a novel framework that combines DF-STGNN and STG-Mamba to enhance motion sequence modeling. The DF-STGNN incorporates a dynamic spatio-temporal filter that adaptively adjusts spatial connections between skeletal joints and temporal interactions across different movement phases. This approach ensures better feature propagation through dynamic graph structures by considering the hierarchical nature and dynamics of skeletal gait data. Meanwhile, STG-Mamba, an extension of Mamba adapted for skeletal motion data, ensures a continuous propagation of states, facilitating the capture of long-term dependencies while reducing computational complexity. To reduce the number of model parameters and computational costs while maintaining consistency, we propose Cross-Graph Relational Knowledge Distillation, a novel knowledge transfer mechanism that aligns relational information between teacher (large architecture) and student models (small architecture) while using shared memory. This ensures that the interactions and movement patterns of the joints are accurately preserved in the motion sequences. We validate our DynSTG-Mamba on KOA-NM, PD-WALK, and ATAXIA datasets, where it outperforms state-of-the-art approaches by achieving in terms of Accuracy, F1-score, and Recall. Our results highlight the efficiency and robustness of our approach, offering a lightweight yet highly accurate solution for automated gait analysis and movement disorder assessment.</p></details> |  |

Our approach applies query-based detection (DETR) to each frame and matches DETR queries to link the same person across frames. We introduce the Query Matching Module (QMM), which uses metric learning to bring queries for the same person closer together across frames compared to queries for different people. Action classes are predicted using the sequence of queries obtained from QMM matching, allowing for variable-length inputs from videos longer than a single clip. Experimental results on JHMDB, UCF101-24, and AVA datasets demonstrate that our method performs well for large position changes of people while offering superior computational efficiency and lower resource requirements.</p></details> | <details><summary>exten...</summary><p>extended version of VISAPP2025</p></details> |

Recently, we have witnessed the rise of variational autoencoder-based latent factor models, which learn latent factors self-adaptively. While these models focus on modeling overall market conditions, they often fail to effectively capture the temporal patterns of individual stocks. Additionally, representing multiple factors as single values simplifies the model but limits its ability to capture complex relationships and dependencies. As a result, the learned factors are of low quality and lack diversity, reducing their effectiveness and robustness across different trading periods. To address these issues, we propose a Spatio-Temporal factOR Model based on dual vector quantized variational autoencoders, named STORM, which extracts features of stocks from temporal and spatial perspectives, then fuses and aligns these features at the fine-grained and semantic level, and represents the factors as multi-dimensional embeddings. The discrete codebooks cluster similar factor embeddings, ensuring orthogonality and diversity, which helps distinguish between different factors and enables factor selection in financial trading. To show the performance of the proposed factor model, we apply it to two downstream experiments: portfolio management on two stock datasets and individual trading tasks on six specific stocks. The extensive experiments demonstrate STORM's flexibility in adapting to downstream tasks and superior performance over baseline models.</p></details> |  |

It is a multimodal task aimed at localizing specific subjects spatio-temporally based on textual queries without bounding box supervision. Motivated by recent advancements in multi-modal foundation models for grounding tasks, we first explore the potential of state-of-the-art object detection models for WSTVG. Despite their robust zero-shot capabilities, our adaptation reveals significant limitations, including inconsistent temporal predictions, inadequate understanding of complex queries, and challenges in adapting to difficult scenarios. We propose CoSPaL (Contextual Self-Paced Learning), a novel approach which is designed to overcome these limitations. CoSPaL integrates three core components: (1) Tubelet Phrase Grounding (TPG), which introduces spatio-temporal prediction by linking textual queries to tubelets; (2) Contextual Referral Grounding (CRG), which improves comprehension of complex queries by extracting contextual information to refine object identification over time; and (3) Self-Paced Scene Understanding (SPS), a training paradigm that progressively increases task difficulty, enabling the model to adapt to complex scenarios by transitioning from coarse to fine-grained understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR'...</summary><p>ICLR'25 Main Conference.

The complexity arises from the intricate interactions between scales and the interplay of diverse physical processes. Neural operators have emerged as promising models for predicting such dynamics due to their flexibility and computational efficiency. However, they often fail to effectively capture multi-scale interactions or quantify the uncertainties inherent in the predictions. These limitations lead to rapid error accumulation, particularly in long-term forecasting of systems characterized by complex and coupled dynamics. To address these challenges, we propose a spatio-temporal Fourier transformer (StFT), in which each transformer block is designed to learn dynamics at a specific scale. By leveraging a structured hierarchy of StFT blocks, the model explicitly captures dynamics across both macro- and micro- spatial scales. Furthermore, a generative residual correction mechanism is integrated to estimate and mitigate predictive uncertainties, enhancing both the accuracy and reliability of long-term forecasts. Evaluations conducted on three benchmark datasets (plasma, fluid, and atmospheric dynamics) demonstrate the advantages of our approach over state-of-the-art ML methods.</p></details> | 16 pages, 10 figures |

However, can Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) also "reason through a sequential spatio-temporal logic" in videos? Existing Video-LLM benchmarks primarily focus on assessing object presence, neglecting relational reasoning. Consequently, it is difficult to measure whether a model truly comprehends object interactions (actions/events) in videos or merely relies on pre-trained "memory" of co-occurrences as biases in generating answers. In this work, we introduce a Video Spatio-Temporal Reasoning (V-STaR) benchmark to address these shortcomings. The key idea is to decompose video understanding into a Reverse Spatio-Temporal Reasoning (RSTR) task that simultaneously evaluates what objects are present, when events occur, and where they are located while capturing the underlying Chain-of-thought (CoT) logic. To support this evaluation, we construct a dataset to elicit the spatial-temporal reasoning process of Video-LLMs. It contains coarse-to-fine CoT questions generated by a semi-automated GPT-4-powered pipeline, embedding explicit reasoning chains to mimic human cognition. Experiments from 14 Video-LLMs on our V-STaR reveal significant gaps between current Video-LLMs and the needs for robust and consistent spatio-temporal reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>A ben...</summary><p>A benchmark for Video Spatio-Temporal Reasoning</p></details> |

Nevertheless, conventional Mamba-based models encounter significant challenges in accurately predicting stock time series, as they fail to adequately capture both the overarching market dynamics and the intricate interdependencies among individual stocks. To overcome these constraints, we introduce the Hierarchical Information-Guided Spatio-Temporal Mamba (HIGSTM) framework. HIGSTM introduces Index-Guided Frequency Filtering Decomposition to extract commonality and specificity from time series. The model architecture features a meticulously designed hierarchical framework that systematically captures both temporal dynamic patterns and global static relationships within the stock market. Furthermore, we propose an Information-Guided Mamba that integrates macro informations into the sequence selection process, thereby facilitating more market-conscious decision-making. Comprehensive experimental evaluations conducted on the CSI500, CSI800 and CSI1000 datasets demonstrate that HIGSTM achieves state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  |

Our approach processes multi-station waveform data and generates station-specific detection probabilities.

Prior work primarily focuses on single-frame cooperative perception, which fuses agents' information across different spatial locations but ignores temporal cues and temporal tasks (e.g., temporal perception and prediction). In this paper, we focus on the spatio-temporal fusion in V2X scenarios and design one-step and multi-step communication strategies (when to transmit) as well as examine their integration with three fusion strategies - early, late, and intermediate (what to transmit), providing comprehensive benchmarks with 11 fusion models (how to fuse). Furthermore, we propose V2XPnP, a novel intermediate fusion framework within one-step communication for end-to-end perception and prediction. Our framework employs a unified Transformer-based architecture to effectively model complex spatio-temporal relationships across multiple agents, frames, and high-definition map. Moreover, we introduce the V2XPnP Sequential Dataset that supports all V2X collaboration modes and addresses the limitations of existing real-world datasets, which are restricted to single-frame or single-mode cooperation. Extensive experiments demonstrate our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both perception and prediction tasks.

Compared to classic STVG locating only a single target, OmniSTVG enables localization of not only an arbitrary number of text-referred targets but also their interacting counterparts in the query from the video, making it more flexible and practical in real scenarios for comprehensive understanding. In order to facilitate exploration of OmniSTVG, we introduce BOSTVG, a large-scale benchmark dedicated to OmniSTVG. Specifically, our BOSTVG consists of 10,018 videos with 10.2M frames and covers a wide selection of 287 classes from diverse scenarios. Each sequence in BOSTVG, paired with a free-form textual query, encompasses a varying number of targets ranging from 1 to 10. To ensure high quality, each video is manually annotated with meticulous inspection and refinement. To our best knowledge, BOSTVG is to date the first and the largest benchmark for OmniSTVG. To encourage future research, we introduce a simple yet effective approach, named OmniTube, which, drawing inspiration from Transformer-based STVG methods, is specially designed for OmniSTVG and demonstrates promising results. By releasing BOSTVG, we hope to go beyond classic STVG by locating every object appearing in the query for more comprehensive understanding, opening up a new direction for STVG. Our benchmark, model, and results will be released at https://github.com/JellyYao3000/OmniSTVG.</p></details> |  |

Traditional deep learning approaches have significantly advanced this field, particularly in the stage of ST data mining. However, these models remain task-specific and often require extensive labeled data. Inspired by the success of Foundation Models (FM), especially large language models, researchers have begun exploring the concept of Spatio-Temporal Foundation Models (STFMs) to enhance adaptability and generalization across diverse ST tasks. Unlike prior architectures, STFMs empower the entire workflow of ST data science, ranging from data sensing, management, to mining, thereby offering a more holistic and scalable approach. Despite rapid progress, a systematic study of STFMs for ST data science remains lacking. This survey aims to provide a comprehensive review of STFMs, categorizing existing methodologies and identifying key research directions to advance ST general intelligence.</p></details> |  |

Utilizing existing observations, spatio-temporal kriging is a method for estimating air quality at unobserved locations during a specific period. Inductive spatio-temporal kriging with increment training strategy has demonstrated its effectiveness using virtual nodes to simulate unobserved nodes. However, a disparity between virtual and real nodes persists, complicating the application of learning patterns derived from virtual nodes to actual unobserved ones. To address these limitations, this paper presents a Physics-Guided Increment Training Strategy (PGITS). Specifically, we design a dynamic graph generation module to incorporate the advection and diffusion processes of airborne particles as physical knowledge into the graph structure, dynamically adjusting the adjacency matrix to reflect physical interactions between nodes. By using physics principles as a bridge between virtual and real nodes, this strategy ensures the features of virtual nodes and their pseudo labels are closer to actual nodes. Consequently, the learned patterns of virtual nodes can be applied to actual unobserved nodes for effective kriging.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Traffic Prediction Through Spatio-Temporal Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10459v2)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) have gained considerable attention in recent years for traffic flow prediction due to their ability to learn spatio-temporal pattern representations through a graph-based message-passing framework. Although GNNs have shown great promise in handling traffic datasets, their deployment in real-life applications has been hindered by scalability constraints arising from high-order message passing. Additionally, the over-smoothing problem of GNNs may lead to indistinguishable region representations as the number of layers increases, resulting in performance degradation. To address these challenges, we propose a new knowledge distillation paradigm termed LightST that transfers spatial and temporal knowledge from a high-capacity teacher to a lightweight student. Specifically, we introduce a spatio-temporal knowledge distillation framework that helps student MLPs capture graph-structured global spatio-temporal patterns while alleviating the over-smoothing effect with adaptive knowledge distillation. Extensive experiments verify that LightST significantly speeds up traffic flow predictions by 5X to 40X compared to state-of-the-art spatio-temporal GNNs, all while maintaining superior accuracy.</p></details> | 9 pages |
| **[STGDPM:Vessel Trajectory Prediction with Spatio-Temporal Graph Diffusion Probabilistic Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08065v1)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vessel trajectory prediction is a critical component for ensuring maritime traffic safety and avoiding collisions. Due to the inherent uncertainty in vessel behavior, trajectory prediction systems must adopt a multimodal approach to accurately model potential future motion states. However, existing vessel trajectory prediction methods lack the ability to comprehensively model behavioral multi-modality. To better capture multimodal behavior in interactive scenarios, we propose modeling interactions as dynamic graphs, replacing traditional aggregation-based techniques that rely on vessel states. By leveraging the natural multimodal capabilities of diffusion models, we frame the trajectory prediction task as an inverse process of motion uncertainty diffusion, wherein uncertainties across potential navigational areas are progressively eliminated until the desired trajectories is produced. In summary, we pioneer the integration of Spatio-Temporal Graph (STG) with diffusion models in ship trajectory prediction. Extensive experiments on real Automatic Identification System (AIS) data validate the superiority of our approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been ACCEPTED as a FULL PAPER at DASFAA 2025</p></details> |
| **[STEAD: Spatio-Temporal Efficient Anomaly Detection for Time and Compute Sensitive Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07942v1)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a new method for anomaly detection in automated systems with time and compute sensitive requirements, such as autonomous driving, with unparalleled efficiency. As systems like autonomous driving become increasingly popular, ensuring their safety has become more important than ever. Therefore, this paper focuses on how to quickly and effectively detect various anomalies in the aforementioned systems, with the goal of making them safer and more effective. Many detection systems have been developed with great success under spatial contexts; however, there is still significant room for improvement when it comes to temporal context. While there is substantial work regarding this task, there is minimal work done regarding the efficiency of models and their ability to be applied to scenarios that require real-time inference, i.e., autonomous driving where anomalies need to be detected the moment they are within view. To address this gap, we propose STEAD (Spatio-Temporal Efficient Anomaly Detection), whose backbone is developed using (2+1)D Convolutions and Performer Linear Attention, which ensures computational efficiency without sacrificing performance. When tested on the UCF-Crime benchmark, our base model achieves an AUC of 91.34%, outperforming the previous state-of-the-art, and our fast version achieves an AUC of 88.87%, while having 99.70% less parameters and outperforming the previous state-of-the-art as well.

Deep Learning (DL), particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs), have revolutionized this field by enhancing the accuracy of classification tasks. In this work, a novel approach combining a transformer-based Swin-Unet architecture with seasonal synthesized spatio-temporal images has been employed to classify LC types using spatio-temporal features extracted from Sentinel-1 (S1) Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data, organized into seasonal clusters. The study focuses on three distinct regions - Amazonia, Africa, and Siberia - and evaluates the model performance across diverse ecoregions within these areas. By utilizing seasonal feature sequences instead of dense temporal sequences, notable performance improvements have been achieved, especially in regions with temporal data gaps like Siberia, where S1 data distribution is uneven and non-uniform. The results demonstrate the effectiveness and the generalization capabilities of the proposed methodology in achieving high overall accuracy (O.A.) values, even in regions with limited training data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing</p></details> |

Recent studies have shown that SNNs suffer from severe overfitting, which limits their generalization performance. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective Temporal Reversal Regularization (TRR) to mitigate overfitting during training and facilitate generalization of SNNs. We exploit the inherent temporal properties of SNNs to perform input/feature temporal reversal perturbations, prompting the SNN to produce original-reversed consistent outputs and learn perturbation-invariant representations. To further enhance generalization, we utilize the lightweight ``star operation" (Hadamard product) for feature hybridization of original and temporally reversed spike firing rates, which expands the implicit dimensionality and acts as a spatio-temporal regularizer. We show theoretically that our method is able to tighten the upper bound of the generalization error, and extensive experiments on static/neuromorphic recognition as well as 3D point cloud classification tasks demonstrate its effectiveness, versatility, and adversarial robustness. In particular, our regularization significantly improves the recognition accuracy of low-latency SNN for neuromorphic objects, contributing to the real-world deployment of neuromorphic computational software-hardware integration.</p></details> | 17 pages, 9 figures |

However, existing methods still suffer from noisy and inconsistent flow matching, making it difficult to handle challenging scenarios and long-sequence estimation. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Spatio-Temporal Visual Odometry (STVO), a novel deep network architecture that effectively leverages inherent spatio-temporal cues to enhance the accuracy and consistency of multi-frame flow matching. With more accurate and consistent flow matching, STVO can achieve better pose estimation through the bundle adjustment (BA). Specifically, STVO introduces two innovative components: 1) the Temporal Propagation Module that utilizes multi-frame information to extract and propagate temporal cues across adjacent frames, maintaining temporal consistency; 2) the Spatial Activation Module that utilizes geometric priors from the depth maps to enhance spatial consistency while filtering out excessive noise and incorrect matches. Our STVO achieves state-of-the-art performance on TUM-RGBD, EuRoc MAV, ETH3D and KITTI Odometry benchmarks. Notably, it improves accuracy by 77.8% on ETH3D benchmark and 38.9% on KITTI Odometry benchmark over the previous best methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[DropletVideo: A Dataset and Approach to Explore Integral Spatio-Temporal Consistent Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06053v1)** | 2025-03-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal consistency is a critical research topic in video generation. A qualified generated video segment must ensure plot plausibility and coherence while maintaining visual consistency of objects and scenes across varying viewpoints. Prior research, especially in open-source projects, primarily focuses on either temporal or spatial consistency, or their basic combination, such as appending a description of a camera movement after a prompt without constraining the outcomes of this movement. However, camera movement may introduce new objects to the scene or eliminate existing ones, thereby overlaying and affecting the preceding narrative. Especially in videos with numerous camera movements, the interplay between multiple plots becomes increasingly complex. This paper introduces and examines integral spatio-temporal consistency, considering the synergy between plot progression and camera techniques, and the long-term impact of prior content on subsequent generation. Our research encompasses dataset construction through to the development of the model. Initially, we constructed a DropletVideo-10M dataset, which comprises 10 million videos featuring dynamic camera motion and object actions. Each video is annotated with an average caption of 206 words, detailing various camera movements and plot developments. Following this, we developed and trained the DropletVideo model, which excels in preserving spatio-temporal coherence during video generation. The DropletVideo dataset and model are accessible at https://dropletx.github.io.</p></details> |  |

However, understanding the predictions from a model is crucial to ensure reliability and trustworthiness, particularly for high-risk applications, such as healthcare and transport. Few existing methods are able to generate explanations for models trained on continuous-time dynamic graph data and, of these, the computational complexity and lack of suitable explanation objectives pose challenges. In this paper, we propose $\textbf{S}$patio-$\textbf{T}$emporal E$\textbf{X}$planation $\textbf{Search}$ (STX-Search), a novel method for generating instance-level explanations that is applicable to static and dynamic temporal graph structures. We introduce a novel search strategy and objective function, to find explanations that are highly faithful and interpretable. When compared with existing methods, STX-Search produces explanations of higher fidelity whilst optimising explanation size to maintain interpretability.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we demonstrate that effective information compression may occur over time or space during sequences of node communications in distributed algorithms, leading to the concept of spatio-temporal compressors. This abstraction classifies existing compressors as spatio-temporal compressors, with their effectiveness described by constructive stability criteria from nonlinear system theory. Subsequently, we apply these spatio-temporal compressors to standard continuous-time consensus flows and distributed prime-dual flows, establishing conditions ensuring convergence. Additionally, we introduce a novel observer-based distributed primal-dual continuous flow integrated with spatio-temporal compressors, which provides broader convergence conditions. These continuous flows achieve exponential convergence to the global optimum when the objective function is strongly convex and can be discretized using Euler approximations. Finally, numerical simulations illustrate the versatility of the proposed spatio-temporal compressors and verify the convergence of algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2408.02332</p></details> |

State-of-the-art association methods in agriculture are dedicated towards matching larger crops using either high-resolution point clouds or temporally stable features, which are both difficult to obtain for smaller fruit in the field. To address these challenges, we propose a transformer-based architecture that encodes the shape and position of each fruitlet, and propagates and refines these features through a series of transformer encoder layers with alternating self and cross-attention. We demonstrate that our method is able to achieve an F1-score of 92.4% on data collected in a commercial apple orchard and outperforms all baselines and ablations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Advancing Spatio-Temporal Processing in Spiking Neural Networks through Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07517v2)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Implementations of spiking neural networks on neuromorphic hardware promise orders of magnitude less power consumption than their non-spiking counterparts. The standard neuron model for spike-based computation on such systems has long been the leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neuron. A computationally light augmentation of the LIF neuron model with an adaptation mechanism has recently been shown to exhibit superior performance on spatio-temporal processing tasks. The root of the superiority of these so-called adaptive LIF neurons however is not well understood. In this article, we thoroughly analyze the dynamical, computational, and learning properties of adaptive LIF neurons and networks thereof. Our investigation reveals significant challenges related to stability and parameterization when employing the conventional Euler-Forward discretization for this class of models. We report a rigorous theoretical and empirical demonstration that these challenges can be effectively addressed by adopting an alternative discretization approach - the Symplectic Euler method, allowing to improve over state-of-the-art performances on common event-based benchmark datasets. Our further analysis of the computational properties of networks of adaptive LIF neurons shows that they are particularly well suited to exploit the spatio-temporal structure of input sequences without any normalization techniques.</p></details> |  |

Here we present new generally applicable methodology to perform this task. We introduce a parsimonious representation of seasonality and a biologically informed specification of the outbreak component to avoid parameter identifiability issues. We develop a computationally efficient Bayesian inference methodology for the proposed models, including techniques to detect outbreaks by computing marginal posterior probabilities at each spatial location and time point. We show that it is possible to efficiently integrate out the discrete parameters associated with outbreak states, enabling the use of dynamic Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) as a complementary alternative to a hybrid Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm. Furthermore, we introduce a robust Bayesian model comparison framework based on importance sampling to approximate model evidence in high-dimensional space. The performance of our methodology is validated through systematic simulation studies, where simulated outbreaks were successfully detected, and our model comparison strategy demonstrates strong reliability. We also apply our new methodology to monthly incidence data on invasive meningococcal disease from 28 European countries. The results highlight outbreaks across multiple countries and months, with model comparison analysis showing that the new specification outperforms previous approaches.

To achieve this goal, we propose the Spatio-Temporal Memory Agent (STMA), a novel framework designed to enhance task planning and execution by integrating spatio-temporal memory. STMA is built upon three critical components: (1) a spatio-temporal memory module that captures historical and environmental changes in real time, (2) a dynamic knowledge graph that facilitates adaptive spatial reasoning, and (3) a planner-critic mechanism that iteratively refines task strategies. We evaluate STMA in the TextWorld environment on 32 tasks, involving multi-step planning and exploration under varying levels of complexity. Experimental results demonstrate that STMA achieves a 31.25% improvement in success rate and a 24.7% increase in average score compared to the state-of-the-art model. The results highlight the effectiveness of spatio-temporal memory in advancing the memory capabilities of embodied agents.</p></details> |  |

To address these limitations, this paper presents the Spatio-Temporal GraphFormer framework (STGFormer) for 3D human pose estimation in videos. First, we introduce a Spatio-Temporal criss-cross Graph (STG) attention mechanism, designed to more effectively leverage the inherent graph priors of the human body within continuous sequence distributions while capturing spatiotemporal long-range dependencies. Next, we present a dual-path Modulated Hop-wise Regular GCN (MHR-GCN) to independently process temporal and spatial dimensions in parallel, preserving features rich in temporal dynamics and the original or high-dimensional representations of spatial structures. Furthermore, the module leverages modulation to optimize parameter efficiency and incorporates spatiotemporal hop-wise skip connections to capture higher-order information. Finally, we demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Human3.6M and MPIINF-3DHP datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[H-FLTN: A Privacy-Preserving Hierarchical Framework for Electric Vehicle Spatio-Temporal Charge Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18697v1)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The widespread adoption of Electric Vehicles (EVs) poses critical challenges for energy providers, particularly in predicting charging time (temporal prediction), ensuring user privacy, and managing resources efficiently in mobility-driven networks. This paper introduces the Hierarchical Federated Learning Transformer Network (H-FLTN) framework to address these challenges. H-FLTN employs a three-tier hierarchical architecture comprising EVs, community Distributed Energy Resource Management Systems (DERMS), and the Energy Provider Data Centre (EPDC) to enable accurate spatio-temporal predictions of EV charging needs while preserving privacy. Temporal prediction is enhanced using Transformer-based learning, capturing complex dependencies in charging behavior. Privacy is ensured through Secure Aggregation, Additive Secret Sharing, and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Sharing with Augmentation, which allow only secret shares of model weights to be exchanged while securing all transmissions. To improve training efficiency and resource management, H-FLTN integrates Dynamic Client Capping Mechanism (DCCM) and Client Rotation Management (CRM), ensuring that training remains both computationally and temporally efficient as the number of participating EVs increases. DCCM optimises client participation by limiting excessive computational loads, while CRM balances training contributions across epochs, preventing imbalanced participation. Our simulation results based on large-scale empirical vehicle mobility data reveal that DCCM and CRM reduce the training time complexity with increasing EVs from linear to constant. Its integration into real-world smart city infrastructure enhances energy demand forecasting, resource allocation, and grid stability, ensuring reliability and sustainability in future mobility ecosystems.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 7 tables, 2 figures, Journal Paper</p></details> |

Recently, advancements in monitoring technology have facilitated the effective recording of nuclear radiation levels and related factors, such as weather conditions. The abundance of monitoring data enables the development of accurate and reliable nuclear radiation forecasting models, which play a crucial role in informing decision-making for individuals and governments. However, this task is challenging due to the imbalanced distribution of monitoring stations over a wide spatial range and the non-stationary radiation variation patterns. In this study, we introduce NRFormer, a novel framework tailored for the nationwide prediction of nuclear radiation variations. By integrating a non-stationary temporal attention module, an imbalance-aware spatial attention module, and a radiation propagation prompting module, NRFormer collectively captures complex spatio-temporal dynamics of nuclear radiation. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed framework against 11 baselines.</p></details> |  |

The objective is to provide a quality score to ensure correct performance and achieve desired results. To achieve this goal, a new graph-based model, the Dense Spatio-Temporal Graph Conv-GRU Network with Transformer, is introduced. This model combines a modified version of STGCN and transformer architectures for efficient handling of spatio-temporal data. The key idea is to consider skeleton data respecting its non-linear structure as a graph and detecting joints playing the main role in each rehabilitation exercise. Dense connections and GRU mechanisms are used to rapidly process large 3D skeleton inputs and effectively model temporal dynamics. The transformer encoder's attention mechanism focuses on relevant parts of the input sequence, making it useful for evaluating rehabilitation exercises.

However, traditional approaches to assess patient actions often rely on manual observation and scoring, which are subjective and time-consuming. In this paper, we propose an automated approach for patient action assessment using a Multi-Residual Spatio Temporal Graph Network (MR-STGN) that incorporates both angular and positional 3D skeletons. The MR-STGN is specifically designed to capture the spatio-temporal dynamics of patient actions. It achieves this by integrating information from multiple residual layers, with each layer extracting features at distinct levels of abstraction. Furthermore, we integrate an attention fusion mechanism into the network, which facilitates the adaptive weighting of various features. This empowers the model to concentrate on the most pertinent aspects of the patient's movements, offering precise instructions regarding specific body parts or movements that require attention. Ablation studies are conducted to analyze the impact of individual components within the proposed model. We evaluate our model on the UI-PRMD dataset demonstrating its performance in accurately predicting real-time patient action scores, surpassing state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

This approach enables the detection of both the spatial distribution and temporal dynamics of stick-slip regions. Also, the proposed method can be applied to strain distribution sensing devices, such as vision-based tactile sensors. Simulations and prototype experiments validated the effectiveness of this approach under varying contact conditions, including different contact geometries, friction coefficients, and combined loads. Experiments demonstrated that this method not only accurately and reliably delineates incipient slip, but also facilitates friction parameter estimation and adaptive grasping control.</p></details> | 21 pages, 19 figures |

However, most approaches are based on the assumption of the availability of and accessibility to a sufficiently dense data source, which is rather the rare case in reality. Traffic sensors in road networks are generally highly sparse in their distribution: fleet-based traffic sensing is sparse in space but also sparse in time. There are also other traffic application, besides road traffic, like moving objects in the marine space, where observations are sparsely and arbitrarily distributed in space. In this paper, we tackle the problem of traffic prediction on sparse and spatially irregular and non-deterministic traffic observations. We draw a border between imputations and this work as we consider high sparsity rates and no fixed sensor locations. We advance correlation mining methods with a Sparse Unstructured Spatio Temporal Reconstruction (SUSTeR) framework that reconstructs traffic states from sparse non-stationary observations. For the prediction the framework creates a hidden context traffic state which is enriched in a residual fashion with each observation. Such an assimilated hidden traffic state can be used by existing traffic prediction methods to predict future traffic states. We query these states with query locations from the spatial domain.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted and presented at ACM SIGSPATIAL '23</p></details> |

However, existing whole-body-object interaction video benchmarks overlook the truth that open-world objects are diverse, that is, they usually provide limited and predefined object classes. Therefore, we introduce a new open-world benchmark: Grounding Interacted Objects (GIO) including 1,098 interacted objects class and 290K interacted object boxes annotation. Accordingly, an object grounding task is proposed expecting vision systems to discover interacted objects. Even though today's detectors and grounding methods have succeeded greatly, they perform unsatisfactorily in localizing diverse and rare objects in GIO. This profoundly reveals the limitations of current vision systems and poses a great challenge. Thus, we explore leveraging spatio-temporal cues to address object grounding and propose a 4D question-answering framework (4D-QA) to discover interacted objects from diverse videos.

HD EEG devices improve the spatial resolution of EEG by placing more electrodes on the scalp, which meet the requirements of clinical diagnostic applications such as epilepsy focus localization. However, this technique faces challenges, such as high acquisition costs and limited usage scenarios. In this paper, spatio-temporal adaptive diffusion models (STAD) are proposed to pioneer the use of diffusion models for achieving spatial SR reconstruction from low-resolution (LR, 64 channels or fewer) EEG to high-resolution (HR, 256 channels) EEG. Specifically, a spatio-temporal condition module is designed to extract the spatio-temporal features of LR EEG, which are then used as conditional inputs to direct the reverse denoising process. Additionally, a multi-scale Transformer denoising module is constructed to leverage multi-scale convolution blocks and cross-attention-based diffusion Transformer blocks for conditional guidance to generate subject-adaptive SR EEG. Experimental results demonstrate that the STAD significantly enhances the spatial resolution of LR EEG and quantitatively outperforms existing methods. Furthermore, STAD demonstrate their value by applying synthetic SR EEG to classification and source localization tasks, indicating their potential to substantially boost the spatial resolution of EEG.</p></details> |  |

With around 2000 ball events per game, their precise and exhaustive annotation based on a monocular video stream remains a tedious and costly manual task. While state-of-the-art spatio-temporal action detection methods show promise for automating this task, they lack contextual understanding of the game. Assuming professional players' behaviors are interdependent, we hypothesize that incorporating surrounding players' information such as positions, velocity and team membership can enhance purely visual predictions.

Traditionally, these studies assume a fixed number of variables, but in real-world applications, Cyber-Physical Systems often expand as new sensors are deployed, increasing variables in MTSF. In light of this, we introduce a novel task, Expanding-variate Time Series Forecasting (EVTSF). This task presents unique challenges, specifically (1) handling inconsistent data shapes caused by adding new variables, and (2) addressing imbalanced spatio-temporal learning, where expanding variables have limited observed data due to the necessity for timely operation. To address these challenges, we propose STEV, a flexible spatio-temporal forecasting framework. STEV includes a new Flat Scheme to tackle the inconsistent data shape issue, which extends the graph-based spatio-temporal modeling architecture into 1D space by flattening the 2D samples along the variable dimension, making the model variable-scale-agnostic while still preserving dynamic spatial correlations through a holistic graph. We introduce a novel Spatio-temporal Focal Learning strategy that incorporates a negative filter to resolve potential conflicts between contrastive learning and graph representation, and a focal contrastive loss as its core to guide the framework to focus on optimizing the expanding variables. We benchmark EVTSF performance using three real-world datasets and compare it against three potential solutions employing SOTA MTSF models tailored for EVSTF. Experimental results show that STEV significantly outperforms its competitors, particularly on expanding variables. Notably, STEV, with only 5% of observations from the expanding period, is on par with SOTA MTSF models trained with complete observations. Further exploration of various expanding strategies underscores the generalizability of STEV in real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

In a graphon particle system, the interactions among particles are characterized by the coupled mean field terms through an underlying graphon and the randomness of the coefficients comes from the stochastic processes associated with the particle labels. By constructing two-level approximated sequences converging in 2-Wasserstein distance, we prove the existence and uniqueness of the solution to the system. Besides, by constructing two-level approximated functions converging to the graphon mean field terms, we establish the law of large numbers, which reveals that if the number of particles tends to infinity and the discretization step tends to zero, then the discrete-time interacting particle system over a large-scale network converges to the graphon particle system. As a byproduct, we discover that the graphon particle system can describe the limiting dynamics of the distributed stochastic gradient descent algorithm over the large-scale network and prove that if the gradients of the local cost functions are Lipschitz continuous, then the graphon particle system can be regarded as the spatio-temporal approximation of the discrete-time distributed stochastic gradient descent algorithm as the number of network nodes tends to infinity and the algorithm step size tends to zero.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Target Tracking to Targeting Track -- Part I: A Metric for Spatio-Temporal Trajectory Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15842v1)** | 2025-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the realm of target tracking, performance evaluation plays a pivotal role in the design, comparison, and analytics of trackers. Compared with the traditional trajectory composed of a set of point-estimates obtained by a tracker in the measurement time-series, the trajectory that our series of studies including this paper pursued is given by a curve function of time (FoT). The trajectory FoT provides complete information of the movement of the target over time and can be used to infer the state corresponding to arbitrary time, not only at the measurement time. However, there are no metrics available for comparing and evaluating the trajectory FoT. To address this lacuna, we propose a metric denominated as the spatiotemporal-aligned trajectory integral distance (Star-ID). The StarID associates and aligns the estimated and actual trajectories in the spatio-temporal domain and distinguishes between the time-aligned and unaligned segments in calculating the spatial divergence including false alarm, miss-detection and localization errors. The effectiveness of the proposed distance metric and the time-averaged version is validated through theoretical analysis and numerical examples of a single target or multiple targets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Part ...</summary><p>Part I of a series of companion papers; 11 pages, 10 figures</p></details> |

Digital Subtraction Angiography (DSA) sequences, recognized as the gold standard for diagnosing CVDs, can clearly visualize the dynamic flow and reveal pathological conditions within the cerebrovasculature. Therefore, precise segmentation of cerebral arteries (CAs) and classification between their main trunks and branches are crucial for physicians to accurately quantify diseases. However, achieving accurate CA segmentation in DSA sequences remains a challenging task due to small vessels with low contrast, and ambiguity between vessels and residual skull structures. Moreover, the lack of publicly available datasets limits exploration in the field. In this paper, we introduce a DSA Sequence-based Cerebral Artery segmentation dataset (DSCA), the publicly accessible dataset designed specifically for pixel-level semantic segmentation of CAs. Additionally, we propose DSANet, a spatio-temporal network for CA segmentation in DSA sequences. Unlike existing DSA segmentation methods that focus only on a single frame, the proposed DSANet introduces a separate temporal encoding branch to capture dynamic vessel details across multiple frames. To enhance small vessel segmentation and improve vessel connectivity, we design a novel TemporalFormer module to capture global context and correlations among sequential frames. Furthermore, we develop a Spatio-Temporal Fusion (STF) module to effectively integrate spatial and temporal features from the encoder. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DSANet outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in CA segmentation, achieving a Dice of 0.9033.</p></details> | Published by TMI |
| **[Hierarchical Spatio-Temporal Uncertainty Quantification for Distributed Energy Adoption](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12193v2)** | 2025-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid deployment of distributed energy resources (DER) has introduced significant spatio-temporal uncertainties in power grid management, necessitating accurate multilevel forecasting methods. However, existing approaches often produce overly conservative uncertainty intervals at individual spatial units and fail to properly capture uncertainties when aggregating predictions across different spatial scales. This paper presents a novel hierarchical spatio-temporal model based on the conformal prediction framework to address these challenges. Our approach generates circuit-level DER growth predictions and efficiently aggregates them to the substation level while maintaining statistical validity through a tailored non-conformity score. Applied to a decade of DER installation data from a local utility network, our method demonstrates superior performance over existing approaches, particularly in reducing prediction interval widths while maintaining coverage.</p></details> |  |

They primarily emphasize temporal sharing while overlooking spatial and spectral dimensions. We propose an adaptive, AI-driven spectrum-sharing framework within the O-RAN architecture, integrating discriminative and generative AI (GenAI) to forecast spectrum needs across multiple timescales and spatial granularities. A marketplace model, managed by an authorized spectrum broker, enables operators to trade spectrum dynamically, balancing static assignments with real-time trading. GenAI enhances traffic prediction, spectrum estimation, and allocation, optimizing utilization while reducing costs. This modular, flexible approach fosters operator collaboration, maximizing efficiency and revenue. A key research challenge is refining allocation granularity and spatio-temporal dynamics beyond existing models.</p></details> |  |

Discretization in space is based on the theory of geometric quantization, which yields a spatially discretized analogue of the MHD equations as a finite-dimensional Lie--Poisson system on the dual of the magnetic extension Lie algebra $\mathfrak{f}=\mathfrak{su}(N)\ltimes\mathfrak{su}(N)^{*}$. We also give accompanying structure preserving time discretizations for Lie--Poisson systems on the dual of semi-direct product Lie algebras of the form $\mathfrak{f}=\mathfrak{g}\ltimes\mathfrak{g^{*}}$, where $\mathfrak{g}$ is a $J$-quadratic Lie algebra. The time integration method is free of computationally costly matrix exponentials. We prove that the full method preserves a modified Lie--Poisson structure and corresponding Casimir functions, and that the modified structure and Casimirs converge to the continuous ones. The method is demonstrated for two models of magnetic fluids: incompressible magnetohydrodynamics and Hazeltine's model.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, convergence results for Casimirs added in sect. 3, typos corrected</p></details> |

We propose AQ-Net, a spatiotemporal reanalysis model for both observed and unobserved stations in the near future. AQ-Net utilizes the LSTM and multi-head attention for the temporal regression. We also propose a cyclic encoding technique to ensure continuous time representation. To learn fine-grained spatial air quality estimation, we incorporate AQ-Net with the neural kNN to explore feature-based interpolation, such that we can fill the spatial gaps given coarse observation stations. To demonstrate the efficiency of our model for spatiotemporal reanalysis, we use data from 2013-2017 collected in northern China for PM2.5 analysis. Extensive experiments show that AQ-Net excels in air quality reanalysis, highlighting the potential of hybrid spatio-temporal models to better capture environmental dynamics, especially in urban areas where both spatial and temporal variability are critical.</p></details> |  |

Existing spatio-temporal data secure retrieval schemes have significant shortcomings regarding dynamic updates, either compromising privacy through leakage during updates (forward insecurity) or incurring excessively high update costs that hinder practical application. Under these circumstances, we first propose a basic filter-based spatio-temporal range query scheme \TrinityI that supports low-cost dynamic updates and automatic expansion. Furthermore, to improve security, reduce storage cost, and false positives, we propose a forward secure and verifiable scheme \TrinityII that simultaneously minimizes storage overhead. A formal security analysis proves that \TrinityI and \TrinityII are Indistinguishable under Selective Chosen-Plaintext Attack (IND-SCPA). Finally, extensive experiments demonstrate that our design \TrinityII significantly reduces storage requirements by 80\%, enables data retrieval at the 1 million-record level in just 0.01 seconds, and achieves 10 $\times$ update efficiency than state-of-art.</p></details> | 14pages,6 figures |

Naturally, automated detection of forged Deepfake videos is attracting a proportional amount of interest of researchers. Current methods for detecting forged videos mainly rely on global frame features and under-utilize the spatio-temporal inconsistencies found in the manipulated videos. Moreover, they fail to attend to manipulation-specific subtle and well-localized pattern variations along both spatial and temporal dimensions. Addressing these gaps, we propose a neural Deepfake detector that focuses on the localized manipulative signatures of the forged videos at individual frame level as well as frame sequence level. Using a ResNet backbone, it strengthens the shallow frame-level feature learning with a spatial attention mechanism. The spatial stream of the model is further helped by fusing texture enhanced shallow features with the deeper features. Simultaneously, the model processes frame sequences with a distance attention mechanism that further allows fusion of temporal attention maps with the learned features at the deeper layers. The overall model is trained to detect forged content as a classifier. We evaluate our method on two popular large data sets and achieve significant performance over the state-of-the-art methods.Moreover, our technique also provides memory and computational advantages over the competitive techniques.</p></details> |  |

Full-scale resolving simulations for systems such as highly turbulent flows are not feasible in the foreseeable future, and reduced-order models must capture dynamics that involve interactions across scales. In the present work, we propose a novel framework, Graph-based Learning of Effective Dynamics (Graph-LED), that leverages graph neural networks (GNNs), as well as an attention-based autoregressive model, to extract the effective dynamics from a small amount of simulation data. GNNs represent flow fields on unstructured meshes as graphs and effectively handle complex geometries and non-uniform grids. The proposed method combines a GNN based, dimensionality reduction for variable-size unstructured meshes with an autoregressive temporal attention model that can learn temporal dependencies automatically. We evaluated the proposed approach on a suite of fluid dynamics problems, including flow past a cylinder and flow over a backward-facing step over a range of Reynolds numbers. The results demonstrate robust and effective forecasting of spatio-temporal physics; in the case of the flow past a cylinder, both small-scale effects that occur close to the cylinder as well as its wake are accurately captured.</p></details> | <details><summary>Confe...</summary><p>Conference on Parsimony and Learning (CPAL)</p></details> |

However, despite the prevalence of spatio-temporal data in critical domains such as transportation, public health, and environmental monitoring, spatio-temporal foundation models (STFMs) have not yet achieved comparable success. In this paper, we articulate a vision for the future of STFMs, outlining their essential characteristics and the generalization capabilities necessary for broad applicability. We critically assess the current state of research, identifying gaps relative to these ideal traits, and highlight key challenges that impede their progress. Finally, we explore potential opportunities and directions to advance research towards the aim of effective and broadly applicable STFMs.</p></details> |  |

Real-world measurements of such processes are often collected at irregularly distributed points in space, which can be effectively represented as graphs; however, there are currently only a few existing datasets. Our work aims to make advancements in the field of PDE-modeling accessible to the temporal graph machine learning community, while addressing the data scarcity problem, by creating and utilizing datasets based on PDEs. In this work, we create and use synthetic datasets based on PDEs to support spatio-temporal graph modeling in machine learning for different applications. More precisely, we showcase three equations to model different types of disasters and hazards in the fields of epidemiology, atmospheric particles, and tsunami waves. Further, we show how such created datasets can be used by benchmarking several machine learning models on the epidemiological dataset. Additionally, we show how pre-training on this dataset can improve model performance on real-world epidemiological data. The presented methods enable others to create datasets and benchmarks customized to individual requirements.

In particular, ride-hailing vehicles can effectively facilitate flexible data collection and contribute towards urban intelligence, despite resource limitations. Therefore, this work explores a promising scenario, where edge-assisted vehicles perform joint tasks of order serving and the emerging foundation model fine-tuning using various urban data. However, integrating the VCS AI task with the conventional order serving task is challenging, due to their inconsistent spatio-temporal characteristics: (i) The distributions of ride orders and data point-of-interests (PoIs) may not coincide in geography, both following a priori unknown patterns; (ii) they have distinct forms of temporal effects, i.e., prolonged waiting makes orders become instantly invalid while data with increased staleness gradually reduces its utility for model fine-tuning.To overcome these obstacles, we propose an online framework based on multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) with careful augmentation. A new quality-of-service (QoS) metric is designed to characterize and balance the utility of the two joint tasks, under the effects of varying data volumes and staleness. We also integrate graph neural networks (GNNs) with MARL to enhance state representations, capturing graph-structured, time-varying dependencies among vehicles and across locations. Extensive experiments on our testbed simulator, utilizing various real-world foundation model fine-tuning tasks and the New York City Taxi ride order dataset, demonstrate the advantage of our proposed method.</p></details> |  |

This progress enables applications such as match outcome prediction, player scouting, and tactical analysis. In soccer, the effective utilization of event and tracking data is fundamental for capturing and analyzing the dynamics of the game. However, there are two primary challenges: the limited availability of event data, primarily restricted to top-tier teams and leagues, and the scarcity and high cost of tracking data, which complicates its integration with event data for comprehensive analysis. Here we propose OpenSTARLab, an open-source framework designed to democratize spatio-temporal agent data analysis in sports by addressing these key challenges. OpenSTARLab includes the Pre-processing Package that standardizes event and tracking data through Unified and Integrated Event Data and State-Action-Reward formats, the Event Modeling Package that implements deep learning-based event prediction, alongside the RLearn Package for reinforcement learning tasks. These technical components facilitate the handling of diverse data sources and support advanced analytical tasks, thereby enhancing the overall functionality and usability of the framework. To assess OpenSTARLab's effectiveness, we conducted several experimental evaluations. These demonstrate the superior performance of the specific event prediction model in terms of action and time prediction accuracies and maintained its robust event simulation performance. Furthermore, reinforcement learning experiments reveal a trade-off between action accuracy and temporal difference loss and show comprehensive visualization. Overall, OpenSTARLab serves as a robust platform for researchers and practitioners, enhancing innovation and collaboration in the field of soccer data analytics.</p></details> | <details><summary>OpenS...</summary><p>OpenSTARLab is available at https://github.com/open-starlab, and its documentation can be found at https://openstarlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/</p></details> |

This task is however challenging due to multiple sign variations, complexity in language and inherent richness of expressions. Computational approaches have evidenced capabilities to support SLT. Nonetheless, these approaches remain limited to cover gestures variability and support long sequence translations. This paper introduces a Transformer-based architecture that encodes spatio-temporal motion gestures, preserving both local and long-range spatial information through the use of multiple convolutional and attention mechanisms. The proposed approach was validated on the Colombian Sign Language Translation Dataset (CoL-SLTD) outperforming baseline approaches, and achieving a BLEU4 of 46.84%. Additionally, the proposed approach was validated on the RWTH-PHOENIX-Weather-2014T (PHOENIX14T), achieving a BLEU4 score of 30.77%, demonstrating its robustness and effectiveness in handling real-world variations</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we adapt and specialise the robust and conjugate GP (RCGP) framework of Altamirano et al. (2024) to the spatio-temporal setting. In doing so, we obtain an outlier-robust spatio-temporal GP with a computational cost comparable to classical spatio-temporal GPs. We also overcome the three main drawbacks of RCGPs: their unreliable performance when the prior mean is chosen poorly, their lack of reliable uncertainty quantification, and the need to carefully select a hyperparameter by hand. We study our method extensively in finance and weather forecasting applications, demonstrating that it provides a reliable approach to spatio-temporal modelling in the presence of outliers.</p></details> |  |

Spatio-semantic graphs are a useful tool for analyzing this narrative path from transcripts alone, however they are limited by the need for manual tagging of content information units (CIUs). In this paper, we propose an automated approach for estimation of spatio-semantic graphs (via automated extraction of CIUs) from the Cookie Theft picture commonly used in cognitive-linguistic analyses. The method enables the automatic characterization of the visual semantic path during picture description. Experiments demonstrate that the automatic spatio-semantic graphs effectively differentiate between cognitively impaired and unimpaired speakers. Statistical analyses reveal that the features derived by the automated method produce comparable results to the manual method, with even greater group differences between clinical groups of interest. These results highlight the potential of the automated approach for extracting spatio-semantic features in developing clinical speech models for cognitive impairment assessment.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in ICASSP 2025</p></details> |

For this purpose, spatial homogeneity and temporal stationarity are widely used assumptions, and many parametric covariance models have been developed under these assumptions. However, these are strong and unrealistic conditions in many cases. In addition, on the sphere, although different statistical approaches from those on Euclidean space should be applied to build a proper covariance model considering its unique characteristics, relevant studies are rare. In this research, we introduce novel parameterized models of the covariance function for spatially non-homogeneous and temporally non-stationary random processes on the sphere. To alleviate the spatial homogeneity assumption and temporal stationarity, and to consider the spherical domain and time domain together, this research will apply the theories of Intrinsic Random Functions (IRF). We also provide a methodology to estimate the associated parameters for the model. Finally, through a simulation study and analysis of a real-world data set about global temperature anomaly, we demonstrate validity of the suggested covariance model with its advantage of interpretability.</p></details> |  |

Motivated by this observation, we develop a novel class of test-time optimization methods to re-weight or "re-mixing" the experts in different layers jointly for each test sample. Since the test sample's ground truth is unknown, we propose to optimize a surrogate objective defined by the sample's "successful neighbors" from a reference set of samples. We introduce three surrogates and algorithms based on mode-finding, kernel regression, and the average loss of similar reference samples/tasks. To reduce the cost of optimizing whole pathways, we apply our algorithms merely to the core experts' mixing weights in critical layers, which enjoy similar performance but save significant computation. This leads to "Critical-Layer, Core-Expert, Collaborative Pathway Optimization (C3PO)". We apply C3PO to two recent MoE LLMs and examine it on six widely-used benchmarks. It consistently improves the base model by 7-15% in accuracy and outperforms widely used test-time learning baselines, e.g., in-context learning and prompt/prefix tuning, by a large margin. Moreover, C3PO enables MoE LLMs with 1-3B active parameters to outperform LLMs of 7-9B parameters, hence improving MoE's advantages on efficiency. Our thorough ablation study further sheds novel insights on achieving test-time improvement on MoE.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamic Cheatsheet: Test-Time Learning with Adaptive Memory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07952v1)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite their impressive performance on complex tasks, current language models (LMs) typically operate in a vacuum: Each input query is processed separately, without retaining insights from previous attempts. Here, we present Dynamic Cheatsheet (DC), a lightweight framework that endows a black-box LM with a persistent, evolving memory. Rather than repeatedly re-discovering or re-committing the same solutions and mistakes, DC enables models to store and reuse accumulated strategies, code snippets, and general problem-solving insights at inference time. This test-time learning enhances performance substantially across a range of tasks without needing explicit ground-truth labels or human feedback. Leveraging DC, Claude 3.5 Sonnet's accuracy more than doubled on AIME math exams once it began retaining algebraic insights across questions. Similarly, GPT-4o's success rate on Game of 24 increased from 10% to 99% after the model discovered and reused a Python-based solution. In tasks prone to arithmetic mistakes, such as balancing equations, DC enabled GPT-4o and Claude to reach near-perfect accuracy by recalling previously validated code, whereas their baselines stagnated around 50%. Beyond arithmetic challenges, DC yields notable accuracy gains on knowledge-demanding tasks. Claude achieved a 9% improvement in GPQA-Diamond and an 8% boost on MMLU-Pro problems. Crucially, DC's memory is self-curated, focusing on concise, transferable snippets rather than entire transcript. Unlike finetuning or static retrieval methods, DC adapts LMs' problem-solving skills on the fly, without modifying their underlying parameters. Overall, our findings present DC as a promising approach for augmenting LMs with persistent memory, bridging the divide between isolated inference events and the cumulative, experience-driven learning characteristic of human cognition.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://github.com/suzgunmirac/dynamic-cheatsheet</p></details> |

In particular, we introduce a Temporal Tensor Formalism to describe multidimensional time, define Quantum Shortcut Operators that enact near-instantaneous state transitions, and incorporate these into a supermaze topological model inspired by labyrinthine geometry and network complexity. We show how this framework can give rise to surprising effects such as anomalous thermodynamic relaxation (analogous to the Mpemba effect) in quantum systems. Theoretical implications for quantum computing (including quantum cloud networks) are discussed, and connections are drawn to established mathematical paradoxes and physical principles.</p></details> |  |
| **[SpecReason: Fast and Accurate Inference-Time Compute via Speculative Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07891v1)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in inference-time compute have significantly improved performance on complex tasks by generating long chains of thought (CoTs) using Large Reasoning Models (LRMs). However, this improved accuracy comes at the cost of high inference latency due to the length of generated reasoning sequences and the autoregressive nature of decoding. Our key insight in tackling these overheads is that LRM inference, and the reasoning that it embeds, is highly tolerant of approximations: complex tasks are typically broken down into simpler steps, each of which brings utility based on the semantic insight it provides for downstream steps rather than the exact tokens it generates. Accordingly, we introduce SpecReason, a system that automatically accelerates LRM inference by using a lightweight model to (speculatively) carry out simpler intermediate reasoning steps and reserving the costly base model only to assess (and potentially correct) the speculated outputs. Importantly, SpecReason's focus on exploiting the semantic flexibility of thinking tokens in preserving final-answer accuracy is complementary to prior speculation techniques, most notably speculative decoding, which demands token-level equivalence at each step. Across a variety of reasoning benchmarks, SpecReason achieves 1.5-2.5$\times$ speedup over vanilla LRM inference while improving accuracy by 1.0-9.9\%. Compared to speculative decoding without SpecReason, their combination yields an additional 19.4-44.2\% latency reduction.

| **[First Real-Time Detection of Ambient Backscatters using Uplink Sounding Reference Signals of a Commercial 4G Smartphone](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15576v2)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, cellular Ambient Backscattering has been proposed for cellular networks. Up to now an Ambient backscatter device, called zero-energy device or tag, broadcasted its message by backscattering ambient downlink waves from the closest Base Station (BS) according to a predefined pattern. A tag was detected by smartphones nearby. This paper presents, for the first time, a novel ambient backscatter communication system exploiting uplink ambient waves from smartphones instead of downlink waves. In this novel system, a BS connected to a smartphone monitors the uplink pilot signals and detects TAGs in proximity. The proposed system is implemented and tested with one prototype of TAG, a commercial off-the shelf 4G smartphone and a 4G Software Defined Radio (SDR) BS. Indoor and outdoor experiments were conducted to assess the proposed technique. These very preliminary experiments exhibit a promising potential. In indoor, a detection probability of more than 90% has been achieved without false alarm when the TAG was 3 meters from the UE, and the BS 20 meters away of them, behind walls and obstacles.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 19 figures, submitted to JRFID (2nd round after revision)</p></details> |

However, these models still face challenges scaling storage efficiently. Inspired by psychological theories of continuous neural resource allocation in working memory, we propose an approach that compresses large discrete Hopfield memories into smaller, continuous-time memories. Leveraging continuous attention, our new energy function modifies the update rule of HNs, replacing the traditional softmax-based probability mass function with a probability density, over the continuous memory. This formulation aligns with modern perspectives on human executive function, offering a principled link between attractor dynamics in working memory and resource-efficient memory allocation. Our framework maintains competitive performance with HNs while leveraging a compressed memory, reducing computational costs across synthetic and video datasets.</p></details> |  |

However, the main challenge in implementing ECA lies in accessing real-world or historical clinical trials data. Indeed, regulations protecting patients' rights by strictly controlling data processing make pooling data from multiple sources in a central server often difficult. To address these limitations, we develop a new method, 'FedECA' that leverages federated learning (FL) to enable inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) for time-to-event outcomes on separate cohorts without needing to pool data. To showcase the potential of FedECA, we apply it in different settings of increasing complexity culminating with a real-world use-case in which FedECA is used to compare the treatment effect of two approved chemotherapy regimens using data from three separate cohorts of patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer. By sharing our code, we hope FedECA will foster the creation of federated research networks and thus accelerate drug development.</p></details> | <details><summary>code ...</summary><p>code available at: https://github.com/owkin/fedeca, bug in SMD present in v1 and v2 fixed, experiments on real data added + fix in YODA experiments (v3->v4) + affiliations fix + more precise wording for acknowledgments, real-world experiment results fixed by excluding data with bias + text polished (v5->v6) + updating abs(v6->v7)+ typo (v7->v8)</p></details> |

However, existing architectures generally process their input at a single temporal scale, which may be sub-optimal for many tasks where information changes over multiple time scales. In this paper, we introduce a novel architecture called Multi-scale Mamba (ms-Mamba) to address this gap. ms-Mamba incorporates multiple temporal scales by using multiple Mamba blocks with different sampling rates ($\Delta$s). Our experiments on many benchmarks demonstrate that ms-Mamba outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, including the recently proposed Transformer-based and Mamba-based models.</p></details> |  |

Our approach bridges cage-based deformation and 3DGS by using a proxy point-cloud representation. This point cloud is generated from 3D Gaussians, and deformations applied to the point cloud are translated into transformations on the 3D Gaussians. To handle potential bending caused by deformation, we incorporate a splitting process to approximate it. Our method does not modify or extend the core architecture of 3D Gaussian Splatting, making it compatible with any trained vanilla 3DGS or its variants. Additionally, we automate cage construction for 3DGS and its variants using a render-and-reconstruct approach. Experiments demonstrate that GSDeformer delivers superior deformation results compared to existing methods, is robust under extreme deformations, requires no retraining for editing, runs in real-time, and can be extended to other 3DGS variants.

| **[Explicit Uncertainty Modeling for Video Watch Time Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07575v1)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In video recommendation, a critical component that determines the system's recommendation accuracy is the watch-time prediction module, since how long a user watches a video directly reflects personalized preferences. One of the key challenges of this problem is the user's stochastic watch-time behavior. To improve the prediction accuracy for such an uncertain behavior, existing approaches show that one can either reduce the noise through duration bias modeling or formulate a distribution modeling task to capture the uncertainty. However, the uncontrolled uncertainty is not always equally distributed across users and videos, inducing a balancing paradox between the model accuracy and the ability to capture out-of-distribution samples. In practice, we find that the uncertainty of the watch-time prediction model also provides key information about user behavior, which, in turn, could benefit the prediction task itself. Following this notion, we derive an explicit uncertainty modeling strategy for the prediction model and propose an adversarial optimization framework that can better exploit the user watch-time behavior. This framework has been deployed online on an industrial video sharing platform that serves hundreds of millions of daily active users, which obtains a significant increase in users' video watch time by 0.31% through the online A/B test. Furthermore, extended offline experiments on two public datasets verify the effectiveness of the proposed framework across various watch-time prediction backbones.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion Transformers for Tabular Data Time Series Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07566v1)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tabular data generation has recently attracted a growing interest due to its different application scenarios. However, generating time series of tabular data, where each element of the series depends on the others, remains a largely unexplored domain. This gap is probably due to the difficulty of jointly solving different problems, the main of which are the heterogeneity of tabular data (a problem common to non-time-dependent approaches) and the variable length of a time series. In this paper, we propose a Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) based approach for tabular data series generation. Inspired by the recent success of DiTs in image and video generation, we extend this framework to deal with heterogeneous data and variable-length sequences. Using extensive experiments on six datasets, we show that the proposed approach outperforms previous work by a large margin.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, 19 figures, 13 tables</p></details> |

Aligning Language Models through Edit-Based Writing Rewards and Test-time Computation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07532v1)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>AI-generated text is proliferating across domains, from creative writing and journalism to marketing content and scientific articles. Models can follow user-provided instructions to generate coherent and grammatically correct outputs but in this work, we study a more fundamental question: how do we evaluate and improve the writing quality of AI-generated text? Writing quality assessment has received less attention from the community, in part because it is fundamentally subjective and requires expertise. We first introduce the Writing Quality Benchmark (WQ) by consolidating five writing-preference datasets into 4,729 writing quality judgments. Our experiments show that competitive baselines, including state-of-the-art LLMs that excel at reasoning tasks, barely outperform random baselines on WQ. We then train specialized Writing Quality Reward Models (WQRM) of various sizes for writing quality assessment that demonstrate strong generalization on four out-of-distribution test sets and 74% accuracy on the WQ benchmark. To further show WQRM's practical benefits during inference, we leverage additional test-time compute to generate and rank multiple candidate revisions, allowing us to select higher-quality outputs from an initial draft. Human evaluation with 9 experienced writers confirm that WQRM-based selection produces writing samples preferred by experts 66% overall, and 72.2% when the reward gap is larger than 1 point. We release our datasets and models to encourage community engagement with writing quality assessment and development of AI writing systems better aligned with human preferences.</p></details> | Under Submission |
| **[Real-time Verification and Refinement of Language Model Text Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07824v3)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance across a wide range of natural language tasks. However, a critical challenge remains in that they sometimes generate factually incorrect answers. To address this, while many previous work has focused on identifying errors in their generation and further refining them, they are slow in deployment since they are designed to verify the response from LLMs only after their entire generation (from the first to last tokens) is done. Further, we observe that once LLMs generate incorrect tokens early on, there is a higher likelihood that subsequent tokens will also be factually incorrect. To this end, in this work, we propose Streaming-VR (Streaming Verification and Refinement), a novel approach designed to enhance the efficiency of verification and refinement of LLM outputs. Specifically, the proposed Streaming-VR enables on-the-fly verification and correction of tokens as they are being generated, similar to a streaming process, ensuring that each subset of tokens is checked and refined in real-time by another LLM as the LLM constructs its response. Through comprehensive evaluations on multiple datasets, we demonstrate that our approach not only enhances the factual accuracy of LLMs, but also offers a more efficient solution compared to prior refinement methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exact Model Reduction for Continuous-Time Open Quantum Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05102v2)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider finite-dimensional many-body quantum systems described by time-independent Hamiltonians and Markovian master equations, and present a systematic method for constructing smaller-dimensional, reduced models that exactly reproduce the time evolution of a set of initial conditions or observables of interest. Our approach exploits Krylov operator spaces and their extension to operator algebras, and may be used to obtain reduced linear models of minimal dimension, well-suited for simulation on classical computers, or reduced quantum models that preserve the structural constraints of physically admissible quantum dynamics, as required for simulation on quantum computers. Notably, we prove that the reduced quantum-dynamical generator is still in Lindblad form. By introducing a new type of observable-dependent symmetries, we show that our method provides a non-trivial generalization of techniques that leverage symmetries, unlocking new reduction opportunities. We quantitatively benchmark our method on paradigmatic open many-body systems of relevance to condensed-matter and quantum-information physics. In particular, we demonstrate how our reduced models can quantitatively describe decoherence dynamics in central-spin systems coupled to structured environments, magnetization transport in boundary-driven dissipative spin chains, and unwanted error dynamics on information encoded in a noiseless quantum code.</p></details> |  |

In PET/MR systems, computed tomography (CT), which offers a straightforward estimation of AC is not available. This study presents a deep learning approach to generate synthetic CT (sCT) images directly from Time-of-Flight (TOF) non-attenuation corrected (NAC) PET images, enhancing AC for PET/MR. We first evaluated models pre-trained on large-scale natural image datasets for a CT-to-CT reconstruction task, finding that the pre-trained model outperformed those trained solely on medical datasets. The pre-trained model was then fine-tuned using an institutional dataset of 35 TOF NAC PET and CT volume pairs, achieving the lowest mean absolute error (MAE) of 74.49 HU and highest peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) of 28.66 dB within the body contour region. Visual assessments demonstrated improved reconstruction of both bone and soft tissue structures from TOF NAC PET images. This work highlights the effectiveness of using pre-trained deep learning models for medical image translation tasks. Future work will assess the impact of sCT on PET attenuation correction and explore additional neural network architectures and datasets to further enhance performance and practical applications in PET imaging.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 pag...</summary><p>4 pages, 2 figures, ISBI 2025</p></details> |

To refine this map, we design a novel channel and spatial attention module. Addressing the challenge of sparse ground truth data in thermal imagery, we utilize knowledge distillation to boost performance without increasing computational demands.

| **[AMAD: AutoMasked Attention for Unsupervised Multivariate Time Series Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06643v2)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unsupervised multivariate time series anomaly detection (UMTSAD) plays a critical role in various domains, including finance, networks, and sensor systems. In recent years, due to the outstanding performance of deep learning in general sequential tasks, many models have been specialized for deep UMTSAD tasks and have achieved impressive results, particularly those based on the Transformer and self-attention mechanisms. However, the sequence anomaly association assumptions underlying these models are often limited to specific predefined patterns and scenarios, such as concentrated or peak anomaly patterns. These limitations hinder their ability to generalize to diverse anomaly situations, especially where the lack of labels poses significant challenges. To address these issues, we propose AMAD, which integrates \textbf{A}uto\textbf{M}asked Attention for UMTS\textbf{AD} scenarios. AMAD introduces a novel structure based on the AutoMask mechanism and an attention mixup module, forming a simple yet generalized anomaly association representation framework. This framework is further enhanced by a Max-Min training strategy and a Local-Global contrastive learning approach. By combining multi-scale feature extraction with automatic relative association modeling, AMAD provides a robust and adaptable solution to UMTSAD challenges. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model achieving competitive performance results compared to SOTA benchmarks across a variety of datasets.</p></details> | fix img issues |

They describe conditionally independent divergent evolution of taxa from common ancestors. Phylogenetic trees commonly do not have enough flexibility to adequately model all evolutionary processes. For example, introgressive hybridization, where genes can flow from one taxon to another. Phylogenetic networks model evolution not fully described by a phylogenetic tree. However, many phylogenetic network models assume ancestral taxa merge instantaneously to form ``hybrid'' descendant taxa. In contrast, our convergence-divergence models retain a single underlying ``principal'' tree, but permit gene flow over arbitrary time frames. Alternatively, convergence-divergence models can describe other biological processes leading to taxa becoming more similar over a time frame, such as replicated evolution. Here we present novel maximum likelihood-based algorithms to infer most aspects of $N$-taxon convergence-divergence models, many consistently, using a quartet-based approach. The algorithms can be applied to multiple sequence alignments restricted to genes or genomic windows or to gene presence/absence datasets.</p></details> | 73 pages, 9 figures |

No previous data structure was known that supports $O(\log n)$-time queries and polylog-time insertions. In order to achieve logarithmic queries our data structure uses a new technique related to fractional cascading that leverages the inherent geometry of this problem.

| **[Enhancing Time Series Forecasting via Multi-Level Text Alignment with LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07360v1)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The adaptation of large language models (LLMs) to time series forecasting poses unique challenges, as time series data is continuous in nature, while LLMs operate on discrete tokens. Despite the success of LLMs in natural language processing (NLP) and other structured domains, aligning time series data with language-based representations while maintaining both predictive accuracy and interpretability remains a significant hurdle. Existing methods have attempted to reprogram time series data into text-based forms, but these often fall short in delivering meaningful, interpretable results. In this paper, we propose a multi-level text alignment framework for time series forecasting using LLMs that not only improves prediction accuracy but also enhances the interpretability of time series representations. Our method decomposes time series into trend, seasonal, and residual components, which are then reprogrammed into component-specific text representations. We introduce a multi-level alignment mechanism, where component-specific embeddings are aligned with pre-trained word tokens, enabling more interpretable forecasts. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art models in accuracy while providing good interpretability.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we introduce a class of dynamical time series models for continuous random variables taking values in $(0,1)$ based on the Unit-Lindley distribution. The models pertaining to the proposed class are observation-driven ones for which, conditionally on a set of covariates, the random component is modeled by a Unit-Lindley distribution. The systematic component aims at modeling the conditional mean through a dynamical structure resembling the classical ARMA models. Parameter estimation in conducted using partial maximum likelihood, for which an asymptotic theory is available. Based on asymptotic results, the construction of confidence intervals, hypotheses testing, model selection, and forecasting can be carried on. A Monte Carlo simulation study is conducted to assess the finite sample performance of the proposed partial maximum likelihood approach. Finally, an application considering forecasting of the proportion of net electricity generated by conventional hydroelectric power in the United States is presented. The application show the versatility of the proposed method compared to other benchmarks models in the literature.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2502.18645</p></details> |

The proposed discretization scheme is based on a space-time variational formulation of the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation. In particular, the space-time method is conforming and is of Galerkin-type, i.e., trial and test spaces are equal. We consider a tensor-product approach with respect to time and space, using piecewise polynomial, continuous trial and test functions. In this case, we state the global linear system and efficient direct space-time solvers based on exploiting the Kronecker structure of the global system matrix. This leads to the Bartels-Stewart method and the fast diagonalization method. Both methods result in solving a sequence of spatial subproblems. In particular, the fast diagonalization method allows for solving the spatial subproblems in parallel, i.e., a time parallelization is possible. Numerical examples for a two-dimensional spatial domain illustrate convergence in space-time norms and show the potential of the proposed solvers.</p></details> | 8 pages |

While first-order consensus strategies are well-studied -- with known robustness to uncertainties such as time delays, time-varying weights, and nonlinearities like saturations -- the theoretical guarantees for high-order consensus are comparatively limited. We propose a compositional control framework that generates high-order consensus protocols by serially connecting stable first-order consensus operators. Under mild assumptions, we establish that the resulting high-order system inherits stability properties from its components. The proposed design is versatile and supports a wide range of real-world constraints. This is demonstrated through applications inspired by vehicular formation control, including protocols with time-varying weights, bounded time-varying delays, and saturated inputs. We derive theoretical guarantees for these settings using the proposed compositional approach and demonstrate the advantages gained compared to conventional protocols in simulations.</p></details> |  |

We propose FlashDepth, a method that satisfies all three requirements, performing depth estimation on a 2044x1148 streaming video at 24 FPS. We show that, with careful modifications to pretrained single-image depth models, these capabilities are enabled with relatively little data and training. We evaluate our approach across multiple unseen datasets against state-of-the-art depth models, and find that ours outperforms them in terms of boundary sharpness and speed by a significant margin, while maintaining competitive accuracy. We hope our model will enable various applications that require high-resolution depth, such as video editing, and online decision-making, such as robotics.</p></details> |  |

During the routing, the crosstalk effect is typically modeled by predicting coupling capacitance with congestion information. However, the timing estimation tends to be overly pessimistic, as the crosstalk-induced delay depends not only on the coupling capacitance but also on the signal arrival time. This work presents a crosstalk-aware timing estimation method using a two-step machine learning approach. Interconnects that are physically adjacent and overlap in signal timing windows are filtered first. Crosstalk delay is predicted by integrating physical topology and timing features without relying on post-routing results and the parasitic extraction.

In the Earth Observation field, satellite failure or cloud occlusion frequently results in missing time-steps, introducing uncertainties in the predicted output and causing a decline in predictive performance. While many studies address missing time-steps through data augmentation to improve model robustness, the uncertainty arising at the input level is commonly overlooked. To address this gap, we introduce Monte Carlo Temporal Dropout (MC-TD), a method that explicitly accounts for input-level uncertainty by randomly dropping time-steps during inference using a predefined dropout ratio, thereby simulating the effect of missing data. To bypass the need for costly searches for the optimal dropout ratio, we extend this approach with Monte Carlo Concrete Temporal Dropout (MC-ConcTD), a method that learns the optimal dropout distribution directly. Both MC-TD and MC-ConcTD are applied during inference, leveraging Monte Carlo sampling for uncertainty quantification. Experiments on three EO time-series datasets demonstrate that MC-ConcTD improves predictive performance and uncertainty calibration compared to existing approaches. Additionally, we highlight the advantages of adaptive dropout tuning over manual selection, making uncertainty quantification more robust and accessible for EO applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Symposium on Intelligent Data Analysis (IDA 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Quantized symbolic time series approximation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15209v2)** | 2025-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series are ubiquitous in numerous science and engineering domains, e.g., signal processing, bioinformatics, and astronomy. Previous work has verified the efficacy of symbolic time series representation in a variety of engineering applications due to its storage efficiency and numerosity reduction. The most recent symbolic aggregate approximation technique, ABBA, has been shown to preserve essential shape information of time series and improve downstream applications, e.g., neural network inference regarding prediction and anomaly detection in time series. Motivated by the emergence of high-performance hardware which enables efficient computation for low bit-width representations, we present a new quantization-based ABBA symbolic approximation technique, QABBA, which exhibits improved storage efficiency while retaining the original speed and accuracy of symbolic reconstruction. We prove an upper bound for the error arising from quantization and discuss how the number of bits should be chosen to balance this with other errors. An application of QABBA with large language models (LLMs) for time series regression is also presented, and its utility is investigated. By representing the symbolic chain of patterns on time series, QABBA not only avoids the training of embedding from scratch, but also achieves a new state-of-the-art on Monash regression dataset. The symbolic approximation to the time series offers a more efficient way to fine-tune LLMs on the time series regression task which contains various application domains. We further present a set of extensive experiments performed across various well-established datasets to demonstrate the advantages of the QABBA method for symbolic approximation.</p></details> |  |
| **[ODEStream: A Buffer-Free Online Learning Framework with ODE-based Adaptor for Streaming Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07413v2)** | 2025-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Addressing the challenges of irregularity and concept drift in streaming time series is crucial for real-world predictive modelling. Previous studies in time series continual learning often propose models that require buffering long sequences, potentially restricting the responsiveness of the inference system. Moreover, these models are typically designed for regularly sampled data, an unrealistic assumption in real-world scenarios. This paper introduces ODEStream, a novel buffer-free continual learning framework that incorporates a temporal isolation layer to capture temporal dependencies within the data. Simultaneously, it leverages the capability of neural ordinary differential equations to process irregular sequences and generate a continuous data representation, enabling seamless adaptation to changing dynamics in a data streaming scenario. Our approach focuses on learning how the dynamics and distribution of historical data change over time, facilitating direct processing of streaming sequences. Evaluations on benchmark real-world datasets demonstrate that ODEStream outperforms the state-of-the-art online learning and streaming analysis baseline models, providing accurate predictions over extended periods while minimising performance degradation over time by learning how the sequence dynamics change.

| **[TESSERACT: Eliminating Experimental Bias in Malware Classification across Space and Time (Extended Version)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01359v2)** | 2025-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine learning (ML) plays a pivotal role in detecting malicious software. Despite the high F1-scores reported in numerous studies reaching upwards of 0.99, the issue is not completely solved. Malware detectors often experience performance decay due to constantly evolving operating systems and attack methods, which can render previously learned knowledge insufficient for accurate decision-making on new inputs. This paper argues that commonly reported results are inflated due to two pervasive sources of experimental bias in the detection task: spatial bias caused by data distributions that are not representative of a real-world deployment; and temporal bias caused by incorrect time splits of data, leading to unrealistic configurations. To address these biases, we introduce a set of constraints for fair experiment design, and propose a new metric, AUT, for classifier robustness in real-world settings. We additionally propose an algorithm designed to tune training data to enhance classifier performance. Finally, we present TESSERACT, an open-source framework for realistic classifier comparison. Our evaluation encompasses both traditional ML and deep learning methods, examining published works on an extensive Android dataset with 259,230 samples over a five-year span. Additionally, we conduct case studies in the Windows PE and PDF domains. Our findings identify the existence of biases in previous studies and reveal that significant performance enhancements are possible through appropriate, periodic tuning. We explore how mitigation strategies may support in achieving a more stable and better performance over time by employing multiple strategies to delay performance decay.</p></details> | <details><summary>30 pa...</summary><p>30 pages. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1807.07838</p></details> |

While biology makes use of spikes to seamless use both spike timing and mean firing rate to modulate synaptic strength, most models focus on one of the two. In this work, we present a Hebbian local learning rule that models synaptic modification as a function of calcium traces tracking neuronal activity. We show how the rule reproduces results from spike time and spike rate protocols from neuroscientific studies. Moreover, we use the model to train spiking neural networks on MNIST digit recognition to show and explain what sort of mechanisms are needed to learn real-world patterns. We show how our model is sensitive to correlated spiking activity and how this enables it to modulate the learning rate of the network without altering the mean firing rate of the neurons nor the hyparameters of the learning rule. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that showcases how spike timing and rate can be complementary in their role of shaping the connectivity of spiking neural networks.</p></details> |  |

The ability to search time-series signals based on descriptive queries is essential in domains such as industrial diagnostics, where data scientists often need to find signals with specific characteristics. However, existing methods rely on sketch-based inputs, predefined synonym dictionaries, or domain-specific manual designs, limiting their scalability and adaptability. CLaSP addresses these challenges by employing contrastive learning to map time-series signals to natural language descriptions. Unlike prior approaches, it eliminates the need for predefined synonym dictionaries and leverages the rich contextual knowledge of large language models (LLMs). Using the TRUCE and SUSHI datasets, which pair time-series signals with natural language descriptions, we demonstrate that CLaSP achieves high accuracy in retrieving a variety of time series patterns based on natural language queries.</p></details> |  |

Memory bit-flips can severely degrade DNN accuracy, while traditional protection approaches like Triple Modular Redundancy (TMR) often sacrifice accuracy to maintain reliability, creating a three-way dilemma between reliability, accuracy, and timeliness. We introduce NAPER, a novel protection approach that addresses this challenge through ensemble learning. Unlike conventional redundancy methods, NAPER employs heterogeneous model redundancy, where diverse models collectively achieve higher accuracy than any individual model. This is complemented by an efficient fault detection mechanism and a real-time scheduler that prioritizes meeting deadlines by intelligently scheduling recovery operations without interrupting inference. Our evaluations demonstrate NAPER's superiority: 40% faster inference in both normal and fault conditions, maintained accuracy 4.2% higher than TMR-based strategies, and guaranteed uninterrupted operation even during fault recovery. NAPER effectively balances the competing demands of accuracy, reliability, and timeliness in real-time DNN applications</p></details> | 8 pages, 8 figures |

StreamCodec adopts a fully causal, symmetric encoder-decoder structure and operates in the modified discrete cosine transform (MDCT) domain, aiming for low-latency inference and real-time efficient generation. To improve codebook utilization efficiency and compensate for the audio quality loss caused by structural causality, StreamCodec introduces a novel residual scalar-vector quantizer (RSVQ). The RSVQ sequentially connects scalar quantizers and improved vector quantizers in a residual manner, constructing coarse audio contours and refining acoustic details, respectively. Experimental results confirm that the proposed StreamCodec achieves decoded audio quality comparable to advanced non-streamable neural audio codecs. Specifically, on the 16 kHz LibriTTS dataset, StreamCodec attains a ViSQOL score of 4.30 at 1.5 kbps. It has a fixed latency of only 20 ms and achieves a generation speed nearly 20 times real-time on a CPU, with a lightweight model size of just 7M parameters, making it highly suitable for real-time communication applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Signal Processing Letters</p></details> |

This paper presents a novel model, WaveHiTS, which integrates wavelet transform with Neural Hierarchical Interpolation for Time Series to address these challenges. Our approach decomposes wind direction into U-V components, applies wavelet transform to capture multi-scale frequency patterns, and utilizes a hierarchical structure to model temporal dependencies at multiple scales, effectively mitigating error propagation. Experiments conducted on real-world meteorological data from Inner Mongolia, China demonstrate that WaveHiTS significantly outperforms deep learning models (RNN, LSTM, GRU), transformer-based approaches (TFT, Informer, iTransformer), and hybrid models (EMD-LSTM). The proposed model achieves RMSE values of approximately 19.2{\deg}-19.4{\deg} compared to 56{\deg}-64{\deg} for deep learning recurrent models, maintaining consistent accuracy across all forecasting steps up to 60 minutes ahead. Moreover, WaveHiTS demonstrates superior robustness with vector correlation coefficients (VCC) of 0.985-0.987 and hit rates of 88.5%-90.1%, substantially outperforming baseline models. Ablation studies confirm that each component-wavelet transform, hierarchical structure, and U-V decomposition-contributes meaningfully to overall performance. These improvements in wind direction nowcasting have significant implications for enhancing wind turbine yaw control efficiency and grid integration of wind energy.</p></details> |  |

This study addresses these limitations by employing a multi-viewpoint camera recording system, capturing the surgical procedure from six different angles to mitigate occlusions. We propose a fully supervised learning-based time series prediction method to choose the best shot sequences from multiple simultaneously recorded video streams, ensuring optimal viewpoints at each moment. Our time series prediction model forecasts future camera selections by extracting and fusing visual and semantic features from surgical videos using pre-trained models. These features are processed by a temporal prediction network with TimeBlocks to capture sequential dependencies. A linear embedding layer reduces dimensionality, and a Softmax classifier selects the optimal camera view based on the highest probability. In our experiments, we created five groups of open thyroidectomy videos, each with simultaneous recordings from six different angles. The results demonstrate that our method achieves competitive accuracy compared to traditional supervised methods, even when predicting over longer time horizons. Furthermore, our approach outperforms state-of-the-art time series prediction techniques on our dataset. This manuscript makes a unique contribution by presenting an innovative framework that advances surgical video analysis techniques, with significant implications for improving surgical education and patient safety.</p></details> |  |

However, resource allocation for workflows, particularly those with branching structures, is complicated by cold starts and network delays between dependent functions, significantly degrading execution efficiency and response times. In this paper, we propose the Invocation Concurrency Prediction-Based Scaling (ICPS) algorithm to address these challenges. ICPS employs Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to predict function concurrency, dynamically pre-warming function instances, and an affinity-based deployment strategy to co-locate dependent functions on the same worker node, minimizing network latency. The experimental results demonstrate that ICPS consistently outperforms existing approaches in diverse scenarios. The results confirm ICPS as a robust and scalable solution for optimizing serverless workflow execution.</p></details> |  |

The optimization process yields an optimal control sequence that depends on the initial conditions and system parameters. However, the optimal sequence may result in undesirable behavior if the system's initial conditions and parameters are erroneous. This work presents a data-driven fuzzy controller synthesis framework that is guided by a time-optimal trajectory for multicopter tracking problems. In particular, we consider an aggressive maneuver consisting of a mid-air flip and generate a time-optimal trajectory by numerically solving the two-point boundary value problem. A fuzzy controller consisting of a stabilizing controller near hover conditions and an autoregressive moving average (ARMA) controller, trained to mimic the time-optimal aggressive trajectory, is constructed using the Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 10 figures, submitted to MECC 2025</p></details> |
| **[LassoRNet: Accurate dim-light melatonin onset time prediction from multiple blood tissue samples](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06494v1)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Research on chemotherapy, heart surgery, and vaccines has indicated that the risks and benefits of a treatment could vary depending on the time of day it is administered. A challenge with performing studies on timing treatment administration is that the optimal treatment time is different for each patient, as it would be based on a patient's internal clock time (ICT) rather than the 24-hour day-night cycle time. Prediction methods have been developed to determine a patient's ICT based on biomarker measurements, which can be leveraged to personalize treatment time. However, these methods face two limitations. First, these methods are designed to output predictions given biomarker measurements from a single tissue sample, when multiple tissue samples can be collected over time. Second, these methods are based on linear modelling frameworks, which would not capture the potentially complex relationships between biomarkers and a patient's ICT. To address these two limitations, this paper introduces a recurrent neural network framework, which we refer to as LassoRNet, for predicting the ICT at which a patient's biomarkers are measured as well as the underlying offset between a patient's ICT and the 24-hour day-night cycle time, or that patient's dim-light melatonin onset (DLMO) time. A novel feature of LassoRNet is a proposed variable selection scheme that minimizes the number of biomarkers needed to predict ICT. We evaluate LassoRNet on three longitudinal circadian transcriptome study data sets where DLMO time was determined for each study participant, and find that it consistently outperforms state-of-the art in both ICT and DLMO time prediction. Notably, LassoRNet obtains a median absolute error of approximately one hour in ICT prediction and 30 to 40 minutes in DLMO time prediction, where DLMO time prediction is performed using three samples collected at sequential time points.</p></details> |  |

However, most of the solutions proposed so far either rely on unrealistic assumptions on the nature of the objective function or do not offer any theoretical guarantees. We propose the first analysis that asymptotically bounds the cumulative regret of TVBO algorithms under mild and realistic assumptions only. In particular, we provide an algorithm-independent lower regret bound and an upper regret bound that holds for a large class of TVBO algorithms. Based on this analysis, we formulate recommendations for TVBO algorithms and show how an algorithm (BOLT) that follows them performs better than the state-of-the-art of TVBO through experiments on synthetic and real-world problems.</p></details> |  |

We design formally a dynamic multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wireless link that can coexist in the fixed congested frequency band by (a) optimally avoiding sensed interference in the joint space-time domain, and (b) protecting existing links by minimizing its own transmitted power in the band. In particular, the transmit beam weight vector and time domain pulse code sequence are jointly optimized to minimize the transmit energy per bit per antenna, while maintaining a pre-defined signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) at the output of the joint space-time maximum SINR receiver filter. Extensive numerical studies are carried out to demonstrate the derived algorithmic solution in light and heavily congested band scenarios with non-cooperative co-channel links. We show that the proposed autonomously reconfigurable 4x4 MIMO link outperforms a non-adaptive transceiver and other forms of waveform shaping in terms of the pre-detection SINR performance and the capability to protect ongoing non-cooperative links by not occupying the band with redundant transmissions.</p></details> |  |

| **[Bounds in Wasserstein Distance for Locally Stationary Functional Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06453v1)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Functional time series (FTS) extend traditional methodologies to accommodate data observed as functions/curves. A significant challenge in FTS consists of accurately capturing the time-dependence structure, especially with the presence of time-varying covariates. When analyzing time series with time-varying statistical properties, locally stationary time series (LSTS) provide a robust framework that allows smooth changes in mean and variance over time. This work investigates Nadaraya-Watson (NW) estimation procedure for the conditional distribution of locally stationary functional time series (LSFTS), where the covariates reside in a semi-metric space endowed with a semi-metric. Under small ball probability and mixing condition, we establish convergence rates of NW estimator for LSFTS with respect to Wasserstein distance. The finite-sample performances of the model and the estimation method are illustrated through extensive numerical experiments both on functional simulated and real data.</p></details> |  |

Accurately assessing an operator's mental state is critical for maintaining performance and well-being. We use subjective time perception, which can be altered by stress and cognitive load, as a sensitive, low-latency indicator of well-being and cognitive strain. Distortions in time perception can affect decision-making, reaction times, and overall task effectiveness, making it a valuable metric for adaptive human-swarm interaction systems. We study how human physiological signals can be used to estimate a person's subjective time perception in a human-swarm interaction scenario as example. A human operator needs to guide and control a swarm of small mobile robots. We obtain eye-tracking data that is classified for subjective time perception based on questionnaire data. Our results show that we successfully estimate a person's time perception from eye-tracking data. The approach can profit from individual-based pretraining using only 30 seconds of data. In future work, we aim for robots that respond to human operator needs by automatically classifying physiological data in a closed control loop.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

However, existing drone detection systems often struggle in real-world settings due to environmental noise and sensor limitations. This paper introduces TRIDENT, a tri-modal drone detection framework that integrates synchronized audio, visual, and RF data to enhance robustness and reduce dependence on individual sensors. TRIDENT introduces two fusion strategies - Late Fusion and GMU Fusion - to improve multi-modal integration while maintaining efficiency. The framework incorporates domain-specific feature extraction techniques alongside a specialized data augmentation pipeline that simulates real-world sensor degradation to improve generalization capabilities. A diverse multi-sensor dataset is collected in urban and non-urban environments under varying lighting conditions, ensuring comprehensive evaluation. Experimental results show that TRIDENT achieves 98.8 percent accuracy in real-world recordings and 83.26 percent in a more complex setting (augmented data), outperforming unimodal and dual-modal baselines. Moreover, TRIDENT operates in real-time, detecting drones in just 6.09 ms while consuming only 75.27 mJ per detection, making it highly efficient for resource-constrained devices.

Particularly, we revisit residual NNs due to their popularity in computer vision and our hypothesis that residual blocks are a primary cause of data leakage owing to the use of skip connections. By formulating inference-time data leakage as a constrained optimization problem, we propose a novel backward feature inversion method, \textbf{PEEL}, which can effectively recover block-wise input features from the intermediate output of residual NNs. The surprising results in high-quality input data recovery can be explained by the intuition that the output from these residual blocks can be considered as a noisy version of the input and thus the output retains sufficient information for input recovery. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our layer-by-layer feature inversion method on facial image datasets and pre-trained classifiers. Our results show that PEEL outperforms the state-of-the-art recovery methods by an order of magnitude when evaluated by mean squared error (MSE).

We apply a model-free approach that relies neither on knowledge of model parameters nor on their estimations, and devise an RL algorithm to learn the optimal policy parameter directly. Our main contributions include the introduction of an exploration schedule and a regret analysis of the proposed algorithm. We provide the convergence rate of the policy parameter to the optimal one, and prove that the algorithm achieves a regret bound of $O(N^{\frac{3}{4}})$ up to a logarithmic factor, where $N$ is the number of learning episodes. We conduct a simulation study to validate the theoretical results and demonstrate the effectiveness and reliability of the proposed algorithm. We also perform numerical comparisons between our method and those of the recent model-based stochastic LQ RL studies adapted to the state- and control-dependent volatility setting, demonstrating a better performance of the former in terms of regret bounds.</p></details> | 42 pages, 4 figures |

This problem has been particularly studied in the case of time series, and is known as Early Classification of Time Series (ECTS). Although it has been the subject of a growing body of literature, there is still a lack of a systematic, shared evaluation protocol to compare the relative merits of the various existing methods. This document begins by situating these methods within a principle-based taxonomy. It defines dimensions for organizing their evaluation, and then reports the results of a very extensive set of experiments along these dimensions involving nine state-of-the art ECTS algorithms. In addition, these and other experiments can be carried out using an open-source library in which most of the existing ECTS algorithms have been implemented (see https://github.com/ML-EDM/ml_edm).</p></details> |  |

Current publicly available datasets are too small, not diverse and feature trivial anomalies, which hinders measurable progress in this research area. We propose a solution: a diverse, extensive, and non-trivial dataset generated via state-of-the-art simulation tools that reflects realistic behaviour of an automotive powertrain, including its multivariate, dynamic and variable-state properties. Additionally, our dataset represents a discrete-sequence problem, which remains unaddressed by previously-proposed solutions in literature. To cater for both unsupervised and semi-supervised anomaly detection settings, as well as time series generation and forecasting, we make different versions of the dataset available, where training and test subsets are offered in contaminated and clean versions, depending on the task. We also provide baseline results from a selection of approaches based on deterministic and variational autoencoders, as well as a non-parametric approach. As expected, the baseline experimentation shows that the approaches trained on the semi-supervised version of the dataset outperform their unsupervised counterparts, highlighting a need for approaches more robust to contaminated training data. Furthermore, results show that the threshold used can have a large influence on detection performance, hence more work needs to be invested in methods to find a suitable threshold without the need for labelled data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to the Big Data Research journal</p></details> |

Existing lane detection algorithms generally perform well under favorable weather conditions. However, their performance degrades significantly in adverse conditions, such as fog, which increases the risk of traffic accidents. This challenge is compounded by the lack of specialized datasets and methods designed for foggy environments. To address this, we introduce the FoggyLane dataset, captured in real-world foggy scenarios, and synthesize two additional datasets, FoggyCULane and FoggyTusimple, from existing popular lane detection datasets. Furthermore, we propose a robust Fog-Enhanced Network for lane detection, incorporating a Global Feature Fusion Module (GFFM) to capture global relationships in foggy images, a Kernel Feature Fusion Module (KFFM) to model the structural and positional relationships of lane instances, and a Low-level Edge Enhanced Module (LEEM) to address missing edge details in foggy conditions. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, with F1-scores of 95.04 on FoggyLane, 79.85 on FoggyCULane, and 96.95 on FoggyTusimple. Additionally, with TensorRT acceleration, the method reaches a processing speed of 38.4 FPS on the NVIDIA Jetson AGX Orin, confirming its real-time capabilities and robustness in foggy environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Real-Time LaCAM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06091v1)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The vast majority of Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) methods with completeness guarantees require planning full horizon paths. However, planning full horizon paths can take too long and be impractical in real-world applications. Instead, real-time planning and execution, which only allows the planner a finite amount of time before executing and replanning, is more practical for real world multi-agent systems. Several methods utilize real-time planning schemes but none are provably complete, which leads to livelock or deadlock. Our main contribution is to show the first Real-Time MAPF method with provable completeness guarantees. We do this by leveraging LaCAM (Okumura 2023) in an incremental fashion. Our results show how we can iteratively plan for congested environments with a cutoff time of milliseconds while still maintaining the same success rate as full horizon LaCAM. We also show how it can be used with a single-step learned MAPF policy. The proposed Real-Time LaCAM also provides us with a general mechanism for using iterative constraints for completeness in future real-time MAPF algorithms.</p></details> |  |
| **[Polynomial-Time PIT from (Almost) Necessary Assumptions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06044v1)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The celebrated result of Kabanets and Impagliazzo (Computational Complexity, 2004) showed that PIT algorithms imply circuit lower bounds, and vice versa. Since then it has been a major challenge to understand the precise connections between PIT and lower bounds. In particular, a main goal has been to understand which lower bounds suffice to obtain efficient PIT algorithms, and how close are they to lower bounds that are necessary for the conclusion. We construct polynomial-time PIT algorithms from lower bounds that are, up to relatively minor remaining gaps, necessary for the existence of such algorithms. That is, we prove that these lower bounds are, up to the mentioned minor gaps, both sufficient and necessary for polynomial-time PIT, over fields of characteristic zero. Over sufficiently large finite fields, we show a similar result wherein the PIT algorithm runs in time $n^{\log^{(c)}(n)}$, i.e. a power of $c$-iterated log for an arbitrarily large constant $c>1$. The key to these improvements is studying PIT versus lower bounds in the uniform setting, in which we focus on proving lower bounds for uniform arithmetic circuits and their variants (and on deducing algorithms from such lower bounds). Indeed, by working in this setting we obtain results that are significantly tighter than previously known results concerning polynomial-time PIT vs lower bounds, and are in fact also tighter than known hardness-vs-randomness connections in the Boolean setting. Our results are obtained by combining recent techniques from Boolean hardness vs randomness, and in particular the generator of Chen and Tell (FOCS 2021), with the algebraic hitting-set generator of Guo, Kumar, Saptharishi, and Solomon (SIAM J. Computing 2022) along with the bootstrapping ideas of Agrawal, Ghosh, and Saxena (STOC 2018) and of Kumar, Saptharishi, and Tengse (SODA 2019).</p></details> |  |

It is shown that the defining features of relaxation -- complete monotonicity, passivity, and memory-based storage -- carry over seamlessly to the spatio-temporal domain. An LTSI system is shown to be of relaxation type if and only if its associated spatio-temporal Hankel operator is cyclically monotone. This implies the existence of an intrinsic quadratic storage functional defined uniquely by past inputs, independently of any state-space realization. As in the LTI case, LTSI relaxation systems are shown to be those systems for which the state-space concept of storage coincides with the input-output concept of fading memory functional.</p></details> |  |

Traditional approaches such as BM25 and Dense Passage Retrieval (DPR) focus on lexical or semantic similarity but tend to neglect the temporal alignment between queries and documents, which is essential for time-sensitive tasks like temporal question answering (TQA). We propose TempRetriever, a novel extension of DPR that explicitly incorporates temporal information by embedding both the query date and document timestamp into the retrieval process. This allows retrieving passages that are not only contextually relevant but also aligned with the temporal intent of queries. We evaluate TempRetriever on two large-scale datasets ArchivalQA and ChroniclingAmericaQA demonstrating its superiority over baseline retrieval models across multiple metrics. TempRetriever achieves a 6.63\% improvement in Top-1 retrieval accuracy and a 3.79\% improvement in NDCG@10 compared to the standard DPR on ArchivalQA. Similarly, for ChroniclingAmericaQA, TempRetriever exhibits a 9.56\% improvement in Top-1 retrieval accuracy and a 4.68\% improvement in NDCG@10. We also propose a novel, time-based negative sampling strategy which further enhances retrieval performance by addressing temporal misalignment during training. Our results underline the importance of temporal aspects in dense retrieval systems and establish a new benchmark for time-aware passage retrieval.</p></details> |  |

However, their reliance on closed-source or resource-intensive models introduces significant deployment challenges in private environments, prompting a critical question: \textit{How can personally deployable open-source LLMs achieve comparable code reasoning performance?} To this end, we propose a unified Test-Time Compute scaling framework that leverages increased inference-time computation instead of larger models. Our framework incorporates two complementary strategies: internal TTC and external TTC. Internally, we introduce a \textit{development-contextualized trajectory synthesis} method leveraging real-world software repositories to bootstrap multi-stage reasoning processes, such as fault localization and patch generation. We further enhance trajectory quality through rejection sampling, rigorously evaluating trajectories along accuracy and complexity. Externally, we propose a novel \textit{development-process-based search} strategy guided by reward models and execution verification. This approach enables targeted computational allocation at critical development decision points, overcoming limitations of existing "end-point only" verification methods. Evaluations on SWE-bench Verified demonstrate our \textbf{32B model achieves a 46\% issue resolution rate}, surpassing significantly larger models such as DeepSeek R1 671B and OpenAI o1. Additionally, we provide the empirical validation of the test-time scaling phenomenon within SWE agents, revealing that \textbf{models dynamically allocate more tokens to increasingly challenging problems}, effectively enhancing reasoning capabilities. We publicly release all training data, models, and code to facilitate future research. https://github.com/yingweima2022/SWE-Reasoner</p></details> |  |

Concretely, we are interested in predicting when such a system admits unimodal oscillations, i.e., when the output has a single-peaked period. Under the assumption that the linear system is stable and has an impulse response that is strictly monotonically decreasing on its infinite support, we take a novel approach in using the framework of total positivity to address our main question. It is shown that unimodal self-oscillations can only exist if the number of positive and negative elements in a period coincides. Based on this result, we derive conditions for the existence of such oscillations, determine bounds on their periods, and address the question of uniqueness.</p></details> |  |

The proposed control framework employs two kinds of CBFs to impose safety constraints on the UAVs' motion. The first class of CBFs (LCBF) is a three-dimensional exponentially decaying function centered above the landing platform, designed to safely and precisely land UAVs on the UGVs. The second set is a spherical CBF (SCBF), defined between every pair of UAVs, which avoids collisions between them. The LCBF is time-varying and adapts to the motions of the UGVs. In the proposed CBF approach, the control input from the UAV's nominal tracking controller designed to reach the landing platform is filtered to choose a minimally-deviating control input that ensures safety (as defined by the CBFs). As the control inputs of every UAV are shared in establishing multiple CBF constraints, we prove that the control inputs are shared without conflict in rendering the safe sets forward invariant. The performance of the control framework is validated through a simulated scenario involving three UAVs landing on three moving targets.</p></details> |  |

This work is motivated by the design of periodic schedules in public transport with constraints on the quality of service. Namely, we require that the fastest path between (important) pairs of vertices is upper bounded by a specified maximum duration, encoded in an upper distance matrix $D$. While previous work has considered the undirected version of the problem, the application in public transport schedule design requires the flexibility to assign different departure times to the two directions of an edge. A problem instance can only be feasible if all values of the distance matrix are at least shortest path distances. However, the task of realizing exact fastest path distances in a periodic temporal graph is often too restrictive. Therefore, we introduce a minimum slack parameter $k$ that describes a lower bound on the maximum allowed waiting time on each path. We concentrate on tree topologies and provide a full characterization of the complexity landscape with respect to the period $\Delta$ and the minimum slack parameter~$k$, showing a sharp threshold between NP-complete cases and cases which are always realizable. We also provide hardness results for the special case of period $\Delta = 2$ for general directed and undirected graphs.</p></details> |  |

While approaches such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and rule-based reward mechanisms demonstrate promise in text and image domains, their application to video understanding remains limited. This paper presents a systematic exploration of Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) with GRPO for video MLLMs, aiming to enhance spatio-temporal perception while maintaining general capabilities. Our experiments reveal that RFT is highly data-efficient for task-specific improvements. Through multi-task RFT on spatio-temporal perception objectives with limited samples, we develop VideoChat-R1, a powerful video MLLM that achieves state-of-the-art performance on spatio-temporal perception tasks without sacrificing chat ability, while exhibiting emerging spatio-temporal reasoning abilities. Compared to Qwen2.5-VL-7B, VideoChat-R1 boosts performance several-fold in tasks like temporal grounding (+31.8) and object tracking (+31.2). Additionally, it significantly improves on general QA benchmarks such as VideoMME (+0.9), MVBench (+1.0), and Perception Test (+0.9). Our findings underscore the potential of RFT for specialized task enhancement of Video MLLMs. We hope our work offers valuable insights for future RL research in video MLLMs.</p></details> |  |

In particular, we introduce a Temporal Tensor Formalism to describe multidimensional time, define Quantum Shortcut Operators that enact near-instantaneous state transitions, and incorporate these into a supermaze topological model inspired by labyrinthine geometry and network complexity. We show how this framework can give rise to surprising effects such as anomalous thermodynamic relaxation (analogous to the Mpemba effect) in quantum systems. Theoretical implications for quantum computing (including quantum cloud networks) are discussed, and connections are drawn to established mathematical paradoxes and physical principles.</p></details> |  |
| **[DG-STMTL: A Novel Graph Convolutional Network for Multi-Task Spatio-Temporal Traffic Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07822v1)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal traffic prediction is crucial in intelligent transportation systems. The key challenge of accurate prediction is how to model the complex spatio-temporal dependencies and adapt to the inherent dynamics in data. Traditional Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) often struggle with static adjacency matrices that introduce domain bias or learnable matrices that may be overfitting to specific patterns. This challenge becomes more complex when considering Multi-Task Learning (MTL). While MTL has the potential to enhance prediction accuracy through task synergies, it can also face significant hurdles due to task interference. To overcome these challenges, this study introduces a novel MTL framework, Dynamic Group-wise Spatio-Temporal Multi-Task Learning (DG-STMTL). DG-STMTL proposes a hybrid adjacency matrix generation module that combines static matrices with dynamic ones through a task-specific gating mechanism. We also introduce a group-wise GCN module to enhance the modelling capability of spatio-temporal dependencies. We conduct extensive experiments on two real-world datasets to evaluate our method. Results show that our method outperforms other state-of-the-arts, indicating its effectiveness and robustness.</p></details> |  |

The hardness of choosing delays to meet passenger demands in temporal graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18987v2)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In train networks, carefully-chosen delays may be beneficial for certain passengers, who would otherwise miss some connection. Given a simple (directed or undirected) temporal graph and a set of passengers (each specifying a starting vertex, an ending vertex, and a desired arrival time), we ask whether it is possible to delay some of the edges of the temporal graph to realize all the passengers' demands. We call this problem DelayBetter (DB), and study it along with two variants: in $\delta$-DelayBetter, each delay must be of at most $\delta$; in ($\delta$-)Path DB, passengers also fully specify the vertices they should visit on their journey. On the positive side, we give a polynomial-time algorithm for Path DB and $\delta$-Path DB, and obtain as a corollary a polynomial-time algorithm for DB and $\delta$-DB on trees. We also provide an fpt algorithm for both problems parameterized by the size of the graph's Feedback Edge Set together with the number of passengers. On the negative side, we show NP-completeness of ($1$-)DB on bounded-degree temporal graphs even when the lifetime is $2$, and of ($10$-)DB on bounded-degree planar temporal graphs of lifetime $19$. Our results complement previous work studying reachability problems in temporal graphs with delaying operations. This is to our knowledge the first such problem in which the aim is to facilitate travel between specific points (as opposed to facilitating or impeding a broadcast from one or many sources).</p></details> | 20 pages, 7 figures |

In this paper we work on this topic, focusing on structured and semi-structured anonymized data. We not only develop a direct LLM pipeline, but also compare various methodologies and conduct an in-depth analysis. We identified and examined seventeen common temporal reasoning tasks in natural language, focusing on their algorithmic components. To assess LLM performance, we created the \textit{Reasoning and Answering Temporal Ability} dataset (RATA), featuring semi-structured anonymized data to ensure reliance on reasoning rather than on prior knowledge. We compared several methodologies, involving SoTA techniques such as Tree-of-Thought, self-reflexion and code execution, tuned specifically for this scenario. Our results suggest that achieving scalable and reliable solutions requires more than just standalone LLMs, highlighting the need for integrated approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 7 tables, 5 figures</p></details> |

Unlike existing benchmarks focused on static image-text compositionality or isolated single-event videos, our benchmark targets alignment in continuous multi-event videos. Leveraging video-text datasets with temporally localized event captions (e.g. ActivityNet-Captions, YouCook2), we construct two compositional benchmarks, ActivityNet-Comp and YouCook2-Comp. We create challenging negative samples with subtle temporal disruptions such as reordering, action word replacement, partial captioning, and combined disruptions. These benchmarks comprehensively test models' compositional sensitivity across extended, cohesive video-text sequences. To improve model performance, we propose a hierarchical pairwise preference loss that strengthens alignment with temporally accurate pairs and gradually penalizes increasingly disrupted ones, encouraging fine-grained compositional learning. To mitigate the limited availability of densely annotated video data, we introduce a pretraining strategy that concatenates short video-caption pairs to simulate multi-event sequences. We evaluate video-text foundational models and large multimodal models (LMMs) on our benchmark, identifying both strengths and areas for improvement in compositionality. Overall, our work provides a comprehensive framework for evaluating and enhancing model capabilities in achieving fine-grained, temporally coherent video-text alignment.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025, project page at https://github.com/google-deepmind/video_comp</p></details> |
| **[VideoExpert: Augmented LLM for Temporal-Sensitive Video Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07519v1)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The core challenge in video understanding lies in perceiving dynamic content changes over time. However, multimodal large language models struggle with temporal-sensitive video tasks, which requires generating timestamps to mark the occurrence of specific events. Existing strategies require MLLMs to generate absolute or relative timestamps directly. We have observed that those MLLMs tend to rely more on language patterns than visual cues when generating timestamps, affecting their performance. To address this problem, we propose VideoExpert, a general-purpose MLLM suitable for several temporal-sensitive video tasks. Inspired by the expert concept, VideoExpert integrates two parallel modules: the Temporal Expert and the Spatial Expert. The Temporal Expert is responsible for modeling time sequences and performing temporal grounding. It processes high-frame-rate yet compressed tokens to capture dynamic variations in videos and includes a lightweight prediction head for precise event localization. The Spatial Expert focuses on content detail analysis and instruction following. It handles specially designed spatial tokens and language input, aiming to generate content-related responses. These two experts collaborate seamlessly via a special token, ensuring coordinated temporal grounding and content generation. Notably, the Temporal and Spatial Experts maintain independent parameter sets. By offloading temporal grounding from content generation, VideoExpert prevents text pattern biases in timestamp predictions. Moreover, we introduce a Spatial Compress module to obtain spatial tokens. This module filters and compresses patch tokens while preserving key information, delivering compact yet detail-rich input for the Spatial Expert. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of the VideoExpert.</p></details> |  |

However, incorporating long histories is resource-intensive.

We introduce FLASH, a learnable and graph-adaptive neighborhood selection mechanism that generalizes existing heuristics. FLASH integrates seamlessly into TGNNs and is trained end-to-end using a self-supervised ranking loss. We provide theoretical evidence that commonly used heuristics hinders TGNNs performance, motivating our design.

In today's economy, there is a stark contrast between the high demand for skilled labour and the limited employment opportunities available to those who are not adequately prepared for the digital economy.

We introduce our novel temporal KG constructed from online job advertisements. We then train and evaluate different temporal KG embeddings for temporal link prediction.

While MLLMs have been extensively studied for visual semantic understanding tasks, their ability to perform precise and quantitative spatial-temporal understanding in real-world applications remains largely unexamined, leading to uncertain prospects. To evaluate models' Spatial-Temporal Intelligence, we introduce STI-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs' spatial-temporal understanding through challenging tasks such as estimating and predicting the appearance, pose, displacement, and motion of objects. Our benchmark encompasses a wide range of robot and vehicle operations across desktop, indoor, and outdoor scenarios.

In the Earth Observation field, satellite failure or cloud occlusion frequently results in missing time-steps, introducing uncertainties in the predicted output and causing a decline in predictive performance. While many studies address missing time-steps through data augmentation to improve model robustness, the uncertainty arising at the input level is commonly overlooked. To address this gap, we introduce Monte Carlo Temporal Dropout (MC-TD), a method that explicitly accounts for input-level uncertainty by randomly dropping time-steps during inference using a predefined dropout ratio, thereby simulating the effect of missing data. To bypass the need for costly searches for the optimal dropout ratio, we extend this approach with Monte Carlo Concrete Temporal Dropout (MC-ConcTD), a method that learns the optimal dropout distribution directly. Both MC-TD and MC-ConcTD are applied during inference, leveraging Monte Carlo sampling for uncertainty quantification. Experiments on three EO time-series datasets demonstrate that MC-ConcTD improves predictive performance and uncertainty calibration compared to existing approaches. Additionally, we highlight the advantages of adaptive dropout tuning over manual selection, making uncertainty quantification more robust and accessible for EO applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Symposium on Intelligent Data Analysis (IDA 2025)</p></details> |

Many classical problems on graphs can be translated to temporal graphs, and the results may differ. In this paper, we define the Temporal Edge Cover and Temporal Matching problems and show that they are NP-complete even when fixing the lifetime or when the underlying graph is a tree. We then describe two FPT algorithms, with parameters lifetime and treewidth, that solve the two problems. We also find lower bounds for the approximation of the two problems and give two approximation algorithms which match these bounds. Finally, we discuss the differences between the problems in the temporal and the static framework.</p></details> |  |
| **[STaR: Seamless Spatial-Temporal Aware Motion Retargeting with Penetration and Consistency Constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06504v1)** | 2025-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motion retargeting seeks to faithfully replicate the spatio-temporal motion characteristics of a source character onto a target character with a different body shape. Apart from motion semantics preservation, ensuring geometric plausibility and maintaining temporal consistency are also crucial for effective motion retargeting. However, many existing methods prioritize either geometric plausibility or temporal consistency. Neglecting geometric plausibility results in interpenetration while neglecting temporal consistency leads to motion jitter. In this paper, we propose a novel sequence-to-sequence model for seamless Spatial-Temporal aware motion Retargeting (STaR), with penetration and consistency constraints. STaR consists of two modules: (1) a spatial module that incorporates dense shape representation and a novel limb penetration constraint to ensure geometric plausibility while preserving motion semantics, and (2) a temporal module that utilizes a temporal transformer and a novel temporal consistency constraint to predict the entire motion sequence at once while enforcing multi-level trajectory smoothness. The seamless combination of the two modules helps us achieve a good balance between the semantic, geometric, and temporal targets. Extensive experiments on the Mixamo and ScanRet datasets demonstrate that our method produces plausible and coherent motions while significantly reducing interpenetration rates compared with other approaches.</p></details> | 12 pages, 9 figures; |

Traditional models often rely on parametric kernels, limiting their ability to capture heterogeneous, nonstationary dynamics. Recent innovations integrate deep neural architectures -- either by modeling the conditional intensity function directly or by learning flexible, data-driven influence kernels, substantially broadening their expressive power. This article reviews the development of the deep influence kernel approach, which enjoys statistical explainability, since the influence kernel remains in the model to capture the spatiotemporal propagation of event influence and its impact on future events, while also possessing strong expressive power, thereby benefiting from both worlds. We explain the main components in developing deep kernel point processes, leveraging tools such as functional basis decomposition and graph neural networks to encode complex spatial or network structures, as well as estimation using both likelihood-based and likelihood-free methods, and address computational scalability for large-scale data. We also discuss the theoretical foundation of kernel identifiability. Simulated and real-data examples highlight applications to crime analysis, earthquake aftershock prediction, and sepsis prediction modeling, and we conclude by discussing promising directions for the field.</p></details> |  |

A key challenge in FSAR is handling divergent narrative trajectories for precise video matching. While the frame- and tuple-level alignment approaches have been promising, their methods heavily rely on pre-defined and length-dependent alignment units (e.g., frames or tuples), which limits flexibility for actions of varying lengths and speeds. In this work, we introduce a novel TEmporal Alignment-free Matching (TEAM) approach, which eliminates the need for temporal units in action representation and brute-force alignment during matching. Specifically, TEAM represents each video with a fixed set of pattern tokens that capture globally discriminative clues within the video instance regardless of action length or speed, ensuring its flexibility. Furthermore, TEAM is inherently efficient, using token-wise comparisons to measure similarity between videos, unlike existing methods that rely on pairwise comparisons for temporal alignment. Additionally, we propose an adaptation process that identifies and removes common information across classes, establishing clear boundaries even between novel categories. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of TEAM.

Traditional methods often focus only on the overall passenger volume, neglecting the interdependence between different modes within the hub. To address this limitation, we propose MM-STFlowNet, a comprehensive multi-mode prediction framework grounded in dynamic spatial-temporal graph modeling. Initially, an integrated temporal feature processing strategy is implemented using signal decomposition and convolution techniques to address data spikes and high volatility. Subsequently, we introduce the Spatial-Temporal Dynamic Graph Convolutional Recurrent Network (STDGCRN) to capture detailed spatial-temporal dependencies across multiple traffic modes, enhanced by an adaptive channel attention mechanism. Finally, the self-attention mechanism is applied to incorporate various external factors, further enhancing prediction accuracy. Experiments on a real-world dataset from Guangzhounan Railway Station in China demonstrate that MM-STFlowNet achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly during peak periods, providing valuable insight for transportation hub management.</p></details> |  |

While existing research focuses on capturing vision-language relevance, it faces limitations due to biased temporal distributions, imprecise annotations, and insufficient compositionally. To achieve fair evaluation and comprehensive exploration, our objective is to investigate and evaluate the ability of models to achieve alignment from a temporal perspective, specifically focusing on their capacity to synchronize visual scenarios with linguistic context in a temporally coherent manner. As a preliminary step, we present the statistical analysis of existing benchmarks and reveal the existing challenges from a decomposed perspective. To this end, we introduce SVLTA, the Synthetic Vision-Language Temporal Alignment derived via a well-designed and feasible control generation method within a simulation environment. The approach considers commonsense knowledge, manipulable action, and constrained filtering, which generates reasonable, diverse, and balanced data distributions for diagnostic evaluations. Our experiments reveal diagnostic insights through the evaluations in temporal question answering, distributional shift sensitiveness, and temporal alignment adaptation.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025.

| **[Hybrid Temporal Differential Consistency Autoencoder for Efficient and Sustainable Anomaly Detection in Cyber-Physical Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06320v1)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cyberattacks on critical infrastructure, particularly water distribution systems, have increased due to rapid digitalization and the integration of IoT devices and industrial control systems (ICS). These cyber-physical systems (CPS) introduce new vulnerabilities, requiring robust and automated intrusion detection systems (IDS) to mitigate potential threats. This study addresses key challenges in anomaly detection by leveraging time correlations in sensor data, integrating physical principles into machine learning models, and optimizing computational efficiency for edge applications. We build upon the concept of temporal differential consistency (TDC) loss to capture the dynamics of the system, ensuring meaningful relationships between dynamic states. Expanding on this foundation, we propose a hybrid autoencoder-based approach, referred to as hybrid TDC-AE, which extends TDC by incorporating both deterministic nodes and conventional statistical nodes. This hybrid structure enables the model to account for non-deterministic processes. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art classification performance while improving time to detect anomalies by 3%, outperforming the BATADAL challenge leader without requiring domain-specific knowledge, making it broadly applicable. Additionally, it maintains the computational efficiency of conventional autoencoders while reducing the number of fully connected layers, resulting in a more sustainable and efficient solution. The method demonstrates how leveraging physics-inspired consistency principles enhances anomaly detection and strengthens the resilience of cyber-physical systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Video Flow as Time Series: Discovering Temporal Consistency and Variability for VideoQA](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05783v1)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Question Answering (VideoQA) is a complex video-language task that demands a sophisticated understanding of both visual content and temporal dynamics. Traditional Transformer-style architectures, while effective in integrating multimodal data, often simplify temporal dynamics through positional encoding and fail to capture non-linear interactions within video sequences. In this paper, we introduce the Temporal Trio Transformer (T3T), a novel architecture that models time consistency and time variability. The T3T integrates three key components: Temporal Smoothing (TS), Temporal Difference (TD), and Temporal Fusion (TF). The TS module employs Brownian Bridge for capturing smooth, continuous temporal transitions, while the TD module identifies and encodes significant temporal variations and abrupt changes within the video content. Subsequently, the TF module synthesizes these temporal features with textual cues, facilitating a deeper contextual understanding and response accuracy. The efficacy of the T3T is demonstrated through extensive testing on multiple VideoQA benchmark datasets. Our results underscore the importance of a nuanced approach to temporal modeling in improving the accuracy and depth of video-based question answering.</p></details> |  |
| **[Temporal Dynamic Embedding for Irregularly Sampled Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05768v1)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In several practical applications, particularly healthcare, clinical data of each patient is individually recorded in a database at irregular intervals as required. This causes a sparse and irregularly sampled time series, which makes it difficult to handle as a structured representation of the prerequisites of neural network models. We therefore propose temporal dynamic embedding (TDE), which enables neural network models to receive data that change the number of variables over time. TDE regards each time series variable as an embedding vector evolving over time, instead of a conventional fixed structured representation, which causes a critical missing problem. For each time step, TDE allows for the selective adoption and aggregation of only observed variable subsets and represents the current status of patient based on current observations. The experiment was conducted on three clinical datasets: PhysioNet 2012, MIMIC-III, and PhysioNet 2019. The TDE model performed competitively or better than the imputation-based baseline and several recent state-of-the-art methods with reduced training runtime.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploiting Temporal Audio-Visual Correlation Embedding for Audio-Driven One-Shot Talking Head Animation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05746v1)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The paramount challenge in audio-driven One-shot Talking Head Animation (ADOS-THA) lies in capturing subtle imperceptible changes between adjacent video frames. Inherently, the temporal relationship of adjacent audio clips is highly correlated with that of the corresponding adjacent video frames, offering supplementary information that can be pivotal for guiding and supervising talking head animations. In this work, we propose to learn audio-visual correlations and integrate the correlations to help enhance feature representation and regularize final generation by a novel Temporal Audio-Visual Correlation Embedding (TAVCE) framework. Specifically, it first learns an audio-visual temporal correlation metric, ensuring the temporal audio relationships of adjacent clips are aligned with the temporal visual relationships of corresponding adjacent video frames. Since the temporal audio relationship contains aligned information about the visual frame, we first integrate it to guide learning more representative features via a simple yet effective channel attention mechanism. During training, we also use the alignment correlations as an additional objective to supervise generating visual frames. We conduct extensive experiments on several publicly available benchmarks (i.e., HDTF, LRW, VoxCeleb1, and VoxCeleb2) to demonstrate its superiority over existing leading algorithms.</p></details> | Accepted at TMM 2025 |
| **[POMATO: Marrying Pointmap Matching with Temporal Motion for Dynamic 3D Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05692v1)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D reconstruction in dynamic scenes primarily relies on the combination of geometry estimation and matching modules where the latter task is pivotal for distinguishing dynamic regions which can help to mitigate the interference introduced by camera and object motion. Furthermore, the matching module explicitly models object motion, enabling the tracking of specific targets and advancing motion understanding in complex scenarios. Recently, the proposed representation of pointmap in DUSt3R suggests a potential solution to unify both geometry estimation and matching in 3D space, but it still struggles with ambiguous matching in dynamic regions, which may hamper further improvement. In this work, we present POMATO, a unified framework for dynamic 3D reconstruction by marrying pointmap matching with temporal motion. Specifically, our method first learns an explicit matching relationship by mapping RGB pixels from both dynamic and static regions across different views to 3D pointmaps within a unified coordinate system. Furthermore, we introduce a temporal motion module for dynamic motions that ensures scale consistency across different frames and enhances performance in tasks requiring both precise geometry and reliable matching, most notably 3D point tracking. We show the effectiveness of the proposed pointmap matching and temporal fusion paradigm by demonstrating the remarkable performance across multiple downstream tasks, including video depth estimation, 3D point tracking, and pose estimation.

Among all approaches, Functional Connectome (FC) is the most popular method. Computed by the correlation coefficients between ROI time series, FC is a powerful and computationally efficient way to estimate ROI connectivity. However, it is well known for neglecting structural connections and causality in ROI interactions. Also, FC becomes much more noisy in the short spatio-temporal sliding-window subsequences of fMRI. Effective Connectome (EC) is proposed as a directional alternative, but is difficult to accurately estimate. Furthermore, for optimal GNN performance, usually only a small percentage of the strongest connections are selected as sparse edges, resulting in oversimplification of complex brain connections. To tackle these challenges, we propose the Spatio-Temporal Node Attention Graph Neural Network (STNAGNN) as a data-driven alternative that combines sparse predefined FC with dense data-driven spatio-temporal connections, allowing for flexible and spatio-temporal learning of ROI interaction patterns.</p></details> |  |
| **[Continual Learning of Multiple Cognitive Functions with Brain-inspired Temporal Development Mechanism](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05621v1)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cognitive functions in current artificial intelligence networks are tied to the exponential increase in network scale, whereas the human brain can continuously learn hundreds of cognitive functions with remarkably low energy consumption. This advantage is in part due to the brain cross-regional temporal development mechanisms, where the progressive formation, reorganization, and pruning of connections from basic to advanced regions, facilitate knowledge transfer and prevent network redundancy. Inspired by these, we propose the Continual Learning of Multiple Cognitive Functions with Brain-inspired Temporal Development Mechanism(TD-MCL), enabling cognitive enhancement from simple to complex in Perception-Motor-Interaction(PMI) multiple cognitive task scenarios. The TD-MCL model proposes the sequential evolution of long-range connections between different cognitive modules to promote positive knowledge transfer, while using feedback-guided local connection inhibition and pruning to effectively eliminate redundancies in previous tasks, reducing energy consumption while preserving acquired knowledge. Experiments show that the proposed method can achieve continual learning capabilities while reducing network scale, without introducing regularization, replay, or freezing strategies, and achieving superior accuracy on new tasks compared to direct learning. The proposed method shows that the brain's developmental mechanisms offer a valuable reference for exploring biologically plausible, low-energy enhancements of general cognitive abilities.</p></details> |  |

Ensuring that such models verify that kind of temporal properties requires to use something beyond simulation. In this work we use the model checker Uppaal to verify a class of recurrent quantitative temporal properties appearing in RT-DEVS models, even though Uppaal cannot deal in general with this kind of properties. In order to overcome these limitations we use the technique known as automata observer. Secondly, by introducing mutations to quantitative temporal properties we are able to find errors in RT-DEVS models and their implementations. A case study from the railway domain is presented.</p></details> |  |
| **[Structural temporal logic for mechanized program verification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14906v6)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mechanized verification of liveness properties for infinite programs with effects and nondeterminism is challenging. Existing temporal reasoning frameworks operate at the level of models such as traces and automata. Reasoning happens at a very low-level, requiring complex nested (co-)inductive proof techniques and familiarity with proof assistant mechanics (e.g., the guardedness checker). Further, reasoning at the level of models instead of program constructs creates a verification gap that loses the benefits of modularity and composition enjoyed by structural program logics such as Hoare Logic. To address this verification gap, and the lack of compositional proof techniques for temporal specifications, we propose Ticl, a new structural temporal logic. Using ticl, we encode complex (co-)inductive proof techniques as structural lemmas and focus our reasoning on variants and invariants. We show that it is possible to perform compositional proofs of general temporal properties in a proof assistant, while working at a high level of abstraction. We demonstrate the benefits of Ticl by giving mechanized proofs of safety and liveness properties for programs with scheduling, concurrent shared memory, and distributed consensus, demonstrating a low proof-to-code ratio.</p></details> |  |
| **[Entropy Rate Maximization of Markov Decision Processes under Linear Temporal Logic Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.12805v3)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate the problem of synthesizing optimal control policies for Markov decision processes (MDPs) with both qualitative and quantitative objectives. Specifically, our goal is to achieve a given linear temporal logic (LTL) task with probability one, while maximizing the \emph{entropy rate} of the system. The notion of entropy rate characterizes the long-run average (un)predictability of a stochastic process. Such an optimal policy is of our interest, in particular, from the security point of view, as it not only ensures the completion of tasks, but also maximizes the unpredictability of the system. However, existing works only focus on maximizing the total entropy which may diverge to infinity for infinite horizon. In this paper, we provide a complete solution to the entropy rate maximization problem under LTL constraints. Specifically, we first present an algorithm for synthesizing entropy rate maximizing policies for communicating MDPs. Then based on a new state classification method, we show the entropy rate maximization problem under LTL task can be effectively solved in polynomial-time. We illustrate the proposed algorithm based on two case studies of robot task planning scenario.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning to Reason Over Time: Timeline Self-Reflection for Improved Temporal Reasoning in Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05258v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for generating coherent text, understanding context, and performing reasoning tasks. However, they struggle with temporal reasoning, which requires processing time-related information such as event sequencing, durations, and inter-temporal relationships. These capabilities are critical for applications including question answering, scheduling, and historical analysis. In this paper, we introduce TISER, a novel framework that enhances the temporal reasoning abilities of LLMs through a multi-stage process that combines timeline construction with iterative self-reflection. Our approach leverages test-time scaling to extend the length of reasoning traces, enabling models to capture complex temporal dependencies more effectively. This strategy not only boosts reasoning accuracy but also improves the traceability of the inference process. Experimental results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks, including out-of-distribution test sets, and reveal that TISER enables smaller open-source models to surpass larger closed-weight models on challenging temporal reasoning tasks.</p></details> |  |

It faces a great challenge yet to be addressed - that is, the significant distributional differences among monitoring data from multiple modes make it difficult for the models to extract shared feature representations related to system health conditions. In response to this problem, this paper introduces a novel method called attention-based multi-scale temporal fusion network. The multi-scale depthwise convolution and gated recurrent unit are employed to extract multi-scale contextual local features and long-short-term features. A temporal attention mechanism is designed to focus on critical time points with higher cross-mode shared information, thereby enhancing the accuracy of fault diagnosis. The proposed model is applied to Tennessee Eastman process dataset and three-phase flow facility dataset. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed model achieves superior diagnostic performance and maintains a small model size.</p></details> | 31 pages,11 figures |

Current 4D representation learning techniques typically engage in iterative processing coupled with dense query operations. Although effective in capturing temporal features, this approach leads to substantial computational redundancy. In this work, we propose a framework, named as PvNeXt, for effective yet efficient point cloud video recognition, via personalized one-shot query operation. Specially, PvNeXt consists of two key modules, the Motion Imitator and the Single-Step Motion Encoder. The former module, the Motion Imitator, is designed to capture the temporal dynamics inherent in sequences of point clouds, thus generating the virtual motion corresponding to each frame. The Single-Step Motion Encoder performs a one-step query operation, associating point cloud of each frame with its corresponding virtual motion frame, thereby extracting motion cues from point cloud sequences and capturing temporal dynamics across the entire sequence. Through the integration of these two modules, {PvNeXt} enables personalized one-shot queries for each frame, effectively eliminating the need for frame-specific looping and intensive query processes. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR 2025</p></details> |
| **[AsyReC: A Multimodal Graph-based Framework for Spatio-Temporal Asymmetric Dyadic Relationship Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05030v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dyadic social relationships, which refer to relationships between two individuals who know each other through repeated interactions (or not), are shaped by shared spatial and temporal experiences. Current computational methods for modeling these relationships face three major challenges: (1) the failure to model asymmetric relationships, e.g., one individual may perceive the other as a friend while the other perceives them as an acquaintance, (2) the disruption of continuous interactions by discrete frame sampling, which segments the temporal continuity of interaction in real-world scenarios, and (3) the limitation to consider periodic behavioral cues, such as rhythmic vocalizations or recurrent gestures, which are crucial for inferring the evolution of dyadic relationships. To address these challenges, we propose AsyReC, a multimodal graph-based framework for asymmetric dyadic relationship classification, with three core innovations: (i) a triplet graph neural network with node-edge dual attention that dynamically weights multimodal cues to capture interaction asymmetries (addressing challenge 1); (ii) a clip-level relationship learning architecture that preserves temporal continuity, enabling fine-grained modeling of real-world interaction dynamics (addressing challenge 2); and (iii) a periodic temporal encoder that projects time indices onto sine/cosine waveforms to model recurrent behavioral patterns (addressing challenge 3). Extensive experiments on two public datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, while ablation studies validate the critical role of asymmetric interaction modeling and periodic temporal encoding in improving the robustness of dyadic relationship classification in real-world scenarios. Our code is publicly available at: https://github.com/tw-repository/AsyReC.</p></details> |  |

However, they struggle to perform spatio-temporal video grounding. This limitation stems from two major challenges. Firstly, it is difficult to extract accurate spatio-temporal information of each frame in the video. Secondly, the substantial number of visual tokens makes it challenging to precisely map visual tokens of each frame to their corresponding spatial coordinates. To address these issues, we introduce SpaceVLLM, a MLLM endowed with spatio-temporal video grounding capability. Specifically, we adopt a set of interleaved Spatio-Temporal Aware Queries to capture temporal perception and dynamic spatial information. Moreover, we propose a Query-Guided Space Decoder to establish a corresponding connection between the queries and spatial coordinates. Additionally, due to the lack of spatio-temporal datasets, we construct the Unified Spatio-Temporal Grounding (Uni-STG) dataset, comprising 480K instances across three tasks. This dataset fully exploits the potential of MLLM to simultaneously facilitate localization in both temporal and spatial dimensions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SpaceVLLM achieves the state-of-the-art performance across 11 benchmarks covering temporal, spatial, spatio-temporal and video understanding tasks, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach. Our code, datasets and model will be released.</p></details> |  |

Recent advancements in visual-language models, especially based on contrastive pretraining, have shown remarkable generalization in zero-shot tasks, helping to overcome this dependence on labeled datasets. Adaptations of such models for videos, typically involve modifying the architecture of vision-language models to cater to video data. However, this is not trivial, since such adaptations are mostly computationally intensive and struggle with temporal modeling. We present TP-CLIP, an adaptation of CLIP that leverages temporal visual prompting for temporal adaptation without modifying the core CLIP architecture. This preserves its generalization abilities. TP-CLIP efficiently integrates into the CLIP architecture, leveraging its pre-trained capabilities for video data. Extensive experiments across various datasets demonstrate its efficacy in zero-shot and few-shot learning, outperforming existing approaches with fewer parameters and computational efficiency. In particular, we use just 1/3 the GFLOPs and 1/28 the number of tuneable parameters in comparison to recent state-of-the-art and still outperform it by up to 15.8% depending on the task and dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in CVPR-W 2025</p></details> |

In this paper, we study efficient solutions to temporal graph applications using new algorithms for Incremental Minimum Spanning Trees (MST). The first contribution of this work is to formally discuss how a broad set of setting-problem combinations of temporal graph processing can be solved using incremental MST, along with their theoretical guarantees. However, to give efficient solutions for incremental MST, we observe a gap between theory and practice. While many classic data structures, such as the link-cut tree, provide strong bounds for incremental MST, their performance is limited in practice. Meanwhile, existing practical solutions used in applications do not have any non-trivial theoretical guarantees. Our second and main contribution includes new algorithms for incremental MST that are efficient both in theory and in practice. Our new data structure, the AM-tree, achieves the same theoretical bound as the link-cut tree for temporal graph processing and shows strong performance in practice. In our experiments, the AM-tree has competitive or better performance than existing practical solutions due to theoretical guarantee, and can be significantly faster than the link-cut tree (7.8-11x in update and 7.7-13.7x in query).</p></details> |  |

Given available disturbance datasets, we leverage conformal prediction (CP) to address the underlying chance-constrained multi-agent STL synthesis problem in a distribution-free manner. By introducing nonconformity scores as functions of prediction regions (PRs) of error trajectories, we develop an iterative PR-scaling and disturbance-feedback synthesis approach to bound training error trajectory samples. These bounds are then calibrated using a separate dataset, providing probabilistic guarantees via CP. Subsequently, we relax the underlying stochastic optimal control problem by tightening the robustness functions of collaborative tasks based on their Lipschitz constants and the computed error bounds. To address scalability, we exploit the compositional structure of the multi-agent STL formula and propose a model-predictive-control-like algorithm, where agent-level problems are solved in a distributed fashion.

In this work, we revisit temporal search paradigms for long-form video understanding and address a fundamental issue pertaining to all state-of-the-art (SOTA) long-context vision-language models (VLMs). Our contributions are twofold: First, we frame temporal search as a Long Video Haystack problem: finding a minimal set of relevant frames (e.g., one to five) from tens of thousands based on specific queries. Upon this formulation, we introduce LV-Haystack, the first dataset with 480 hours of videos, 15,092 human-annotated instances for both training and evaluation aiming to improve temporal search quality and efficiency. Results on LV-Haystack highlight a significant research gap in temporal search capabilities, with current SOTA search methods only achieving 2.1% temporal F1 score on the Longvideobench subset. Next, inspired by visual search in images, we propose a lightweight temporal search framework, T* that reframes costly temporal search as spatial search. T* leverages powerful visual localization techniques commonly used in images and introduces an adaptive zooming-in mechanism that operates across both temporal and spatial dimensions. Extensive experiments show that integrating T* with existing methods significantly improves SOTA long-form video understanding. Under an inference budget of 32 frames, T* improves GPT-4o's performance from 50.5% to 53.1% and LLaVA-OneVision-OV-72B's performance from 56.5% to 62.4% on the Longvideobench XL subset.

Inspired by recent advances in vision-language foundation models, we investigate their utility for WSTVG, leveraging their zero-shot grounding capabilities. However, we find that a simple adaptation lacks essential spatio-temporal grounding abilities. To bridge this gap, we introduce Tubelet Referral Grounding (TRG), which connects textual queries to tubelets to enable spatio-temporal predictions. Despite its promise, TRG struggles with compositional action understanding and dense scene scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose STPro, a novel progressive learning framework with two key modules: (1) Sub-Action Temporal Curriculum Learning (SA-TCL), which incrementally builds compositional action understanding, and (2) Congestion-Guided Spatial Curriculum Learning (CG-SCL), which adapts the model to complex scenes by spatially increasing task difficulty. STPro achieves state-of-the-art results on three benchmark datasets, with improvements of 1.0% on VidSTG-Declarative and 3.0% on HCSTVG-v1.</p></details> | CVPR'25 Conference |

The hallucination problem arises from multiple factors, including the inherent hallucinations in language models, the limitations of visual encoders in perception, and biases introduced by multimodal data. Extensive research has explored ways to mitigate hallucinations. For instance, OPERA prevents the model from overly focusing on "anchor tokens", thereby reducing hallucinations, whereas VCD mitigates hallucinations by employing a contrastive decoding approach. In this paper, we investigate the correlation between the decay of attention to image tokens and the occurrence of hallucinations. Based on this finding, we propose Temporal Attention Real-time Accumulative Connection (TARAC), a novel training-free method that dynamically accumulates and updates LVLMs' attention on image tokens during generation. By enhancing the model's attention to image tokens, TARAC mitigates hallucinations caused by the decay of attention on image tokens. We validate the effectiveness of TARAC across multiple models and datasets, demonstrating that our approach substantially mitigates hallucinations. In particular, TARAC reduces $C_S$ by 25.2 and $C_I$ by 8.7 compared to VCD on the CHAIR benchmark.</p></details> |  |

While single-vehicle perception systems encounter limitations, stemming from incomplete perception due to object occlusion and inherent blind spots, cooperative perception systems present their own challenges in terms of sensor calibration precision and positioning accuracy. To address these issues, we introduce LET-VIC, a LiDAR-based End-to-End Tracking framework for Vehicle-Infrastructure Cooperation (VIC). First, we employ Temporal Self-Attention and VIC Cross-Attention modules to effectively integrate temporal and spatial information from both vehicle and infrastructure perspectives. Then, we develop a novel Calibration Error Compensation (CEC) module to mitigate sensor misalignment issues and facilitate accurate feature alignment.

| **[Enhancing Temporal Consistency in Video Editing by Reconstructing Videos with 3D Gaussian Splatting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02541v4)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in zero-shot video diffusion models have shown promise for text-driven video editing, but challenges remain in achieving high temporal consistency. To address this, we introduce Video-3DGS, a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)-based video refiner designed to enhance temporal consistency in zero-shot video editors. Our approach utilizes a two-stage 3D Gaussian optimizing process tailored for editing dynamic monocular videos. In the first stage, Video-3DGS employs an improved version of COLMAP, referred to as MC-COLMAP, which processes original videos using a Masked and Clipped approach. For each video clip, MC-COLMAP generates the point clouds for dynamic foreground objects and complex backgrounds. These point clouds are utilized to initialize two sets of 3D Gaussians (Frg-3DGS and Bkg-3DGS) aiming to represent foreground and background views. Both foreground and background views are then merged with a 2D learnable parameter map to reconstruct full views. In the second stage, we leverage the reconstruction ability developed in the first stage to impose the temporal constraints on the video diffusion model. To demonstrate the efficacy of Video-3DGS on both stages, we conduct extensive experiments across two related tasks: Video Reconstruction and Video Editing. Video-3DGS trained with 3k iterations significantly improves video reconstruction quality (+3 PSNR, +7 PSNR increase) and training efficiency (x1.9, x4.5 times faster) over NeRF-based and 3DGS-based state-of-art methods on DAVIS dataset, respectively. Moreover, it enhances video editing by ensuring temporal consistency across 58 dynamic monocular videos.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to TMLR 2025.

Specifically, our work explores to provide a general representation to boost the temporal matching ability in various downstream tracking tasks. To achieve this, we firstly find that a simple extension of MAE, which randomly masks out frame patches in videos and reconstruct the frame pixels, heavily relies on spatial cues while ignoring temporal relations for frame reconstruction, thus leading to sub-optimal temporal matching representations. To alleviate this, we propose DropMAE, which adaptively performs spatial-attention dropout in the frame reconstruction to facilitate temporal correspondence learning in videos. We obtain several important findings with DropMAE: 1) DropMAE is a strong and efficient temporal matching learner, which achieves better fine-tuning results on matching-based tasks than the ImageNet-based MAE with 2x faster pre-training speed. 2) DropMAE is effective for different tracking tasks, i.e., object-level matching tasks including VOT and VOS, dense tracking tasks including optical flow estimation and tracking any point (TAP), and even 3D tracking in the different modality of point cloud data. Since none exists, we build ViT-based trackers for different downstream tracking tasks, and our pre-trained DropMAE model can be directly loaded in these ViT-based trackers for fine-tuning without further modifications. Experiments on 6 downstream tracking tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of DropMAE as a general pre-trained representation for diverse tracking tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exten...</summary><p>Extension of DropMAE for 6 temporal matching-based downstream tasks</p></details> |
| **[Temporal-contextual Event Learning for Pedestrian Crossing Intent Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06292v1)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring the safety of vulnerable road users through accurate prediction of pedestrian crossing intention (PCI) plays a crucial role in the context of autonomous and assisted driving. Analyzing the set of observation video frames in ego-view has been widely used in most PCI prediction methods to forecast the cross intent. However, they struggle to capture the critical events related to pedestrian behaviour along the temporal dimension due to the high redundancy of the video frames, which results in the sub-optimal performance of PCI prediction. Our research addresses the challenge by introducing a novel approach called \underline{T}emporal-\underline{c}ontextual Event \underline{L}earning (TCL). The TCL is composed of the Temporal Merging Module (TMM), which aims to manage the redundancy by clustering the observed video frames into multiple key temporal events. Then, the Contextual Attention Block (CAB) is employed to adaptively aggregate multiple event features along with visual and non-visual data. By synthesizing the temporal feature extraction and contextual attention on the key information across the critical events, TCL can learn expressive representation for the PCI prediction. Extensive experiments are carried out on three widely adopted datasets, including PIE, JAAD-beh, and JAAD-all. The results show that TCL substantially surpasses the state-of-the-art methods.

| **[TQD-Track: Temporal Query Denoising for 3D Multi-Object Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03258v1)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Query denoising has become a standard training strategy for DETR-based detectors by addressing the slow convergence issue. Besides that, query denoising can be used to increase the diversity of training samples for modeling complex scenarios which is critical for Multi-Object Tracking (MOT), showing its potential in MOT application. Existing approaches integrate query denoising within the tracking-by-attention paradigm. However, as the denoising process only happens within the single frame, it cannot benefit the tracker to learn temporal-related information. In addition, the attention mask in query denoising prevents information exchange between denoising and object queries, limiting its potential in improving association using self-attention. To address these issues, we propose TQD-Track, which introduces Temporal Query Denoising (TQD) tailored for MOT, enabling denoising queries to carry temporal information and instance-specific feature representation. We introduce diverse noise types onto denoising queries that simulate real-world challenges in MOT. We analyze our proposed TQD for different tracking paradigms, and find out the paradigm with explicit learned data association module, e.g. tracking-by-detection or alternating detection and association, benefit from TQD by a larger margin. For these paradigms, we further design an association mask in the association module to ensure the consistent interaction between track and detection queries as during inference. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that our approach consistently enhances different tracking methods by only changing the training process, especially the paradigms with explicit association module.</p></details> |  |

We introduce HybridMamba, a novel architecture that combines visual transformers with state-space temporal modeling to achieve accurate crash time localization. Our method uses multi-level token compression and hierarchical temporal processing to remain computationally efficient without sacrificing temporal resolution. Evaluated on a large-scale dataset from the Iowa Department of Transportation, HybridMamba achieves a mean absolute error of 1.50 seconds, with 65.2 percent of predictions within one second of the ground truth. It outperforms recent video-language models such as TimeChat and VideoLLaMA2 by up to 2.8 seconds, while using significantly fewer parameters. Our results demonstrate strong generalization across videos ranging from 2 to 40 minutes in diverse conditions. HybridMamba offers a robust and efficient solution for fine-grained temporal localization in traffic surveillance. The code will be released upon publication.</p></details> |  |
| **[Electromyography-Based Gesture Recognition: Hierarchical Feature Extraction for Enhanced Spatial-Temporal Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03221v1)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hand gesture recognition using multichannel surface electromyography (sEMG) is challenging due to unstable predictions and inefficient time-varying feature enhancement. To overcome the lack of signal based time-varying feature problems, we propose a lightweight squeeze-excitation deep learning-based multi stream spatial temporal dynamics time-varying feature extraction approach to build an effective sEMG-based hand gesture recognition system. Each branch of the proposed model was designed to extract hierarchical features, capturing both global and detailed spatial-temporal relationships to ensure feature effectiveness. The first branch, utilizing a Bidirectional-TCN (Bi-TCN), focuses on capturing long-term temporal dependencies by modelling past and future temporal contexts, providing a holistic view of gesture dynamics. The second branch, incorporating a 1D Convolutional layer, separable CNN, and Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) block, efficiently extracts spatial-temporal features while emphasizing critical feature channels, enhancing feature relevance. The third branch, combining a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) and Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM), captures bidirectional temporal relationships and time-varying patterns. Outputs from all branches are fused using concatenation to capture subtle variations in the data and then refined with a channel attention module, selectively focusing on the most informative features while improving computational efficiency. The proposed model was tested on the Ninapro DB2, DB4, and DB5 datasets, achieving accuracy rates of 96.41%, 92.40%, and 93.34%, respectively. These results demonstrate the capability of the system to handle complex sEMG dynamics, offering advancements in prosthetic limb control and human-machine interface technologies with significant implications for assistive technologies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Pair Temporal Sentence Grounding via Multi-Thread Knowledge Transfer Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15678v2)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Given some video-query pairs with untrimmed videos and sentence queries, temporal sentence grounding (TSG) aims to locate query-relevant segments in these videos. Although previous respectable TSG methods have achieved remarkable success, they train each video-query pair separately and ignore the relationship between different pairs. We observe that the similar video/query content not only helps the TSG model better understand and generalize the cross-modal representation but also assists the model in locating some complex video-query pairs. Previous methods follow a single-thread framework that cannot co-train different pairs and usually spends much time re-obtaining redundant knowledge, limiting their real-world applications. To this end, in this paper, we pose a brand-new setting: Multi-Pair TSG, which aims to co-train these pairs. In particular, we propose a novel video-query co-training approach, Multi-Thread Knowledge Transfer Network, to locate a variety of video-query pairs effectively and efficiently. Firstly, we mine the spatial and temporal semantics across different queries to cooperate with each other. To learn intra- and inter-modal representations simultaneously, we design a cross-modal contrast module to explore the semantic consistency by a self-supervised strategy. To fully align visual and textual representations between different pairs, we design a prototype alignment strategy to 1) match object prototypes and phrase prototypes for spatial alignment, and 2) align activity prototypes and sentence prototypes for temporal alignment. Finally, we develop an adaptive negative selection module to adaptively generate a threshold for cross-modal matching. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[DP-LET: An Efficient Spatio-Temporal Network Traffic Prediction Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03792v1)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurately predicting spatio-temporal network traffic is essential for dynamically managing computing resources in modern communication systems and minimizing energy consumption. Although spatio-temporal traffic prediction has received extensive research attention, further improvements in prediction accuracy and computational efficiency remain necessary. In particular, existing decomposition-based methods or hybrid architectures often incur heavy overhead when capturing local and global feature correlations, necessitating novel approaches that optimize accuracy and complexity. In this paper, we propose an efficient spatio-temporal network traffic prediction framework, DP-LET, which consists of a data processing module, a local feature enhancement module, and a Transformer-based prediction module. The data processing module is designed for high-efficiency denoising of network data and spatial decoupling. In contrast, the local feature enhancement module leverages multiple Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs) to capture fine-grained local features. Meanwhile, the prediction module utilizes a Transformer encoder to model long-term dependencies and assess feature relevance. A case study on real-world cellular traffic prediction demonstrates the practicality of DP-LET, which maintains low computational complexity while achieving state-of-the-art performance, significantly reducing MSE by 31.8% and MAE by 23.1% compared to baseline models.</p></details> | 6 pages |
| **[How I Warped Your Noise: a Temporally-Correlated Noise Prior for Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03072v1)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video editing and generation methods often rely on pre-trained image-based diffusion models. During the diffusion process, however, the reliance on rudimentary noise sampling techniques that do not preserve correlations present in subsequent frames of a video is detrimental to the quality of the results. This either produces high-frequency flickering, or texture-sticking artifacts that are not amenable to post-processing. With this in mind, we propose a novel method for preserving temporal correlations in a sequence of noise samples. This approach is materialized by a novel noise representation, dubbed $\int$-noise (integral noise), that reinterprets individual noise samples as a continuously integrated noise field: pixel values do not represent discrete values, but are rather the integral of an underlying infinite-resolution noise over the pixel area. Additionally, we propose a carefully tailored transport method that uses $\int$-noise to accurately advect noise samples over a sequence of frames, maximizing the correlation between different frames while also preserving the noise properties. Our results demonstrate that the proposed $\int$-noise can be used for a variety of tasks, such as video restoration, surrogate rendering, and conditional video generation.

However, due to the complexity that the notion of time introduces to the learning of the rules, an accurate graph reasoning, e.g., predicting new links between entities, is still a difficult problem. In this paper, we propose TILP, a differentiable framework for temporal logical rules learning. By designing a constrained random walk mechanism and the introduction of temporal operators, we ensure the efficiency of our model. We present temporal features modeling in tKG, e.g., recurrence, temporal order, interval between pair of relations, and duration, and incorporate it into our learning process. We compare TILP with state-of-the-art methods on two benchmark datasets. We show that our proposed framework can improve upon the performance of baseline methods while providing interpretable results. In particular, we consider various scenarios in which training samples are limited, data is biased, and the time range between training and inference are different. In all these cases, TILP works much better than the state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | ICLR 2023 |
| **[Distributionally Robust Predictive Runtime Verification under Spatio-Temporal Logic Specifications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02964v1)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cyber-physical systems designed in simulators, often consisting of multiple interacting agents, behave differently in the real-world. We would like to verify these systems during runtime when they are deployed. Thus, we propose robust predictive runtime verification (RPRV) algorithms for: (1) general stochastic CPS under signal temporal logic (STL) tasks, and (2) stochastic multi-agent systems (MAS) under spatio-temporal logic tasks. The RPRV problem presents the following challenges: (1) there may not be sufficient data on the behavior of the deployed CPS, (2) predictive models based on design phase system trajectories may encounter distribution shift during real-world deployment, and (3) the algorithms need to scale to the complexity of MAS and be applicable to spatio-temporal logic tasks. To address these challenges, we assume knowledge of an upper bound on the statistical distance (in terms of an f-divergence) between the trajectory distributions of the system at deployment and design time. We are motivated by our prior work [1, 2] where we proposed an accurate and an interpretable RPRV algorithm for general CPS, which we here extend to the MAS setting and spatio-temporal logic tasks. Specifically, we use a learned predictive model to estimate the system behavior at runtime and robust conformal prediction to obtain probabilistic guarantees by accounting for distribution shifts. Building on [1], we perform robust conformal prediction over the robust semantics of spatio-temporal reach and escape logic (STREL) to obtain centralized RPRV algorithms for MAS. We empirically validate our results in a drone swarm simulator, where we show the scalability of our RPRV algorithms to MAS and analyze the impact of different trajectory predictors on the verification result. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first statistically valid algorithms for MAS under distribution shift.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2311.09482</p></details> |

We demonstrate the temporal effects of an LLM agent as a writing assistant, which uses web search to complete scientific publication abstracts. We show that the temporality of search engine translates into tool-dependent agent performance but can be alleviated with base model choice and explicit reasoning instructions such as chain-of-thought prompting. Our results indicate that agent design and evaluations should take a dynamical view and implement measures to account for the temporal influence of external resources to ensure reliability.</p></details> | <details><summary>under...</summary><p>under review, comments welcome</p></details> |

Introduced by Fox, Roughgarden, Seshadhri, Wei and Wein [ICALP 2018, SICOMP 2020], this definition is an abstraction of the triadic closure property exhibited by many real-world social networks, namely, friends of friends tend to be friends themselves. Social networks, however, are often temporal rather than static -- the connections change over a period of time. And hence temporal graphs, rather than static graphs, are often better suited to model social networks. Motivated by this, we introduce a definition of temporal c-closed graphs, in which if two vertices u and v have at least c common neighbors during a short interval of time, then u and v are adjacent to each other around that time. Our pilot experiments show that several real-world temporal networks are c-closed for rather small values of c. We also study the computational problems of enumerating maximal cliques and similar dense subgraphs in temporal c-closed graphs; a clique in a temporal graph is a subgraph that lasts for a certain period of time, during which every possible edge in the subgraph becomes active often enough, and other dense subgraphs are defined similarly. We bound the number of such maximal dense subgraphs in a temporal c-closed graph that evolves slowly, and thus show that the corresponding enumeration problems admit efficient algorithms; by slow evolution, we mean that between consecutive time-steps, the local change in adjacencies remains small. Our work also adds to a growing body of literature on defining suitable structural parameters for temporal graphs that can be leveraged to design efficient algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in AAAI 2025</p></details> |

Existing CDFSAR methods mainly focus on joint training of source and target data to mitigate the side effect of domain gap. However, such kind of methods suffer from two limitations: First, pair-wise joint training requires retraining deep models in case of one source data and multiple target ones, which incurs heavy computation cost, especially for large source and small target data. Second, pre-trained models after joint training are adopted to target domain in a straightforward manner, hardly taking full potential of pre-trained models and then limiting recognition performance. To overcome above limitations, this paper proposes a simple yet effective baseline, namely Temporal-Aware Model Tuning (TAMT) for CDFSAR. Specifically, our TAMT involves a decoupled paradigm by performing pre-training on source data and fine-tuning target data, which avoids retraining for multiple target data with single source. To effectively and efficiently explore the potential of pre-trained models in transferring to target domain, our TAMT proposes a Hierarchical Temporal Tuning Network (HTTN), whose core involves local temporal-aware adapters (TAA) and a global temporal-aware moment tuning (GTMT). Particularly, TAA learns few parameters to recalibrate the intermediate features of frozen pre-trained models, enabling efficient adaptation to target domains. Furthermore, GTMT helps to generate powerful video representations, improving match performance on the target domain. Experiments on several widely used video benchmarks show our TAMT outperforms the recently proposed counterparts by 13%$\sim$31%, achieving new state-of-the-art CDFSAR results.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2025; Project page: https://github.com/TJU-YDragonW/TAMT</p></details> |

Traditional approaches often simplify road networks into standard graphs, which results in a failure to consider the dynamic nature of traffic data at neighboring intersections, thereby neglecting higher-order interconnections necessary for real-time control. To address this, we propose a novel TSCS framework to realize intelligent traffic control. This framework collaborates with multiple neighboring edge computing servers to collect traffic information across the road network. To elevate the efficiency of traffic signal control, we have crafted a multi-agent soft actor-critic (MA-SAC) reinforcement learning algorithm. Within this algorithm, individual agents are deployed at each intersection with a mandate to optimize traffic flow across the road network collectively. Furthermore, we introduce hypergraph learning into the critic network of MA-SAC to enable the spatio-temporal interactions from multiple intersections in the road network. This method fuses hypergraph and spatio-temporal graph structures to encode traffic data and capture the complex spatio-temporal correlations between multiple intersections. Our empirical evaluation, tested on varied datasets, demonstrates the superiority of our framework in minimizing average vehicle travel times and sustaining high-throughput performance. This work facilitates the development of more intelligent urban traffic management solutions.

Hence, we define a protocol for unseen view action segmentation where camera views for evaluating the model are unavailable during training. This includes changing from top-frontal views to a side view or even more challenging from exocentric to egocentric views. Furthermore, we present an approach for temporal action segmentation that tackles this challenge. Our approach leverages a shared representation at both the sequence and segment levels to reduce the impact of view differences during training. We achieve this by introducing a sequence loss and an action loss, which together facilitate consistent video and action representations across different views. The evaluation on the Assembly101, IkeaASM, and EgoExoLearn datasets demonstrate significant improvements, with a 12.8% increase in F1@50 for unseen exocentric views and a substantial 54% improvement for unseen egocentric views.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods are highly dependent on clean, high-quality inputs, making them susceptible to noise and real-world imperfections. Additionally, intricate temporal relationships in time series data are often inadequately captured in traditional 1D representations, leading to suboptimal modeling of dependencies. We introduce VISTA, a training-free, unsupervised TSAD algorithm designed to overcome these challenges. VISTA features three core modules: 1) Time Series Decomposition using Seasonal and Trend Decomposition via Loess (STL) to decompose noisy time series into trend, seasonal, and residual components; 2) Temporal Self-Attention, which transforms 1D time series into 2D temporal correlation matrices for richer dependency modeling and anomaly detection; and 3) Multivariate Temporal Aggregation, which uses a pretrained feature extractor to integrate cross-variable information into a unified, memory-efficient representation. VISTA's training-free approach enables rapid deployment and easy hyperparameter tuning, making it suitable for industrial applications. It achieves state-of-the-art performance on five multivariate TSAD benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

Early studies always encounter trade-offs related to sampling rate, bandwidth, field of view, and the simplicity of the optical path. Recent advances in event camera hardware show good potential for its application in visual sound recovery, because of its superior ability in capturing high-frequency signals. However, existing event-based vibration recovery methods are still sub-optimal for sound recovery. In this work, we propose a novel pipeline for non-contact sound recovery, fully utilizing spatial-temporal information from the event stream. We first generate a large training set using a novel simulation pipeline. Then we designed a network that leverages the sparsity of events to capture spatial information and uses Mamba to model long-term temporal information. Lastly, we train a spatial aggregation block to aggregate information from different locations to further improve signal quality. To capture event signals caused by sound waves, we also designed an imaging system using a laser matrix to enhance the gradient and collected multiple data sequences for testing.

Existing statistical methods and deep learning methods have shown promising results in time series imputation. In this paper, we propose a Temporal Gaussian Copula Model (TGC) for three-order MTS imputation. The key idea is to leverage the Gaussian Copula to explore the cross-variable and temporal relationships based on the latent Gaussian representation. Subsequently, we employ an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm to improve robustness in managing data with varying missing rates. Comprehensive experiments were conducted on three real-world MTS datasets. The results demonstrate that our TGC substantially outperforms the state-of-the-art imputation methods. Additionally, the TGC model exhibits stronger robustness to the varying missing ratios in the test dataset.

However, the growing inter-dependencies have introduced numerous attack vectors, making supply chains a prime target for exploitation. In particular, advanced persistent threats (APTs) frequently leverage supply chain vulnerabilities (SCVs) as entry points, benefiting from their inherent stealth. Current defense strategies primarly focus on prevention through blockchain for integrity assurance or detection using plain-text source code analysis in open-source software (OSS). However, these approaches overlook scenarios where source code is unavailable and fail to address detection and defense during runtime. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel approach that integrates multi-source data, constructs a comprehensive dynamic provenance graph, and detects APT behavior in real time using temporal graph learning. Given the lack of tailored datasets in both industry and academia, we also aim to simulate a custom dataset by replaying real-world supply chain exploits with multi-source monitoring.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted at 45th IEEE International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems</p></details> |
| **[Moment Quantization for Video Temporal Grounding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02286v1)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video temporal grounding is a critical video understanding task, which aims to localize moments relevant to a language description. The challenge of this task lies in distinguishing relevant and irrelevant moments. Previous methods focused on learning continuous features exhibit weak differentiation between foreground and background features. In this paper, we propose a novel Moment-Quantization based Video Temporal Grounding method (MQVTG), which quantizes the input video into various discrete vectors to enhance the discrimination between relevant and irrelevant moments. Specifically, MQVTG maintains a learnable moment codebook, where each video moment matches a codeword. Considering the visual diversity, i.e., various visual expressions for the same moment, MQVTG treats moment-codeword matching as a clustering process without using discrete vectors, avoiding the loss of useful information from direct hard quantization. Additionally, we employ effective prior-initialization and joint-projection strategies to enhance the maintained moment codebook. With its simple implementation, the proposed method can be integrated into existing temporal grounding models as a plug-and-play component. Extensive experiments on six popular benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of MQVTG, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Further qualitative analysis shows that our method effectively groups relevant features and separates irrelevant ones, aligning with our goal of enhancing discrimination.</p></details> |  |

This ability to reason over time allows us to identify future steps and understand the effects of financial and political decisions on our lives. However, large language models (LLMs) are typically trained on static datasets, limiting their ability to perform effective temporal reasoning. To assess the temporal reasoning capabilities of LLMs, we present the TRANSIENTTABLES dataset, which comprises 3,971 questions derived from over 14,000 tables, spanning 1,238 entities across multiple time periods. We introduce a template-based question-generation pipeline that harnesses LLMs to refine both templates and questions. Additionally, we establish baseline results using state-of-the-art LLMs to create a benchmark. We also introduce novel modeling strategies centered around task decomposition, enhancing LLM performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 Pa...</summary><p>19 Pages. 21 Tables, 1 figure</p></details> |
| **[Decoding Covert Speech from EEG Using a Functional Areas Spatio-Temporal Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03762v1)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Covert speech involves imagining speaking without audible sound or any movements. Decoding covert speech from electroencephalogram (EEG) is challenging due to a limited understanding of neural pronunciation mapping and the low signal-to-noise ratio of the signal. In this study, we developed a large-scale multi-utterance speech EEG dataset from 57 right-handed native English-speaking subjects, each performing covert and overt speech tasks by repeating the same word in five utterances within a ten-second duration. Given the spatio-temporal nature of the neural activation process during speech pronunciation, we developed a Functional Areas Spatio-temporal Transformer (FAST), an effective framework for converting EEG signals into tokens and utilizing transformer architecture for sequence encoding. Our results reveal distinct and interpretable speech neural features by the visualization of FAST-generated activation maps across frontal and temporal brain regions with each word being covertly spoken, providing new insights into the discriminative features of the neural representation of covert speech. This is the first report of such a study, which provides interpretable evidence for speech decoding from EEG.

| **[DRAN: A Distribution and Relation Adaptive Network for Spatio-temporal Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01531v1)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate predictions of spatio-temporal systems' states are crucial for tasks such as system management, control, and crisis prevention. However, the inherent time variance of spatio-temporal systems poses challenges to achieving accurate predictions whenever stationarity is not granted. To address non-stationarity frameworks, we propose a Distribution and Relation Adaptive Network (DRAN) capable of dynamically adapting to relation and distribution changes over time. While temporal normalization and de-normalization are frequently used techniques to adapt to distribution shifts, this operation is not suitable for the spatio-temporal context as temporal normalization scales the time series of nodes and possibly disrupts the spatial relations among nodes. In order to address this problem, we develop a Spatial Factor Learner (SFL) module that enables the normalization and de-normalization process in spatio-temporal systems. To adapt to dynamic changes in spatial relationships among sensors, we propose a Dynamic-Static Fusion Learner (DSFL) module that effectively integrates features learned from both dynamic and static relations through an adaptive fusion ratio mechanism. Furthermore, we introduce a Stochastic Learner to capture the noisy components of spatio-temporal representations. Our approach outperforms state of the art methods in weather prediction and traffic flows forecasting tasks. Experimental results show that our SFL efficiently preserves spatial relationships across various temporal normalization operations. Visualizations of the learned dynamic and static relations demonstrate that DSFL can capture both local and distant relationships between nodes. Moreover, ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of each component.</p></details> | 15 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Diameter Shortcut Sets on Temporal Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01485v1)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Shortcut sets are a vital instrument for reducing the diameter of a static graph and, consequently, its shortest path complexity, which is relevant in numerous subfields of graph theory. We explore the notion of shortcut sets in temporal graphs, which incorporate a discrete time model into the graph, rendering each edge accessible exclusively at specific points in time. This not only alters the underlying assumptions of regular graphs but also substantially increases the complexity of path problems and reachability. In turn, a temporal graph is often a much more realistic and accurate representation of a real-world network. In this thesis we provide a definition for a shortcut set in a temporal graph and explore differences to classic shortcut sets. Utilizing this definition, we show that temporal and regular shortcut sets yield the same results on temporal paths, enabling the application of existing construction algorithms for static shortcut sets on paths. The primary contribution of this thesis is a translation approach for general temporal graphs that utilizes the static expansion of a temporal graph, allowing the conversion of static shortcut sets into temporal shortcut sets, yielding similar results.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is my Bachelor's thesis submitted at the Digital Engineering Faculty of the University of Potsdam on March 7, 2025</p></details> |
| **[Detecting Lip-Syncing Deepfakes: Vision Temporal Transformer for Analyzing Mouth Inconsistencies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01470v1)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deepfakes are AI-generated media in which the original content is digitally altered to create convincing but manipulated images, videos, or audio. Among the various types of deepfakes, lip-syncing deepfakes are one of the most challenging deepfakes to detect. In these videos, a person's lip movements are synthesized to match altered or entirely new audio using AI models. Therefore, unlike other types of deepfakes, the artifacts in lip-syncing deepfakes are confined to the mouth region, making them more subtle and, thus harder to discern. In this paper, we propose LIPINC-V2, a novel detection framework that leverages a combination of vision temporal transformer with multihead cross-attention to detect lip-syncing deepfakes by identifying spatiotemporal inconsistencies in the mouth region. These inconsistencies appear across adjacent frames and persist throughout the video. Our model can successfully capture both short-term and long-term variations in mouth movement, enhancing its ability to detect these inconsistencies. Additionally, we created a new lip-syncing deepfake dataset, LipSyncTIMIT, which was generated using five state-of-the-art lip-syncing models to simulate real-world scenarios. Extensive experiments on our proposed LipSyncTIMIT dataset and two other benchmark deepfake datasets demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance. The code and the dataset are available at https://github.com/skrantidatta/LIPINC-V2 .</p></details> |  |

A Deep Look at Temporal Generalization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08460v3)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to the development of benchmarks that consider temporal dynamics, however, there remains a gap in understanding how well these models can generalize across temporal contexts due to the inherent dynamic nature of language and information. This paper introduces the concept of temporal generalization in LLMs, including bias in past and future generalizations. Then we introduce FreshBench, a new evaluation framework that employs fresh text and event prediction for assessing LLMs' temporal adaptability, ensuring the evaluation process free from data leakage and subjective bias. The experiment shows significant temporal biases and a decline in performance over time. Our findings reveal that powerful models, while initially superior, tend to decline more rapidly in future generalization. Additionally, powerful open-source models demonstrate better long-term adaptability compared to their closed-source counterparts.

Such data occurs widely, ranging from the scientific and medical domains to the industrial and environmental domains. When the properties in time series exhibit spatial variations, we often call the data spatio-temporal. As part of the continued digitalization of processes throughout society, increasingly large volumes of time series and spatio-temporal data are available. In this tutorial, we focus on data-driven decision making with such data, e.g., enabling greener and more efficient transportation based on traffic time series forecasting. The tutorial adopts the holistic paradigm of ``data-governance-analytics-decision.'' We first introduce the data foundation of time series and spatio-temporal data, which is often heterogeneous. Next, we discuss data governance methods that aim to improve data quality. We then cover data analytics, focusing on the ``AGREE'' principles: Automation, Generalization, Robustness, Explainability, and Efficiency. We finally cover data-driven decision making strategies and briefly discuss promising research directions. We hope that the tutorial will serve as a primary resource for researchers and practitioners who are interested in value creation from time series and spatio-temporal data.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted by ICDE 2025</p></details> |
| **[Recurrent Stochastic Configuration Networks for Temporal Data Analytics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16959v3)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal data modelling techniques with neural networks are useful in many domain applications, including time-series forecasting and control engineering. This paper aims at developing a recurrent version of stochastic configuration networks (RSCNs) for problem solving, where we have no underlying assumption on the dynamic orders of the input variables. Given a collection of historical data, we first build an initial RSCN model in the light of a supervisory mechanism, followed by an online update of the output weights by using a projection algorithm. Some theoretical results are established, including the echo state property, the universal approximation property of RSCNs for both the offline and online learnings, and the convergence of the output weights. The proposed RSCN model is remarkably distinguished from the well-known echo state networks (ESNs) in terms of the way of assigning the input random weight matrix and a special structure of the random feedback matrix. A comprehensive comparison study among the long short-term memory (LSTM) network, the original ESN, and several state-of-the-art ESN methods such as the simple cycle reservoir (SCR), the polynomial ESN (PESN), the leaky-integrator ESN (LIESN) and RSCN is carried out. Numerical results clearly indicate that the proposed RSCN performs favourably over all of the datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Biologically Inspired Hierarchical Temporal Memory with Hardware-Accelerated Reflex Memory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03746v1)** | 2025-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid expansion of the Internet of Things (IoT) generates zettabytes of data that demand efficient unsupervised learning systems. Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM), a third-generation unsupervised AI algorithm, models the neocortex of the human brain by simulating columns of neurons to process and predict sequences. These neuron columns can memorize and infer sequences across multiple orders. While multiorder inferences offer robust predictive capabilities, they often come with significant computational overhead. The Sequence Memory (SM) component of HTM, which manages these inferences, encounters bottlenecks primarily due to its extensive programmable interconnects. In many cases, it has been observed that first-order temporal relationships have proven to be sufficient without any significant loss in efficiency. This paper introduces a Reflex Memory (RM) block, inspired by the Spinal Cord's working mechanisms, designed to accelerate the processing of first-order inferences. The RM block performs these inferences significantly faster than the SM. The integration of RM with HTM forms a system called the Accelerated Hierarchical Temporal Memory (AHTM), which processes repetitive information more efficiently than the original HTM while still supporting multiorder inferences. The experimental results demonstrate that the HTM predicts an event in 0.945 s, whereas the AHTM module does so in 0.125 s. Additionally, the hardware implementation of RM in a content-addressable memory (CAM) block, known as Hardware-Accelerated Hierarchical Temporal Memory (H-AHTM), predicts an event in just 0.094 s, significantly improving inference speed. Compared to the original algorithm \cite{bautista2020matlabhtm}, AHTM accelerates inference by up to 7.55x, while H-AHTM further enhances performance with a 10.10x speedup.</p></details> |  |
| **[Agile Temporal Discretization for Symbolic Optimal Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03741v1)** | 2025-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As control systems grow in complexity, abstraction-based methods have become essential for designing controllers with formal guarantees. However, a key limitation of these methods is their reliance on discrete-time models, typically obtained by discretizing continuous-time systems with a fixed time step. This discretization leads to two major problems: when the time step is small, the abstraction includes numerous stuttering and spurious trajectories, making controller synthesis suboptimal or even infeasible; conversely, a large time step may also render control design infeasible due to a lack of flexibility. In this work, drawing inspiration from Reinforcement Learning concepts, we introduce temporal abstractions, which allow for a flexible time-step. We provide a method for constructing such abstractions and formally establish their correctness in controller design. Furthermore we show how to apply these to optimal control under reachability specifications. Finally we showcase our methods on two numerical examples, highlighting that our approach leads to better controllers.</p></details> |  |
| **[FDDet: Frequency-Decoupling for Boundary Refinement in Temporal Action Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00647v1)** | 2025-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal action detection aims to locate and classify actions in untrimmed videos. While recent works focus on designing powerful feature processors for pre-trained representations, they often overlook the inherent noise and redundancy within these features. Large-scale pre-trained video encoders tend to introduce background clutter and irrelevant semantics, leading to context confusion and imprecise boundaries. To address this, we propose a frequency-aware decoupling network that improves action discriminability by filtering out noisy semantics captured by pre-trained models. Specifically, we introduce an adaptive temporal decoupling scheme that suppresses irrelevant information while preserving fine-grained atomic action details, yielding more task-specific representations. In addition, we enhance inter-frame modeling by capturing temporal variations to better distinguish actions from background redundancy. Furthermore, we present a long-short-term category-aware relation network that jointly models local transitions and long-range dependencies, improving localization precision. The refined atomic features and frequency-guided dynamics are fed into a standard detection head to produce accurate action predictions. Extensive experiments on THUMOS14, HACS, and ActivityNet-1.3 show that our method, powered by InternVideo2-6B features, achieves state-of-the-art performance on temporal action detection benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[AttentiveGRU: Recurrent Spatio-Temporal Modeling for Advanced Radar-Based BEV Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00559v1)** | 2025-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bird's-eye view (BEV) object detection has become important for advanced automotive 3D radar-based perception systems. However, the inherently sparse and non-deterministic nature of radar data limits the effectiveness of traditional single-frame BEV paradigms. In this paper, we addresses this limitation by introducing AttentiveGRU, a novel attention-based recurrent approach tailored for radar constraints, which extracts individualized spatio-temporal context for objects by dynamically identifying and fusing temporally correlated structures across present and memory states. By leveraging the consistency of object's latent representation over time, our approach exploits temporal relations to enrich feature representations for both stationary and moving objects, thereby enhancing detection performance and eliminating the need for externally providing or estimating any information about ego vehicle motion. Our experimental results on the public nuScenes dataset show a significant increase in mAP for the car category by 21% over the best radar-only submission. Further evaluations on an additional dataset demonstrate notable improvements in object detection capabilities, underscoring the applicability and effectiveness of our method.</p></details> |  |

Additionally, SNN possess a crucial characteristic, namely the ability to process spatio-temporal information. However, this ability is constrained by both internal and external factors in practical applications, thereby affecting the performance of SNN. Firstly, the internal issue of SNN lies in the inherent limitations of their network structure and neuronal model, which result in the network adopting a unified processing approach for information of different temporal dimensions when processing input data containing complex temporal information. Secondly, the external issue of SNN stems from the direct encoding method commonly adopted by directly trained SNN, which uses the same feature map for input at each time step, failing to fully exploit the spatio-temporal characteristics of SNN. To address these issues, this paper proposes an Unconstrained Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (ULIF) neuronal model that allows for learning different membrane potential parameters at different time steps, thereby enhancing SNN' ability to process information of different temporal dimensions. Additionally, this paper presents a hybrid encoding scheme aimed at solving the problem of direct encoding lacking temporal dimension information. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed methods effectively improve the overall performance of SNN in object detection and object recognition tasks. related code is available at https://github.com/hhx0320/ASNN.</p></details> |  |

However, the scarcity of such data presents a significant hurdle to extending these methods to general use cases. To address this concern, we present an automated framework to decompose trajectory data into temporally bounded and natural language-based descriptive sub-tasks by leveraging recent prompting strategies for Foundation Models (FMs) including both Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision Language Models (VLMs). Our framework provides both time-based and language-based descriptions for lower-level sub-tasks that comprise full trajectories. To rigorously evaluate the quality of our automatic labeling framework, we contribute an algorithm SIMILARITY to produce two novel metrics, temporal similarity and semantic similarity. The metrics measure the temporal alignment and semantic fidelity of language descriptions between two sub-task decompositions, namely an FM sub-task decomposition prediction and a ground-truth sub-task decomposition. We present scores for temporal similarity and semantic similarity above 90%, compared to 30% of a randomized baseline, for multiple robotic environments, demonstrating the effectiveness of our proposed framework. Our results enable building diverse, large-scale, language-supervised datasets for improved robotic TAMP.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures.

| **[EventMamba: Enhancing Spatio-Temporal Locality with State Space Models for Event-Based Video Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19721v3)** | 2025-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Leveraging its robust linear global modeling capability, Mamba has notably excelled in computer vision. Despite its success, existing Mamba-based vision models have overlooked the nuances of event-driven tasks, especially in video reconstruction. Event-based video reconstruction (EBVR) demands spatial translation invariance and close attention to local event relationships in the spatio-temporal domain. Unfortunately, conventional Mamba algorithms apply static window partitions and standard reshape scanning methods, leading to significant losses in local connectivity. To overcome these limitations, we introduce EventMamba--a specialized model designed for EBVR tasks. EventMamba innovates by incorporating random window offset (RWO) in the spatial domain, moving away from the restrictive fixed partitioning. Additionally, it features a new consistent traversal serialization approach in the spatio-temporal domain, which maintains the proximity of adjacent events both spatially and temporally. These enhancements enable EventMamba to retain Mamba's robust modeling capabilities while significantly preserving the spatio-temporal locality of event data. Comprehensive testing on multiple datasets shows that EventMamba markedly enhances video reconstruction, drastically improving computation speed while delivering superior visual quality compared to Transformer-based methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[UniFlow: A Foundation Model for Unified Urban Spatio-Temporal Flow Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12972v3)** | 2025-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Urban spatio-temporal flow prediction, encompassing traffic flows and crowd flows, is crucial for optimizing city infrastructure and managing traffic and emergency responses. Traditional approaches have relied on separate models tailored to either grid-based data, representing cities as uniform cells, or graph-based data, modeling cities as networks of nodes and edges. In this paper, we build UniFlow, a foundational model for general urban flow prediction that unifies both grid-based and graphbased data. We first design a multi-view spatio-temporal patching mechanism to standardize different data into a consistent sequential format and then introduce a spatio-temporal transformer architecture to capture complex correlations and dynamics. To leverage shared spatio-temporal patterns across different data types and facilitate effective cross-learning, we propose SpatioTemporal Memory Retrieval Augmentation (ST-MRA). By creating structured memory modules to store shared spatio-temporal patterns, ST-MRA enhances predictions through adaptive memory retrieval. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniFlow outperforms existing models in both grid-based and graph-based flow prediction, excelling particularly in scenarios with limited data availability, showcasing its superior performance and broad applicability.

However, hallucination, where models generate inaccurate or misleading content, remains underexplored in the video domain. Building on the observation that MLLM visual encoders often fail to distinguish visually different yet semantically similar video pairs, we introduce VidHalluc, the largest benchmark designed to examine hallucinations in MLLMs for video understanding. It consists of 5,002 videos, paired to highlight cases prone to hallucinations. VidHalluc assesses hallucinations across three critical dimensions: (1) action, (2) temporal sequence, and (3) scene transition. Comprehensive testing shows that most MLLMs are vulnerable to hallucinations across these dimensions. Furthermore, we propose DINO-HEAL, a training-free method that reduces hallucinations by incorporating spatial saliency from DINOv2 to reweight visual features during inference. Our results show that DINO-HEAL consistently improves performance on VidHalluc, achieving an average improvement of 3.02% in mitigating hallucinations across all tasks.

| **[Towards Precise Action Spotting: Addressing Temporal Misalignment in Labels with Dynamic Label Assignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00149v1)** | 2025-03-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Precise action spotting has attracted considerable attention due to its promising applications. While existing methods achieve substantial performance by employing well-designed model architecture, they overlook a significant challenge: the temporal misalignment inherent in ground-truth labels. This misalignment arises when frames labeled as containing events do not align accurately with the actual event times, often as a result of human annotation errors or the inherent difficulties in precisely identifying event boundaries across neighboring frames. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel dynamic label assignment strategy that allows predictions to have temporal offsets from ground-truth action times during training, ensuring consistent event spotting. Our method extends the concept of minimum-cost matching, which is utilized in the spatial domain for object detection, to the temporal domain. By calculating matching costs based on predicted action class scores and temporal offsets, our method dynamically assigns labels to the most likely predictions, even when the predicted times of these predictions deviate from ground-truth times, alleviating the negative effects of temporal misalignment in labels. We conduct extensive experiments and demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly in conditions where events are visually distinct and temporal misalignment in labels is common.</p></details> |  |

Having knowledge of the total demand between various locations in the upcoming time slots enables platforms to proactively prepare adequate supplies, thereby increasing the likelihood of fulfilling travelers' requests and redistributing idle drivers to areas with high potential demand to optimize the global supply-demand equilibrium. This paper delves into the prediction of Origin-Destination (OD) demands at a fine-grained spatial level, especially when confronted with an expansive set of local regions. While this task holds immense practical value, it remains relatively unexplored within the research community. To fill this gap, we introduce a novel prediction model called OD-CED, which comprises an unsupervised space coarsening technique to alleviate data sparsity and an encoder-decoder architecture to capture both semantic and geographic dependencies. Through practical experimentation, OD-CED has demonstrated remarkable results. It achieved an impressive reduction of up to 45% reduction in root-mean-square error and 60% in weighted mean absolute percentage error over traditional statistical methods when dealing with OD matrices exhibiting a sparsity exceeding 90%.</p></details> |  |

The realization of high-speed and high-precision eye-tracking using frame-based image sensors is constrained by their limited temporal resolution, which impairs the accurate capture of rapid ocular dynamics, such as saccades and blinks. Event cameras, inspired by biological vision systems, are capable of perceiving eye movements with extremely low power consumption and ultra-high temporal resolution. This makes them a promising solution for achieving high-speed, high-precision tracking with rich temporal dynamics. In this paper, we propose TDTracker, an effective eye-tracking framework that captures rapid eye movements by thoroughly modeling temporal dynamics from both implicit and explicit perspectives. TDTracker utilizes 3D convolutional neural networks to capture implicit short-term temporal dynamics and employs a cascaded structure consisting of a Frequency-aware Module, GRU, and Mamba to extract explicit long-term temporal dynamics. Ultimately, a prediction heatmap is used for eye coordinate regression. Experimental results demonstrate that TDTracker achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on the synthetic SEET dataset and secured Third place in the CVPR event-based eye-tracking challenge 2025.

Traditional influence maximization strategies often fail to keep up with rapidly evolving relationships and structures, leading to missed opportunities and inefficiencies. To address this, we propose a novel learning-based approach integrating Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) models. This hybrid framework captures both structural and temporal dynamics, enabling accurate prediction of candidate nodes for seed set selection. The bidirectional nature of BiLSTM allows our model to analyze patterns from both past and future network states, ensuring adaptability to changes over time. By dynamically adapting to graph evolution at each time snapshot, our approach improves seed set calculation efficiency, achieving an average of 90% accuracy in predicting potential seed nodes across diverse networks. This significantly reduces computational overhead by optimizing the number of nodes evaluated for seed selection. Our method is particularly effective in fields like viral marketing and social network analysis, where understanding temporal dynamics is crucial.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 5 figures, Accepted in AAAI25 to AI4TS Workshop@AAAI 2025</p></details> |

Here, we present a novel in-situ spatiotemporal sequence detector that leverages vertical NAND storage to achieve massively parallel pattern detection. By encoding each cell with two single-transistor-based multi-level cell (MLC) memory elements, such as ferroelectric field-effect transistors (FeFETs), and mapping a pixel's temporal sequence onto consecutive word lines (WLs), we enable direct temporal pattern detection within NAND strings. Each NAND string serves as a dedicated reference for a single pixel, while different blocks store patterns for distinct pixels, allowing large-scale spatial-temporal pattern recognition via simple direct bit-line (BL) sensing, a well-established operation in vertical NAND storage. We experimentally validate our approach at both the cell and array levels, demonstrating that vertical NAND-based detector achieves more than six orders of magnitude improvement in energy efficiency and more than three orders of magnitude reduction in latency compared to conventional CPU-based methods. These findings establish vertical NAND storage as a scalable and energy-efficient solution for next-generation neuromorphic vision processing.</p></details> | 26 pages, 7 figures |

In cinematography, Directors of Photography meticulously craft camera movements to achieve expressive and intentional framing. However, existing methods for camera trajectory generation remain limited: Traditional approaches rely on geometric optimization or handcrafted procedural systems, while recent learning-based methods often inherit structural biases or lack textual alignment, constraining creative synthesis. In this work, we introduce an auto-regressive model inspired by the expertise of Directors of Photography to generate artistic and expressive camera trajectories. We first introduce DataDoP, a large-scale multi-modal dataset containing 29K real-world shots with free-moving camera trajectories, depth maps, and detailed captions in specific movements, interaction with the scene, and directorial intent. Thanks to the comprehensive and diverse database, we further train an auto-regressive, decoder-only Transformer for high-quality, context-aware camera movement generation based on text guidance and RGBD inputs, named GenDoP. Extensive experiments demonstrate that compared to existing methods, GenDoP offers better controllability, finer-grained trajectory adjustments, and higher motion stability. We believe our approach establishes a new standard for learning-based cinematography, paving the way for future advancements in camera control and filmmaking.

| **[Opinion dynamics and the unpredictability of opinion trajectories in an adaptive social network model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07848v1)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding opinion dynamics in social networks is critical for predicting social behavior and detecting polarization. Traditional approaches often rely on static snapshots of network states, which can obscure the underlying dynamics of opinion evolution. In this study, we introduce a dynamic framework that quantifies the unpredictability of opinion trajectories using the normalized Lempel-Ziv (nLZ) complexity. Our approach leverages an adaptive social network model where each node is characterized by three behavioral parameters - homophily, neophily, and social conformity - and where opinions evolve continuously according to a system of ordinary differential equations. The results reveal distinct nLZ complexity signatures for each node type: homophilic nodes exhibit consistently rising complexity, reflecting increasingly unpredictable opinion shifts that are counterintuitive given their tendency for similarity; neophilic nodes maintain low and stable complexity, suggesting that openness to novelty can, surprisingly, lead to stable opinion dynamics; and conformic nodes display a U-shaped complexity trend, transitioning from early opinion stagnation to later unpredictability. In fully heterogeneous networks, modest interaction effects emerge, with slight shifts in the unpredictability of each faction's trajectories. These findings underscore the importance of temporal analysis in uncovering hidden dynamical patterns, offering novel insights into the mechanisms underlying social adaptation and polarization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory Optimization Under Stochastic Dynamics Leveraging Maximum Mean Discrepancy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19045v2)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper addresses sampling-based trajectory optimization for risk-aware navigation under stochastic dynamics. Typically such approaches operate by computing $\tilde{N}$ perturbed rollouts around the nominal dynamics to estimate the collision risk associated with a sequence of control commands. We consider a setting where it is expensive to estimate risk using perturbed rollouts, for example, due to expensive collision-checks. We put forward two key contributions. First, we develop an algorithm that distills the statistical information from a larger set of rollouts to a reduced-set with sample size $N<<\tilde{N}$. Consequently, we estimate collision risk using just $N$ rollouts instead of $\tilde{N}$. Second, we formulate a novel surrogate for the collision risk that can leverage the distilled statistical information contained in the reduced-set. We formalize both algorithmic contributions using distribution embedding in Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) and Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD). We perform extensive benchmarking to demonstrate that our MMD-based approach leads to safer trajectories at low sample regime than existing baselines using Conditional Value-at Risk (CVaR) based collision risk estimate.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://github.com/Basant1861/MPC-MMD</p></details> |
| **[Efficient Swept Volume-Based Trajectory Generation for Arbitrary-Shaped Ground Robot Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07554v1)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Navigating an arbitrary-shaped ground robot safely in cluttered environments remains a challenging problem. The existing trajectory planners that account for the robot's physical geometry severely suffer from the intractable runtime. To achieve both computational efficiency and Continuous Collision Avoidance (CCA) of arbitrary-shaped ground robot planning, we proposed a novel coarse-to-fine navigation framework that significantly accelerates planning. In the first stage, a sampling-based method selectively generates distinct topological paths that guarantee a minimum inflated margin. In the second stage, a geometry-aware front-end strategy is designed to discretize these topologies into full-state robot motion sequences while concurrently partitioning the paths into SE(2) sub-problems and simpler R2 sub-problems for back-end optimization. In the final stage, an SVSDF-based optimizer generates trajectories tailored to these sub-problems and seamlessly splices them into a continuous final motion plan. Extensive benchmark comparisons show that the proposed method is one to several orders of magnitude faster than the cutting-edge methods in runtime while maintaining a high planning success rate and ensuring CCA.</p></details> |  |
| **[Novel Diffusion Models for Multimodal 3D Hand Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07375v1)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting hand motion is critical for understanding human intentions and bridging the action space between human movements and robot manipulations. Existing hand trajectory prediction (HTP) methods forecast the future hand waypoints in 3D space conditioned on past egocentric observations. However, such models are only designed to accommodate 2D egocentric video inputs. There is a lack of awareness of multimodal environmental information from both 2D and 3D observations, hindering the further improvement of 3D HTP performance. In addition, these models overlook the synergy between hand movements and headset camera egomotion, either predicting hand trajectories in isolation or encoding egomotion only from past frames. To address these limitations, we propose novel diffusion models (MMTwin) for multimodal 3D hand trajectory prediction. MMTwin is designed to absorb multimodal information as input encompassing 2D RGB images, 3D point clouds, past hand waypoints, and text prompt. Besides, two latent diffusion models, the egomotion diffusion and the HTP diffusion as twins, are integrated into MMTwin to predict camera egomotion and future hand trajectories concurrently. We propose a novel hybrid Mamba-Transformer module as the denoising model of the HTP diffusion to better fuse multimodal features. The experimental results on three publicly available datasets and our self-recorded data demonstrate that our proposed MMTwin can predict plausible future 3D hand trajectories compared to the state-of-the-art baselines, and generalizes well to unseen environments. The code and pretrained models will be released at https://github.com/IRMVLab/MMTwin.</p></details> |  |

It performs optimal controls by directly harnessing input-output (I/O) data, bypassing the process of explicit model identification that can be costly and time-consuming. However, its high computational complexity, driven by a large-scale optimization problem (typically in a higher dimension than its model-based counterpart--Model Predictive Control), hinders real-time applications. To overcome this limitation, we propose the data-enabled neighboring extremal (DeeNE) framework, which significantly reduces computational cost while preserving control performance. DeeNE leverages first-order optimality perturbation analysis to efficiently update a precomputed nominal DeePC solution in response to changes in initial conditions and reference trajectories. We validate its effectiveness on a 7-DoF KINOVA Gen3 robotic arm, demonstrating substantial computational savings and robust, data-driven control performance.</p></details> |  |

Current methods in this space require specific architectural changes to image generation models, which limit their adaptability and scalability. In contrast to such methods, we provide a model-agnostic approach. We use intersections in diffusion trajectories, working only with the latent values. We could not obtain localized frame-wise coherence and diversity using only the intersection of trajectories. Thus, we instead use a grid-based approach. An in-context trained LLM is used to generate coherent frame-wise prompts; another is used to identify differences between frames. Based on these, we obtain a CLIP-based attention mask that controls the timing of switching the prompts for each grid cell. Earlier switching results in higher variance, while later switching results in more coherence. Therefore, our approach can ensure appropriate control between coherence and variance for the frames. Our approach results in state-of-the-art performance while being more flexible when working with diverse image-generation models. The empirical analysis using quantitative metrics and user studies confirms our model's superior temporal consistency, visual fidelity and user satisfaction, thus providing a novel way to obtain training-free, image-based text-to-video generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR) 2025</p></details> |

Yet, to fully realize its potential, an effective online trajectory evaluation is indispensable to ensure safety. By forecasting the future outcomes of a given trajectory, trajectory evaluation becomes much more effective. This goal can be achieved by employing a world model to capture environmental dynamics and predict future states. Therefore, we propose an end-to-end driving framework WoTE, which leverages a BEV World model to predict future BEV states for Trajectory Evaluation. The proposed BEV world model is latency-efficient compared to image-level world models and can be seamlessly supervised using off-the-shelf BEV-space traffic simulators. We validate our framework on both the NAVSIM benchmark and the closed-loop Bench2Drive benchmark based on the CARLA simulator, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

However, open-loop training on the nuPlan dataset tends to cause causal confusion during closed-loop testing, and the dataset also presents a long-tail distribution of scenarios. These issues introduce challenges for imitation learning. To tackle these problems, we introduce CAFE-AD, a Cross-Scenario Adaptive Feature Enhancement for Trajectory Planning in Autonomous Driving method, designed to enhance feature representation across various scenario types. We develop an adaptive feature pruning module that ranks feature importance to capture the most relevant information while reducing the interference of noisy information during training. Moreover, we propose a cross-scenario feature interpolation module that enhances scenario information to introduce diversity, enabling the network to alleviate over-fitting in dominant scenarios. We evaluate our method CAFE-AD on the challenging public nuPlan Test14-Hard closed-loop simulation benchmark. The results demonstrate that CAFE-AD outperforms state-of-the-art methods including rule-based and hybrid planners, and exhibits the potential in mitigating the impact of long-tail distribution within the dataset. Additionally, we further validate its effectiveness in real-world environments.

The optimization process yields an optimal control sequence that depends on the initial conditions and system parameters. However, the optimal sequence may result in undesirable behavior if the system's initial conditions and parameters are erroneous. This work presents a data-driven fuzzy controller synthesis framework that is guided by a time-optimal trajectory for multicopter tracking problems. In particular, we consider an aggressive maneuver consisting of a mid-air flip and generate a time-optimal trajectory by numerically solving the two-point boundary value problem. A fuzzy controller consisting of a stabilizing controller near hover conditions and an autoregressive moving average (ARMA) controller, trained to mimic the time-optimal aggressive trajectory, is constructed using the Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 10 figures, submitted to MECC 2025</p></details> |

The proposed approach is effective with both complete and partial observations, producing refined trajectory signals with kinematic consistency, ensuring that velocity is the integral of acceleration and position is the integral of velocity. Additionally, the method accounts for the constraint that vehicles can only move in the direction of their orientation. The method is implemented as a configurable python library that also enables trajectory estimation solely based on position data. Regularization is applied to prevent extreme state variations.

Specifically, the UAV's kinematic and camera control inputs are jointly optimized over a rolling planning horizon to achieve complete 3D coverage of the object. The proposed controller incorporates ray-tracing into the planning process to simulate the propagation of light rays, thereby determining the visible parts of the object through the UAV's camera. This integration enables the generation of precise look-ahead coverage trajectories. The coverage planning problem is formulated as a rolling finite-horizon optimal control problem and solved using mixed-integer programming techniques. Extensive real-world and synthetic experiments validate the performance of the proposed approach.</p></details> |  |

Aiming at this issue, this paper investigates a differential flatness-based trajectory optimization method for fixed-wing UAVs (DFTO-FW). The customized trajectory representation is presented through differential flat characteristics analysis and polynomial parameterization, eliminating equality constraints to avoid the heavy computational burdens of solving complex dynamics. Through the design of integral performance costs and derivation of analytical gradients, the original trajectory optimization is transcribed into a lightweight, unconstrained, gradient-analytical optimization with linear time complexity to improve efficiency further. The simulation experiments illustrate the superior efficiency of the DFTO-FW, which takes sub-second CPU time (on a personal desktop) against other competitors by orders of magnitude to generate fixed-wing UAV trajectories in randomly generated obstacle environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Updat...</summary><p>Updated version with minor language and formatting edits.

| **[Conformal Slit Mapping Based Spiral Tool Trajectory Planning for Ball-end Milling on Complex Freeform Surfaces](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06310v1)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study presents a spiral-based complete coverage strategy for ball-end milling on freeform surfaces, utilizing conformal slit mapping to generate milling trajectories that are more compact, smoother, and evenly distributed when machining 2D cavities with islands. This approach, an upgrade from traditional methods, extends the original algorithm to effectively address 3D perforated surface milling. Unlike conventional algorithms, the method embeds a continuous spiral trajectory within perforated surfaces without requiring cellular decomposition or additional boundaries. The proposed method addresses three primary challenges, including modifying conformal slit mapping for mesh surfaces, maintaining uniform scallop height between adjacent spiral trajectories, and optimizing the mapped origin point to ensure uniform scallop height distribution. To overcome these challenges, surface flattening techniques are incorporated into the original approach to accommodate mesh surfaces effectively. Tool path spacing is then optimized using a binary search strategy to regulate scallop height. A functional energy metric associated with scallop height uniformity is introduced for rapid evaluation of points mapped to the origin, with the minimum functional energy determined through perturbation techniques. The optimal placement of this point is identified using a modified gradient descent approach applied to the energy function. Validation on intricate surfaces, including low-quality and high-genus meshes, verifies the robustness of the algorithm. Surface milling experiments comparing this method with conventional techniques indicate a 15.63% improvement in scallop height uniformity while reducing machining time, average spindle impact, and spindle impact variance by up to 7.36%, 27.79%, and 55.98%, respectively.</p></details> |  |

The proposed method is measurement-based and decomposes the voltage trajectory into two key components using Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD): a residual part, which indicates delayed voltage recovery, and an oscillatory part, which captures oscillations. The residual component is critical, as it can detect activation of OELs in synchronous generators or Low Voltage Ride-Through (LVRT) relays in inverter-based resources, potentially leading to instability within the quasisteady-state time frame. Meanwhile, the oscillatory component may indicate either a stable or unstable state in the short term. To accurately assess stability, STVSI employs an entropy-based metric to measure the proximity of the system to instability, with specific indices for short-term voltage stability based on oscillations and recovery. Simulations on the Nordic power system demonstrate that STVSI effectively identifies and categorizes voltage stability issues. Moreover, STVSI not only detects voltage stability conditions but also qualitatively assesses the extent of stability, providing a nuanced measure of stability.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted for publication in IEEE PESGM 2025</p></details> |

However, while MPC excels in planning and control, it lacks the capability for environmental perception, leading to failures in complex and unstructured scenarios. To address this limitation, we introduce Vision-Language Model Predictive Control (VLMPC), a robotic manipulation planning framework that integrates the perception power of vision-language models (VLMs) with MPC. VLMPC utilizes a conditional action sampling module that takes a goal image or language instruction as input and leverages VLM to generate candidate action sequences. These candidates are fed into a video prediction model that simulates future frames based on the actions. In addition, we propose an enhanced variant, Traj-VLMPC, which replaces video prediction with motion trajectory generation to reduce computational complexity while maintaining accuracy. Traj-VLMPC estimates motion dynamics conditioned on the candidate actions, offering a more efficient alternative for long-horizon tasks and real-time applications. Both VLMPC and Traj-VLMPC select the optimal action sequence using a VLM-based hierarchical cost function that captures both pixel-level and knowledge-level consistency between the current observation and the task input. We demonstrate that both approaches outperform existing state-of-the-art methods on public benchmarks and achieve excellent performance in various real-world robotic manipulation tasks.

Despite recent advancements in place recognition using 2D cameras or 3D LiDAR, it remains to be seen how to use 4D radar for place recognition - an increasingly popular sensor for its robustness against adverse weather and lighting conditions. Compared to LiDAR point clouds, radar data are drastically sparser, noisier and in much lower resolution, which hampers their ability to effectively represent scenes, posing significant challenges for 4D radar-based place recognition.

However, uncertainties introduced by inherent driving behaviors -- such as acceleration, deceleration, and left and right maneuvers -- pose significant challenges for reliable trajectory prediction. We introduce a Maneuver-Intention-Aware Transformer (MIAT) architecture, which integrates a maneuver intention awareness mechanism with spatiotemporal interaction modeling to enhance long-horizon trajectory predictions. We systematically investigate the impact of varying awareness of maneuver intention on both short- and long-horizon trajectory predictions. Evaluated on the real-world NGSIM dataset and benchmarked against various transformer- and LSTM-based methods, our approach achieves an improvement of up to 4.7% in short-horizon predictions and a 1.6% in long-horizon predictions compared to other intention-aware benchmark methods. Moreover, by leveraging an intention awareness control mechanism, MIAT realizes an 11.1% performance boost in long-horizon predictions, with a modest drop in short-horizon performance.</p></details> |  |

Transformer-based architectures have demonstrated significant promise in capturing complex spatio-temporality dependencies. However, their reliance on normalization layers can lead to computation overhead and training instabilities. In this work, we present a two-fold approach to address these challenges. First, we integrate DynamicTanh (DyT), which is the latest method to promote transformers, into the backbone, replacing traditional layer normalization. This modification simplifies the network architecture and improves the stability of the inference. We are the first work to deploy the DyT to the trajectory prediction task. Complementing this, we employ a snapshot ensemble strategy to further boost trajectory prediction performance. Using cyclical learning rate scheduling, multiple model snapshots are captured during a single training run. These snapshots are then aggregated via simple averaging at inference time, allowing the model to benefit from diverse hypotheses without incurring substantial additional computational cost. Extensive experiments on Argoverse datasets demonstrate that our combined approach significantly improves prediction accuracy, inference speed and robustness in diverse driving scenarios. This work underscores the potential of normalization-free transformer designs augmented with lightweight ensemble techniques in advancing trajectory forecasting for autonomous vehicles.</p></details> |  |

GAMDTP encodes the high-definition map(HD map) data and the agents' historical trajectory coordinates and decodes the network's output to generate the final prediction results. Additionally, recent approaches predominantly focus on dynamically fusing historical forecast results and rely on two-stage frameworks including proposal and refinement. To further enhance the performance of the two-stage frameworks we also design a scoring mechanism to evaluate the prediction quality during the proposal and refinement processes. Experiments on the Argoverse dataset demonstrates that GAMDTP achieves state-of-the-art performance, achieving superior accuracy in dynamic trajectory prediction.</p></details> |  |

To address chance constraints imposed on the entire stochastic trajectory, we propose a framework based on the set erosion strategy, which converts the chance constraints into safety constraints on an eroded subset of the safe set along the corresponding deterministic trajectory. The depth of erosion is captured by the probabilistic bound on the distance between the stochastic trajectory and its deterministic counterpart, for which we utilize a novel and sharp probabilistic bound developed recently. By adopting this framework, a deterministic control input sequence can be obtained, whose feasibility and performance are demonstrated through theoretical analysis. Our framework is compatible with various deterministic optimal control techniques, offering great flexibility and computational efficiency in a wide range of scenarios. To the best of our knowledge, our method provides the first scalable trajectory optimization scheme for high-dimensional stochastic systems under trajectory level chance constraints. We validate the proposed method through two numerical experiments.</p></details> |  |

However, they still face challenges in hallucinations, uncertainty, and long inference latency. While existing foundation models have general knowledge of avoiding collisions, they often lack transportation-specific safety knowledge. To overcome these limitations, we introduce LetsPi, a physics-informed, dual-phase, knowledge-driven framework for safe, human-like trajectory planning. To prevent hallucinations and minimize uncertainty, this hybrid framework integrates Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning with physics-informed social force dynamics. LetsPi leverages the LLM to analyze driving scenes and historical information, providing appropriate parameters and target destinations (goals) for the social force model, which then generates the future trajectory. Moreover, the dual-phase architecture balances reasoning and computational efficiency through its Memory Collection phase and Fast Inference phase. The Memory Collection phase leverages the physics-informed LLM to process and refine planning results through reasoning, reflection, and memory modules, storing safe, high-quality driving experiences in a memory bank. Surrogate safety measures and physics-informed prompt techniques are introduced to enhance the LLM's knowledge of transportation safety and physical force, respectively. The Fast Inference phase extracts similar driving experiences as few-shot examples for new scenarios, while simplifying input-output requirements to enable rapid trajectory planning without compromising safety. Extensive experiments using the HighD dataset demonstrate that LetsPi outperforms baseline models across five safety metrics.See PDF for project Github link.</p></details> |  |
| **[A High-Speed Time-Optimal Trajectory Generation Strategy via a Two-layer Planning Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11072v2)** | 2025-04-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motion planning and trajectory generation are crucial technologies in various domains including the control of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, manipulators, and rockets. However, optimization-based real-time motion planning becomes increasingly challenging due to the problem's probable non-convexity and the inherent limitations of non-linear programming algorithms. Highly nonlinear dynamics, obstacle avoidance constraints, and non-convex inputs can exacerbate these difficulties. In order to enhance the robustness and reduce the computational burden, this paper proposes a two-layer trajectory generating algorithm for intelligent ground vehicles with convex optimization methods, aiming to provide real-time guarantees for trajectory optimization and to improve the calculate speed of motion prediction. Our approach involves breaking down the original problem into small horizon-based planning cycles with fixed final times, referred to as planning cycles. Each planning cycle is then solved within a series of restricted convex sets constructed by some customized search algorithms incrementally. We rigorously establish these advantages through mathematical analysis under moderate assumptions and comprehensive experimental validations. For linear vehicle models, comparative experiments with general sequential convex programming algorithms demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed method, particularly in terms of the computational efficiency in dynamic maps and the reduced final time.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Self-Supervised Learning Approach with Differentiable Optimization for UAV Trajectory Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04289v1)** | 2025-04-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have gained significant traction across various fields, path planning in 3D environments remains a critical challenge, particularly under size, weight, and power (SWAP) constraints. Traditional modular planning systems often introduce latency and suboptimal performance due to limited information sharing and local minima issues. End-to-end learning approaches streamline the pipeline by mapping sensory observations directly to actions but require large-scale datasets, face significant sim-to-real gaps, or lack dynamical feasibility. In this paper, we propose a self-supervised UAV trajectory planning pipeline that integrates a learning-based depth perception with differentiable trajectory optimization. A 3D cost map guides UAV behavior without expert demonstrations or human labels. Additionally, we incorporate a neural network-based time allocation strategy to improve the efficiency and optimality. The system thus combines robust learning-based perception with reliable physics-based optimization for improved generalizability and interpretability.

| **[Nonlinear second-order dynamics describe labial constriction trajectories across languages and contexts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08351v2)** | 2025-04-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate the dynamics of labial constriction trajectories during the production of /b/ and /m/ in English and Mandarin. We find that, across languages and contexts, the ratio of instantaneous displacement to instantaneous velocity generally follows an exponential decay curve from movement onset to movement offset. We formalize this empirical discovery in a differential equation and, in combination with an assumption of point attractor dynamics, derive a nonlinear second-order dynamical system describing labial constriction trajectories. The equation has only two parameters, T and r. T corresponds to the target state and r corresponds to movement rapidity. Thus, each of the parameters corresponds to a phonetically relevant dimension of control. Nonlinear regression demonstrates that the model provides excellent fits to individual movement trajectories. Moreover, trajectories simulated from the model qualitatively match empirical trajectories, and capture key kinematic variables like duration, peak velocity, and time to achieve peak velocity. The model constitutes a proposal for the dynamics of individual articulatory movements, and thus offers a novel foundation from which to understand additional influences on articulatory kinematics like prosody, inter-movement coordination, and stochastic noise.</p></details> |  |
| **[In-Trajectory Inverse Reinforcement Learning: Learn Incrementally Before An Ongoing Trajectory Terminates](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15612v6)** | 2025-04-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) aims to learn a reward function and a corresponding policy that best fit the demonstrated trajectories of an expert. However, current IRL works cannot learn incrementally from an ongoing trajectory because they have to wait to collect at least one complete trajectory to learn. To bridge the gap, this paper considers the problem of learning a reward function and a corresponding policy while observing the initial state-action pair of an ongoing trajectory and keeping updating the learned reward and policy when new state-action pairs of the ongoing trajectory are observed. We formulate this problem as an online bi-level optimization problem where the upper level dynamically adjusts the learned reward according to the newly observed state-action pairs with the help of a meta-regularization term, and the lower level learns the corresponding policy. We propose a novel algorithm to solve this problem and guarantee that the algorithm achieves sub-linear local regret $O(\sqrt{T}+\log T+\sqrt{T}\log T)$. If the reward function is linear, we prove that the proposed algorithm achieves sub-linear regret $O(\log T)$. Experiments are used to validate the proposed algorithm.</p></details> |  |
| **[Leveraging Sound Source Trajectories for Universal Sound Separation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04843v2)** | 2025-04-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing methods utilizing spatial information for sound source separation require prior knowledge of the direction of arrival (DOA) of the source or utilize estimated but imprecise localization results, which impairs the separation performance, especially when the sound sources are moving. In fact, sound source localization and separation are interconnected problems, that is, sound source localization facilitates sound separation while sound separation contributes to refined source localization. This paper proposes a method utilizing the mutual facilitation mechanism between sound source localization and separation for moving sources. The proposed method comprises three stages. The first stage is initial tracking, which tracks each sound source from the audio mixture based on the source signal envelope estimation. These tracking results may lack sufficient accuracy. The second stage involves mutual facilitation: Sound separation is conducted using preliminary sound source tracking results. Subsequently, sound source tracking is performed on the separated signals, thereby refining the tracking precision. The refined trajectories further improve separation performance. This mutual facilitation process can be iterated multiple times. In the third stage, a neural beamformer estimates precise single-channel separation results based on the refined tracking trajectories and multi-channel separation outputs. Simulation experiments conducted under reverberant conditions and with moving sound sources demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve more accurate separation based on refined tracking results.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio, Speech and Language Processing(TASLP)</p></details> |

When humans grasp an object, appropriate trajectories naturally form in our minds to use it for specific tasks. Hand-object interaction trajectory priors can greatly benefit applications in robotics, embodied AI, augmented reality and related fields. However, synthesizing realistic and appropriate hand trajectories given a single object or hand-object interaction image is a highly ambiguous task, requiring to correctly identify the object of interest and possibly even the correct interaction among many possible alternatives. To tackle this challenging problem, we propose the SIGHT-Fusion system, consisting of a curated pipeline for extracting visual features of hand-object interaction details from egocentric videos involving object manipulation, and a diffusion-based conditional motion generation model processing the extracted features. We train our method given video data with corresponding hand trajectory annotations, without supervision in the form of action labels. For the evaluation, we establish benchmarks utilizing the first-person FPHAB and HOI4D datasets, testing our method against various baselines and using multiple metrics. We also introduce task simulators for executing the generated hand trajectories and reporting task success rates as an additional metric. Experiments show that our method generates more appropriate and realistic hand trajectories than baselines and presents promising generalization capability on unseen objects. The accuracy of the generated hand trajectories is confirmed in a physics simulation setting, showcasing the authenticity of the created sequences and their applicability in downstream uses.</p></details> |  |

Deep learning approaches have become key in this area, utilizing large-scale trajectory datasets to model movement patterns, but face challenges in managing complex spatial dependencies and adapting to dynamic environments. To address these challenges, we introduce TrajLearn, a novel model for trajectory prediction that leverages generative modeling of higher-order mobility flows based on hexagonal spatial representation. TrajLearn predicts the next $k$ steps by integrating a customized beam search for exploring multiple potential paths while maintaining spatial continuity. We conducted a rigorous evaluation of TrajLearn, benchmarking it against leading state-of-the-art approaches and meaningful baselines. The results indicate that TrajLearn achieves significant performance gains, with improvements of up to ~40% across multiple real-world trajectory datasets. In addition, we evaluated different prediction horizons (i.e., various values of $k$), conducted resolution sensitivity analysis, and performed ablation studies to assess the impact of key model components. Furthermore, we developed a novel algorithm to generate mixed-resolution maps by hierarchically subdividing hexagonal regions into finer segments within a specified observation area. This approach supports selective detailing, applying finer resolution to areas of interest or high activity (e.g., urban centers) while using coarser resolution for less significant regions (e.g., rural areas), effectively reducing data storage requirements and computational overhead. We promote reproducibility and adaptability by offering complete code, data, and detailed documentation with flexible configuration options for various applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ACM Transactions on Spatial Algorithms and Systems</p></details> |
| **[Target Prediction Under Deceptive Switching Strategies via Outlier-Robust Filtering of Partially Observed Incomplete Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03502v1)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motivated by a study on deception and counter-deception, this paper addresses the problem of identifying an agent's target as it seeks to reach one of two targets in a given environment. In practice, an agent may initially follow a strategy to aim at one target but decide to switch to another midway. Such a strategy can be deceptive when the counterpart only has access to imperfect observations, which include heavily corrupted sensor noise and possible outliers, making it difficult to visually identify the agent's true intent. To counter deception and identify the true target, we utilize prior knowledge of the agent's dynamics and the imprecisely observed partial trajectory of the agent's states to dynamically update the estimation of the posterior probability of whether a deceptive switch has taken place. However, existing methods in the literature have not achieved effective deception identification within a reasonable computation time. We propose a set of outlier-robust change detection methods to track relevant change-related statistics efficiently, enabling the detection of deceptive strategies in hidden nonlinear dynamics with reasonable computational effort. The performance of the proposed framework is examined for Weapon-Target Assignment (WTA) detection under deceptive strategies using random simulations in the kinematics model with external forcing.</p></details> |  |

In this method, each control input between two consecutive events is a polynomial and its coefficients are chosen to minimize the error in approximating a continuous-time control signal. We design an event-triggering rule that guarantees uniform ultimate boundedness of the tracking error and non-Zeno behavior of inter-event times. We illustrate our results through a suite of numerical simulations and experiments, which indicate that the number of events generated by the proposed controller is significantly less compared to that by a time-triggered controller or a event-triggered controller based on zero-order hold while guaranteeing similar tracking performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Data-Driven Hamiltonian for Direct Construction of Safe Set from Trajectory Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03233v1)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In continuous-time optimal control, evaluating the Hamiltonian requires solving a constrained optimization problem using the system's dynamics model. Hamilton-Jacobi reachability analysis for safety verification has demonstrated practical utility only when efficient evaluation of the Hamiltonian over a large state-time grid is possible. In this study, we introduce the concept of a data-driven Hamiltonian (DDH), which circumvents the need for an explicit dynamics model by relying only on mild prior knowledge (e.g., Lipschitz constants), thus enabling the construction of reachable sets directly from trajectory data. Recognizing that the Hamiltonian is the optimal inner product between a given costate and realizable state velocities, the DDH estimates the Hamiltonian using the worst-case realization of the velocity field based on the observed state trajectory data. This formulation ensures a conservative approximation of the true Hamiltonian for uncertain dynamics. The reachable set computed based on the DDH is also ensured to be a conservative approximation of the true reachable set. Next, we propose a data-efficient safe experiment framework for gradual expansion of safe sets using the DDH. This is achieved by iteratively conducting experiments within the computed data-driven safe set and updating the set using newly collected trajectory data. To demonstrate the capabilities of our approach, we showcase its effectiveness in safe flight envelope expansion for a tiltrotor vehicle transitioning from near-hover to forward flight.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is the extended version of the article submitted to IEEE CDC 2025.

| **[Learning Lie Group Generators from Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03220v1)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work investigates the inverse problem of generator recovery in matrix Lie groups from discretized trajectories. Let $G$ be a real matrix Lie group and $\mathfrak{g} = \text{Lie}(G)$ its corresponding Lie algebra. A smooth trajectory $\gamma($t$)$ generated by a fixed Lie algebra element $\xi \in \mathfrak{g}$ follows the exponential flow $\gamma($t$) = g_0 \cdot \exp(t \xi)$. The central task addressed in this work is the reconstruction of such a latent generator $\xi$ from a discretized sequence of poses $ \{g_0, g_1, \dots, g_T\} \subset G$, sampled at uniform time intervals. This problem is formulated as a data-driven regression from normalized sequences of discrete Lie algebra increments $\log\left(g_{t}^{-1} g_{t+1}\right)$ to the constant generator $\xi \in \mathfrak{g}$. A feedforward neural network is trained to learn this mapping across several groups, including $\text{SE(2)}, \text{SE(3)}, \text{SO(3)}, and \text{SL(2,$\mathbb{R})$}$. It demonstrates strong empirical accuracy under both clean and noisy conditions, which validates the viability of data-driven recovery of Lie group generators using shallow neural architectures.

Such environments contain rich features like crosswalks, grass, and curbs, which are easily interpretable by humans, but not by mobile robots. We aim to compute suitable trajectories that (1) satisfy the environment-specific traversability constraints and (2) generate human-like paths while navigating on crosswalks, sidewalks, etc. Our formulation uses a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) generative model enhanced with traversability constraints to generate multiple candidate trajectories for global navigation. We develop a visual prompting approach and leverage the Visual Language Model's (VLM) zero-shot ability of semantic understanding and logical reasoning to choose the best trajectory given the contextual information about the task. We evaluate our method in various outdoor scenes with wheeled robots and compare the performance with other global navigation algorithms. In practice, we observe an average improvement of 20.81% in satisfying traversability constraints and 28.51% in terms of human-like navigation in four different outdoor navigation scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quattro: Transformer-Accelerated Iterative Linear Quadratic Regulator Framework for Fast Trajectory Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01806v2)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-time optimal control remains a fundamental challenge in robotics, especially for nonlinear systems with stringent performance requirements. As one of the representative trajectory optimization algorithms, the iterative Linear Quadratic Regulator (iLQR) faces limitations due to their inherently sequential computational nature, which restricts the efficiency and applicability of real-time control for robotic systems. While existing parallel implementations aim to overcome the above limitations, they typically demand additional computational iterations and high-performance hardware, leading to only modest practical improvements. In this paper, we introduce Quattro, a transformer-accelerated iLQR framework employing an algorithm-hardware co-design strategy to predict intermediate feedback and feedforward matrices. It facilitates effective parallel computations on resource-constrained devices without sacrificing accuracy. Experiments on cart-pole and quadrotor systems show an algorithm-level acceleration of up to 5.3$\times$ and 27$\times$ per iteration, respectively. When integrated into a Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework, Quattro achieves overall speedups of 2.8$\times$ for the cart-pole and 17.8$\times$ for the quadrotor compared to the one that applies traditional iLQR. Transformer inference is deployed on FPGA to maximize performance, achieving further up to 20.8$\times$ speedup over prevalent embedded CPUs with over 11$\times$ power reduction than GPU and low hardware resource overhead.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods often struggle to accurately capture this intricate structure from Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) data, particularly due to the lack of ground truth labels and the ambiguous, intertwined nature of fiber trajectories. We present a novel deep learning framework for unsupervised clustering of myocardial fibers, providing a data-driven approach to identifying distinct fiber bundles. We uniquely combine a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory network to capture local sequential information along fibers, with a Transformer autoencoder to learn global shape features, with pointwise incorporation of essential anatomical context. Clustering these representations using a density-based algorithm identifies 33 to 62 robust clusters, successfully capturing the subtle distinctions in fiber trajectories with varying levels of granularity. Our framework offers a new, flexible, and quantitative way to analyze myocardial structure, achieving a level of delineation that, to our knowledge, has not been previously achieved, with potential applications in improving surgical planning, characterizing disease-related remodeling, and ultimately, advancing personalized cardiac care.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 figures.

| **[Virtual Target Trajectory Prediction for Stochastic Targets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01851v1)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction of other vehicles is crucial for autonomous vehicles, with applications from missile guidance to UAV collision avoidance. Typically, target trajectories are assumed deterministic, but real-world aerial vehicles exhibit stochastic behavior, such as evasive maneuvers or gliders circling in thermals. This paper uses Conditional Normalizing Flows, an unsupervised Machine Learning technique, to learn and predict the stochastic behavior of targets of guided missiles using trajectory data. The trained model predicts the distribution of future target positions based on initial conditions and parameters of the dynamics. Samples from this distribution are clustered using a time series k-means algorithm to generate representative trajectories, termed virtual targets. The method is fast and target-agnostic, requiring only training data in the form of target trajectories. Thus, it serves as a drop-in replacement for deterministic trajectory predictions in guidance laws and path planning. Simulated scenarios demonstrate the approach's effectiveness for aerial vehicles with random maneuvers, bridging the gap between deterministic predictions and stochastic reality, advancing guidance and control algorithms for autonomous vehicles.</p></details> | <details><summary>will ...</summary><p>will be submitted to Journal of Guidance, Control, and Dynamics</p></details> |
| **[Semi-Self Representation Learning for Crowdsourced WiFi Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03756v1)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>WiFi fingerprint-based localization has been studied intensively. Point-based solutions rely on position annotations of WiFi fingerprints. Trajectory-based solutions, however, require end-position annotations of WiFi trajectories, where a WiFi trajectory is a multivariate time series of signal features. A trajectory dataset is much larger than a pointwise dataset as the number of potential trajectories in a field may grow exponentially with respect to the size of the field. This work presents a semi-self representation learning solution, where a large dataset $C$ of crowdsourced unlabeled WiFi trajectories can be automatically labeled by a much smaller dataset $\tilde C$ of labeled WiFi trajectories. The size of $\tilde C$ only needs to be proportional to the size of the physical field, while the unlabeled $C$ could be much larger. This is made possible through a novel ``cut-and-flip'' augmentation scheme based on the meet-in-the-middle paradigm. A two-stage learning consisting of trajectory embedding followed by endpoint embedding is proposed for the unlabeled $C$. Then the learned representations are labeled by $\tilde C$ and connected to a neural-based localization network. The result, while delivering promising accuracy, significantly relieves the burden of human annotations for trajectory-based localization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by VTC2025-Spring</p></details> |
| **[ACTIVE: Continuous Similarity Search for Vessel Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01142v1)** | 2025-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Publicly available vessel trajectory data is emitted continuously from the global AIS system. Continuous trajectory similarity search on this data has applications in, e.g., maritime navigation and safety. Existing proposals typically assume an offline setting and focus on finding similarities between complete trajectories. Such proposals are less effective when applied to online scenarios, where similarity comparisons must be performed continuously as new trajectory data arrives and trajectories evolve. We therefore propose a real-time continuous trajectory similarity search method for vessels (ACTIVE). We introduce a novel similarity measure, object-trajectory real-time distance, that emphasizes the anticipated future movement trends of vessels, enabling more predictive and forward-looking comparisons. Next, we propose a segment-based vessel trajectory index structure that organizes historical trajectories into smaller and manageable segments, facilitating accelerated similarity computations. Leveraging this index, we propose an efficient continuous similar trajectory search (CSTS) algorithm together with a variety of search space pruning strategies that reduce unnecessary computations during the continuous similarity search, thereby further improving efficiency. Extensive experiments on two large real-world AIS datasets offer evidence that ACTIVE is capable of outperforming state-of-the-art methods considerably. ACTIVE significantly reduces index construction costs and index size while achieving a 70% reduction in terms of query time and a 60% increase in terms of hit rate.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we aim to learn the trajectory prediction model by using broad out-of-domain data to improve its performance and generalization ability. Trajectory model is designed to predict any-point trajectories in the current frame given an instruction and can provide detailed control guidance for robotic policy learning. To handle the diverse out-of-domain data distribution, we propose a sparsely-gated MoE (\textbf{Top-1} gating strategy) architecture for trajectory model, coined as \textbf{Tra-MoE}. The sparse activation design enables good balance between parameter cooperation and specialization, effectively benefiting from large-scale out-of-domain data while maintaining constant FLOPs per token. In addition, we further introduce an adaptive policy conditioning technique by learning 2D mask representations for predicted trajectories, which is explicitly aligned with image observations to guide action prediction more flexibly. We perform extensive experiments on both simulation and real-world scenarios to verify the effectiveness of Tra-MoE and adaptive policy conditioning technique. We also conduct a comprehensive empirical study to train Tra-MoE, demonstrating that our Tra-MoE consistently exhibits superior performance compared to the dense baseline model, even when the latter is scaled to match Tra-MoE's parameter count.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2025.

| **[Timely Trajectory Reconstruction in Finite Buffer Remote Tracking Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00849v1)** | 2025-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Remote tracking systems play a critical role in applications such as IoT, monitoring, surveillance and healthcare. In such systems, maintaining both real-time state awareness (for online decision making) and accurate reconstruction of historical trajectories (for offline post-processing) are essential. While the Age of Information (AoI) metric has been extensively studied as a measure of freshness, it does not capture the accuracy with which past trajectories can be reconstructed. In this work, we investigate reconstruction error as a complementary metric to AoI, addressing the trade-off between timely updates and historical accuracy. Specifically, we consider three policies, each prioritizing different aspects of information management: Keep-Old, Keep-Fresh, and our proposed Inter-arrival-Aware dropping policy. We compare these policies in terms of impact on both AoI and reconstruction error in a remote tracking system with a finite buffer. Through theoretical analysis and numerical simulations of queueing behavior, we demonstrate that while the Keep-Fresh policy minimizes AoI, it does not necessarily minimize reconstruction error. In contrast, our proposed Inter-arrival-Aware dropping policy dynamically adjusts packet retention decisions based on generation times, achieving a balance between AoI and reconstruction error. Our results provide key insights into the design of efficient update policies for resource-constrained IoT networks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fine-Grained Behavior and Lane Constraints Guided Trajectory Prediction Method](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21477v2)** | 2025-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction, as a critical component of autonomous driving systems, has attracted the attention of many researchers. Existing prediction algorithms focus on extracting more detailed scene features or selecting more reasonable trajectory destinations. However, in the face of dynamic and evolving future movements of the target vehicle, these algorithms cannot provide a fine-grained and continuous description of future behaviors and lane constraints, which degrades the prediction accuracy. To address this challenge, we present BLNet, a novel dualstream architecture that synergistically integrates behavioral intention recognition and lane constraint modeling through parallel attention mechanisms. The framework generates fine-grained behavior state queries (capturing spatial-temporal movement patterns) and lane queries (encoding lane topology constraints), supervised by two auxiliary losses, respectively. Subsequently, a two-stage decoder first produces trajectory proposals, then performs point-level refinement by jointly incorporating both the continuity of passed lanes and future motion features. Extensive experiments on two large datasets, nuScenes and Argoverse, show that our network exhibits significant performance gains over existing direct regression and goal-based algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

The proposed system employs multiple UAVs equipped with dual-functional radar-communication capabilities to simultaneously perform target sensing and provide communication services to users. We formulate a joint optimization problem that aims to maximize the sum rate of users while maintaining target sensing performance through coordinated beamforming and UAV trajectory design. To address this challenging non-convex problem, we develop a block coordinated descent (BCD)-based iterative algorithm that decomposes the original problem into tractable subproblems. Then, the beamforming design problem is addressed using fractional programming, while the UAV trajectory is refined through the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed joint optimization approach achieves significant performance improvements in both communication throughput and sensing accuracy compared to conventional, separated designs. We also show that proper coordination of multiple UAVs through optimized trajectories and beamforming patterns can effectively balance the tradeoff between sensing and communication objectives.</p></details> | 5 pages, 1 figure |

To this end, an accurate prediction of dynamic obstacle trajectories is vital. Traditional approaches to trajectory prediction face limitations in generalizability and often fail to account for the intentions of other vessels. While recent research has considered incorporating the intentions of dynamic obstacles, these efforts are typically based on the own-ship's interpretation of the situation. The current state-of-the-art in this area is a Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN) model, which infers target vessel intentions by considering multiple underlying causes and allowing for different interpretations of the situation by different vessels. However, since its inception, there have not been any significant structural improvements to this model. In this paper, we propose enhancing the DBN model by incorporating considerations for grounding hazards and vessel waypoint information. The proposed model is validated using real vessel encounters extracted from historical Automatic Identification System (AIS) data.</p></details> |  |

Although mmWaves can offer a notably high data rate, their high penetration and propagation losses mean that line of sight (LoS) is necessary for effective communication. Due to the presence of obstacles and user mobility, UAV trajectory planning plays a crucial role in improving system performance. In this work, we propose a novel computational geometry-based trajectory planning scheme by considering the user mobility, the priority of the delay sensitive ultra-reliable low-latency communications (URLLC) and the high throughput requirements of the enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB) traffic. Specifically, we use geometric tools like Apollonius circle and minimum enclosing ball of balls to find the optimal position of the UAV that supports uninterrupted connections to the URLLC users and maximizes the aggregate throughput of the eMBB users. Finally, the numerical results demonstrate the benefits of the suggested approach over an existing state of the art benchmark scheme in terms of sum throughput obtained by URLLC and eMBB users.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to a reputed conference</p></details> |

| **[Aligning Diffusion Model with Problem Constraints for Trajectory Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00342v1)** | 2025-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have recently emerged as effective generative frameworks for trajectory optimization, capable of producing high-quality and diverse solutions. However, training these models in a purely data-driven manner without explicit incorporation of constraint information often leads to violations of critical constraints, such as goal-reaching, collision avoidance, and adherence to system dynamics. To address this limitation, we propose a novel approach that aligns diffusion models explicitly with problem-specific constraints, drawing insights from the Dynamic Data-driven Application Systems (DDDAS) framework. Our approach introduces a hybrid loss function that explicitly measures and penalizes constraint violations during training. Furthermore, by statistically analyzing how constraint violations evolve throughout the diffusion steps, we develop a re-weighting strategy that aligns predicted violations to ground truth statistics at each diffusion step. Evaluated on a tabletop manipulation and a two-car reach-avoid problem, our constraint-aligned diffusion model significantly reduces constraint violations compared to traditional diffusion models, while maintaining the quality of trajectory solutions. This approach is well-suited for integration into the DDDAS framework for efficient online trajectory adaptation as new environmental data becomes available.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Velocity and Acceleration: Self-Supervised Motion Consistency for Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24272v1)** | 2025-03-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding human motion is crucial for accurate pedestrian trajectory prediction. Conventional methods typically rely on supervised learning, where ground-truth labels are directly optimized against predicted trajectories. This amplifies the limitations caused by long-tailed data distributions, making it difficult for the model to capture abnormal behaviors. In this work, we propose a self-supervised pedestrian trajectory prediction framework that explicitly models position, velocity, and acceleration. We leverage velocity and acceleration information to enhance position prediction through feature injection and a self-supervised motion consistency mechanism. Our model hierarchically injects velocity features into the position stream. Acceleration features are injected into the velocity stream. This enables the model to predict position, velocity, and acceleration jointly. From the predicted position, we compute corresponding pseudo velocity and acceleration, allowing the model to learn from data-generated pseudo labels and thus achieve self-supervised learning. We further design a motion consistency evaluation strategy grounded in physical principles; it selects the most reasonable predicted motion trend by comparing it with historical dynamics and uses this trend to guide and constrain trajectory generation. We conduct experiments on the ETH-UCY and Stanford Drone datasets, demonstrating that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamic High-Order Control Barrier Functions with Diffuser for Safety-Critical Trajectory Planning at Signal-Free Intersections](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00162v2)** | 2025-03-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Planning safe and efficient trajectories through signal-free intersections presents significant challenges for autonomous vehicles (AVs), particularly in dynamic, multi-task environments with unpredictable interactions and an increased possibility of conflicts. This study aims to address these challenges by developing a unified, robust, adaptive framework to ensure safety and efficiency across three distinct intersection movements: left-turn, right-turn, and straight-ahead. Existing methods often struggle to reliably ensure safety and effectively learn multi-task behaviors from demonstrations in such environments. This study proposes a safety-critical planning method that integrates Dynamic High-Order Control Barrier Functions (DHOCBF) with a diffusion-based model, called Dynamic Safety-Critical Diffuser (DSC-Diffuser). The DSC-Diffuser leverages task-guided planning to enhance efficiency, allowing the simultaneous learning of multiple driving tasks from real-world expert demonstrations. Moreover, the incorporation of goal-oriented constraints significantly reduces displacement errors, ensuring precise trajectory execution. To further ensure driving safety in dynamic environments, the proposed DHOCBF framework dynamically adjusts to account for the movements of surrounding vehicles, offering enhanced adaptability and reduce the conservatism compared to traditional control barrier functions. Validity evaluations of DHOCBF, conducted through numerical simulations, demonstrate its robustness in adapting to variations in obstacle velocities, sizes, uncertainties, and locations, effectively maintaining driving safety across a wide range of complex and uncertain scenarios. Comprehensive performance evaluations demonstrate that DSC-Diffuser generates realistic, stable, and generalizable policies, providing flexibility and reliable safety assurance in complex multi-task driving scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 fi...</summary><p>11 figures, 5 tables, 15 pages</p></details> |
| **[Trajectory Planning for Automated Driving using Target Funnels](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23795v1)** | 2025-03-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-driving vehicles rely on sensory input to monitor their surroundings and continuously adapt to the most likely future road course. Predictive trajectory planning is based on snapshots of the (uncertain) road course as a key input. Under noisy perception data, estimates of the road course can vary significantly, leading to indecisive and erratic steering behavior. To overcome this issue, this paper introduces a predictive trajectory planning algorithm with a novel objective function: instead of targeting a single reference trajectory based on the most likely road course, tracking a series of target reference sets, called a target funnel, is considered. The proposed planning algorithm integrates probabilistic information about the road course, and thus implicitly considers regular updates to road perception. Our solution is assessed in a case study using real driving data collected from a prototype vehicle. The results demonstrate that the algorithm maintains tracking accuracy and substantially reduces undesirable steering commands in the presence of noisy road perception, achieving a 56% reduction in input costs compared to a certainty equivalent formulation.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted to European Control Conference 2025 (ECC25)</p></details> |
| **[Language-Guided Trajectory Traversal in Disentangled Stable Diffusion Latent Space for Factorized Medical Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23623v1)** | 2025-03-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-image diffusion models have demonstrated a remarkable ability to generate photorealistic images from natural language prompts. These high-resolution, language-guided synthesized images are essential for the explainability of disease or exploring causal relationships. However, their potential for disentangling and controlling latent factors of variation in specialized domains like medical imaging remains under-explored. In this work, we present the first investigation of the power of pre-trained vision-language foundation models, once fine-tuned on medical image datasets, to perform latent disentanglement for factorized medical image generation and interpolation. Through extensive experiments on chest X-ray and skin datasets, we illustrate that fine-tuned, language-guided Stable Diffusion inherently learns to factorize key attributes for image generation, such as the patient's anatomical structures or disease diagnostic features. We devise a framework to identify, isolate, and manipulate key attributes through latent space trajectory traversal of generative models, facilitating precise control over medical image synthesis.</p></details> | 10 pages |

However, existing datasets fall short in capturing the diversity and dynamics of VRU behaviors, making it difficult to meet the research demands of complex traffic environments. To address this gap, this study developed the OnSiteVRU datasets, which cover a variety of scenarios, including intersections, road segments, and urban villages. These datasets provide trajectory data for motor vehicles, electric bicycles, and human-powered bicycles, totaling approximately 17,429 trajectories with a precision of 0.04 seconds. The datasets integrate both aerial-view natural driving data and onboard real-time dynamic detection data, along with environmental information such as traffic signals, obstacles, and real-time maps, enabling a comprehensive reconstruction of interaction events. The results demonstrate that VRU\_Data outperforms traditional datasets in terms of VRU density and scene coverage, offering a more comprehensive representation of VRU behavioral characteristics. This provides critical support for traffic flow modeling, trajectory prediction, and autonomous driving virtual testing.

VT migration is an effective way that migrates the VT when the locations of physical entities keep changing to maintain seamless immersive VT services. However, an efficient VT migration is challenging due to the rapid movement of vehicles, dynamic workloads of Roadside Units (RSUs), and heterogeneous resources of the RSUs. To achieve efficient migration decisions and a minimum latency for the VT migration, we propose a multi-agent split Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) framework combined with spatio-temporal trajectory generation. In this framework, multiple split DRL agents utilize split architecture to efficiently determine VT migration decisions. Furthermore, we propose a spatio-temporal trajectory generation algorithm based on trajectory datasets and road network data to simulate vehicle trajectories, enhancing the generalization of the proposed scheme for managing VT migration in dynamic network environments. Finally, experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme not only enhances the Quality of Experience (QoE) by 29% but also reduces the computational parameter count by approximately 25% while maintaining similar performances, enhancing users' immersive experiences in vehicular metaverses.</p></details> |  |

However, existing approaches have largely focused on inter-visit event predictions, overlooking the importance of intra-visit nowcasting, which provides prompt clinical insights during an ongoing patient visit. To address this gap, we introduce the task of laboratory measurement prediction within a hospital visit. We study the laboratory data that, however, remained underexplored in previous work. We propose TRACE, a Transformer-based model designed for clinical event nowcasting by encoding patient trajectories. TRACE effectively handles long sequences and captures temporal dependencies through a novel timestamp embedding that integrates decay properties and periodic patterns of data. Additionally, we introduce a smoothed mask for denoising, improving the robustness of the model. Experiments on two large-scale electronic health record datasets demonstrate that the proposed model significantly outperforms previous methods, highlighting its potential for improving patient care through more accurate laboratory measurement nowcasting.

Existing methods also generally predict agents' states without offering any state-wise measure of uncertainty. Moreover, popular multi-modal sampling methods lack any error probability estimates for each generated scene under the same prior observations, making it difficult to rank the predictions during inference time. We introduce U2Diff, a \textbf{unified} diffusion model designed to handle trajectory completion while providing state-wise \textbf{uncertainty} estimates jointly. This uncertainty estimation is achieved by augmenting the simple denoising loss with the negative log-likelihood of the predicted noise and propagating latent space uncertainty to the real state space. Additionally, we incorporate a Rank Neural Network in post-processing to enable \textbf{error probability} estimation for each generated mode, demonstrating a strong correlation with the error relative to ground truth. Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art solutions in trajectory completion and forecasting across four challenging sports datasets (NBA, Basketball-U, Football-U, Soccer-U), highlighting the effectiveness of uncertainty and error probability estimation.

| **[Simplification of Trajectory Streams](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23025v1)** | 2025-03-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While there are software systems that simplify trajectory streams on the fly, few curve simplification algorithms with quality guarantees fit the streaming requirements. We present streaming algorithms for two such problems under the Fr\'{e}chet distance $d_F$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$ for some constant $d \geq 2$. Consider a polygonal curve $\tau$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$ in a stream. We present a streaming algorithm that, for any $\varepsilon\in (0,1)$ and $\delta > 0$, produces a curve $\sigma$ such that $d_F(\sigma,\tau[v_1,v_i])\le (1+\varepsilon)\delta$ and $|\sigma|\le 2\,\mathrm{opt}-2$, where $\tau[v_1,v_i]$ is the prefix in the stream so far, and $\mathrm{opt} = \min\{|\sigma'|: d_F(\sigma',\tau[v_1,v_i])\le \delta\}$. Let $\alpha = 2(d-1){\lfloor d/2 \rfloor}^2 + d$. The working storage is $O(\varepsilon^{-\alpha})$. Each vertex is processed in $O(\varepsilon^{-\alpha}\log\frac{1}{\varepsilon})$ time for $d \in \{2,3\}$ and $O(\varepsilon^{-\alpha})$ time for $d \geq 4$ . Thus, the whole $\tau$ can be simplified in $O(\varepsilon^{-\alpha}|\tau|\log\frac{1}{\varepsilon})$ time. Ignoring polynomial factors in $1/\varepsilon$, this running time is a factor $|\tau|$ faster than the best static algorithm that offers the same guarantees. We present another streaming algorithm that, for any integer $k \geq 2$ and any $\varepsilon \in (0,\frac{1}{17})$, maintains a curve $\sigma$ such that $|\sigma| \leq 2k-2$ and $d_F(\sigma,\tau[v_1,v_i])\le (1+\varepsilon) \cdot \min\{d_F(\sigma',\tau[v_1,v_i]): |\sigma'| \leq k\}$, where $\tau[v_1,v_i]$ is the prefix in the stream so far. The working storage is $O((k\varepsilon^{-1}+\varepsilon^{-(\alpha+1)})\log \frac{1}{\varepsilon})$. Each vertex is processed in $O(k\varepsilon^{-(\alpha+1)}\log^2\frac{1}{\varepsilon})$ time for $d \in \{2,3\}$ and $O(k\varepsilon^{-(\alpha+1)}\log\frac{1}{\varepsilon})$ time for $d \geq 4$.</p></details> | SoCG 2025 |

Machine learning algorithms constitute the state-of-the-art in many fields but require vast data sets, which are costly and time-intensive to collect. Automated strategies for observation and exploration are crucial to enhance the efficiency of data gathering. Therefore, a novel strategy utilizing the Next-Best-Trajectory principle is developed for a robot manipulator operating in dynamic environments. Local trajectories are generated to maximize the information gained from observations along the path while avoiding collisions. We employ a voxel map for environment modeling and utilize raycasting from perspectives around a point of interest to estimate the information gain. A global ergodic trajectory planner provides an optional reference trajectory to the local planner, improving exploration and helping to avoid local minima. To enhance computational efficiency, raycasting for estimating the information gain in the environment is executed in parallel on the graphics processing unit. Benchmark results confirm the efficiency of the parallelization, while real-world experiments demonstrate the strategy's effectiveness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at the IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA), 2025</p></details> |

However, traditional IL methods are limited by their reliance on high-quality, often scarce, expert data, and suffer from covariate shift. To address these challenges, recent advances in offline IL have incorporated suboptimal, unlabeled datasets into the training. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to enhance policy learning from mixed-quality offline datasets by leveraging task-relevant trajectory fragments and rich environmental dynamics. Specifically, we introduce a state-based search framework that stitches state-action pairs from imperfect demonstrations, generating more diverse and informative training trajectories. Experimental results on standard IL benchmarks and real-world robotic tasks showcase that our proposed method significantly improves both generalization and performance.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we present a reinforcement-learning framework for multi-setpoint and multi-trajectory tracking. Tracking multiple setpoints and time-varying trajectories in reinforcement learning is challenging due to the complexity of balancing multiple objectives, a difficulty further exacerbated by system uncertainties such as uncertain initial conditions and stochastic dynamics. This challenge is relevant, e.g., in bioprocesses involving microbial consortia, where precise control over population compositions is required. We introduce a novel return function based on multiplicative reciprocal saturation functions, which explicitly couples reward gains to the simultaneous satisfaction of multiple references. Through a case study involving light-mediated cybergenetic growth control in microbial consortia, we demonstrate via computational experiments that our approach achieves faster convergence, improved stability, and superior control compliance compared to conventional quadratic-cost-based return functions. Moreover, our method enables tuning of the saturation function's parameters, shaping the learning process and policy updates. By incorporating system uncertainties, our framework also demonstrates robustness, a key requirement in industrial bioprocessing. Overall, this work advances reinforcement-learning-based control strategies in bioprocess engineering, with implications in the broader field of process and systems engineering.</p></details> |  |
| **[Follow Your Motion: A Generic Temporal Consistency Portrait Editing Framework with Trajectory Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22225v1)** | 2025-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pre-trained conditional diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable potential in image editing. However, they often face challenges with temporal consistency, particularly in the talking head domain, where continuous changes in facial expressions intensify the level of difficulty. These issues stem from the independent editing of individual images and the inherent loss of temporal continuity during the editing process. In this paper, we introduce Follow Your Motion (FYM), a generic framework for maintaining temporal consistency in portrait editing. Specifically, given portrait images rendered by a pre-trained 3D Gaussian Splatting model, we first develop a diffusion model that intuitively and inherently learns motion trajectory changes at different scales and pixel coordinates, from the first frame to each subsequent frame. This approach ensures that temporally inconsistent edited avatars inherit the motion information from the rendered avatars. Secondly, to maintain fine-grained expression temporal consistency in talking head editing, we propose a dynamic re-weighted attention mechanism. This mechanism assigns higher weight coefficients to landmark points in space and dynamically updates these weights based on landmark loss, achieving more consistent and refined facial expressions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches in terms of temporal consistency and can be used to optimize and compensate for temporally inconsistent outputs in a range of applications, such as text-driven editing, relighting, and various other applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://anonymous-hub1127.github.io/FYM.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[Multi-modal Knowledge Distillation-based Human Trajectory Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22201v1)** | 2025-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pedestrian trajectory forecasting is crucial in various applications such as autonomous driving and mobile robot navigation. In such applications, camera-based perception enables the extraction of additional modalities (human pose, text) to enhance prediction accuracy. Indeed, we find that textual descriptions play a crucial role in integrating additional modalities into a unified understanding. However, online extraction of text requires the use of VLM, which may not be feasible for resource-constrained systems. To address this challenge, we propose a multi-modal knowledge distillation framework: a student model with limited modality is distilled from a teacher model trained with full range of modalities. The comprehensive knowledge of a teacher model trained with trajectory, human pose, and text is distilled into a student model using only trajectory or human pose as a sole supplement. In doing so, we separately distill the core locomotion insights from intra-agent multi-modality and inter-agent interaction. Our generalizable framework is validated with two state-of-the-art models across three datasets on both ego-view (JRDB, SIT) and BEV-view (ETH/UCY) setups, utilizing both annotated and VLM-generated text captions. Distilled student models show consistent improvement in all prediction metrics for both full and instantaneous observations, improving up to ~13%.

Still, existing methods that perform dragging in the 2D space usually face ambiguity when handling out-of-plane movements. In this work, we augment the interaction with a new dimension, i.e., the depth dimension, such that users are allowed to assign a relative depth for each point on the trajectory. That way, our new interaction paradigm not only inherits the convenience from 2D dragging, but facilitates trajectory control in the 3D space, broadening the scope of creativity. We propose a pioneering method for 3D trajectory control in image-to-video synthesis by abstracting object masks into a few cluster points. These points, accompanied by the depth information and the instance information, are finally fed into a video diffusion model as the control signal. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach, dubbed LeviTor, in precisely manipulating the object movements when producing photo-realistic videos from static images.

To this end, we train a video generation model conditioned on spatio-temporally sparse or dense motion trajectories. In contrast to prior motion conditioning work, this flexible representation can encode any number of trajectories, object-specific or global scene motion, and temporally sparse motion; due to its flexibility we refer to this conditioning as motion prompts. While users may directly specify sparse trajectories, we also show how to translate high-level user requests into detailed, semi-dense motion prompts, a process we term motion prompt expansion. We demonstrate the versatility of our approach through various applications, including camera and object motion control, "interacting" with an image, motion transfer, and image editing. Our results showcase emergent behaviors, such as realistic physics, suggesting the potential of motion prompts for probing video models and interacting with future generative world models. Finally, we evaluate quantitatively, conduct a human study, and demonstrate strong performance.

The trajectory planning problem is formulated as an Optimal Control Problem (OCP), which aims to maximize the uncertainty reduction within a specified mission duration. However, this results in an intractable OCP whose objective functional cannot be expressed in closed form. To address this, we propose a Model Predictive Control (MPC) algorithm based on a relaxed formulation of the objective function to approximate the optimal solutions. This relaxation promotes efficient map exploration by penalizing overlaps in the UAV's visibility regions along the trajectory. The algorithm can produce efficient and smooth trajectories, and it can be efficiently implemented using standard Nonlinear Programming solvers, being suitable for real-time planning. Unlike traditional methods, which often rely on discretizing the mission space and using complex mixed-integer formulations, our approach is computationally efficient and easier to implement. The MPC algorithm is initially assessed in MATLAB, followed by Gazebo simulations and actual experimental tests conducted in an outdoor environment. The results demonstrate that the proposed strategy can generate efficient and smooth trajectories for search and coverage missions.</p></details> |  |

The convex cover consists of a set of polytopes such that the union of the polytopes represents obstacle-free space, allowing us to find trajectories for robots that lie within the convex cover. In order to find the SFC that facilitates trajectory optimization, we iteratively find overlapping polytopes of maximum volumes that include specified waypoints initialized by a geometric or kinematic planner. Constraints at waypoints appear in two alternating stages of a joint optimization problem, which is solved by a novel heuristic-based iterative algorithm with partially distributed variables. We validate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm using a range of parameterized environments and show its applications for two-stage motion planning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Consistency Trajectory Matching for One-Step Generative Super-Resolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20349v2)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current diffusion-based super-resolution (SR) approaches achieve commendable performance at the cost of high inference overhead. Therefore, distillation techniques are utilized to accelerate the multi-step teacher model into one-step student model. Nevertheless, these methods significantly raise training costs and constrain the performance of the student model by the teacher model. To overcome these tough challenges, we propose Consistency Trajectory Matching for Super-Resolution (CTMSR), a distillation-free strategy that is able to generate photo-realistic SR results in one step. Concretely, we first formulate a Probability Flow Ordinary Differential Equation (PF-ODE) trajectory to establish a deterministic mapping from low-resolution (LR) images with noise to high-resolution (HR) images. Then we apply the Consistency Training (CT) strategy to directly learn the mapping in one step, eliminating the necessity of pre-trained diffusion model. To further enhance the performance and better leverage the ground-truth during the training process, we aim to align the distribution of SR results more closely with that of the natural images. To this end, we propose to minimize the discrepancy between their respective PF-ODE trajectories from the LR image distribution by our meticulously designed Distribution Trajectory Matching (DTM) loss, resulting in improved realism of our recovered HR images. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed methods can attain comparable or even superior capabilities on both synthetic and real datasets while maintaining minimal inference latency.</p></details> |  |

However, the performance of FL is often hindered by the unreliable communication links between resource-constrained Internet of Things (IoT) devices and the central server. To overcome this challenge, we propose a novel framework that employs an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) as a mobile server to enhance the FL training process. By capitalizing on the UAV's mobility, we establish strong line-of-sight connections with IoT devices, thereby enhancing communication reliability and capacity. To maximize training efficiency, we formulate a latency minimization problem that jointly optimizes bandwidth allocation, computing frequencies, transmit power for both the UAV and IoT devices, and the UAV's flight trajectory. Subsequently, we analyze the required rounds of the IoT devices training and the UAV aggregation for FL convergence. Based on the convergence constraint, we transform the problem into three subproblems and develop an efficient alternating optimization algorithm to solve this problem effectively. Additionally, we provide a thorough analysis of the algorithm's convergence and computational complexity. Extensive numerical results demonstrate that our proposed scheme not only surpasses existing benchmark schemes in reducing latency up to 15.29%, but also achieves training efficiency that nearly matches the ideal scenario.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This manuscript has been submitted to IEEE</p></details> |

However, existing prediction methods are challenged by the irregular sampling time intervals of the vessel tracking data from the global AIS system and the complexity of vessel movement. These aspects render model learning and generalization difficult. To address these challenges and improve vessel trajectory prediction, we propose the multi-modal knowledge-enhanced framework (MAKER) for vessel trajectory prediction. To contend better with the irregular sampling time intervals, MAKER features a Large language model-guided Knowledge Transfer (LKT) module that leverages pre-trained language models to transfer trajectory-specific contextual knowledge effectively. To enhance the ability to learn complex trajectory patterns, MAKER incorporates a Knowledge-based Self-paced Learning (KSL) module. This module employs kinematic knowledge to progressively integrate complex patterns during training, allowing for adaptive learning and enhanced generalization. Experimental results on two vessel trajectory datasets show that MAKER can improve the prediction accuracy of state-of-the-art methods by 12.08%-17.86%.</p></details> | 8 pages, 5 figures |

Model Predictive Control (MPC), particularly sampling-based approaches such as the Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) method, has recently demonstrated considerable success by leveraging parallel computing to efficiently evaluate numerous trajectories. However, MPPI often struggles to balance safe navigation in constrained environments with effective exploration in open spaces, leading to infeasibility in cluttered conditions. To address these limitations, we propose DBaS-Log-MPPI, a novel algorithm that integrates Discrete Barrier States (DBaS) to ensure safety while enabling adaptive exploration with enhanced feasibility. Our method is efficiently validated through three simulation missions and one real-world experiment, involving a 2D quadrotor and a ground vehicle navigating through cluttered obstacles. We demonstrate that our algorithm surpasses both Vanilla MPPI and Log-MPPI, achieving higher success rates, lower tracking errors, and a conservative average speed.</p></details> | IROS 2025 |

Existing methods are designed for specific ball types and struggle to generalize. This challenge arises from three key factors. First, learning-based models require large datasets but suffer from accuracy drops in unseen scenarios. Second, physics-based models rely on complex formulas and detailed inputs, yet accurately obtaining ball states, such as spin, is often impractical. Third, integrating physical principles with neural networks to achieve high accuracy, fast inference, and strong generalization remains difficult. To address these issues, we propose an innovative approach that incorporates physics-based equations and neural networks. We first derive three generalized physical formulas. Then, using a neural network and observed trajectory points, we infer certain parameters while fitting the remaining ones. These formulas enable precise trajectory prediction with minimal training data: only a few dozen samples. Extensive experiments demonstrate our method superiority in generalization, real-time performance, and accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This submission was made without my advisor's consent, and I mistakenly uploaded an incorrect version of the paper.

Latencies cause misalignments in both spatial and semantic features, complicating the fusion of real-time observations from the ego vehicle with delayed data from others. To address these issues, we propose TraF-Align, a novel framework that learns the flow path of features by predicting the feature-level trajectory of objects from past observations up to the ego vehicle's current time. By generating temporally ordered sampling points along these paths, TraF-Align directs attention from the current-time query to relevant historical features along each trajectory, supporting the reconstruction of current-time features and promoting semantic interaction across multiple frames. This approach corrects spatial misalignment and ensures semantic consistency across agents, effectively compensating for motion and achieving coherent feature fusion. Experiments on two real-world datasets, V2V4Real and DAIR-V2X-Seq, show that TraF-Align sets a new benchmark for asynchronous cooperative perception.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2025</p></details> |

By posing the finite-horizon optimal control problem and recursive re-evaluation of the optimal trajectories, minimization of the L2 norms of the state and control errors are transcribed into a quadratic program. Control and state variable constraints are parameterized using Chebyshev polynomials and are accommodated in the optimal trajectory generation programs to incorporate the actuator limits and keep-out constraints. Differentiable collision detection of polytopes is leveraged for optimal collision avoidance. Results obtained from the collocation methods are benchmarked against the existing approaches on an edge computer to outline the performance improvements.

| **[Trajectory Balance with Asynchrony: Decoupling Exploration and Learning for Fast, Scalable LLM Post-Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18929v1)** | 2025-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) is a critical component of large language model (LLM) post-training. However, existing on-policy algorithms used for post-training are inherently incompatible with the use of experience replay buffers, which can be populated scalably by distributed off-policy actors to enhance exploration as compute increases. We propose efficiently obtaining this benefit of replay buffers via Trajectory Balance with Asynchrony (TBA), a massively scalable LLM RL system. In contrast to existing approaches, TBA uses a larger fraction of compute on search, constantly generating off-policy data for a central replay buffer. A training node simultaneously samples data from this buffer based on reward or recency to update the policy using Trajectory Balance (TB), a diversity-seeking RL objective introduced for GFlowNets. TBA offers three key advantages: (1) decoupled training and search, speeding up training wall-clock time by 4x or more; (2) improved diversity through large-scale off-policy sampling; and (3) scalable search for sparse reward settings. On mathematical reasoning, preference-tuning, and automated red-teaming (diverse and representative post-training tasks), TBA produces speed and performance improvements over strong baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[CarPlanner: Consistent Auto-regressive Trajectory Planning for Large-scale Reinforcement Learning in Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19908v3)** | 2025-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory planning is vital for autonomous driving, ensuring safe and efficient navigation in complex environments. While recent learning-based methods, particularly reinforcement learning (RL), have shown promise in specific scenarios, RL planners struggle with training inefficiencies and managing large-scale, real-world driving scenarios. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{CarPlanner}, a \textbf{C}onsistent \textbf{a}uto-\textbf{r}egressive \textbf{Planner} that uses RL to generate multi-modal trajectories. The auto-regressive structure enables efficient large-scale RL training, while the incorporation of consistency ensures stable policy learning by maintaining coherent temporal consistency across time steps. Moreover, CarPlanner employs a generation-selection framework with an expert-guided reward function and an invariant-view module, simplifying RL training and enhancing policy performance. Extensive analysis demonstrates that our proposed RL framework effectively addresses the challenges of training efficiency and performance enhancement, positioning CarPlanner as a promising solution for trajectory planning in autonomous driving. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to demonstrate that the RL-based planner can surpass both IL- and rule-based state-of-the-arts (SOTAs) on the challenging large-scale real-world dataset nuPlan. Our proposed CarPlanner surpasses RL-, IL-, and rule-based SOTA approaches within this demanding dataset.</p></details> | CVPR 2025 |
| **[DiffMove: Group Mobility Tendency Enhanced Trajectory Recovery via Diffusion Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18302v1)** | 2025-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the real world, trajectory data is often sparse and incomplete due to low collection frequencies or limited device coverage. Trajectory recovery aims to recover these missing trajectory points, making the trajectories denser and more complete. However, this task faces two key challenges: 1) The excessive sparsity of individual trajectories makes it difficult to effectively leverage historical information for recovery; 2) Sparse trajectories make it harder to capture complex individual mobility preferences. To address these challenges, we propose a novel method called DiffMove. Firstly, we harness crowd wisdom for trajectory recovery. Specifically, we construct a group tendency graph using the collective trajectories of all users and then integrate the group mobility trends into the location representations via graph embedding. This solves the challenge of sparse trajectories being unable to rely on individual historical trajectories for recovery. Secondly, we capture individual mobility preferences from both historical and current perspectives. Finally, we integrate group mobility tendencies and individual preferences into the spatiotemporal distribution of the trajectory to recover high-quality trajectories. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate that DiffMove outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods. Further analysis validates the robustness of our method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory Imputation in Multi-Agent Sports with Derivative-Accumulating Self-Ensemble](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10878v3)** | 2025-03-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-agent trajectory data collected from domains such as team sports often suffer from missing values due to various factors. While many imputation methods have been proposed for spatiotemporal data, they are not well-suited for multi-agent sports scenarios where player movements are highly dynamic and inter-agent interactions continuously evolve. To address these challenges, we propose MIDAS (Multi-agent Imputer with Derivative-Accumulating Self-ensemble), a framework that imputes multi-agent trajectories with high accuracy and physical plausibility. It jointly predicts positions, velocities, and accelerations through a Set Transformer-based neural network and generates alternative estimates by recursively accumulating predicted velocity and acceleration values. These predictions are then combined using a learnable weighted ensemble to produce final imputed trajectories. Experiments on three sports datasets demonstrate that MIDAS significantly outperforms existing baselines in both positional accuracy and physical plausibility. Lastly, we showcase use cases of MIDAS, such as approximating total distance and pass success probability, to highlight its applicability to practical downstream tasks that require complete tracking data.</p></details> |  |
| **[EF-3DGS: Event-Aided Free-Trajectory 3D Gaussian Splatting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15392v3)** | 2025-03-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scene reconstruction from casually captured videos has wide applications in real-world scenarios. With recent advancements in differentiable rendering techniques, several methods have attempted to simultaneously optimize scene representations (NeRF or 3DGS) and camera poses. Despite recent progress, existing methods relying on traditional camera input tend to fail in high-speed (or equivalently low-frame-rate) scenarios. Event cameras, inspired by biological vision, record pixel-wise intensity changes asynchronously with high temporal resolution, providing valuable scene and motion information in blind inter-frame intervals. In this paper, we introduce the event camera to aid scene construction from a casually captured video for the first time, and propose Event-Aided Free-Trajectory 3DGS, called EF-3DGS, which seamlessly integrates the advantages of event cameras into 3DGS through three key components. First, we leverage the Event Generation Model (EGM) to fuse events and frames, supervising the rendered views observed by the event stream. Second, we adopt the Contrast Maximization (CMax) framework in a piece-wise manner to extract motion information by maximizing the contrast of the Image of Warped Events (IWE), thereby calibrating the estimated poses. Besides, based on the Linear Event Generation Model (LEGM), the brightness information encoded in the IWE is also utilized to constrain the 3DGS in the gradient domain. Third, to mitigate the absence of color information of events, we introduce photometric bundle adjustment (PBA) to ensure view consistency across events and frames. We evaluate our method on the public Tanks and Temples benchmark and a newly collected real-world dataset, RealEv-DAVIS.

Using data from seven cohorts belonging to the Lifetime Risk Pooling Project (LRPP), we present a Bayesian hierarchical multivariate approach that jointly models multiple longitudinal risk factors over time and across cohorts. Because few cohorts in our project cover the entire adult lifespan, our strategy uses information from all risk factors to increase precision for each risk factor trajectory and borrows information across cohorts to fill in unobserved risk factors. We develop novel diagnostic testing and model validation methods to ensure that our model robustly captures and maintains critical relationships over time and across risk factors.</p></details> |  |

In cinematography, Directors of Photography meticulously craft camera movements to achieve expressive and intentional framing. However, existing methods for camera trajectory generation remain limited: Traditional approaches rely on geometric optimization or handcrafted procedural systems, while recent learning-based methods often inherit structural biases or lack textual alignment, constraining creative synthesis. In this work, we introduce an auto-regressive model inspired by the expertise of Directors of Photography to generate artistic and expressive camera trajectories. We first introduce DataDoP, a large-scale multi-modal dataset containing 29K real-world shots with free-moving camera trajectories, depth maps, and detailed captions in specific movements, interaction with the scene, and directorial intent. Thanks to the comprehensive and diverse database, we further train an auto-regressive, decoder-only Transformer for high-quality, context-aware camera movement generation based on text guidance and RGBD inputs, named GenDoP. Extensive experiments demonstrate that compared to existing methods, GenDoP offers better controllability, finer-grained trajectory adjustments, and higher motion stability. We believe our approach establishes a new standard for learning-based cinematography, paving the way for future advancements in camera control and filmmaking.

Traditional approaches often rely on static snapshots of network states, which can obscure the underlying dynamics of opinion evolution. In this study, we introduce a dynamic framework that quantifies the unpredictability of opinion trajectories using the normalized Lempel-Ziv (nLZ) complexity. Our approach leverages an adaptive social network model where each node is characterized by three behavioral parameters - homophily, neophily, and social conformity - and where opinions evolve continuously according to a system of ordinary differential equations. The results reveal distinct nLZ complexity signatures for each node type: homophilic nodes exhibit consistently rising complexity, reflecting increasingly unpredictable opinion shifts that are counterintuitive given their tendency for similarity; neophilic nodes maintain low and stable complexity, suggesting that openness to novelty can, surprisingly, lead to stable opinion dynamics; and conformic nodes display a U-shaped complexity trend, transitioning from early opinion stagnation to later unpredictability. In fully heterogeneous networks, modest interaction effects emerge, with slight shifts in the unpredictability of each faction's trajectories. These findings underscore the importance of temporal analysis in uncovering hidden dynamical patterns, offering novel insights into the mechanisms underlying social adaptation and polarization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory Optimization Under Stochastic Dynamics Leveraging Maximum Mean Discrepancy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19045v2)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper addresses sampling-based trajectory optimization for risk-aware navigation under stochastic dynamics. Typically such approaches operate by computing $\tilde{N}$ perturbed rollouts around the nominal dynamics to estimate the collision risk associated with a sequence of control commands. We consider a setting where it is expensive to estimate risk using perturbed rollouts, for example, due to expensive collision-checks. We put forward two key contributions. First, we develop an algorithm that distills the statistical information from a larger set of rollouts to a reduced-set with sample size $N<<\tilde{N}$. Consequently, we estimate collision risk using just $N$ rollouts instead of $\tilde{N}$. Second, we formulate a novel surrogate for the collision risk that can leverage the distilled statistical information contained in the reduced-set. We formalize both algorithmic contributions using distribution embedding in Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) and Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD). We perform extensive benchmarking to demonstrate that our MMD-based approach leads to safer trajectories at low sample regime than existing baselines using Conditional Value-at Risk (CVaR) based collision risk estimate.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://github.com/Basant1861/MPC-MMD</p></details> |
| **[Efficient Swept Volume-Based Trajectory Generation for Arbitrary-Shaped Ground Robot Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07554v1)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Navigating an arbitrary-shaped ground robot safely in cluttered environments remains a challenging problem. The existing trajectory planners that account for the robot's physical geometry severely suffer from the intractable runtime. To achieve both computational efficiency and Continuous Collision Avoidance (CCA) of arbitrary-shaped ground robot planning, we proposed a novel coarse-to-fine navigation framework that significantly accelerates planning. In the first stage, a sampling-based method selectively generates distinct topological paths that guarantee a minimum inflated margin. In the second stage, a geometry-aware front-end strategy is designed to discretize these topologies into full-state robot motion sequences while concurrently partitioning the paths into SE(2) sub-problems and simpler R2 sub-problems for back-end optimization. In the final stage, an SVSDF-based optimizer generates trajectories tailored to these sub-problems and seamlessly splices them into a continuous final motion plan. Extensive benchmark comparisons show that the proposed method is one to several orders of magnitude faster than the cutting-edge methods in runtime while maintaining a high planning success rate and ensuring CCA.</p></details> |  |
| **[Novel Diffusion Models for Multimodal 3D Hand Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07375v1)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting hand motion is critical for understanding human intentions and bridging the action space between human movements and robot manipulations. Existing hand trajectory prediction (HTP) methods forecast the future hand waypoints in 3D space conditioned on past egocentric observations. However, such models are only designed to accommodate 2D egocentric video inputs. There is a lack of awareness of multimodal environmental information from both 2D and 3D observations, hindering the further improvement of 3D HTP performance. In addition, these models overlook the synergy between hand movements and headset camera egomotion, either predicting hand trajectories in isolation or encoding egomotion only from past frames. To address these limitations, we propose novel diffusion models (MMTwin) for multimodal 3D hand trajectory prediction. MMTwin is designed to absorb multimodal information as input encompassing 2D RGB images, 3D point clouds, past hand waypoints, and text prompt. Besides, two latent diffusion models, the egomotion diffusion and the HTP diffusion as twins, are integrated into MMTwin to predict camera egomotion and future hand trajectories concurrently. We propose a novel hybrid Mamba-Transformer module as the denoising model of the HTP diffusion to better fuse multimodal features. The experimental results on three publicly available datasets and our self-recorded data demonstrate that our proposed MMTwin can predict plausible future 3D hand trajectories compared to the state-of-the-art baselines, and generalizes well to unseen environments. The code and pretrained models will be released at https://github.com/IRMVLab/MMTwin.</p></details> |  |

It performs optimal controls by directly harnessing input-output (I/O) data, bypassing the process of explicit model identification that can be costly and time-consuming. However, its high computational complexity, driven by a large-scale optimization problem (typically in a higher dimension than its model-based counterpart--Model Predictive Control), hinders real-time applications. To overcome this limitation, we propose the data-enabled neighboring extremal (DeeNE) framework, which significantly reduces computational cost while preserving control performance. DeeNE leverages first-order optimality perturbation analysis to efficiently update a precomputed nominal DeePC solution in response to changes in initial conditions and reference trajectories. We validate its effectiveness on a 7-DoF KINOVA Gen3 robotic arm, demonstrating substantial computational savings and robust, data-driven control performance.</p></details> |  |

Current methods in this space require specific architectural changes to image generation models, which limit their adaptability and scalability. In contrast to such methods, we provide a model-agnostic approach. We use intersections in diffusion trajectories, working only with the latent values. We could not obtain localized frame-wise coherence and diversity using only the intersection of trajectories. Thus, we instead use a grid-based approach. An in-context trained LLM is used to generate coherent frame-wise prompts; another is used to identify differences between frames. Based on these, we obtain a CLIP-based attention mask that controls the timing of switching the prompts for each grid cell. Earlier switching results in higher variance, while later switching results in more coherence. Therefore, our approach can ensure appropriate control between coherence and variance for the frames. Our approach results in state-of-the-art performance while being more flexible when working with diverse image-generation models. The empirical analysis using quantitative metrics and user studies confirms our model's superior temporal consistency, visual fidelity and user satisfaction, thus providing a novel way to obtain training-free, image-based text-to-video generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR) 2025</p></details> |

Yet, to fully realize its potential, an effective online trajectory evaluation is indispensable to ensure safety. By forecasting the future outcomes of a given trajectory, trajectory evaluation becomes much more effective. This goal can be achieved by employing a world model to capture environmental dynamics and predict future states. Therefore, we propose an end-to-end driving framework WoTE, which leverages a BEV World model to predict future BEV states for Trajectory Evaluation. The proposed BEV world model is latency-efficient compared to image-level world models and can be seamlessly supervised using off-the-shelf BEV-space traffic simulators. We validate our framework on both the NAVSIM benchmark and the closed-loop Bench2Drive benchmark based on the CARLA simulator, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

However, open-loop training on the nuPlan dataset tends to cause causal confusion during closed-loop testing, and the dataset also presents a long-tail distribution of scenarios. These issues introduce challenges for imitation learning. To tackle these problems, we introduce CAFE-AD, a Cross-Scenario Adaptive Feature Enhancement for Trajectory Planning in Autonomous Driving method, designed to enhance feature representation across various scenario types. We develop an adaptive feature pruning module that ranks feature importance to capture the most relevant information while reducing the interference of noisy information during training. Moreover, we propose a cross-scenario feature interpolation module that enhances scenario information to introduce diversity, enabling the network to alleviate over-fitting in dominant scenarios. We evaluate our method CAFE-AD on the challenging public nuPlan Test14-Hard closed-loop simulation benchmark. The results demonstrate that CAFE-AD outperforms state-of-the-art methods including rule-based and hybrid planners, and exhibits the potential in mitigating the impact of long-tail distribution within the dataset. Additionally, we further validate its effectiveness in real-world environments.

However, the optimal sequence may result in undesirable behavior if the system's initial conditions and parameters are erroneous. This work presents a data-driven fuzzy controller synthesis framework that is guided by a time-optimal trajectory for multicopter tracking problems. In particular, we consider an aggressive maneuver consisting of a mid-air flip and generate a time-optimal trajectory by numerically solving the two-point boundary value problem.

Specifically, the UAV's kinematic and camera control inputs are jointly optimized over a rolling planning horizon to achieve complete 3D coverage of the object. The proposed controller incorporates ray-tracing into the planning process to simulate the propagation of light rays, thereby determining the visible parts of the object through the UAV's camera. This integration enables the generation of precise look-ahead coverage trajectories. The coverage planning problem is formulated as a rolling finite-horizon optimal control problem and solved using mixed-integer programming techniques. Extensive real-world and synthetic experiments validate the performance of the proposed approach.</p></details> |  |

| **[Conformal Slit Mapping Based Spiral Tool Trajectory Planning for Ball-end Milling on Complex Freeform Surfaces](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06310v1)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study presents a spiral-based complete coverage strategy for ball-end milling on freeform surfaces, utilizing conformal slit mapping to generate milling trajectories that are more compact, smoother, and evenly distributed when machining 2D cavities with islands. This approach, an upgrade from traditional methods, extends the original algorithm to effectively address 3D perforated surface milling. Unlike conventional algorithms, the method embeds a continuous spiral trajectory within perforated surfaces without requiring cellular decomposition or additional boundaries. The proposed method addresses three primary challenges, including modifying conformal slit mapping for mesh surfaces, maintaining uniform scallop height between adjacent spiral trajectories, and optimizing the mapped origin point to ensure uniform scallop height distribution. To overcome these challenges, surface flattening techniques are incorporated into the original approach to accommodate mesh surfaces effectively. Tool path spacing is then optimized using a binary search strategy to regulate scallop height. A functional energy metric associated with scallop height uniformity is introduced for rapid evaluation of points mapped to the origin, with the minimum functional energy determined through perturbation techniques. The optimal placement of this point is identified using a modified gradient descent approach applied to the energy function. Validation on intricate surfaces, including low-quality and high-genus meshes, verifies the robustness of the algorithm. Surface milling experiments comparing this method with conventional techniques indicate a 15.63% improvement in scallop height uniformity while reducing machining time, average spindle impact, and spindle impact variance by up to 7.36%, 27.79%, and 55.98%, respectively.</p></details> |  |

The proposed method is measurement-based and decomposes the voltage trajectory into two key components using Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD): a residual part, which indicates delayed voltage recovery, and an oscillatory part, which captures oscillations. The residual component is critical, as it can detect activation of OELs in synchronous generators or Low Voltage Ride-Through (LVRT) relays in inverter-based resources, potentially leading to instability within the quasisteady-state time frame. Meanwhile, the oscillatory component may indicate either a stable or unstable state in the short term. To accurately assess stability, STVSI employs an entropy-based metric to measure the proximity of the system to instability, with specific indices for short-term voltage stability based on oscillations and recovery. Simulations on the Nordic power system demonstrate that STVSI effectively identifies and categorizes voltage stability issues. Moreover, STVSI not only detects voltage stability conditions but also qualitatively assesses the extent of stability, providing a nuanced measure of stability.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted for publication in IEEE PESGM 2025</p></details> |

However, while MPC excels in planning and control, it lacks the capability for environmental perception, leading to failures in complex and unstructured scenarios. To address this limitation, we introduce Vision-Language Model Predictive Control (VLMPC), a robotic manipulation planning framework that integrates the perception power of vision-language models (VLMs) with MPC. VLMPC utilizes a conditional action sampling module that takes a goal image or language instruction as input and leverages VLM to generate candidate action sequences. These candidates are fed into a video prediction model that simulates future frames based on the actions. In addition, we propose an enhanced variant, Traj-VLMPC, which replaces video prediction with motion trajectory generation to reduce computational complexity while maintaining accuracy. Traj-VLMPC estimates motion dynamics conditioned on the candidate actions, offering a more efficient alternative for long-horizon tasks and real-time applications. Both VLMPC and Traj-VLMPC select the optimal action sequence using a VLM-based hierarchical cost function that captures both pixel-level and knowledge-level consistency between the current observation and the task input.

Despite recent advancements in place recognition using 2D cameras or 3D LiDAR, it remains to be seen how to use 4D radar for place recognition - an increasingly popular sensor for its robustness against adverse weather and lighting conditions. Compared to LiDAR point clouds, radar data are drastically sparser, noisier and in much lower resolution, which hampers their ability to effectively represent scenes, posing significant challenges for 4D radar-based place recognition. This work addresses these challenges by leveraging multi-modal information from sequential 4D radar scans and effectively extracting and aggregating spatio-temporal features.Our approach follows a principled pipeline that comprises (1) dynamic points removal and ego-velocity estimation from velocity property, (2) bird's eye view (BEV) feature encoding on the refined point cloud, (3) feature alignment using BEV feature map motion trajectory calculated by ego-velocity, (4) multi-scale spatio-temporal features of the aligned BEV feature maps are extracted and aggregated.Real-world experimental results validate the feasibility of the proposed method and demonstrate its robustness in handling dynamic environments.

However, uncertainties introduced by inherent driving behaviors -- such as acceleration, deceleration, and left and right maneuvers -- pose significant challenges for reliable trajectory prediction. We introduce a Maneuver-Intention-Aware Transformer (MIAT) architecture, which integrates a maneuver intention awareness mechanism with spatiotemporal interaction modeling to enhance long-horizon trajectory predictions. We systematically investigate the impact of varying awareness of maneuver intention on both short- and long-horizon trajectory predictions. Evaluated on the real-world NGSIM dataset and benchmarked against various transformer- and LSTM-based methods, our approach achieves an improvement of up to 4.7% in short-horizon predictions and a 1.6% in long-horizon predictions compared to other intention-aware benchmark methods. Moreover, by leveraging an intention awareness control mechanism, MIAT realizes an 11.1% performance boost in long-horizon predictions, with a modest drop in short-horizon performance.</p></details> |  |

STO maintains the maneuver strategy of the high-level global planner while allowing curvature discontinuities at switching points to improve maneuver efficiency. To ensure safety, a convex corridor is constructed via GJK-accelerated ellipse shrinking and expansion, serving as safety constraints in each iteration. Numerical simulations in perpendicular and reverse-angled parking scenarios demonstrate that STO enhances maneuver efficiency while ensuring safety. Moreover, computational performance confirms its practicality for real-world applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures, submitted to IROS 2025</p></details> |
| **[DyTTP: Trajectory Prediction with Normalization-Free Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05356v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate trajectory prediction is a cornerstone for the safe operation of autonomous driving systems, where understanding the dynamic behavior of surrounding agents is crucial. Transformer-based architectures have demonstrated significant promise in capturing complex spatio-temporality dependencies. However, their reliance on normalization layers can lead to computation overhead and training instabilities. In this work, we present a two-fold approach to address these challenges. First, we integrate DynamicTanh (DyT), which is the latest method to promote transformers, into the backbone, replacing traditional layer normalization. This modification simplifies the network architecture and improves the stability of the inference. We are the first work to deploy the DyT to the trajectory prediction task. Complementing this, we employ a snapshot ensemble strategy to further boost trajectory prediction performance. Using cyclical learning rate scheduling, multiple model snapshots are captured during a single training run. These snapshots are then aggregated via simple averaging at inference time, allowing the model to benefit from diverse hypotheses without incurring substantial additional computational cost. Extensive experiments on Argoverse datasets demonstrate that our combined approach significantly improves prediction accuracy, inference speed and robustness in diverse driving scenarios. This work underscores the potential of normalization-free transformer designs augmented with lightweight ensemble techniques in advancing trajectory forecasting for autonomous vehicles.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we introduce GAMDTP, a novel graph attention-based network tailored for dynamic trajectory prediction. Specifically, we fuse the result of self attention and mamba-ssm through a gate mechanism, leveraging the strengths of both to extract features more efficiently and accurately, in each graph convolution layer. GAMDTP encodes the high-definition map(HD map) data and the agents' historical trajectory coordinates and decodes the network's output to generate the final prediction results. Additionally, recent approaches predominantly focus on dynamically fusing historical forecast results and rely on two-stage frameworks including proposal and refinement. To further enhance the performance of the two-stage frameworks we also design a scoring mechanism to evaluate the prediction quality during the proposal and refinement processes. Experiments on the Argoverse dataset demonstrates that GAMDTP achieves state-of-the-art performance, achieving superior accuracy in dynamic trajectory prediction.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory Optimization of Stochastic Systems under Chance Constraints via Set Erosion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04705v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the trajectory optimization problem under chance constraints for continuous-time stochastic systems. To address chance constraints imposed on the entire stochastic trajectory, we propose a framework based on the set erosion strategy, which converts the chance constraints into safety constraints on an eroded subset of the safe set along the corresponding deterministic trajectory. The depth of erosion is captured by the probabilistic bound on the distance between the stochastic trajectory and its deterministic counterpart, for which we utilize a novel and sharp probabilistic bound developed recently. By adopting this framework, a deterministic control input sequence can be obtained, whose feasibility and performance are demonstrated through theoretical analysis. Our framework is compatible with various deterministic optimal control techniques, offering great flexibility and computational efficiency in a wide range of scenarios. To the best of our knowledge, our method provides the first scalable trajectory optimization scheme for high-dimensional stochastic systems under trajectory level chance constraints. We validate the proposed method through two numerical experiments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Planning Safety Trajectories with Dual-Phase, Physics-Informed, and Transportation Knowledge-Driven Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04562v1)** | 2025-04-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models have demonstrated strong reasoning and generalization capabilities in driving-related tasks, including scene understanding, planning, and control. However, they still face challenges in hallucinations, uncertainty, and long inference latency. While existing foundation models have general knowledge of avoiding collisions, they often lack transportation-specific safety knowledge. To overcome these limitations, we introduce LetsPi, a physics-informed, dual-phase, knowledge-driven framework for safe, human-like trajectory planning. To prevent hallucinations and minimize uncertainty, this hybrid framework integrates Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning with physics-informed social force dynamics. LetsPi leverages the LLM to analyze driving scenes and historical information, providing appropriate parameters and target destinations (goals) for the social force model, which then generates the future trajectory. Moreover, the dual-phase architecture balances reasoning and computational efficiency through its Memory Collection phase and Fast Inference phase. The Memory Collection phase leverages the physics-informed LLM to process and refine planning results through reasoning, reflection, and memory modules, storing safe, high-quality driving experiences in a memory bank. Surrogate safety measures and physics-informed prompt techniques are introduced to enhance the LLM's knowledge of transportation safety and physical force, respectively. The Fast Inference phase extracts similar driving experiences as few-shot examples for new scenarios, while simplifying input-output requirements to enable rapid trajectory planning without compromising safety. Extensive experiments using the HighD dataset demonstrate that LetsPi outperforms baseline models across five safety metrics.See PDF for project Github link.</p></details> |  |
| **[A High-Speed Time-Optimal Trajectory Generation Strategy via a Two-layer Planning Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11072v2)** | 2025-04-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motion planning and trajectory generation are crucial technologies in various domains including the control of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, manipulators, and rockets. However, optimization-based real-time motion planning becomes increasingly challenging due to the problem's probable non-convexity and the inherent limitations of non-linear programming algorithms. Highly nonlinear dynamics, obstacle avoidance constraints, and non-convex inputs can exacerbate these difficulties. In order to enhance the robustness and reduce the computational burden, this paper proposes a two-layer trajectory generating algorithm for intelligent ground vehicles with convex optimization methods, aiming to provide real-time guarantees for trajectory optimization and to improve the calculate speed of motion prediction. Our approach involves breaking down the original problem into small horizon-based planning cycles with fixed final times, referred to as planning cycles. Each planning cycle is then solved within a series of restricted convex sets constructed by some customized search algorithms incrementally. We rigorously establish these advantages through mathematical analysis under moderate assumptions and comprehensive experimental validations. For linear vehicle models, comparative experiments with general sequential convex programming algorithms demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed method, particularly in terms of the computational efficiency in dynamic maps and the reduced final time.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Self-Supervised Learning Approach with Differentiable Optimization for UAV Trajectory Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04289v1)** | 2025-04-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have gained significant traction across various fields, path planning in 3D environments remains a critical challenge, particularly under size, weight, and power (SWAP) constraints. Traditional modular planning systems often introduce latency and suboptimal performance due to limited information sharing and local minima issues. End-to-end learning approaches streamline the pipeline by mapping sensory observations directly to actions but require large-scale datasets, face significant sim-to-real gaps, or lack dynamical feasibility. In this paper, we propose a self-supervised UAV trajectory planning pipeline that integrates a learning-based depth perception with differentiable trajectory optimization. A 3D cost map guides UAV behavior without expert demonstrations or human labels. Additionally, we incorporate a neural network-based time allocation strategy to improve the efficiency and optimality. The system thus combines robust learning-based perception with reliable physics-based optimization for improved generalizability and interpretability. Both simulation and real-world experiments validate our approach across various environments, demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness. Our method achieves a 31.33% improvement in position tracking error and 49.37% reduction in control effort compared to the state-of-the-art.</p></details> |  |
| **[Nonlinear second-order dynamics describe labial constriction trajectories across languages and contexts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08351v2)** | 2025-04-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate the dynamics of labial constriction trajectories during the production of /b/ and /m/ in English and Mandarin. We find that, across languages and contexts, the ratio of instantaneous displacement to instantaneous velocity generally follows an exponential decay curve from movement onset to movement offset. We formalize this empirical discovery in a differential equation and, in combination with an assumption of point attractor dynamics, derive a nonlinear second-order dynamical system describing labial constriction trajectories. The equation has only two parameters, T and r. T corresponds to the target state and r corresponds to movement rapidity. Thus, each of the parameters corresponds to a phonetically relevant dimension of control. Nonlinear regression demonstrates that the model provides excellent fits to individual movement trajectories. Moreover, trajectories simulated from the model qualitatively match empirical trajectories, and capture key kinematic variables like duration, peak velocity, and time to achieve peak velocity. The model constitutes a proposal for the dynamics of individual articulatory movements, and thus offers a novel foundation from which to understand additional influences on articulatory kinematics like prosody, inter-movement coordination, and stochastic noise.</p></details> |  |
| **[In-Trajectory Inverse Reinforcement Learning: Learn Incrementally Before An Ongoing Trajectory Terminates](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15612v6)** | 2025-04-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) aims to learn a reward function and a corresponding policy that best fit the demonstrated trajectories of an expert. However, current IRL works cannot learn incrementally from an ongoing trajectory because they have to wait to collect at least one complete trajectory to learn. To bridge the gap, this paper considers the problem of learning a reward function and a corresponding policy while observing the initial state-action pair of an ongoing trajectory and keeping updating the learned reward and policy when new state-action pairs of the ongoing trajectory are observed. We formulate this problem as an online bi-level optimization problem where the upper level dynamically adjusts the learned reward according to the newly observed state-action pairs with the help of a meta-regularization term, and the lower level learns the corresponding policy. We propose a novel algorithm to solve this problem and guarantee that the algorithm achieves sub-linear local regret $O(\sqrt{T}+\log T+\sqrt{T}\log T)$. If the reward function is linear, we prove that the proposed algorithm achieves sub-linear regret $O(\log T)$. Experiments are used to validate the proposed algorithm.</p></details> |  |
| **[Leveraging Sound Source Trajectories for Universal Sound Separation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04843v2)** | 2025-04-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing methods utilizing spatial information for sound source separation require prior knowledge of the direction of arrival (DOA) of the source or utilize estimated but imprecise localization results, which impairs the separation performance, especially when the sound sources are moving. In fact, sound source localization and separation are interconnected problems, that is, sound source localization facilitates sound separation while sound separation contributes to refined source localization. This paper proposes a method utilizing the mutual facilitation mechanism between sound source localization and separation for moving sources. The proposed method comprises three stages. The first stage is initial tracking, which tracks each sound source from the audio mixture based on the source signal envelope estimation. These tracking results may lack sufficient accuracy. The second stage involves mutual facilitation: Sound separation is conducted using preliminary sound source tracking results. Subsequently, sound source tracking is performed on the separated signals, thereby refining the tracking precision. The refined trajectories further improve separation performance. This mutual facilitation process can be iterated multiple times. In the third stage, a neural beamformer estimates precise single-channel separation results based on the refined tracking trajectories and multi-channel separation outputs. Simulation experiments conducted under reverberant conditions and with moving sound sources demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve more accurate separation based on refined tracking results.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio, Speech and Language Processing(TASLP)</p></details> |

When humans grasp an object, appropriate trajectories naturally form in our minds to use it for specific tasks. Hand-object interaction trajectory priors can greatly benefit applications in robotics, embodied AI, augmented reality and related fields. However, synthesizing realistic and appropriate hand trajectories given a single object or hand-object interaction image is a highly ambiguous task, requiring to correctly identify the object of interest and possibly even the correct interaction among many possible alternatives. To tackle this challenging problem, we propose the SIGHT-Fusion system, consisting of a curated pipeline for extracting visual features of hand-object interaction details from egocentric videos involving object manipulation, and a diffusion-based conditional motion generation model processing the extracted features. We train our method given video data with corresponding hand trajectory annotations, without supervision in the form of action labels. For the evaluation, we establish benchmarks utilizing the first-person FPHAB and HOI4D datasets, testing our method against various baselines and using multiple metrics. We also introduce task simulators for executing the generated hand trajectories and reporting task success rates as an additional metric. Experiments show that our method generates more appropriate and realistic hand trajectories than baselines and presents promising generalization capability on unseen objects. The accuracy of the generated hand trajectories is confirmed in a physics simulation setting, showcasing the authenticity of the created sequences and their applicability in downstream uses.</p></details> |  |

Deep learning approaches have become key in this area, utilizing large-scale trajectory datasets to model movement patterns, but face challenges in managing complex spatial dependencies and adapting to dynamic environments. To address these challenges, we introduce TrajLearn, a novel model for trajectory prediction that leverages generative modeling of higher-order mobility flows based on hexagonal spatial representation. TrajLearn predicts the next $k$ steps by integrating a customized beam search for exploring multiple potential paths while maintaining spatial continuity. We conducted a rigorous evaluation of TrajLearn, benchmarking it against leading state-of-the-art approaches and meaningful baselines. The results indicate that TrajLearn achieves significant performance gains, with improvements of up to ~40% across multiple real-world trajectory datasets. In addition, we evaluated different prediction horizons (i.e., various values of $k$), conducted resolution sensitivity analysis, and performed ablation studies to assess the impact of key model components. Furthermore, we developed a novel algorithm to generate mixed-resolution maps by hierarchically subdividing hexagonal regions into finer segments within a specified observation area. This approach supports selective detailing, applying finer resolution to areas of interest or high activity (e.g., urban centers) while using coarser resolution for less significant regions (e.g., rural areas), effectively reducing data storage requirements and computational overhead. We promote reproducibility and adaptability by offering complete code, data, and detailed documentation with flexible configuration options for various applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ACM Transactions on Spatial Algorithms and Systems</p></details> |
| **[Target Prediction Under Deceptive Switching Strategies via Outlier-Robust Filtering of Partially Observed Incomplete Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03502v1)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motivated by a study on deception and counter-deception, this paper addresses the problem of identifying an agent's target as it seeks to reach one of two targets in a given environment. In practice, an agent may initially follow a strategy to aim at one target but decide to switch to another midway. Such a strategy can be deceptive when the counterpart only has access to imperfect observations, which include heavily corrupted sensor noise and possible outliers, making it difficult to visually identify the agent's true intent. To counter deception and identify the true target, we utilize prior knowledge of the agent's dynamics and the imprecisely observed partial trajectory of the agent's states to dynamically update the estimation of the posterior probability of whether a deceptive switch has taken place. However, existing methods in the literature have not achieved effective deception identification within a reasonable computation time. We propose a set of outlier-robust change detection methods to track relevant change-related statistics efficiently, enabling the detection of deceptive strategies in hidden nonlinear dynamics with reasonable computational effort. The performance of the proposed framework is examined for Weapon-Target Assignment (WTA) detection under deceptive strategies using random simulations in the kinematics model with external forcing.</p></details> |  |

In this method, each control input between two consecutive events is a polynomial and its coefficients are chosen to minimize the error in approximating a continuous-time control signal. We design an event-triggering rule that guarantees uniform ultimate boundedness of the tracking error and non-Zeno behavior of inter-event times. We illustrate our results through a suite of numerical simulations and experiments, which indicate that the number of events generated by the proposed controller is significantly less compared to that by a time-triggered controller or a event-triggered controller based on zero-order hold while guaranteeing similar tracking performance.</p></details> |  |

Hamilton-Jacobi reachability analysis for safety verification has demonstrated practical utility only when efficient evaluation of the Hamiltonian over a large state-time grid is possible. In this study, we introduce the concept of a data-driven Hamiltonian (DDH), which circumvents the need for an explicit dynamics model by relying only on mild prior knowledge (e.g., Lipschitz constants), thus enabling the construction of reachable sets directly from trajectory data. Recognizing that the Hamiltonian is the optimal inner product between a given costate and realizable state velocities, the DDH estimates the Hamiltonian using the worst-case realization of the velocity field based on the observed state trajectory data. This formulation ensures a conservative approximation of the true Hamiltonian for uncertain dynamics. The reachable set computed based on the DDH is also ensured to be a conservative approximation of the true reachable set. Next, we propose a data-efficient safe experiment framework for gradual expansion of safe sets using the DDH. This is achieved by iteratively conducting experiments within the computed data-driven safe set and updating the set using newly collected trajectory data. To demonstrate the capabilities of our approach, we showcase its effectiveness in safe flight envelope expansion for a tiltrotor vehicle transitioning from near-hover to forward flight.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is the extended version of the article submitted to IEEE CDC 2025.

Let $G$ be a real matrix Lie group and $\mathfrak{g} = \text{Lie}(G)$ its corresponding Lie algebra. A smooth trajectory $\gamma($t$)$ generated by a fixed Lie algebra element $\xi \in \mathfrak{g}$ follows the exponential flow $\gamma($t$) = g_0 \cdot \exp(t \xi)$. The central task addressed in this work is the reconstruction of such a latent generator $\xi$ from a discretized sequence of poses $ \{g_0, g_1, \dots, g_T\} \subset G$, sampled at uniform time intervals. This problem is formulated as a data-driven regression from normalized sequences of discrete Lie algebra increments $\log\left(g_{t}^{-1} g_{t+1}\right)$ to the constant generator $\xi \in \mathfrak{g}$. A feedforward neural network is trained to learn this mapping across several groups, including $\text{SE(2)}, \text{SE(3)}, \text{SO(3)}, and \text{SL(2,$\mathbb{R})$}$. It demonstrates strong empirical accuracy under both clean and noisy conditions, which validates the viability of data-driven recovery of Lie group generators using shallow neural architectures.

Such environments contain rich features like crosswalks, grass, and curbs, which are easily interpretable by humans, but not by mobile robots. We aim to compute suitable trajectories that (1) satisfy the environment-specific traversability constraints and (2) generate human-like paths while navigating on crosswalks, sidewalks, etc. Our formulation uses a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) generative model enhanced with traversability constraints to generate multiple candidate trajectories for global navigation. We develop a visual prompting approach and leverage the Visual Language Model's (VLM) zero-shot ability of semantic understanding and logical reasoning to choose the best trajectory given the contextual information about the task. We evaluate our method in various outdoor scenes with wheeled robots and compare the performance with other global navigation algorithms. In practice, we observe an average improvement of 20.81% in satisfying traversability constraints and 28.51% in terms of human-like navigation in four different outdoor navigation scenarios.</p></details> |  |

As one of the representative trajectory optimization algorithms, the iterative Linear Quadratic Regulator (iLQR) faces limitations due to their inherently sequential computational nature, which restricts the efficiency and applicability of real-time control for robotic systems. While existing parallel implementations aim to overcome the above limitations, they typically demand additional computational iterations and high-performance hardware, leading to only modest practical improvements. In this paper, we introduce Quattro, a transformer-accelerated iLQR framework employing an algorithm-hardware co-design strategy to predict intermediate feedback and feedforward matrices. It facilitates effective parallel computations on resource-constrained devices without sacrificing accuracy. Experiments on cart-pole and quadrotor systems show an algorithm-level acceleration of up to 5.3$\times$ and 27$\times$ per iteration, respectively. When integrated into a Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework, Quattro achieves overall speedups of 2.8$\times$ for the cart-pole and 17.8$\times$ for the quadrotor compared to the one that applies traditional iLQR. Transformer inference is deployed on FPGA to maximize performance, achieving further up to 20.8$\times$ speedup over prevalent embedded CPUs with over 11$\times$ power reduction than GPU and low hardware resource overhead.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods often struggle to accurately capture this intricate structure from Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) data, particularly due to the lack of ground truth labels and the ambiguous, intertwined nature of fiber trajectories. We present a novel deep learning framework for unsupervised clustering of myocardial fibers, providing a data-driven approach to identifying distinct fiber bundles. We uniquely combine a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory network to capture local sequential information along fibers, with a Transformer autoencoder to learn global shape features, with pointwise incorporation of essential anatomical context. Clustering these representations using a density-based algorithm identifies 33 to 62 robust clusters, successfully capturing the subtle distinctions in fiber trajectories with varying levels of granularity. Our framework offers a new, flexible, and quantitative way to analyze myocardial structure, achieving a level of delineation that, to our knowledge, has not been previously achieved, with potential applications in improving surgical planning, characterizing disease-related remodeling, and ultimately, advancing personalized cardiac care.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 figures.

Typically, target trajectories are assumed deterministic, but real-world aerial vehicles exhibit stochastic behavior, such as evasive maneuvers or gliders circling in thermals. This paper uses Conditional Normalizing Flows, an unsupervised Machine Learning technique, to learn and predict the stochastic behavior of targets of guided missiles using trajectory data. The trained model predicts the distribution of future target positions based on initial conditions and parameters of the dynamics. Samples from this distribution are clustered using a time series k-means algorithm to generate representative trajectories, termed virtual targets. The method is fast and target-agnostic, requiring only training data in the form of target trajectories. Thus, it serves as a drop-in replacement for deterministic trajectory predictions in guidance laws and path planning. Simulated scenarios demonstrate the approach's effectiveness for aerial vehicles with random maneuvers, bridging the gap between deterministic predictions and stochastic reality, advancing guidance and control algorithms for autonomous vehicles.</p></details> | <details><summary>will ...</summary><p>will be submitted to Journal of Guidance, Control, and Dynamics</p></details> |

Point-based solutions rely on position annotations of WiFi fingerprints. Trajectory-based solutions, however, require end-position annotations of WiFi trajectories, where a WiFi trajectory is a multivariate time series of signal features. A trajectory dataset is much larger than a pointwise dataset as the number of potential trajectories in a field may grow exponentially with respect to the size of the field. This work presents a semi-self representation learning solution, where a large dataset $C$ of crowdsourced unlabeled WiFi trajectories can be automatically labeled by a much smaller dataset $\tilde C$ of labeled WiFi trajectories. The size of $\tilde C$ only needs to be proportional to the size of the physical field, while the unlabeled $C$ could be much larger. This is made possible through a novel ``cut-and-flip'' augmentation scheme based on the meet-in-the-middle paradigm. A two-stage learning consisting of trajectory embedding followed by endpoint embedding is proposed for the unlabeled $C$. Then the learned representations are labeled by $\tilde C$ and connected to a neural-based localization network. The result, while delivering promising accuracy, significantly relieves the burden of human annotations for trajectory-based localization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by VTC2025-Spring</p></details> |
| **[ACTIVE: Continuous Similarity Search for Vessel Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01142v1)** | 2025-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Publicly available vessel trajectory data is emitted continuously from the global AIS system. Continuous trajectory similarity search on this data has applications in, e.g., maritime navigation and safety. Existing proposals typically assume an offline setting and focus on finding similarities between complete trajectories. Such proposals are less effective when applied to online scenarios, where similarity comparisons must be performed continuously as new trajectory data arrives and trajectories evolve. We therefore propose a real-time continuous trajectory similarity search method for vessels (ACTIVE). We introduce a novel similarity measure, object-trajectory real-time distance, that emphasizes the anticipated future movement trends of vessels, enabling more predictive and forward-looking comparisons. Next, we propose a segment-based vessel trajectory index structure that organizes historical trajectories into smaller and manageable segments, facilitating accelerated similarity computations. Leveraging this index, we propose an efficient continuous similar trajectory search (CSTS) algorithm together with a variety of search space pruning strategies that reduce unnecessary computations during the continuous similarity search, thereby further improving efficiency. Extensive experiments on two large real-world AIS datasets offer evidence that ACTIVE is capable of outperforming state-of-the-art methods considerably.

In this paper, we aim to learn the trajectory prediction model by using broad out-of-domain data to improve its performance and generalization ability. Trajectory model is designed to predict any-point trajectories in the current frame given an instruction and can provide detailed control guidance for robotic policy learning. To handle the diverse out-of-domain data distribution, we propose a sparsely-gated MoE (\textbf{Top-1} gating strategy) architecture for trajectory model, coined as \textbf{Tra-MoE}. The sparse activation design enables good balance between parameter cooperation and specialization, effectively benefiting from large-scale out-of-domain data while maintaining constant FLOPs per token. In addition, we further introduce an adaptive policy conditioning technique by learning 2D mask representations for predicted trajectories, which is explicitly aligned with image observations to guide action prediction more flexibly. We perform extensive experiments on both simulation and real-world scenarios to verify the effectiveness of Tra-MoE and adaptive policy conditioning technique. We also conduct a comprehensive empirical study to train Tra-MoE, demonstrating that our Tra-MoE consistently exhibits superior performance compared to the dense baseline model, even when the latter is scaled to match Tra-MoE's parameter count.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2025.

| **[Timely Trajectory Reconstruction in Finite Buffer Remote Tracking Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00849v1)** | 2025-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Remote tracking systems play a critical role in applications such as IoT, monitoring, surveillance and healthcare. In such systems, maintaining both real-time state awareness (for online decision making) and accurate reconstruction of historical trajectories (for offline post-processing) are essential. While the Age of Information (AoI) metric has been extensively studied as a measure of freshness, it does not capture the accuracy with which past trajectories can be reconstructed. In this work, we investigate reconstruction error as a complementary metric to AoI, addressing the trade-off between timely updates and historical accuracy. Specifically, we consider three policies, each prioritizing different aspects of information management: Keep-Old, Keep-Fresh, and our proposed Inter-arrival-Aware dropping policy. We compare these policies in terms of impact on both AoI and reconstruction error in a remote tracking system with a finite buffer. Through theoretical analysis and numerical simulations of queueing behavior, we demonstrate that while the Keep-Fresh policy minimizes AoI, it does not necessarily minimize reconstruction error. In contrast, our proposed Inter-arrival-Aware dropping policy dynamically adjusts packet retention decisions based on generation times, achieving a balance between AoI and reconstruction error. Our results provide key insights into the design of efficient update policies for resource-constrained IoT networks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fine-Grained Behavior and Lane Constraints Guided Trajectory Prediction Method](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21477v2)** | 2025-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction, as a critical component of autonomous driving systems, has attracted the attention of many researchers. Existing prediction algorithms focus on extracting more detailed scene features or selecting more reasonable trajectory destinations. However, in the face of dynamic and evolving future movements of the target vehicle, these algorithms cannot provide a fine-grained and continuous description of future behaviors and lane constraints, which degrades the prediction accuracy. To address this challenge, we present BLNet, a novel dualstream architecture that synergistically integrates behavioral intention recognition and lane constraint modeling through parallel attention mechanisms. The framework generates fine-grained behavior state queries (capturing spatial-temporal movement patterns) and lane queries (encoding lane topology constraints), supervised by two auxiliary losses, respectively. Subsequently, a two-stage decoder first produces trajectory proposals, then performs point-level refinement by jointly incorporating both the continuity of passed lanes and future motion features. Extensive experiments on two large datasets, nuScenes and Argoverse, show that our network exhibits significant performance gains over existing direct regression and goal-based algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

The proposed system employs multiple UAVs equipped with dual-functional radar-communication capabilities to simultaneously perform target sensing and provide communication services to users. We formulate a joint optimization problem that aims to maximize the sum rate of users while maintaining target sensing performance through coordinated beamforming and UAV trajectory design. To address this challenging non-convex problem, we develop a block coordinated descent (BCD)-based iterative algorithm that decomposes the original problem into tractable subproblems. Then, the beamforming design problem is addressed using fractional programming, while the UAV trajectory is refined through the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed joint optimization approach achieves significant performance improvements in both communication throughput and sensing accuracy compared to conventional, separated designs. We also show that proper coordination of multiple UAVs through optimized trajectories and beamforming patterns can effectively balance the tradeoff between sensing and communication objectives.</p></details> | 5 pages, 1 figure |

To this end, an accurate prediction of dynamic obstacle trajectories is vital. Traditional approaches to trajectory prediction face limitations in generalizability and often fail to account for the intentions of other vessels. While recent research has considered incorporating the intentions of dynamic obstacles, these efforts are typically based on the own-ship's interpretation of the situation. The current state-of-the-art in this area is a Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN) model, which infers target vessel intentions by considering multiple underlying causes and allowing for different interpretations of the situation by different vessels. However, since its inception, there have not been any significant structural improvements to this model. In this paper, we propose enhancing the DBN model by incorporating considerations for grounding hazards and vessel waypoint information. The proposed model is validated using real vessel encounters extracted from historical Automatic Identification System (AIS) data.</p></details> |  |

Although mmWaves can offer a notably high data rate, their high penetration and propagation losses mean that line of sight (LoS) is necessary for effective communication. Due to the presence of obstacles and user mobility, UAV trajectory planning plays a crucial role in improving system performance. In this work, we propose a novel computational geometry-based trajectory planning scheme by considering the user mobility, the priority of the delay sensitive ultra-reliable low-latency communications (URLLC) and the high throughput requirements of the enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB) traffic. Specifically, we use geometric tools like Apollonius circle and minimum enclosing ball of balls to find the optimal position of the UAV that supports uninterrupted connections to the URLLC users and maximizes the aggregate throughput of the eMBB users. Finally, the numerical results demonstrate the benefits of the suggested approach over an existing state of the art benchmark scheme in terms of sum throughput obtained by URLLC and eMBB users.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to a reputed conference</p></details> |

This article presents an extension of the HMPC formulation to track periodic harmonic/sinusoidal references and discusses its use for tracking arbitrary trajectories. The proposed formulation inherits the benefits of its predecessor, namely its good performance and large domain of attraction when using small prediction horizons, and that the complexity of its optimization problem does not depend on the period of the reference.

| **[Aligning Diffusion Model with Problem Constraints for Trajectory Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00342v1)** | 2025-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have recently emerged as effective generative frameworks for trajectory optimization, capable of producing high-quality and diverse solutions. However, training these models in a purely data-driven manner without explicit incorporation of constraint information often leads to violations of critical constraints, such as goal-reaching, collision avoidance, and adherence to system dynamics. To address this limitation, we propose a novel approach that aligns diffusion models explicitly with problem-specific constraints, drawing insights from the Dynamic Data-driven Application Systems (DDDAS) framework. Our approach introduces a hybrid loss function that explicitly measures and penalizes constraint violations during training. Furthermore, by statistically analyzing how constraint violations evolve throughout the diffusion steps, we develop a re-weighting strategy that aligns predicted violations to ground truth statistics at each diffusion step. Evaluated on a tabletop manipulation and a two-car reach-avoid problem, our constraint-aligned diffusion model significantly reduces constraint violations compared to traditional diffusion models, while maintaining the quality of trajectory solutions. This approach is well-suited for integration into the DDDAS framework for efficient online trajectory adaptation as new environmental data becomes available.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Velocity and Acceleration: Self-Supervised Motion Consistency for Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24272v1)** | 2025-03-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding human motion is crucial for accurate pedestrian trajectory prediction. Conventional methods typically rely on supervised learning, where ground-truth labels are directly optimized against predicted trajectories. This amplifies the limitations caused by long-tailed data distributions, making it difficult for the model to capture abnormal behaviors. In this work, we propose a self-supervised pedestrian trajectory prediction framework that explicitly models position, velocity, and acceleration. We leverage velocity and acceleration information to enhance position prediction through feature injection and a self-supervised motion consistency mechanism. Our model hierarchically injects velocity features into the position stream. Acceleration features are injected into the velocity stream. This enables the model to predict position, velocity, and acceleration jointly. From the predicted position, we compute corresponding pseudo velocity and acceleration, allowing the model to learn from data-generated pseudo labels and thus achieve self-supervised learning. We further design a motion consistency evaluation strategy grounded in physical principles; it selects the most reasonable predicted motion trend by comparing it with historical dynamics and uses this trend to guide and constrain trajectory generation. We conduct experiments on the ETH-UCY and Stanford Drone datasets, demonstrating that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamic High-Order Control Barrier Functions with Diffuser for Safety-Critical Trajectory Planning at Signal-Free Intersections](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00162v2)** | 2025-03-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Planning safe and efficient trajectories through signal-free intersections presents significant challenges for autonomous vehicles (AVs), particularly in dynamic, multi-task environments with unpredictable interactions and an increased possibility of conflicts. This study aims to address these challenges by developing a unified, robust, adaptive framework to ensure safety and efficiency across three distinct intersection movements: left-turn, right-turn, and straight-ahead. Existing methods often struggle to reliably ensure safety and effectively learn multi-task behaviors from demonstrations in such environments. This study proposes a safety-critical planning method that integrates Dynamic High-Order Control Barrier Functions (DHOCBF) with a diffusion-based model, called Dynamic Safety-Critical Diffuser (DSC-Diffuser). The DSC-Diffuser leverages task-guided planning to enhance efficiency, allowing the simultaneous learning of multiple driving tasks from real-world expert demonstrations. Moreover, the incorporation of goal-oriented constraints significantly reduces displacement errors, ensuring precise trajectory execution. To further ensure driving safety in dynamic environments, the proposed DHOCBF framework dynamically adjusts to account for the movements of surrounding vehicles, offering enhanced adaptability and reduce the conservatism compared to traditional control barrier functions. Validity evaluations of DHOCBF, conducted through numerical simulations, demonstrate its robustness in adapting to variations in obstacle velocities, sizes, uncertainties, and locations, effectively maintaining driving safety across a wide range of complex and uncertain scenarios. Comprehensive performance evaluations demonstrate that DSC-Diffuser generates realistic, stable, and generalizable policies, providing flexibility and reliable safety assurance in complex multi-task driving scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 fi...</summary><p>11 figures, 5 tables, 15 pages</p></details> |
| **[Trajectory Planning for Automated Driving using Target Funnels](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23795v1)** | 2025-03-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-driving vehicles rely on sensory input to monitor their surroundings and continuously adapt to the most likely future road course. Predictive trajectory planning is based on snapshots of the (uncertain) road course as a key input. Under noisy perception data, estimates of the road course can vary significantly, leading to indecisive and erratic steering behavior. To overcome this issue, this paper introduces a predictive trajectory planning algorithm with a novel objective function: instead of targeting a single reference trajectory based on the most likely road course, tracking a series of target reference sets, called a target funnel, is considered. The proposed planning algorithm integrates probabilistic information about the road course, and thus implicitly considers regular updates to road perception. Our solution is assessed in a case study using real driving data collected from a prototype vehicle. The results demonstrate that the algorithm maintains tracking accuracy and substantially reduces undesirable steering commands in the presence of noisy road perception, achieving a 56% reduction in input costs compared to a certainty equivalent formulation.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted to European Control Conference 2025 (ECC25)</p></details> |

These high-resolution, language-guided synthesized images are essential for the explainability of disease or exploring causal relationships. However, their potential for disentangling and controlling latent factors of variation in specialized domains like medical imaging remains under-explored. In this work, we present the first investigation of the power of pre-trained vision-language foundation models, once fine-tuned on medical image datasets, to perform latent disentanglement for factorized medical image generation and interpolation. Through extensive experiments on chest X-ray and skin datasets, we illustrate that fine-tuned, language-guided Stable Diffusion inherently learns to factorize key attributes for image generation, such as the patient's anatomical structures or disease diagnostic features. We devise a framework to identify, isolate, and manipulate key attributes through latent space trajectory traversal of generative models, facilitating precise control over medical image synthesis.</p></details> | 10 pages |

However, existing datasets fall short in capturing the diversity and dynamics of VRU behaviors, making it difficult to meet the research demands of complex traffic environments. To address this gap, this study developed the OnSiteVRU datasets, which cover a variety of scenarios, including intersections, road segments, and urban villages. These datasets provide trajectory data for motor vehicles, electric bicycles, and human-powered bicycles, totaling approximately 17,429 trajectories with a precision of 0.04 seconds. The datasets integrate both aerial-view natural driving data and onboard real-time dynamic detection data, along with environmental information such as traffic signals, obstacles, and real-time maps, enabling a comprehensive reconstruction of interaction events. The results demonstrate that VRU\_Data outperforms traditional datasets in terms of VRU density and scene coverage, offering a more comprehensive representation of VRU behavioral characteristics. This provides critical support for traffic flow modeling, trajectory prediction, and autonomous driving virtual testing.

VT migration is an effective way that migrates the VT when the locations of physical entities keep changing to maintain seamless immersive VT services. However, an efficient VT migration is challenging due to the rapid movement of vehicles, dynamic workloads of Roadside Units (RSUs), and heterogeneous resources of the RSUs. To achieve efficient migration decisions and a minimum latency for the VT migration, we propose a multi-agent split Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) framework combined with spatio-temporal trajectory generation. In this framework, multiple split DRL agents utilize split architecture to efficiently determine VT migration decisions. Furthermore, we propose a spatio-temporal trajectory generation algorithm based on trajectory datasets and road network data to simulate vehicle trajectories, enhancing the generalization of the proposed scheme for managing VT migration in dynamic network environments. Finally, experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme not only enhances the Quality of Experience (QoE) by 29% but also reduces the computational parameter count by approximately 25% while maintaining similar performances, enhancing users' immersive experiences in vehicular metaverses.</p></details> |  |

However, existing approaches have largely focused on inter-visit event predictions, overlooking the importance of intra-visit nowcasting, which provides prompt clinical insights during an ongoing patient visit. To address this gap, we introduce the task of laboratory measurement prediction within a hospital visit. We study the laboratory data that, however, remained underexplored in previous work. We propose TRACE, a Transformer-based model designed for clinical event nowcasting by encoding patient trajectories. TRACE effectively handles long sequences and captures temporal dependencies through a novel timestamp embedding that integrates decay properties and periodic patterns of data.

Existing methods also generally predict agents' states without offering any state-wise measure of uncertainty. Moreover, popular multi-modal sampling methods lack any error probability estimates for each generated scene under the same prior observations, making it difficult to rank the predictions during inference time. We introduce U2Diff, a \textbf{unified} diffusion model designed to handle trajectory completion while providing state-wise \textbf{uncertainty} estimates jointly. This uncertainty estimation is achieved by augmenting the simple denoising loss with the negative log-likelihood of the predicted noise and propagating latent space uncertainty to the real state space. Additionally, we incorporate a Rank Neural Network in post-processing to enable \textbf{error probability} estimation for each generated mode, demonstrating a strong correlation with the error relative to ground truth. Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art solutions in trajectory completion and forecasting across four challenging sports datasets (NBA, Basketball-U, Football-U, Soccer-U), highlighting the effectiveness of uncertainty and error probability estimation.

| **[Simplification of Trajectory Streams](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23025v1)** | 2025-03-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While there are software systems that simplify trajectory streams on the fly, few curve simplification algorithms with quality guarantees fit the streaming requirements. We present streaming algorithms for two such problems under the Fr\'{e}chet distance $d_F$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$ for some constant $d \geq 2$. Consider a polygonal curve $\tau$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$ in a stream. We present a streaming algorithm that, for any $\varepsilon\in (0,1)$ and $\delta > 0$, produces a curve $\sigma$ such that $d_F(\sigma,\tau[v_1,v_i])\le (1+\varepsilon)\delta$ and $|\sigma|\le 2\,\mathrm{opt}-2$, where $\tau[v_1,v_i]$ is the prefix in the stream so far, and $\mathrm{opt} = \min\{|\sigma'|: d_F(\sigma',\tau[v_1,v_i])\le \delta\}$. Let $\alpha = 2(d-1){\lfloor d/2 \rfloor}^2 + d$. The working storage is $O(\varepsilon^{-\alpha})$. Each vertex is processed in $O(\varepsilon^{-\alpha}\log\frac{1}{\varepsilon})$ time for $d \in \{2,3\}$ and $O(\varepsilon^{-\alpha})$ time for $d \geq 4$ . Thus, the whole $\tau$ can be simplified in $O(\varepsilon^{-\alpha}|\tau|\log\frac{1}{\varepsilon})$ time. Ignoring polynomial factors in $1/\varepsilon$, this running time is a factor $|\tau|$ faster than the best static algorithm that offers the same guarantees. We present another streaming algorithm that, for any integer $k \geq 2$ and any $\varepsilon \in (0,\frac{1}{17})$, maintains a curve $\sigma$ such that $|\sigma| \leq 2k-2$ and $d_F(\sigma,\tau[v_1,v_i])\le (1+\varepsilon) \cdot \min\{d_F(\sigma',\tau[v_1,v_i]): |\sigma'| \leq k\}$, where $\tau[v_1,v_i]$ is the prefix in the stream so far. The working storage is $O((k\varepsilon^{-1}+\varepsilon^{-(\alpha+1)})\log \frac{1}{\varepsilon})$. Each vertex is processed in $O(k\varepsilon^{-(\alpha+1)}\log^2\frac{1}{\varepsilon})$ time for $d \in \{2,3\}$ and $O(k\varepsilon^{-(\alpha+1)}\log\frac{1}{\varepsilon})$ time for $d \geq 4$.</p></details> | SoCG 2025 |

Machine learning algorithms constitute the state-of-the-art in many fields but require vast data sets, which are costly and time-intensive to collect. Automated strategies for observation and exploration are crucial to enhance the efficiency of data gathering. Therefore, a novel strategy utilizing the Next-Best-Trajectory principle is developed for a robot manipulator operating in dynamic environments. Local trajectories are generated to maximize the information gained from observations along the path while avoiding collisions. We employ a voxel map for environment modeling and utilize raycasting from perspectives around a point of interest to estimate the information gain. A global ergodic trajectory planner provides an optional reference trajectory to the local planner, improving exploration and helping to avoid local minima. To enhance computational efficiency, raycasting for estimating the information gain in the environment is executed in parallel on the graphics processing unit. Benchmark results confirm the efficiency of the parallelization, while real-world experiments demonstrate the strategy's effectiveness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at the IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA), 2025</p></details> |

In this work, we present a reinforcement-learning framework for multi-setpoint and multi-trajectory tracking. Tracking multiple setpoints and time-varying trajectories in reinforcement learning is challenging due to the complexity of balancing multiple objectives, a difficulty further exacerbated by system uncertainties such as uncertain initial conditions and stochastic dynamics. This challenge is relevant, e.g., in bioprocesses involving microbial consortia, where precise control over population compositions is required. We introduce a novel return function based on multiplicative reciprocal saturation functions, which explicitly couples reward gains to the simultaneous satisfaction of multiple references. Through a case study involving light-mediated cybergenetic growth control in microbial consortia, we demonstrate via computational experiments that our approach achieves faster convergence, improved stability, and superior control compliance compared to conventional quadratic-cost-based return functions. Moreover, our method enables tuning of the saturation function's parameters, shaping the learning process and policy updates. By incorporating system uncertainties, our framework also demonstrates robustness, a key requirement in industrial bioprocessing. Overall, this work advances reinforcement-learning-based control strategies in bioprocess engineering, with implications in the broader field of process and systems engineering.</p></details> |  |

However, they often face challenges with temporal consistency, particularly in the talking head domain, where continuous changes in facial expressions intensify the level of difficulty. These issues stem from the independent editing of individual images and the inherent loss of temporal continuity during the editing process. In this paper, we introduce Follow Your Motion (FYM), a generic framework for maintaining temporal consistency in portrait editing. Specifically, given portrait images rendered by a pre-trained 3D Gaussian Splatting model, we first develop a diffusion model that intuitively and inherently learns motion trajectory changes at different scales and pixel coordinates, from the first frame to each subsequent frame. This approach ensures that temporally inconsistent edited avatars inherit the motion information from the rendered avatars. Secondly, to maintain fine-grained expression temporal consistency in talking head editing, we propose a dynamic re-weighted attention mechanism. This mechanism assigns higher weight coefficients to landmark points in space and dynamically updates these weights based on landmark loss, achieving more consistent and refined facial expressions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches in terms of temporal consistency and can be used to optimize and compensate for temporally inconsistent outputs in a range of applications, such as text-driven editing, relighting, and various other applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://anonymous-hub1127.github.io/FYM.github.io/</p></details> |

In such applications, camera-based perception enables the extraction of additional modalities (human pose, text) to enhance prediction accuracy. Indeed, we find that textual descriptions play a crucial role in integrating additional modalities into a unified understanding. However, online extraction of text requires the use of VLM, which may not be feasible for resource-constrained systems. To address this challenge, we propose a multi-modal knowledge distillation framework: a student model with limited modality is distilled from a teacher model trained with full range of modalities. The comprehensive knowledge of a teacher model trained with trajectory, human pose, and text is distilled into a student model using only trajectory or human pose as a sole supplement. In doing so, we separately distill the core locomotion insights from intra-agent multi-modality and inter-agent interaction. Our generalizable framework is validated with two state-of-the-art models across three datasets on both ego-view (JRDB, SIT) and BEV-view (ETH/UCY) setups, utilizing both annotated and VLM-generated text captions. Distilled student models show consistent improvement in all prediction metrics for both full and instantaneous observations, improving up to ~13%.

Still, existing methods that perform dragging in the 2D space usually face ambiguity when handling out-of-plane movements. In this work, we augment the interaction with a new dimension, i.e., the depth dimension, such that users are allowed to assign a relative depth for each point on the trajectory. That way, our new interaction paradigm not only inherits the convenience from 2D dragging, but facilitates trajectory control in the 3D space, broadening the scope of creativity. We propose a pioneering method for 3D trajectory control in image-to-video synthesis by abstracting object masks into a few cluster points. These points, accompanied by the depth information and the instance information, are finally fed into a video diffusion model as the control signal.

In contrast to prior motion conditioning work, this flexible representation can encode any number of trajectories, object-specific or global scene motion, and temporally sparse motion; due to its flexibility we refer to this conditioning as motion prompts. While users may directly specify sparse trajectories, we also show how to translate high-level user requests into detailed, semi-dense motion prompts, a process we term motion prompt expansion. We demonstrate the versatility of our approach through various applications, including camera and object motion control, "interacting" with an image, motion transfer, and image editing. Our results showcase emergent behaviors, such as realistic physics, suggesting the potential of motion prompts for probing video models and interacting with future generative world models. Finally, we evaluate quantitatively, conduct a human study, and demonstrate strong performance.

| **[Model-Predictive Trajectory Generation for Aerial Search and Coverage](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05944v2)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces a trajectory planning algorithm for search and coverage missions with an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) based on an uncertainty map that represents prior knowledge of the target region, modeled by a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). The trajectory planning problem is formulated as an Optimal Control Problem (OCP), which aims to maximize the uncertainty reduction within a specified mission duration. However, this results in an intractable OCP whose objective functional cannot be expressed in closed form. To address this, we propose a Model Predictive Control (MPC) algorithm based on a relaxed formulation of the objective function to approximate the optimal solutions. This relaxation promotes efficient map exploration by penalizing overlaps in the UAV's visibility regions along the trajectory. The algorithm can produce efficient and smooth trajectories, and it can be efficiently implemented using standard Nonlinear Programming solvers, being suitable for real-time planning. Unlike traditional methods, which often rely on discretizing the mission space and using complex mixed-integer formulations, our approach is computationally efficient and easier to implement. The MPC algorithm is initially assessed in MATLAB, followed by Gazebo simulations and actual experimental tests conducted in an outdoor environment. The results demonstrate that the proposed strategy can generate efficient and smooth trajectories for search and coverage missions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Optimizing a Convex Cover of Collision-Free Space for Trajectory Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09631v3)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose an online iterative algorithm to optimize a convex cover to under-approximate the free space for autonomous navigation to delineate Safe Flight Corridors (SFC). The convex cover consists of a set of polytopes such that the union of the polytopes represents obstacle-free space, allowing us to find trajectories for robots that lie within the convex cover. In order to find the SFC that facilitates trajectory optimization, we iteratively find overlapping polytopes of maximum volumes that include specified waypoints initialized by a geometric or kinematic planner. Constraints at waypoints appear in two alternating stages of a joint optimization problem, which is solved by a novel heuristic-based iterative algorithm with partially distributed variables. We validate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm using a range of parameterized environments and show its applications for two-stage motion planning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Consistency Trajectory Matching for One-Step Generative Super-Resolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20349v2)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current diffusion-based super-resolution (SR) approaches achieve commendable performance at the cost of high inference overhead. Therefore, distillation techniques are utilized to accelerate the multi-step teacher model into one-step student model. Nevertheless, these methods significantly raise training costs and constrain the performance of the student model by the teacher model. To overcome these tough challenges, we propose Consistency Trajectory Matching for Super-Resolution (CTMSR), a distillation-free strategy that is able to generate photo-realistic SR results in one step. Concretely, we first formulate a Probability Flow Ordinary Differential Equation (PF-ODE) trajectory to establish a deterministic mapping from low-resolution (LR) images with noise to high-resolution (HR) images. Then we apply the Consistency Training (CT) strategy to directly learn the mapping in one step, eliminating the necessity of pre-trained diffusion model. To further enhance the performance and better leverage the ground-truth during the training process, we aim to align the distribution of SR results more closely with that of the natural images. To this end, we propose to minimize the discrepancy between their respective PF-ODE trajectories from the LR image distribution by our meticulously designed Distribution Trajectory Matching (DTM) loss, resulting in improved realism of our recovered HR images. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed methods can attain comparable or even superior capabilities on both synthetic and real datasets while maintaining minimal inference latency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Latency Minimization for UAV-Enabled Federated Learning: Trajectory Design and Resource Allocation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07428v2)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated learning (FL) has become a transformative paradigm for distributed machine learning across wireless networks. However, the performance of FL is often hindered by the unreliable communication links between resource-constrained Internet of Things (IoT) devices and the central server. To overcome this challenge, we propose a novel framework that employs an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) as a mobile server to enhance the FL training process. By capitalizing on the UAV's mobility, we establish strong line-of-sight connections with IoT devices, thereby enhancing communication reliability and capacity. To maximize training efficiency, we formulate a latency minimization problem that jointly optimizes bandwidth allocation, computing frequencies, transmit power for both the UAV and IoT devices, and the UAV's flight trajectory. Subsequently, we analyze the required rounds of the IoT devices training and the UAV aggregation for FL convergence. Based on the convergence constraint, we transform the problem into three subproblems and develop an efficient alternating optimization algorithm to solve this problem effectively. Additionally, we provide a thorough analysis of the algorithm's convergence and computational complexity. Extensive numerical results demonstrate that our proposed scheme not only surpasses existing benchmark schemes in reducing latency up to 15.29%, but also achieves training efficiency that nearly matches the ideal scenario.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This manuscript has been submitted to IEEE</p></details> |
| **[A Multi-Modal Knowledge-Enhanced Framework for Vessel Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21834v1)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate vessel trajectory prediction facilitates improved navigational safety, routing, and environmental protection. However, existing prediction methods are challenged by the irregular sampling time intervals of the vessel tracking data from the global AIS system and the complexity of vessel movement. These aspects render model learning and generalization difficult. To address these challenges and improve vessel trajectory prediction, we propose the multi-modal knowledge-enhanced framework (MAKER) for vessel trajectory prediction. To contend better with the irregular sampling time intervals, MAKER features a Large language model-guided Knowledge Transfer (LKT) module that leverages pre-trained language models to transfer trajectory-specific contextual knowledge effectively. To enhance the ability to learn complex trajectory patterns, MAKER incorporates a Knowledge-based Self-paced Learning (KSL) module. This module employs kinematic knowledge to progressively integrate complex patterns during training, allowing for adaptive learning and enhanced generalization. Experimental results on two vessel trajectory datasets show that MAKER can improve the prediction accuracy of state-of-the-art methods by 12.08%-17.86%.</p></details> | 8 pages, 5 figures |

Model Predictive Control (MPC), particularly sampling-based approaches such as the Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) method, has recently demonstrated considerable success by leveraging parallel computing to efficiently evaluate numerous trajectories. However, MPPI often struggles to balance safe navigation in constrained environments with effective exploration in open spaces, leading to infeasibility in cluttered conditions. To address these limitations, we propose DBaS-Log-MPPI, a novel algorithm that integrates Discrete Barrier States (DBaS) to ensure safety while enabling adaptive exploration with enhanced feasibility. Our method is efficiently validated through three simulation missions and one real-world experiment, involving a 2D quadrotor and a ground vehicle navigating through cluttered obstacles. We demonstrate that our algorithm surpasses both Vanilla MPPI and Log-MPPI, achieving higher success rates, lower tracking errors, and a conservative average speed.</p></details> | IROS 2025 |

Many advanced approaches have been proposed over the years with improved spatial and temporal feature extraction. However, human behaviour is naturally diverse and uncertain. Given the past trajectory and surrounding environment information, an agent can have multiple plausible trajectories in the future. To tackle this problem, an essential task named multi-future trajectory prediction (MTP) has recently been studied. This task aims to generate a diverse, acceptable and explainable distribution of future predictions for each agent. In this paper, we present the first survey for MTP with our unique taxonomies and a comprehensive analysis of frameworks, datasets and evaluation metrics. We also compare models on existing MTP datasets and conduct experiments on the ForkingPath dataset. Finally, we discuss multiple future directions that can help researchers develop novel multi-future trajectory prediction systems and other diverse learning tasks similar to MTP.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by TNNLS 2025</p></details> |

Existing methods are designed for specific ball types and struggle to generalize. This challenge arises from three key factors. First, learning-based models require large datasets but suffer from accuracy drops in unseen scenarios. Second, physics-based models rely on complex formulas and detailed inputs, yet accurately obtaining ball states, such as spin, is often impractical. Third, integrating physical principles with neural networks to achieve high accuracy, fast inference, and strong generalization remains difficult. To address these issues, we propose an innovative approach that incorporates physics-based equations and neural networks. We first derive three generalized physical formulas. Then, using a neural network and observed trajectory points, we infer certain parameters while fitting the remaining ones. These formulas enable precise trajectory prediction with minimal training data: only a few dozen samples. Extensive experiments demonstrate our method superiority in generalization, real-time performance, and accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This submission was made without my advisor's consent, and I mistakenly uploaded an incorrect version of the paper.

Latencies cause misalignments in both spatial and semantic features, complicating the fusion of real-time observations from the ego vehicle with delayed data from others. To address these issues, we propose TraF-Align, a novel framework that learns the flow path of features by predicting the feature-level trajectory of objects from past observations up to the ego vehicle's current time. By generating temporally ordered sampling points along these paths, TraF-Align directs attention from the current-time query to relevant historical features along each trajectory, supporting the reconstruction of current-time features and promoting semantic interaction across multiple frames. This approach corrects spatial misalignment and ensures semantic consistency across agents, effectively compensating for motion and achieving coherent feature fusion. Experiments on two real-world datasets, V2V4Real and DAIR-V2X-Seq, show that TraF-Align sets a new benchmark for asynchronous cooperative perception.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2025</p></details> |

By posing the finite-horizon optimal control problem and recursive re-evaluation of the optimal trajectories, minimization of the L2 norms of the state and control errors are transcribed into a quadratic program. Control and state variable constraints are parameterized using Chebyshev polynomials and are accommodated in the optimal trajectory generation programs to incorporate the actuator limits and keep-out constraints. Differentiable collision detection of polytopes is leveraged for optimal collision avoidance. Results obtained from the collocation methods are benchmarked against the existing approaches on an edge computer to outline the performance improvements.

| **[Trajectory Balance with Asynchrony: Decoupling Exploration and Learning for Fast, Scalable LLM Post-Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18929v1)** | 2025-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) is a critical component of large language model (LLM) post-training. However, existing on-policy algorithms used for post-training are inherently incompatible with the use of experience replay buffers, which can be populated scalably by distributed off-policy actors to enhance exploration as compute increases. We propose efficiently obtaining this benefit of replay buffers via Trajectory Balance with Asynchrony (TBA), a massively scalable LLM RL system. In contrast to existing approaches, TBA uses a larger fraction of compute on search, constantly generating off-policy data for a central replay buffer. A training node simultaneously samples data from this buffer based on reward or recency to update the policy using Trajectory Balance (TB), a diversity-seeking RL objective introduced for GFlowNets. TBA offers three key advantages: (1) decoupled training and search, speeding up training wall-clock time by 4x or more; (2) improved diversity through large-scale off-policy sampling; and (3) scalable search for sparse reward settings. On mathematical reasoning, preference-tuning, and automated red-teaming (diverse and representative post-training tasks), TBA produces speed and performance improvements over strong baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[CarPlanner: Consistent Auto-regressive Trajectory Planning for Large-scale Reinforcement Learning in Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19908v3)** | 2025-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory planning is vital for autonomous driving, ensuring safe and efficient navigation in complex environments. While recent learning-based methods, particularly reinforcement learning (RL), have shown promise in specific scenarios, RL planners struggle with training inefficiencies and managing large-scale, real-world driving scenarios. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{CarPlanner}, a \textbf{C}onsistent \textbf{a}uto-\textbf{r}egressive \textbf{Planner} that uses RL to generate multi-modal trajectories. The auto-regressive structure enables efficient large-scale RL training, while the incorporation of consistency ensures stable policy learning by maintaining coherent temporal consistency across time steps. Moreover, CarPlanner employs a generation-selection framework with an expert-guided reward function and an invariant-view module, simplifying RL training and enhancing policy performance. Extensive analysis demonstrates that our proposed RL framework effectively addresses the challenges of training efficiency and performance enhancement, positioning CarPlanner as a promising solution for trajectory planning in autonomous driving. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to demonstrate that the RL-based planner can surpass both IL- and rule-based state-of-the-arts (SOTAs) on the challenging large-scale real-world dataset nuPlan. Our proposed CarPlanner surpasses RL-, IL-, and rule-based SOTA approaches within this demanding dataset.</p></details> | CVPR 2025 |
| **[DiffMove: Group Mobility Tendency Enhanced Trajectory Recovery via Diffusion Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18302v1)** | 2025-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the real world, trajectory data is often sparse and incomplete due to low collection frequencies or limited device coverage. Trajectory recovery aims to recover these missing trajectory points, making the trajectories denser and more complete. However, this task faces two key challenges: 1) The excessive sparsity of individual trajectories makes it difficult to effectively leverage historical information for recovery; 2) Sparse trajectories make it harder to capture complex individual mobility preferences. To address these challenges, we propose a novel method called DiffMove. Firstly, we harness crowd wisdom for trajectory recovery. Specifically, we construct a group tendency graph using the collective trajectories of all users and then integrate the group mobility trends into the location representations via graph embedding. This solves the challenge of sparse trajectories being unable to rely on individual historical trajectories for recovery. Secondly, we capture individual mobility preferences from both historical and current perspectives. Finally, we integrate group mobility tendencies and individual preferences into the spatiotemporal distribution of the trajectory to recover high-quality trajectories. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate that DiffMove outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods. Further analysis validates the robustness of our method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory Imputation in Multi-Agent Sports with Derivative-Accumulating Self-Ensemble](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10878v3)** | 2025-03-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-agent trajectory data collected from domains such as team sports often suffer from missing values due to various factors. While many imputation methods have been proposed for spatiotemporal data, they are not well-suited for multi-agent sports scenarios where player movements are highly dynamic and inter-agent interactions continuously evolve. To address these challenges, we propose MIDAS (Multi-agent Imputer with Derivative-Accumulating Self-ensemble), a framework that imputes multi-agent trajectories with high accuracy and physical plausibility. It jointly predicts positions, velocities, and accelerations through a Set Transformer-based neural network and generates alternative estimates by recursively accumulating predicted velocity and acceleration values. These predictions are then combined using a learnable weighted ensemble to produce final imputed trajectories. Experiments on three sports datasets demonstrate that MIDAS significantly outperforms existing baselines in both positional accuracy and physical plausibility. Lastly, we showcase use cases of MIDAS, such as approximating total distance and pass success probability, to highlight its applicability to practical downstream tasks that require complete tracking data.</p></details> |  |
| **[EF-3DGS: Event-Aided Free-Trajectory 3D Gaussian Splatting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15392v3)** | 2025-03-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scene reconstruction from casually captured videos has wide applications in real-world scenarios. With recent advancements in differentiable rendering techniques, several methods have attempted to simultaneously optimize scene representations (NeRF or 3DGS) and camera poses. Despite recent progress, existing methods relying on traditional camera input tend to fail in high-speed (or equivalently low-frame-rate) scenarios. Event cameras, inspired by biological vision, record pixel-wise intensity changes asynchronously with high temporal resolution, providing valuable scene and motion information in blind inter-frame intervals. In this paper, we introduce the event camera to aid scene construction from a casually captured video for the first time, and propose Event-Aided Free-Trajectory 3DGS, called EF-3DGS, which seamlessly integrates the advantages of event cameras into 3DGS through three key components. First, we leverage the Event Generation Model (EGM) to fuse events and frames, supervising the rendered views observed by the event stream. Second, we adopt the Contrast Maximization (CMax) framework in a piece-wise manner to extract motion information by maximizing the contrast of the Image of Warped Events (IWE), thereby calibrating the estimated poses. Besides, based on the Linear Event Generation Model (LEGM), the brightness information encoded in the IWE is also utilized to constrain the 3DGS in the gradient domain. Third, to mitigate the absence of color information of events, we introduce photometric bundle adjustment (PBA) to ensure view consistency across events and frames. We evaluate our method on the public Tanks and Temples benchmark and a newly collected real-world dataset, RealEv-DAVIS.

Using data from seven cohorts belonging to the Lifetime Risk Pooling Project (LRPP), we present a Bayesian hierarchical multivariate approach that jointly models multiple longitudinal risk factors over time and across cohorts. Because few cohorts in our project cover the entire adult lifespan, our strategy uses information from all risk factors to increase precision for each risk factor trajectory and borrows information across cohorts to fill in unobserved risk factors. We develop novel diagnostic testing and model validation methods to ensure that our model robustly captures and maintains critical relationships over time and across risk factors.</p></details> |  |

Previous MLLM-based methods commonly struggle with the dilemma between "Ref" and "VOS": they either specialize in understanding a few key frames (global reasoning) or tracking objects on continuous frames (local reasoning), and rely on external VOS or frame selectors to mitigate the other end of the challenge. However, our framework GLUS shows that global and local consistency can be unified into a single video segmentation MLLM: a set of sparse "context frames" provides global information, while a stream of continuous "query frames" conducts local object tracking. This is further supported by jointly training the MLLM with a pre-trained VOS memory bank to simultaneously digest short-range and long-range temporal information. To improve the information efficiency within the limited context window of MLLMs, we introduce object contrastive learning to distinguish hard false-positive objects and a self-refined framework to identify crucial frames and perform propagation. By collectively integrating these insights, our GLUS delivers a simple yet effective baseline, achieving new state-of-the-art for MLLMs on the MeViS and Ref-Youtube-VOS benchmark.

While large language models (LLMs) have advanced general-purpose translation, their performance on SNS-specific content remains limited due to insufficient specialized training data and evaluation benchmarks. This paper introduces RedTrans, a 72B LLM tailored for SNS translation, trained on a novel dataset developed through three innovations: (1) Supervised Finetuning with Dual-LLM Back-Translation Sampling, an unsupervised sampling method using LLM-based back-translation to select diverse data for large-scale finetuning; (2) Rewritten Preference Optimization (RePO), an algorithm that identifies and corrects erroneous preference pairs through expert annotation, building reliable preference corpora; and (3) RedTrans-Bench, the first benchmark for SNS translation, evaluating phenomena like humor localization, emoji semantics, and meme adaptation. Experiments show RedTrans outperforms state-of-the-art LLMs. Besides, RedTrans has already been deployed in a real-world production environment, demonstrating that domain-specific adaptation, effectively bridges the gap between generic and culturally grounded translation systems.</p></details> |  |

A Mechanistic Interpretability Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07898v1)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies have shown that large language models (LLMs) can assess relevance and support information retrieval (IR) tasks such as document ranking and relevance judgment generation. However, the internal mechanisms by which off-the-shelf LLMs understand and operationalize relevance remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we systematically investigate how different LLM modules contribute to relevance judgment through the lens of mechanistic interpretability. Using activation patching techniques, we analyze the roles of various model components and identify a multi-stage, progressive process in generating either pointwise or pairwise relevance judgment. Specifically, LLMs first extract query and document information in the early layers, then process relevance information according to instructions in the middle layers, and finally utilize specific attention heads in the later layers to generate relevance judgments in the required format. Our findings provide insights into the mechanisms underlying relevance assessment in LLMs, offering valuable implications for future research on leveraging LLMs for IR tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, their increasing integration into critical societal domains has raised concerns about embedded biases, which can perpetuate stereotypes and compromise fairness. These biases stem from various sources, including historical inequalities in training data, linguistic imbalances, and adversarial manipulation. Despite mitigation efforts, recent studies indicate that LLMs remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks designed to elicit biased responses. This work proposes a scalable benchmarking framework to evaluate LLM robustness against adversarial bias elicitation. Our methodology involves (i) systematically probing models with a multi-task approach targeting biases across various sociocultural dimensions, (ii) quantifying robustness through safety scores using an LLM-as-a-Judge approach for automated assessment of model responses, and (iii) employing jailbreak techniques to investigate vulnerabilities in safety mechanisms. Our analysis examines prevalent biases in both small and large state-of-the-art models and their impact on model safety. Additionally, we assess the safety of domain-specific models fine-tuned for critical fields, such as medicine. Finally, we release a curated dataset of bias-related prompts, CLEAR-Bias, to facilitate systematic vulnerability benchmarking. Our findings reveal critical trade-offs between model size and safety, aiding the development of fairer and more robust future language models.</p></details> |  |

Although the field of LLM has been witnessing unprecedented advances in pushing the scale and capability of LLM in recent years, training such a large-scale model still involves significant optimization and system challenges. To stabilize the training process, we propose depth-scaled sandwich normalization, which effectively eliminates loss spikes during the training process of deep models. We pre-train our model on 13.2 trillion diverse and high-quality tokens and further enhance its reasoning capabilities during post-training. To perform such large-scale training efficiently, we utilize 8,192 Ascend NPUs with a series of system optimizations. Evaluations on multiple diverse benchmarks indicate that Pangu Ultra significantly advances the state-of-the-art capabilities of dense LLMs such as Llama 405B and Mistral Large 2, and even achieves competitive results with DeepSeek-R1, whose sparse model structure contains much more parameters. Our exploration demonstrates that Ascend NPUs are capable of efficiently and effectively training dense models with more than 100 billion parameters.

| **[Efficient Heterogeneous Large Language Model Decoding with Model-Attention Disaggregation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01814v2)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) exhibit impressive performance in generative tasks but also introduce significant challenges in real-world serving due to inefficient use of the expensive, computation-optimized accelerators. Although disaggregated serving architectures have been proposed to split different phases of LLM inference, the efficiency of decoding phase is still low. This is caused by the varying resource demands of different operators in the transformer-based LLMs. Specifically, the attention operator is memory-intensive, exhibiting a memory access pattern that clashes with the strengths of modern accelerators, especially for long context requests. To enhance the efficiency of LLM decoding, we introduce model-attention disaggregation. This approach leverages a collection of cheap, memory-optimized devices for the attention operator while still utilizing high-end accelerators for other parts of the model. This heterogeneous setup ensures that each component is tailored to its specific workload, maximizing overall performance and cost efficiency. Our comprehensive analysis and experiments confirm the viability of splitting the attention computation over multiple devices. Also, the communication bandwidth required between heterogeneous devices proves to be manageable with prevalent networking technologies. To further validate our theory, we develop and deploy Lamina, an LLM inference system that incorporates model-attention disaggregation in a distributed heterogeneous cluster. Experimental results indicate that Lamina can provide 16.1 ~ 90.1% higher estimated throughput than existing solutions with similar costs.</p></details> |  |

Despite their computational efficiency during inference, the massive overall parameter footprint of MoE models (e.g., GPT-4) introduces critical challenges for practical deployment. Current pruning approaches often fail to address two inherent characteristics of MoE systems: 1).intra-layer expert homogeneity where experts within the same MoE layer exhibit functional redundancy, and 2). inter-layer similarity patterns where deeper layers tend to contain progressively more homogeneous experts. To tackle these issues, we propose Cluster-driven Expert Pruning (C-Prune), a novel two-stage framework for adaptive task-specific compression of MoE LLMs. C-Prune operates through layer-wise expert clustering, which groups functionally similar experts within each MoE layer using parameter similarity metrics, followed by global cluster pruning, which eliminates redundant clusters across all layers through a unified importance scoring mechanism that accounts for cross-layer homogeneity. We validate C-Prune through extensive experiments on multiple MoE models and benchmarks. The results demonstrate that C-Prune effectively reduces model size while outperforming existing MoE pruning methods.</p></details> |  |

To address this gap, we introduce KEDiT, an efficient method for fine-tuning LLMs for knowledge-grounded dialogue generation. KEDiT operates in two main phases: first, it employs an information bottleneck to compress retrieved knowledge into learnable parameters, retaining essential information while minimizing computational overhead. Second, a lightweight knowledge-aware adapter integrates these compressed knowledge vectors into the LLM during fine-tuning, updating less than 2\% of the model parameters. The experimental results on the Wizard of Wikipedia and a newly constructed PubMed-Dialog dataset demonstrate that KEDiT excels in generating contextually relevant and informative responses, outperforming competitive baselines in automatic, LLM-based, and human evaluations. This approach effectively combines the strengths of pretrained LLMs with the adaptability needed for incorporating dynamic knowledge, presenting a scalable solution for fields such as medicine.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at TACL; pre-MIT Press publication version.

However, they also exhibit inherent limitations, such as outdated knowledge and susceptibility to hallucinations. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising paradigm to address these issues, but it also introduces new vulnerabilities. Recent efforts have focused on the security of RAG-based LLMs, yet existing attack methods face three critical challenges: (1) their effectiveness declines sharply when only a limited number of poisoned texts can be injected into the knowledge database, (2) they lack sufficient stealth, as the attacks are often detectable by anomaly detection systems, which compromises their effectiveness, and (3) they rely on heuristic approaches to generate poisoned texts, lacking formal optimization frameworks and theoretic guarantees, which limits their effectiveness and applicability. To address these issues, we propose coordinated Prompt-RAG attack (PR-attack), a novel optimization-driven attack that introduces a small number of poisoned texts into the knowledge database while embedding a backdoor trigger within the prompt. When activated, the trigger causes the LLM to generate pre-designed responses to targeted queries, while maintaining normal behavior in other contexts. This ensures both high effectiveness and stealth. We formulate the attack generation process as a bilevel optimization problem leveraging a principled optimization framework to develop optimal poisoned texts and triggers. Extensive experiments across diverse LLMs and datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of PR-Attack, achieving a high attack success rate even with a limited number of poisoned texts and significantly improved stealth compared to existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at SIGIR 2025</p></details> |

However, processing long sequences of visual tokens extracted from visual backbones poses a challenge for deployment in real-time applications. To address this issue, we introduce FOLDER, a simple yet effective plug-and-play module designed to reduce the length of the visual token sequence, mitigating both computational and memory demands during training and inference. Through a comprehensive analysis of the token reduction process, we analyze the information loss introduced by different reduction strategies and develop FOLDER to preserve key information while removing visual redundancy. We showcase the effectiveness of FOLDER by integrating it into the visual backbone of several MLLMs, significantly accelerating the inference phase. Furthermore, we evaluate its utility as a training accelerator or even performance booster for MLLMs. In both contexts, FOLDER achieves comparable or even better performance than the original models, while dramatically reducing complexity by removing up to 70% of visual tokens.</p></details> |  |

To address these challenges, we propose S2R-HDR, the first large-scale high-quality synthetic dataset for HDR fusion, with 24,000 HDR samples. Using Unreal Engine 5, we design a diverse set of realistic HDR scenes that encompass various dynamic elements, motion types, high dynamic range scenes, and lighting. Additionally, we develop an efficient rendering pipeline to generate realistic HDR images. To further mitigate the domain gap between synthetic and real-world data, we introduce S2R-Adapter, a domain adaptation designed to bridge this gap and enhance the generalization ability of models. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art HDR reconstruction performance.

In this paper we work on this topic, focusing on structured and semi-structured anonymized data. We not only develop a direct LLM pipeline, but also compare various methodologies and conduct an in-depth analysis. We identified and examined seventeen common temporal reasoning tasks in natural language, focusing on their algorithmic components. To assess LLM performance, we created the \textit{Reasoning and Answering Temporal Ability} dataset (RATA), featuring semi-structured anonymized data to ensure reliance on reasoning rather than on prior knowledge. We compared several methodologies, involving SoTA techniques such as Tree-of-Thought, self-reflexion and code execution, tuned specifically for this scenario. Our results suggest that achieving scalable and reliable solutions requires more than just standalone LLMs, highlighting the need for integrated approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 7 tables, 5 figures</p></details> |

This compromises their reliability, especially in domains requiring factual accuracy. We propose a neuro-symbolic approach integrating symbolic ontological reasoning and machine learning methods to enhance the consistency and reliability of LLM outputs. Our workflow utilizes OWL ontologies, a symbolic reasoner (e.g., HermiT) for consistency checking, and a lightweight machine learning model (logistic regression) for mapping natural language statements into logical forms compatible with the ontology. When inconsistencies between LLM outputs and the ontology are detected, the system generates explanatory feedback to guide the LLM towards a corrected, logically coherent response in an iterative refinement loop. We present a working Python prototype demonstrating this pipeline. Experimental results in a defined domain suggest significant improvements in semantic coherence and factual accuracy of LLM outputs, showcasing the potential of combining LLM fluency with the rigor of formal semantics.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 1 figure, includes prototype implementation and experimental evaluation.

Current RAG methodologies often modify the internal architecture of pre-trained language models (PLMs) or rely on textifying knowledge graphs (KGs), which is inefficient in terms of token usage. This paper introduces ConceptFormer, a new approach to augment LLMs with structured knowledge from KGs, such as Wikidata, without altering their internal structure or relying on textual input of KGs. ConceptFormer operates in the LLM embedding vector space, creating and injecting \emph{concept vectors} that encapsulate the information of the KG nodes directly. Trained in conjunction with a frozen LLM, ConceptFormer generates a comprehensive lookup table that maps KG nodes to their respective concept vectors. The approach aims to enhance the factual recall capabilities of LLMs by enabling them to process these concept vectors natively, thus enriching them with structured world knowledge in an efficient and scalable manner. Our experiments demonstrate that the addition of concept vectors to GPT-2 0.1B substantially increases its factual recall ability (Hit@10) by up to 272\% when tested on sentences from Wikipedia and up to 348\% on synthetically generated sentences. Even injecting only a single concept vector into the prompt increases factual recall ability (Hit@10) by up to 213\% on Wikipedia sentences, significantly outperforming RAG with graph textification while consuming 130x fewer input tokens.</p></details> |  |
| **[VLM-R1: A Stable and Generalizable R1-style Large Vision-Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07615v1)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently DeepSeek R1 has shown that reinforcement learning (RL) can substantially improve the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) through a simple yet effective design. The core of R1 lies in its rule-based reward formulation, which leverages tasks with deterministic ground-truth answers to enable precise and stable reward computation. In the visual domain, we similarly observe that a wide range of visual understanding tasks are inherently equipped with well-defined ground-truth annotations. This property makes them naturally compatible with rule-based reward mechanisms. Motivated by this observation, we investigate the extension of R1-style reinforcement learning to Vision-Language Models (VLMs), aiming to enhance their visual reasoning capabilities. To this end, we develop VLM-R1, a dedicated framework designed to harness RL for improving VLMs' performance on general vision-language tasks. Using this framework, we further explore the feasibility of applying RL to visual domain. Experimental results indicate that the RL-based model not only delivers competitive performance on visual understanding tasks but also surpasses Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) in generalization ability. Furthermore, we conduct comprehensive ablation studies that uncover a series of noteworthy insights, including the presence of reward hacking in object detection, the emergence of the "OD aha moment", the impact of training data quality, and the scaling behavior of RL across different model sizes. Through these analyses, we aim to deepen the understanding of how reinforcement learning enhances the capabilities of vision-language models, and we hope our findings and open-source contributions will support continued progress in the vision-language RL community.

Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have opened up new possibilities for generating human-like actions including querying, browsing, and clicking. In this work, we explore the integration of human-like thinking into search simulations by leveraging LLMs to simulate users' hidden cognitive processes. Specifically, given a search task and context, we prompt LLMs to first think like a human before executing the corresponding action. As existing search datasets do not include users' thought processes, we conducted a user study to collect a new dataset enriched with users' explicit thinking. We investigate the impact of incorporating such human-like thinking on simulation performance and apply supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to teach LLMs to emulate both human thinking and actions. Our experiments span two dimensions in leveraging LLMs for user simulation: (1) with or without explicit thinking, and (2) with or without fine-tuning on the thinking-augmented dataset. The results demonstrate the feasibility and potential of incorporating human-like thinking in user simulations, though performance improvements on some metrics remain modest. We believe this exploration provides new avenues and inspirations for advancing user behavior modeling in search simulations.</p></details> |  |

We propose Emotion Interpretation (EI), focusing on causal factors-whether explicit (e.g., observable objects, interpersonal interactions) or implicit (e.g., cultural context, off-screen events)-that drive emotional responses. Unlike traditional emotion recognition, EI tasks require reasoning about triggers instead of mere labeling. To facilitate EI research, we present EIBench, a large-scale benchmark encompassing 1,615 basic EI samples and 50 complex EI samples featuring multifaceted emotions. Each instance demands rationale-based explanations rather than straightforward categorization. We further propose a Coarse-to-Fine Self-Ask (CFSA) annotation pipeline, which guides Vision-Language Models (VLLMs) through iterative question-answer rounds to yield high-quality labels at scale. Extensive evaluations on open-source and proprietary large language models under four experimental settings reveal consistent performance gaps-especially for more intricate scenarios-underscoring EI's potential to enrich empathetic, context-aware AI applications.

In this paper, we present a replicable, supervised method that leverages large language models for assisting the linguist in grammatical annotation through prompt engineering, training, and evaluation. We introduce a methodological pipeline applied to the case study of formal variation in the English evaluative verb construction 'consider X (as) (to be) Y', based on the large language model Claude 3.5 Sonnet and corpus data from Davies' NOW and EnTenTen21 (SketchEngine). Overall, we reach a model accuracy of over 90% on our held-out test samples with only a small amount of training data, validating the method for the annotation of very large quantities of tokens of the construction in the future. We discuss the generalisability of our results for a wider range of case studies of grammatical constructions and grammatical variation and change, underlining the value of AI copilots as tools for future linguistic research, notwithstanding some important caveats.</p></details> |  |

Although these devices improve efficiency and promise additional comfort, they also introduce new security challenges. Common and easy-to-explore vulnerabilities make IoT devices prime targets for malicious actors. Upcoming mandatory security certifications offer a promising way to mitigate these risks by enforcing best practices and providing transparency. Regulatory bodies are developing IoT security frameworks, but a universal standard for large-scale systematic security assessment is lacking. Existing manual testing approaches are expensive, limiting their efficacy in the diverse and rapidly evolving IoT domain.

We explore the following methods: the TBRayMarcher Plugin, the Niagara Fluids Plugin , and various approaches using Sparse Volume Textures (SVT), with a particular focus on Heterogeneous Volumes (HV). We found the HV approach to be the most promising. The biggest challenge we encountered with other approaches was the need to chunk datasets so that each fits into volume textures smaller than one gigavoxel. While this enables display of the entire dataset at reasonable frame rates, it introduces noticeable artifacts at chunk borders due to incorrect lighting, as each chunk lacks information about its neighbors. After addressing some (signed) int32 overflows in the Engine's SVT-related source code by converting them to to (unsigned) uint32 or int64, the SVT-based HV system allows us to render sparse datasets up to 32k x 32k x 16k voxels, provided the compressed tile data (including MIP data and padding for correct interpolation) does not exceed 4 gigavoxels. In the future, we intend to extend the existing SVT streaming functionality to support out-of-core rendering, in order to eventually overcome VRAM limitations, graphics API constraints, and the performance issues associated with 64-bit arithmetic in GPU shaders.</p></details> | Technical Report |

In contrast, the human brain, with approximately 86 billion neurons, is much more energy-efficient than LLMs with similar parameters. Inspired by this, we redesign 7$\sim$70 billion parameter LLMs using bio-plausible spiking mechanisms, emulating the efficient behavior of the human brain. We propose the first spiking large language model, SpikeLLM. Coupled with the proposed model, two essential approaches are proposed to improve spike training efficiency: Generalized Integrate-and-Fire (GIF) neurons to compress spike length from $T$ to $\frac{T}{L} \log_2 L$ bits, and an Optimal Brain Spiking framework to divide outlier channels and allocate different $T$ for GIF neurons, which further compresses spike length to approximate $log_2T$ bits. The necessity of spike-driven LLM is proved by comparison with quantized LLMs with similar operations. In the OmniQuant pipeline, SpikeLLM reduces 11.01% WikiText2 perplexity and improves 2.55% accuracy of common scene reasoning on a LLAMA-7B W4A4 model. In the GPTQ pipeline, SpikeLLM achieves direct additive in linear layers, significantly exceeding PB-LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Cognitive Debiasing Large Language Models for Decision-Making](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04141v2)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown potential in supporting decision-making applications, particularly as personal conversational assistants in the financial, healthcare, and legal domains. While prompt engineering strategies have enhanced the capabilities of LLMs in decision-making, cognitive biases inherent to LLMs present significant challenges. Cognitive biases are systematic patterns of deviation from norms or rationality in decision-making that can lead to the production of inaccurate outputs. Existing cognitive bias mitigation strategies assume that input prompts contain (exactly) one type of cognitive bias and therefore fail to perform well in realistic settings where there maybe any number of biases. To fill this gap, we propose a cognitive debiasing approach, called self-debiasing, that enhances the reliability of LLMs by iteratively refining prompts. Our method follows three sequential steps -- bias determination, bias analysis, and cognitive debiasing -- to iteratively mitigate potential cognitive biases in prompts. Experimental results on finance, healthcare, and legal decision-making tasks, using both closed-source and open-source LLMs, demonstrate that the proposed self-debiasing method outperforms both advanced prompt engineering methods and existing cognitive debiasing techniques in average accuracy under no-bias, single-bias, and multi-bias settings.</p></details> |  |

A joint power and channel allocation scheme is proposed for the terrestrial system, under the constraint of leakage interference to satellite mobile terminals (MTs). The proposed scheme provides near-optimal performance according to both theoretical analysis and simulation results.</p></details> |  |

Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have demonstrated promise in this domain by extracting interpretable and monosemantic features. However, prior works primarily focus on feature extraction from a single layer, failing to effectively capture activations that span multiple layers. In this paper, we introduce Route Sparse Autoencoder (RouteSAE), a new framework that integrates a routing mechanism with a shared SAE to efficiently extract features from multiple layers. It dynamically assigns weights to activations from different layers, incurring minimal parameter overhead while achieving high interpretability and flexibility for targeted feature manipulation. We evaluate RouteSAE through extensive experiments on Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct. Specifically, under the same sparsity constraint of 64, RouteSAE extracts 22.5% more features than baseline SAEs while achieving a 22.3% higher interpretability score. These results underscore the potential of RouteSAE as a scalable and effective method for LLM interpretability, with applications in feature discovery and model intervention.

Despite their theoretical promise, designing quantum feature maps that offer practical advantages over classical methods remains an open challenge. In this work, we propose an agentic system that autonomously generates, evaluates, and refines quantum feature maps using large language models. The system consists of five component: Generation, Storage, Validation, Evaluation, and Review. Using these components, it iteratively improves quantum feature maps. Experiments on the MNIST dataset show that it can successfully discover and refine feature maps without human intervention. The best feature map generated outperforms existing quantum baselines and achieves competitive accuracy compared to classical kernels across MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and CIFAR-10. Our approach provides a framework for exploring dataset-adaptive quantum features and highlights the potential of LLM-driven automation in quantum algorithm design.</p></details> | 39 pages, 6 figures |

Reasoning performance can be improved by suitably combining multiple LLM responses, generated either in parallel in a single query, or via sequential interactions with LLMs throughout the reasoning process. Existing strategies for combination, such as self-consistency and progressive-hint-prompting, make inefficient usage of the LLM responses. We present Refined Answer Distributions, a novel and principled algorithmic framework to enhance the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Our approach can be viewed as an iterative sampling strategy for forming a Monte Carlo approximation of an underlying distribution of answers, with the goal of identifying the mode -- the most likely answer. Empirical evaluation on several reasoning benchmarks demonstrates the superiority of the proposed approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[TALE: A Tool-Augmented Framework for Reference-Free Evaluation of Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07385v1)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As Large Language Models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into real-world, autonomous applications, relying on static, pre-annotated references for evaluation poses significant challenges in cost, scalability, and completeness. We propose Tool-Augmented LLM Evaluation (TALE), a framework to assess LLM outputs without predetermined ground-truth answers. Unlike conventional metrics that compare to fixed references or depend solely on LLM-as-a-judge knowledge, TALE employs an agent with tool-access capabilities that actively retrieves and synthesizes external evidence. It iteratively generates web queries, collects information, summarizes findings, and refines subsequent searches through reflection. By shifting away from static references, TALE aligns with free-form question-answering tasks common in real-world scenarios. Experimental results on multiple free-form QA benchmarks show that TALE not only outperforms standard reference-based metrics for measuring response accuracy but also achieves substantial to near-perfect agreement with human evaluations. TALE enhances the reliability of LLM evaluations in real-world, dynamic scenarios without relying on static references.</p></details> |  |
| **[PROPEL: Supervised and Reinforcement Learning for Large-Scale Supply Chain Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07383v1)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper considers how to fuse Machine Learning (ML) and optimization to solve large-scale Supply Chain Planning (SCP) optimization problems. These problems can be formulated as MIP models which feature both integer (non-binary) and continuous variables, as well as flow balance and capacity constraints. This raises fundamental challenges for existing integrations of ML and optimization that have focused on binary MIPs and graph problems. To address these, the paper proposes PROPEL, a new framework that combines optimization with both supervised and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to reduce the size of search space significantly. PROPEL uses supervised learning, not to predict the values of all integer variables, but to identify the variables that are fixed to zero in the optimal solution, leveraging the structure of SCP applications. PROPEL includes a DRL component that selects which fixed-at-zero variables must be relaxed to improve solution quality when the supervised learning step does not produce a solution with the desired optimality tolerance. PROPEL has been applied to industrial supply chain planning optimizations with millions of variables. The computational results show dramatic improvements in solution times and quality, including a 60% reduction in primal integral and an 88% primal gap reduction, and improvement factors of up to 13.57 and 15.92, respectively.</p></details> |  |

Their strong capability to generate and reason over intermediate thoughts has also led to arguments that they may no longer require extensive prompt engineering or optimization to interpret human instructions and produce accurate outputs. In this work, we aim to systematically study this open question, using the structured task of event extraction for a case study. We experimented with two LRMs (DeepSeek-R1 and o1) and two general-purpose Large Language Models (LLMs) (GPT-4o and GPT-4.5), when they were used as task models or prompt optimizers. Our results show that on tasks as complicated as event extraction, LRMs as task models still benefit from prompt optimization, and that using LRMs as prompt optimizers yields more effective prompts. Finally, we provide an error analysis of common errors made by LRMs and highlight the stability and consistency of LRMs in refining task instructions and event guidelines.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Unified Framework for Large-Scale Classification: Error Rate Control and Optimality](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07321v1)** | 2025-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Classification is a fundamental task in supervised learning, while achieving valid misclassification rate control remains challenging due to possibly the limited predictive capability of the classifiers or the intrinsic complexity of the classification task. In this article, we address large-scale multi-class classification problems with general error rate guarantees to enhance algorithmic trustworthiness. To this end, we first introduce a notion of group-wise classification, which unifies the common class-wise and overall classifications as special cases. We then develop a unified algorithmic framework for the general group-wise classification that consists of three steps: Pre-classification, Selective $p$-value construction, and large-scale Post-classification decisions (PSP). Theoretically, PSP is distribution-free and provides valid finite-sample guarantees for controlling general group-wise false decision rates at target levels. To show the power of PSP, we demonstrate that the step of post-classification decisions never degrades the power of pre-classification, provided that pre-classification has been sufficiently powerful to meet the target error levels. Additionally, we further establish general power optimality theories for PSP from both non-asymptotic and asymptotic perspectives. Numerical results in both simulations and real data analysis validate the performance of the proposed PSP approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[RAISE: Reinforenced Adaptive Instruction Selection For Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07282v1)** | 2025-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the instruction fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs), it has become a consensus that a few high-quality instructions are superior to a large number of low-quality instructions. At present, many instruction selection methods have been proposed, but most of these methods select instruction based on heuristic quality metrics, and only consider data selection before training. These designs lead to insufficient optimization of instruction fine-tuning, and fixed heuristic indicators are often difficult to optimize for specific tasks. So we designed a dynamic, task-objective-driven instruction selection framework RAISE(Reinforenced Adaptive Instruction SElection), which incorporates the entire instruction fine-tuning process into optimization, selecting instruction at each step based on the expected impact of instruction on model performance improvement. Our approach is well interpretable and has strong task-specific optimization capabilities. By modeling dynamic instruction selection as a sequential decision-making process, we use RL to train our selection strategy. Extensive experiments and result analysis prove the superiority of our method compared with other instruction selection methods. Notably, RAISE achieves superior performance by updating only 1\% of the training steps compared to full-data training, demonstrating its efficiency and effectiveness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Comparative Performance Evaluation of Large Language Models for Extracting Molecular Interactions and Pathway Knowledge](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08813v3)** | 2025-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Background Identification of the interactions and regulatory relations between biomolecules play pivotal roles in understanding complex biological systems and the mechanisms underlying diverse biological functions. However, the collection of such molecular interactions has heavily relied on expert curation in the past, making it labor-intensive and time-consuming. To mitigate these challenges, we propose leveraging the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to automate genome-scale extraction of this crucial knowledge. Results In this study, we investigate the efficacy of various LLMs in addressing biological tasks, such as the recognition of protein interactions, identification of genes linked to pathways affected by low-dose radiation, and the delineation of gene regulatory relationships. Overall, the larger models exhibited superior performance, indicating their potential for specific tasks that involve the extraction of complex interactions among genes and proteins. Although these models possessed detailed information for distinct gene and protein groups, they faced challenges in identifying groups with diverse functions and in recognizing highly correlated gene regulatory relationships. Conclusions By conducting a comprehensive assessment of the state-of-the-art models using well-established molecular interaction and pathway databases, our study reveals that LLMs can identify genes/proteins associated with pathways of interest and predict their interactions to a certain extent. Furthermore, these models can provide important insights, marking a noteworthy stride toward advancing our understanding of biological systems through AI-assisted knowledge discovery.</p></details> |  |
| **[Acceptance Test Generation with Large Language Models: An Industrial Case Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07244v1)** | 2025-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model (LLM)-powered assistants are increasingly used for generating program code and unit tests, but their application in acceptance testing remains underexplored. To help address this gap, this paper explores the use of LLMs for generating executable acceptance tests for web applications through a two-step process: (i) generating acceptance test scenarios in natural language (in Gherkin) from user stories, and (ii) converting these scenarios into executable test scripts (in Cypress), knowing the HTML code of the pages under test. This two-step approach supports acceptance test-driven development, enhances tester control, and improves test quality. The two steps were implemented in the AutoUAT and Test Flow tools, respectively, powered by GPT-4 Turbo, and integrated into a partner company's workflow and evaluated on real-world projects. The users found the acceptance test scenarios generated by AutoUAT helpful 95% of the time, even revealing previously overlooked cases. Regarding Test Flow, 92% of the acceptance test cases generated by Test Flow were considered helpful: 60% were usable as generated, 8% required minor fixes, and 24% needed to be regenerated with additional inputs; the remaining 8% were discarded due to major issues. These results suggest that LLMs can,in fact, help improve the acceptance test process with appropriate tooling and supervision.</p></details> |  |
| **[How Accurately Do Large Language Models Understand Code?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04372v2)** | 2025-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used in post-development tasks such as code repair and testing. A key factor in these tasks' success is the model's deep understanding of code. However, the extent to which LLMs truly understand code remains largely unevaluated. Quantifying code comprehension is challenging due to its abstract nature and the lack of a standardized metric. Previously, this was assessed through developer surveys, which are not feasible for evaluating LLMs. Existing LLM benchmarks focus primarily on code generation, fundamentally different from code comprehension. Additionally, fixed benchmarks quickly become obsolete as they become part of the training data. This paper presents the first large-scale empirical investigation into LLMs' ability to understand code. Inspired by mutation testing, we use an LLM's fault-finding ability as a proxy for its deep code understanding. This approach is based on the insight that a model capable of identifying subtle functional discrepancies must understand the code well. We inject faults in real-world programs and ask the LLM to localize them, ensuring the specifications suffice for fault localization. Next, we apply semantic-preserving code mutations (SPMs) to the faulty programs and test whether the LLMs still locate the faults, verifying their confidence in code understanding. We evaluate nine popular LLMs on 600,010 debugging tasks from 670 Java and 637 Python programs. We find that LLMs lose the ability to debug the same bug in 78% of faulty programs when SPMs are applied, indicating a shallow understanding of code and reliance on features irrelevant to semantics. We also find that LLMs understand code earlier in the program better than later. This suggests that LLMs' code comprehension remains tied to lexical and syntactic features due to tokenization designed for natural languages, which overlooks code semantics.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is currently Under Review.

Traditional algorithms like A* and its variants are capable of ensuring path validity but suffer from significant computational and memory inefficiencies as the state space grows. Conversely, large language models (LLMs) excel in broader environmental analysis through contextual understanding, providing global insights into environments. However, they fall short in detailed spatial and temporal reasoning, often leading to invalid or inefficient routes. In this work, we propose LLM-A*, an new LLM based route planning method that synergistically combines the precise pathfinding capabilities of A* with the global reasoning capability of LLMs. This hybrid approach aims to enhance pathfinding efficiency in terms of time and space complexity while maintaining the integrity of path validity, especially in large-scale scenarios. By integrating the strengths of both methodologies, LLM-A* addresses the computational and memory limitations of conventional algorithms without compromising on the validity required for effective pathfinding.</p></details> | <details><summary>Findi...</summary><p>Findings of the Association for Computational Linguistics: EMNLP 2024</p></details> |

Multiple-choice question answering (MCQA) is widely used to assess the understanding capability of LMMs, but it does not guarantee that LMMs truly comprehend the answer. UPD assesses the LMM's ability to withhold answers when encountering unsolvable problems of MCQA, verifying whether the model truly understands the answer. UPD encompasses three problems: Absent Answer Detection (AAD), Incompatible Answer Set Detection (IASD), and Incompatible Visual Question Detection (IVQD), covering unsolvable cases like answer-lacking or incompatible choices and image-question mismatches. For the evaluation, we introduce the MM-UPD Bench, a benchmark for assessing performance across various ability dimensions. Our experiments reveal that even most LMMs, which demonstrate adequate performance on existing benchmarks, struggle significantly with MM-UPD, underscoring a novel aspect of trustworthiness that current benchmarks have overlooked. A detailed analysis shows that LMMs have different bottlenecks and chain-of-thought and self-reflection improved performance for LMMs with the bottleneck in their LLM capability. We hope our insights will enhance the broader understanding and development of more reliable LMMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/AtsuMiyai/UPD</p></details> |

We target the computations of Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) transfer functions for large-scale discretizations of problems with continuous spectral measures, such as linear time-invariant (LTI) PDEs on unbounded domains. Traditional Krylov methods, such as the Lanczos or CG algorithm, are known to be optimal for the computation of $(A+sI)^{-1}B$ with real positive $s$, resulting in an adaptation to the distinctively discrete and nonuniform spectra. However, the adaptation is damped for matrices with dense spectra. It was demonstrated in [Zimmerling, Druskin, Simoncini, Journal of Scientific Computing 103(1), 5 (2025)] that averaging Gau{\ss} and Gau\ss -Radau quadratures computed using the block-Lanczos method significantly reduces approximation errors for such problems. Here, we introduce an adaptive Kre\u{i}n-Nudelman extension to the (block) Lanczos recursions, allowing further acceleration at negligible $o(n)$ cost. Similar to the Gau\ss -Radau quadrature, a low-rank modification is applied to the (block) Lanczos matrix. However, unlike the Gau\ss -Radau quadrature, this modification depends on $\sqrt{s}$ and can be considered in the framework of the Hermite-Pad\'e approximants, which are known to be efficient for problems with branch-cuts, that can be good approximations to dense spectral intervals. Numerical results for large-scale discretizations of heat-diffusion and quasi-magnetostatic Maxwell's operators in unbounded domains confirm the efficiency of the proposed approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>Block...</summary><p>Block Lanczos, Quadrature, Transfer function, Kre\u{i}n-Nudelman, Hermite-Pad\'e</p></details> |

Understanding how to optimally leverage these inference paradigms is critical for advancing LLMs' reasoning capabilities. This paper adopts an exploratory approach by introducing a controlled evaluation environment for analogical reasoning -- a fundamental cognitive task -- that is systematically parameterized across three dimensions: modality (textual, visual, symbolic), difficulty (easy, medium, hard), and task format (multiple-choice or free-text generation). We analyze the comparative dynamics of inductive, abductive, and deductive inference pipelines across these dimensions, and demonstrate that our findings generalize to broader in-context learning tasks. Additionally, we investigate advanced paradigms such as hypothesis selection, verification, and refinement, revealing their potential to scale up logical inference in LLM reasoning. This exploratory study provides a foundation for future research in enhancing LLM reasoning through systematic logical inference strategies.

Although large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated considerable potential in automated code repair, their ability to comprehend and effectively leverage diverse types of feedback remains insufficiently understood. To bridge this gap, we introduce FeedbackEval, a systematic benchmark for evaluating LLMs' feedback comprehension and performance in code repair tasks. We conduct a comprehensive empirical study on five state-of-the-art LLMs, including GPT-4o, Claude-3.5, Gemini-1.5, GLM-4, and Qwen2.5, to evaluate their behavior under both single-iteration and iterative code repair settings. Our results show that structured feedback, particularly in the form of test feedback, leads to the highest repair success rates, while unstructured feedback proves significantly less effective. Iterative feedback further enhances repair performance, though the marginal benefit diminishes after two or three rounds. Moreover, prompt structure is shown to be critical: incorporating docstrings, contextual information, and explicit guidelines substantially improves outcomes, whereas persona-based, chain-of-thought, and few-shot prompting strategies offer limited benefits in single-iteration scenarios. This work introduces a robust benchmark and delivers practical insights to advance the understanding and development of feedback-driven code repair using LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Saliency-driven Dynamic Token Pruning for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04514v2)** | 2025-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the recent success of large language models (LLMs), LLMs are particularly challenging in long-sequence inference scenarios due to the quadratic computational complexity of the attention mechanism. Inspired by the interpretability theory of feature attribution in neural network models, we observe that not all tokens have the same contribution. Based on this observation, we propose a novel token pruning framework, namely Saliency-driven Dynamic Token Pruning (SDTP), to gradually and dynamically prune redundant tokens based on the input context. Specifically, a lightweight saliency-driven prediction module is designed to estimate the importance score of each token with its hidden state, which is added to different layers of the LLM to hierarchically prune redundant tokens. Furthermore, a ranking-based optimization strategy is proposed to minimize the ranking divergence of the saliency score and the predicted importance score. Extensive experiments have shown that our framework is generalizable to various models and datasets. By hierarchically pruning 65\% of the input tokens, our method greatly reduces 33\% $\sim$ 47\% FLOPs and achieves speedup up to 1.75$\times$ during inference, while maintaining comparable performance. We further demonstrate that SDTP can be combined with KV cache compression method for further compression.</p></details> |  |

With approximately 20,000 images, the S-EO dataset establishes a new public resource for shadow detection in remote sensing imagery and its applications to 3D reconstruction. To demonstrate the dataset's impact, we train and evaluate a shadow detector, showcasing its ability to generalize, even to aerial images. Finally, we extend EO-NeRF - a state-of-the-art NeRF approach for satellite imagery - to leverage our shadow predictions for improved 3D reconstructions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Earthvision 2025 (CVPR Workshop)</p></details> |

In this paper, we instead propose and study a more challenging type of retrieval task, called hidden rationale retrieval, in which query and document are not similar but can be inferred by reasoning chains, logic relationships, or empirical experiences. To address such problems, an instruction-tuned Large language model (LLM) with a cross-encoder architecture could be a reasonable choice. To further strengthen pioneering LLM-based retrievers, we design a special instruction that transforms the retrieval task into a generative task by prompting LLM to answer a binary-choice question. The model can be fine-tuned with direct preference optimization (DPO). The framework is also optimized for computational efficiency with no performance degradation. We name this retrieval framework by RaHoRe and verify its zero-shot and fine-tuned performance superiority on Emotional Support Conversation (ESC), compared with previous retrieval works. Our study suggests the potential to employ LLM as a foundation for a wider scope of retrieval tasks.

The prowess of LLMs is underpinned by their substantial model size, extensive and diverse datasets, and the vast computational power harnessed during training, all of which contribute to the emergent abilities of LLMs (e.g., in-context learning) that are not present in small models. Within this context, the mixture of experts (MoE) has emerged as an effective method for substantially scaling up model capacity with minimal computation overhead, gaining significant attention from academia and industry. Despite its growing prevalence, there lacks a systematic and comprehensive review of the literature on MoE. This survey seeks to bridge that gap, serving as an essential resource for researchers delving into the intricacies of MoE.

However, the memory overhead of storing all experts remains a major limitation, especially in large-scale MoE models such as DeepSeek-R1 (671B). In this study, we investigate domain specialization and expert redundancy in large-scale MoE models and uncover a consistent behavior we term few-shot expert localization, with only a few demonstrations, the model consistently activates a sparse and stable subset of experts. Building on this observation, we propose a simple yet effective pruning framework, EASY-EP, that leverages a few domain-specific demonstrations to identify and retain only the most relevant experts. EASY-EP comprises two key components: output-aware expert importance assessment and expert-level token contribution estimation. The former evaluates the importance of each expert for the current token by considering the gating scores and magnitudes of the outputs of activated experts, while the latter assesses the contribution of tokens based on representation similarities after and before routed experts. Experiments show that our method can achieve comparable performances and $2.99\times$ throughput under the same memory budget with full DeepSeek-R1 with only half the experts.

A central factor in their success lies in the application of long chain-of-thought (Long CoT) characteristics, which enhance reasoning abilities and enable the solution of intricate problems. However, despite these developments, a comprehensive survey on Long CoT is still lacking, limiting our understanding of its distinctions from traditional short chain-of-thought (Short CoT) and complicating ongoing debates on issues like "overthinking" and "test-time scaling."

While conventional manual inspections suffer from subjectivity, existing machine learning-based methods are constrained by their reliance on large and high-quality labeled datasets, which require significant resources and limit adaptability across varied road conditions. The revolutionary advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) present significant potential for overcoming these challenges. In this study, we propose an innovative automated zero-shot learning approach that leverages the image recognition and natural language understanding capabilities of LLMs to assess road conditions effectively. Multiple LLM-based assessment models were developed, employing prompt engineering strategies aligned with the Pavement Surface Condition Index (PSCI) standards. These models' accuracy and reliability were evaluated against official PSCI results, with an optimized model ultimately selected. Extensive tests benchmarked the optimized model against evaluations from various levels experts using Google Street View road images. The results reveal that the LLM-based approach can effectively assess road conditions, with the optimized model -employing comprehensive and structured prompt engineering strategies -outperforming simpler configurations by achieving high accuracy and consistency, even surpassing expert evaluations. Moreover, successfully applying the optimized model to Google Street View images demonstrates its potential for future city-scale deployments. These findings highlight the transformative potential of LLMs in automating road damage evaluations and underscore the pivotal role of detailed prompt engineering in achieving reliable assessments.</p></details> |  |

This heterogeneity complicates traditional image processing techniques, resulting in critical errors in tasks such as image registration and brain parcellation. To address these challenges, the AIMS-TBI Segmentation Challenge 2024 aims to advance innovative segmentation algorithms specifically designed for T1-weighted MRI data, the most widely utilized imaging modality in clinical practice. Our proposed solution leverages a large-scale multi-dataset supervised pretraining approach inspired by the MultiTalent method. We train a Resenc L network on a comprehensive collection of datasets covering various anatomical and pathological structures, which equips the model with a robust understanding of brain anatomy and pathology. Following this, the model is fine-tuned on msTBI-specific data to optimize its performance for the unique characteristics of T1-weighted MRI scans and outperforms the baseline without pretraining up to 2 Dice points.</p></details> |  |

However, its large number of parameters presents significant challenges for the deployment. So, compressing LLMs to low bits can enable to deploy on resource-constrained devices. To address this problem, we propose gradient-aware weight quantization (GWQ), the first quantization approach for low-bit weight quantization that leverages gradients to localize outliers, requiring only a minimal amount of calibration data for outlier detection. GWQ retains the top 1\% outliers preferentially at FP16 precision, while the remaining non-outlier weights are stored in a low-bit. We widely evaluate GWQ on different task include language modeling, grounding detection, massive multitask language understanding and vision-language question and answering. Results show that models quantified by GWQ performs better than other quantization method. During quantization process, GWQ only need one calibration set to realize effective quant. Also, GWQ achieves 1.2x inference speedup in comparison to the original model and effectively reduces the inference memory.</p></details> |  |

Current guardrails, which often rely on curated examples or custom classifiers, suffer from high false-positive rates, limited adaptability, and the impracticality of requiring real-world data that is not available in pre-production. In this paper, we introduce a flexible, data-free guardrail development methodology that addresses these challenges. By thoroughly defining the problem space qualitatively and passing this to an LLM to generate diverse prompts, we construct a synthetic dataset to benchmark and train off-topic guardrails that outperform heuristic approaches. Additionally, by framing the task as classifying whether the user prompt is relevant with respect to the system prompt, our guardrails effectively generalize to other misuse categories, including jailbreak and harmful prompts. Lastly, we further contribute to the field by open-sourcing both the synthetic dataset and the off-topic guardrail models, providing valuable resources for developing guardrails in pre-production environments and supporting future research and development in LLM safety.</p></details> | 8 pages, 5 figures |
| **[ClarityEthic: Explainable Moral Judgment Utilizing Contrastive Ethical Insights from Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12848v2)** | 2025-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rise and widespread use of Large Language Models (LLMs), ensuring their safety is crucial to prevent harm to humans and promote ethical behaviors. However, directly assessing value valence (i.e., support or oppose) by leveraging large-scale data training is untrustworthy and inexplainable. We assume that emulating humans to rely on social norms to make moral decisions can help LLMs understand and predict moral judgment. However, capturing human values remains a challenge, as multiple related norms might conflict in specific contexts. Consider norms that are upheld by the majority and promote the well-being of society are more likely to be accepted and widely adopted (e.g., "don't cheat,"). Therefore, it is essential for LLM to identify the appropriate norms for a given scenario before making moral decisions. To this end, we introduce a novel moral judgment approach called \textit{ClarityEthic} that leverages LLMs' reasoning ability and contrastive learning to uncover relevant social norms for human actions from different perspectives and select the most reliable one to enhance judgment accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in moral judgment tasks. Moreover, human evaluations confirm that the generated social norms provide plausible explanations that support the judgments. This suggests that modeling human moral judgment with the emulating humans moral strategy is promising for improving the ethical behaviors of LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>We ha...</summary><p>We have noticed that this version of our experiment and method description isn't quite complete or accurate.

| **[A Neuro-inspired Interpretation of Unlearning in Large Language Models through Sample-level Unlearning Difficulty](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06658v1)** | 2025-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Driven by privacy protection laws and regulations, unlearning in Large Language Models (LLMs) is gaining increasing attention. However, current research often neglects the interpretability of the unlearning process, particularly concerning sample-level unlearning difficulty. Existing studies typically assume a uniform unlearning difficulty across samples. This simplification risks attributing the performance of unlearning algorithms to sample selection rather than the algorithm's design, potentially steering the development of LLM unlearning in the wrong direction. Thus, we investigate the relationship between LLM unlearning and sample characteristics, with a focus on unlearning difficulty. Drawing inspiration from neuroscience, we propose a Memory Removal Difficulty ($\mathrm{MRD}$) metric to quantify sample-level unlearning difficulty. Using $\mathrm{MRD}$, we analyze the characteristics of hard-to-unlearn versus easy-to-unlearn samples. Furthermore, we propose an $\mathrm{MRD}$-based weighted sampling method to optimize existing unlearning algorithms, which prioritizes easily forgettable samples, thereby improving unlearning efficiency and effectiveness. We validate the proposed metric and method using public benchmarks and datasets, with results confirming its effectiveness.</p></details> | 16 pages |
| **[Intent Representation Learning with Large Language Model for Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03307v4)** | 2025-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Intent-based recommender systems have garnered significant attention for uncovering latent fine-grained preferences. Intents, as underlying factors of interactions, are crucial for improving recommendation interpretability. Most methods define intents as learnable parameters updated alongside interactions. However, existing frameworks often overlook textual information (e.g., user reviews, item descriptions), which is crucial for alleviating the sparsity of interaction intents. Exploring these multimodal intents, especially the inherent differences in representation spaces, poses two key challenges: i) How to align multimodal intents and effectively mitigate noise issues; ii) How to extract and match latent key intents across modalities. To tackle these challenges, we propose a model-agnostic framework, Intent Representation Learning with Large Language Model (IRLLRec), which leverages large language models (LLMs) to construct multimodal intents and enhance recommendations. Specifically, IRLLRec employs a dual-tower architecture to learn multimodal intent representations. Next, we propose pairwise and translation alignment to eliminate inter-modal differences and enhance robustness against noisy input features. Finally, to better match textual and interaction-based intents, we employ momentum distillation to perform teacher-student learning on fused intent representations. Empirical evaluations on three datasets show that our IRLLRec framework outperforms baselines.Code available at https://github.com/wangyu0627/IRLLRec.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by SIGIR 2025 Full Paper</p></details> |
| **[PiSSA: Principal Singular Values and Singular Vectors Adaptation of Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02948v4)** | 2025-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To parameter-efficiently fine-tune (PEFT) large language models (LLMs), the low-rank adaptation (LoRA) method approximates the model changes $\Delta W \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$ through the product of two matrices $A \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times r}$ and $B \in \mathbb{R}^{r \times n}$, where $r \ll \min(m, n)$, $A$ is initialized with Gaussian noise, and $B$ with zeros. LoRA freezes the original model $W$ and updates the "Noise & Zero" adapter, which may lead to slow convergence. To overcome this limitation, we introduce Principal Singular values and Singular vectors Adaptation (PiSSA). PiSSA shares the same architecture as LoRA, but initializes the adaptor matrices $A$ and $B$ with the principal components of the original matrix $W$, and put the remaining components into a residual matrix $W^{res} \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$ which is frozen during fine-tuning. Compared to LoRA, PiSSA updates the principal components while freezing the "residual" parts, allowing faster convergence and enhanced performance. Comparative experiments of PiSSA and LoRA across 12 different models, ranging from 184M to 70B, encompassing 5 NLG and 8 NLU tasks, reveal that PiSSA consistently outperforms LoRA under identical experimental setups. On the GSM8K benchmark, Mistral-7B fine-tuned with PiSSA achieves an accuracy of 72.86%, surpassing LoRA's 67.7% by 5.16%. Due to the same architecture, PiSSA is also compatible with quantization to further reduce the memory requirement of fine-tuning. Compared to QLoRA, QPiSSA exhibits smaller quantization errors in the initial stages. Fine-tuning LLaMA-3-70B on GSM8K, QPiSSA attains an accuracy of 86.05%, exceeding the performances of QLoRA at 81.73%. Leveraging a fast SVD technique, PiSSA can be initialized in only a few seconds, presenting a negligible cost for transitioning from LoRA to PiSSA.

During the exploration of MLLM training, we identified Modality Composition Incoherence, a phenomenon that the proportion of a certain modality varies dramatically across different examples. It exacerbates the challenges of addressing mini-batch imbalances, which lead to uneven GPU utilization between Data Parallel (DP) instances and severely degrades the efficiency and scalability of MLLM training, ultimately affecting training speed and hindering further research on MLLMs. To address these challenges, we introduce OrchMLLM, a comprehensive framework designed to mitigate the inefficiencies in MLLM training caused by Modality Composition Incoherence. First, we propose Batch Post-Balancing Dispatcher, a technique that efficiently eliminates mini-batch imbalances in sequential data. Additionally, we integrate MLLM Global Orchestrator into the training framework to orchestrate multimodal data and tackle the issues arising from Modality Composition Incoherence. We evaluate OrchMLLM across various MLLM sizes, demonstrating its efficiency and scalability. Experimental results reveal that OrchMLLM achieves a Model FLOPs Utilization (MFU) of $41.6\%$ when training an 84B MLLM with three modalities on $2560$ H100 GPUs, outperforming Megatron-LM by up to $3.1\times$ in throughput.</p></details> |  |
| **[Using Large Language Models to Develop Requirements Elicitation Skills](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07800v2)** | 2025-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Requirements Elicitation (RE) is a crucial software engineering skill that involves interviewing a client and then devising a software design based on the interview results. Teaching this inherently experiential skill effectively has high cost, such as acquiring an industry partner to interview, or training course staff or other students to play the role of a client. As a result, a typical instructional approach is to provide students with transcripts of real or fictitious interviews to analyze, which exercises the skill of extracting technical requirements but fails to develop the equally important interview skill itself. As an alternative, we propose conditioning a large language model to play the role of the client during a chat-based interview. We perform a between-subjects study (n=120) in which students construct a high-level application design from either an interactive LLM-backed interview session or an existing interview transcript describing the same business processes. We evaluate our approach using both a qualitative survey and quantitative observations about participants' work. We find that both approaches provide sufficient information for participants to construct technically sound solutions and require comparable time on task, but the LLM-based approach is preferred by most participants. Importantly, we observe that LLM-backed interview is seen as both more realistic and more engaging, despite the LLM occasionally providing imprecise or contradictory information. These results, combined with the wide accessibility of LLMs, suggest a new way to practice critical RE skills in a scalable and realistic manner without the overhead of arranging live interviews.</p></details> |  |
| **[Prompting or Fine-tuning? Exploring Large Language Models for Causal Graph Validation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16899v2)** | 2025-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study explores the capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to evaluate causality in causal graphs generated by conventional statistical causal discovery methods-a task traditionally reliant on manual assessment by human subject matter experts. To bridge this gap in causality assessment, LLMs are employed to evaluate the causal relationships by determining whether a causal connection between variable pairs can be inferred from textual context. Our study compares two approaches: (1) prompting-based method for zero-shot and few-shot causal inference and, (2) fine-tuning language models for the causal relation prediction task. While prompt-based LLMs have demonstrated versatility across various NLP tasks, our experiments on biomedical and general-domain datasets show that fine-tuned models consistently outperform them, achieving up to a 20.5-point improvement in F1 score-even when using smaller-parameter language models. These findings provide valuable insights into the strengths and limitations of both approaches for causal graph evaluation.</p></details> |  |
| **[ActiView: Evaluating Active Perception Ability for Multimodal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04659v2)** | 2025-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Active perception, a crucial human capability, involves setting a goal based on the current understanding of the environment and performing actions to achieve that goal. Despite significant efforts in evaluating Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), active perception has been largely overlooked. To address this gap, we propose a novel benchmark named ActiView to evaluate active perception in MLLMs. We focus on a specialized form of Visual Question Answering (VQA) that eases and quantifies the evaluation yet challenging for existing MLLMs. Meanwhile, intermediate reasoning behaviors of models are also discussed. Given an image, we restrict the perceptual field of a model, requiring it to actively zoom or shift its perceptual field based on reasoning to answer the question successfully. We conduct extensive evaluation over 30 models, including proprietary and open-source models, and observe that restricted perceptual fields play a significant role in enabling active perception. Results reveal a significant gap in the active perception capability of MLLMs, indicating that this area deserves more attention. We hope that ActiView could help develop methods for MLLMs to understand multimodal inputs in more natural and holistic ways.</p></details> |  |

However, existing long-context benchmarks primarily focus on unstructured text, neglecting the challenges of long and complex structured tables. To address this gap, we introduce NeedleInATable (NIAT), a novel task that treats each table cell as a "needle" and requires the model to extract the target cell under different queries. Evaluation results of mainstream LLMs on this benchmark show they lack robust long-table comprehension, often relying on superficial correlations or shortcuts for complex table understanding tasks, revealing significant limitations in processing intricate tabular data. To this end, we propose a data synthesis method to enhance models' long-table comprehension capabilities. Experimental results show that our synthesized training data significantly enhances LLMs' performance on the NIAT task, outperforming both long-context LLMs and long-table agent methods. This work advances the evaluation of LLMs' genuine long-structured table comprehension capabilities and paves the way for progress in long-context and table understanding applications.</p></details> | Work in Progress |
| **[Robust Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback for Large Language Models Fine-Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03784v2)** | 2025-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a key technique for aligning the output of large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. To learn the reward function, most existing RLHF algorithms use the Bradley-Terry model, which relies on assumptions about human preferences that may not reflect the complexity and variability of real-world judgments. In this paper, we propose a robust algorithm to enhance the performance of existing approaches under such reward model misspecifications. Theoretically, our algorithm reduces the variance of reward and policy estimators, leading to improved regret bounds. Empirical evaluations on LLM benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed algorithm consistently outperforms existing methods, with 77-81% of responses being favored over baselines on the Anthropic Helpful and Harmless dataset.</p></details> |  |

However, they often struggle to recognize low-resource languages, in particular African languages, which are not well represented in large training corpora. In this paper, we consider how to adapt LLMs to low-resource African languages. We find that combining curated data from African languages with high-quality English educational texts results in a training mix that substantially improves the model's performance on these languages. On the challenging IrokoBench dataset, our models consistently achieve the best performance amongst similarly sized baselines, particularly on knowledge-intensive multiple-choice questions (AfriMMLU). Additionally, on the cross-lingual question answering benchmark AfriQA, our models outperform the base model by over 10%. To better understand the role of English data during training, we translate a subset of 200M tokens into Swahili language and perform an analysis which reveals that the content of these data is primarily responsible for the strong performance. We release our models and data to encourage future research on African languages.</p></details> |  |
| **[Prompt-Enabled Large AI Models for CSI Feedback](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10629v3)** | 2025-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a promising tool for channel state information (CSI) feedback. While recent research primarily focuses on improving feedback accuracy on a specific dataset through novel architectures, the underlying mechanism of AI-based CSI feedback remains unclear. This study explores the mechanism through analyzing performance across diverse datasets, with findings suggesting that superior feedback performance stems from AI models' strong fitting capabilities and their ability to leverage environmental knowledge. Building on these findings, we propose a prompt enabled large AI model (LAM) for CSI feedback. The LAM employs powerful transformer blocks and is trained on extensive datasets from various scenarios. Meanwhile, the channel distribution (environmental knowledge) -- represented as the mean of channel magnitude in the angular-delay domain -- is incorporated as a prompt within the decoder to further enhance reconstruction quality. Simulation results confirm that the proposed prompt-enabled LAM significantly improves feedback accuracy and generalization performance while reducing data collection requirements in new scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 11 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

When properly balanced, we show that certain cognitive biases can enhance decision-making efficiency through rational deviations and heuristic shortcuts. By introducing heuristic moderation and an abstention option, which allows LLMs to withhold responses when uncertain, we reduce error rates, improve decision accuracy, and optimize decision rates. Using the Balance Rigor and Utility (BRU) dataset, developed through expert collaboration, our findings demonstrate that targeted inspection of cognitive biases aligns LLM decisions more closely with human reasoning, enhancing reliability and suggesting strategies for future improvements. This approach offers a novel way to leverage cognitive biases to improve the practical utility of LLMs across various applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been accepted as a full paper at the 2025 Annual Conference of the Cognitive Science Society (CogSci 2025) and will be presented in the form of a poster.

| **[Can Large Language Models Replace Data Scientists in Biomedical Research?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21591v2)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data science plays a critical role in biomedical research, but it requires professionals with expertise in coding and medical data analysis. Large language models (LLMs) have shown great potential in supporting medical tasks and performing well in general coding tests. However, existing evaluations fail to assess their capability in biomedical data science, particularly in handling diverse data types such as genomics and clinical datasets. To address this gap, we developed a benchmark of data science coding tasks derived from the analyses of 39 published studies. This benchmark comprises 293 coding tasks (128 in Python and 165 in R) performed on real-world TCGA-type genomics and clinical data. Our findings reveal that the vanilla prompting of LLMs yields suboptimal performances due to drawbacks in following input instructions, understanding target data, and adhering to standard analysis practices. Next, we benchmarked six cutting-edge LLMs and advanced adaptation methods, finding two methods to be particularly effective: chain-of-thought prompting, which provides a step-by-step plan for data analysis, which led to a 21% code accuracy improvement (56.6% versus 35.3%); and self-reflection, enabling LLMs to refine the buggy code iteratively, yielding an 11% code accuracy improvement (45.5% versus 34.3%). Building on these insights, we developed a platform that integrates LLMs into the data science workflow for medical professionals. In a user study with five medical professionals, we found that while LLMs cannot fully automate programming tasks, they significantly streamline the programming process. We found that 80% of their submitted code solutions were incorporated from LLM-generated code, with up to 96% reuse in some cases. Our analysis highlights the potential of LLMs to enhance data science efficiency in biomedical research when integrated into expert workflows.</p></details> |  |
| **[Human Trust in AI Search: A Large-Scale Experiment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06435v1)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly power generative search engines which, in turn, drive human information seeking and decision making at scale. The extent to which humans trust generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) can therefore influence what we buy, how we vote and our health. Unfortunately, no work establishes the causal effect of generative search designs on human trust. Here we execute ~12,000 search queries across seven countries, generating ~80,000 real-time GenAI and traditional search results, to understand the extent of current global exposure to GenAI search. We then use a preregistered, randomized experiment on a large study sample representative of the U.S. population to show that while participants trust GenAI search less than traditional search on average, reference links and citations significantly increase trust in GenAI, even when those links and citations are incorrect or hallucinated. Uncertainty highlighting, which reveals GenAI's confidence in its own conclusions, makes us less willing to trust and share generative information whether that confidence is high or low. Positive social feedback increases trust in GenAI while negative feedback reduces trust. These results imply that GenAI designs can increase trust in inaccurate and hallucinated information and reduce trust when GenAI's certainty is made explicit. Trust in GenAI varies by topic and with users' demographics, education, industry employment and GenAI experience, revealing which sub-populations are most vulnerable to GenAI misrepresentations. Trust, in turn, predicts behavior, as those who trust GenAI more click more and spend less time evaluating GenAI search results. These findings suggest directions for GenAI design to safely and productively address the AI "trust gap."</p></details> | 23 pages, 6 figures |

While realistic synthetic test cases for power systems have been developed in recent years, they often lack corresponding cyber network models. This work extends synthetic grid models by incorporating cyber-physical representations. To address the growing need for realistic and scalable models that integrate both cyber and physical layers in electric power systems, this paper presents the Scalable Automatic Model Generation Tool (SAM-GT). This tool enables the creation of large-scale cyber-physical topologies for power system models. The resulting cyber-physical network models include power system switches, routers, and firewalls while accounting for data flows and industrial communication protocols. Case studies demonstrate the tool's application to synthetic grid models of 500, 2,000, and 10,000 buses, considering three distinct network topologies. Results from these case studies include network metrics on critical nodes, hops, and generation times, showcasing effectiveness, adaptability, and scalability of SAM-GT.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review in ACM Transactions on Cyber-Physical Systems</p></details> |

In the context of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for evolving ($\textit{i.e.}$, constantly updated) large language models (LLMs), this approach promises efficient adaptation without costly retraining. However, existing methods face critical limitations in simultaneously achieving scalability and controllability. In this paper, we introduce $\texttt{ORAL}$, a novel $\textbf{conditional recurrent diffusion}$ framework that addresses these challenges. $\texttt{ORAL}$ incorporates a novel conditioning mechanism that integrates model architecture and textual task specifications, enabling the generation of task-specific LoRA parameters that can seamlessly transfer across evolving foundation models. Our approach successfully scales to billions-of-parameter LLMs and maintains controllability. Through extensive experiments across seven language tasks, four vision tasks, and three multimodal tasks using five pre-trained LLMs, we demonstrate that $\texttt{ORAL}$ generates high-quality LoRA parameters that achieve comparable or superior performance to vanilla trained counterparts.</p></details> |  |

However, existing self-supervised approaches employ diverse experimental setups, making direct comparisons challenging due to the absence of a standardized benchmark. In this work, we establish a unified benchmark that enables fair comparisons across different methods. Additionally, we systematically investigate five critical aspects of self-supervised learning in videos: (1) dataset size, (2) model complexity, (3) data distribution, (4) data noise, and (5) feature representations. To facilitate this study, we evaluate six self-supervised learning methods across six network architectures, conducting extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets and assessing performance on two distinct downstream tasks. Our analysis reveals key insights into the interplay between pretraining strategies, dataset characteristics, pretext tasks, and model architectures. Furthermore, we extend these findings to Video Foundation Models (ViFMs), demonstrating their relevance in large-scale video representation learning. Finally, leveraging these insights, we propose a novel approach that significantly reduces training data requirements while surpassing state-of-the-art methods that rely on 10% more pretraining data. We believe this work will guide future research toward a deeper understanding of self-supervised video representation learning and its broader implications.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR'...</summary><p>CVPR'25 Workshop: 6th Data-Efficient Workshop</p></details> |

Recent advancements in explainable Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning have shown promise in enabling human-like decision-making. Notably, significant developments have occurred in the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) to the decision-making of complex systems, such as self-driving cars. The textual and somewhat ambiguous nature of COLREGs (from an algorithmic perspective), however, poses challenges that align well with the capabilities of LLMs, suggesting that LLMs may become increasingly suitable for this application soon. This paper presents and demonstrates the first application of LLM-based decision-making and control for ASVs. The proposed method establishes a high-level decision-maker that uses online collision risk indices and key measurements to make decisions for safe manoeuvres. A tailored design and runtime structure is developed to support training and real-time action generation on a realistic ASV model. Local planning and control algorithms are integrated to execute the commands for waypoint following and collision avoidance at a lower level. To the authors' knowledge, this study represents the first attempt to apply explainable AI to the dynamic control problem of maritime systems recognising the COLREGs rules, opening new avenues for research in this challenging area. Results obtained across multiple test scenarios demonstrate the system's ability to maintain online COLREGs compliance, accurate waypoint tracking, and feasible control, while providing human-interpretable reasoning for each decision.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been accepted for publication at European Control Conference 2025, \c{opyright} IEEE 2025.

However, as evaluations shift from static datasets to open-world, dynamic environments, current game-based benchmarks remain inadequate because they lack visual-centric tasks and fail to assess the diverse reasoning skills required for real-world decision-making. To address this, we introduce Visual-centric Multiple Abilities Game Evaluation (V-MAGE), a game-based evaluation framework designed to assess visual reasoning capabilities of MLLMs. V-MAGE features five diverse games with 30+ handcrafted levels, testing models on core visual skills such as positioning, trajectory tracking, timing, and visual memory, alongside higher-level reasoning like long-term planning and deliberation. We use V-MAGE to evaluate leading MLLMs, revealing significant challenges in their visual perception and reasoning. In all game environments, the top-performing MLLMs, as determined by Elo rating comparisons, exhibit a substantial performance gap compared to humans. Our findings highlight critical limitations, including various types of perceptual errors made by the models, and suggest potential avenues for improvement from an agent-centric perspective, such as refining agent strategies and addressing perceptual inaccuracies.

| **[Unraveling Arithmetic in Large Language Models: The Role of Algebraic Structures](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16260v2)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs) have improved with chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting, allowing models to solve complex tasks stepwise. However, training CoT capabilities requires detailed reasoning data, which is often scarce. The self-taught reasoner (STaR) framework addresses this by using reinforcement learning to automatically generate reasoning steps, reducing reliance on human-labeled data. Although STaR and its variants have demonstrated empirical success, a theoretical foundation explaining these improvements is lacking. Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable mathematical capabilities, largely driven by chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting, which decomposes complex reasoning into step-by-step solutions. However, the mechanisms underlying LLMs' ability to perform arithmetic in a single step of CoT remain poorly understood. In this work, we propose that LLMs learn arithmetic by capturing algebraic structures, such as commutativity and identity properties. Since these structures are observable through input-output relationships, they can generalize to unseen data. We empirically demonstrate that LLMs can learn algebraic structures using a custom dataset of arithmetic problems, as well as providing theoretical evidence showing that, under specific configurations of weights and biases, the transformer-based LLMs can generate embeddings that remain invariant to both permutations of input tokens and the presence of identity elements. Our findings indicate that leveraging algebraic structures can enhance the LLMs' arithmetic capabilities, offering insights into improving their arithmetic performance.</p></details> |  |

Despite their effectiveness in modeling KG structural information, KRL methods are suffering from the sparseness of KGs. The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) built on the Transformer architecture presents promising opportunities for enhancing KRL by incorporating textual information to address information sparsity in KGs. LLM-enhanced KRL methods, including three key approaches, encoder-based methods that leverage detailed contextual information, encoder-decoder-based methods that utilize a unified Seq2Seq model for comprehensive encoding and decoding, and decoder-based methods that utilize extensive knowledge from large corpora, have significantly advanced the effectiveness and generalization of KRL in addressing a wide range of downstream tasks. This work provides a broad overview of downstream tasks while simultaneously identifying emerging research directions in these evolving domains.</p></details> |  |

Compared to contemporary neural-network wave functions, FiRE reduces the asymptotic complexity of neural-network variational Monte Carlo (NN-VMC) by $\sim n_\text{el}$, the number of electrons. By restricting electron-electron interactions within the neural network, FiRE accelerates all key operations -- sampling, pseudopotentials, and Laplacian computations -- resulting in a real-world $10\times$ acceleration in now-feasible 180-electron calculations. We validate our method's accuracy on various challenging systems, including biochemical compounds, conjugated hydrocarbons, and organometallic compounds. On these systems, FiRE's energies are consistently within chemical accuracy of the most reliable data, including experiments, even in cases where high-accuracy methods such as CCSD(T), AFQMC, or contemporary NN-VMC fall short. With these improvements in both runtime and accuracy, FiRE represents a new `gold-standard' method for fast and accurate large-scale ab-initio calculations, potentially enabling new computational studies in fields like quantum chemistry, solid-state physics, and material design.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 5 figures + 9 pages supplementary information</p></details> |
| **[Unifying KV Cache Compression for Large Language Models with LeanKV](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03131v2)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) exhibit exceptional performance but incur significant serving costs due to their substantial memory requirements, with the key-value (KV) cache being a primary bottleneck. Existing KV cache compression techniques, such as quantization and pruning, apply uniform treatment to both keys and values, and discard unimportant tokens entirely, overlooking the fine-grained differences in significance of various components within the KV cache. To address these limitations, we introduce LeanKV, a framework that advances KV cache compression by exploiting three levels of differentiation in the KV cache: (1) the differing impact of keys and values on attention computation, (2) the varying importance of tokens, and (3) the diverse dynamic sparsity patterns across attention heads. At the core of LeanKV is an on-GPU memory manager that compacts fragmented free memory list into contiguous regions in parallel, effectively translating sparsity in the KV cache into performance gains. We evaluate LeanKV on several mainstream models, including the recent "thinking model". LeanKV is able to compress the KV cache by $2.7\times$ to $5.7\times$ with near-lossless accuracy on complex workloads requiring sophisticated reasoning and long-generation capabilities, and enhances throughput by $1.9\times$ to $5.4\times$.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Response Generation Strategy Selection for Fine-Tuning Large Language Models Through Self-Aligned Perplexity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11779v2)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) typically relies on producing large sets of input-output pairs. Yet for a given question, there can be many valid outputs. In practice, these outputs are often derived by distilling knowledge from teacher models, and they can vary depending on the specific teacher model or prompting strategy employed. Recent findings show that how these training outputs are generated can significantly affect the performance of the fine-tuned model, raising an important question: how do we pick the best data generation method from among numerous possibilities? Rather than exhaustively training and evaluating on each candidate, this paper proposes a scalable approximate method that assesses a small subset of generated data to estimate its suitability for a specific target LLM. Our central idea is that effective outputs should be familiar to the target LLM. While previous work measures familiarity with perplexity, we find that perplexity might be suboptimal in characterizing 'familiarity' through theoretical analysis and practical observations. To address this, we introduce self-aligned perplexity, a novel metric capturing how closely candidate outputs adhere to the target LLM's own style and reasoning patterns. In this way, we can identify the most effective generation strategy on a small sample, then apply it to produce the complete training set. We demonstrate that training on data generated by the chosen method yields significant improvements across diverse reasoning-focused benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

We introduce a unified Bayesian framework to capture these correlations through structured and informative priors. In this framework, we propose sDM, a generic Bayesian approach for OPE and OPL, grounded in both algorithmic and theoretical foundations. Notably, sDM leverages action correlations without compromising computational efficiency. Moreover, inspired by online Bayesian bandits, we introduce Bayesian metrics that assess the average performance of algorithms across multiple problem instances, deviating from the conventional worst-case assessments. We analyze sDM in OPE and OPL, highlighting the benefits of leveraging action correlations. Empirical evidence showcases the strong performance of sDM.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at AISTATS 2025</p></details> |

We introduce Llama-3-Nanda-10B-Chat, or Nanda for short, a state-of-the-art Hindi-centric instruction-tuned generative LLM, designed to push the boundaries of open-source Hindi language models. Built upon Llama-3-8B, Nanda incorporates continuous pre-training with expanded transformer blocks, leveraging the Llama Pro methodology. A key challenge was the limited availability of high-quality Hindi text data; we addressed this through rigorous data curation, augmentation, and strategic bilingual training, balancing Hindi and English corpora to optimize cross-linguistic knowledge transfer. With 10 billion parameters, Nanda stands among the top-performing open-source Hindi and multilingual models of similar scale, demonstrating significant advantages over many existing models. We provide an in-depth discussion of training strategies, fine-tuning techniques, safety alignment, and evaluation metrics, demonstrating how these approaches enabled Nanda to achieve state-of-the-art results. By open-sourcing Nanda, we aim to advance research in Hindi LLMs and support a wide range of real-world applications across academia, industry, and public services.</p></details> |  |

| **[Fast Adaptation with Behavioral Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07896v1)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unsupervised zero-shot reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for pretraining behavioral foundation models (BFMs), enabling agents to solve a wide range of downstream tasks specified via reward functions in a zero-shot fashion, i.e., without additional test-time learning or planning. This is achieved by learning self-supervised task embeddings alongside corresponding near-optimal behaviors and incorporating an inference procedure to directly retrieve the latent task embedding and associated policy for any given reward function. Despite promising results, zero-shot policies are often suboptimal due to errors induced by the unsupervised training process, the embedding, and the inference procedure. In this paper, we focus on devising fast adaptation strategies to improve the zero-shot performance of BFMs in a few steps of online interaction with the environment while avoiding any performance drop during the adaptation process. Notably, we demonstrate that existing BFMs learn a set of skills containing more performant policies than those identified by their inference procedure, making them well-suited for fast adaptation. Motivated by this observation, we propose both actor-critic and actor-only fast adaptation strategies that search in the low-dimensional task-embedding space of the pre-trained BFM to rapidly improve the performance of its zero-shot policies on any downstream task. Notably, our approach mitigates the initial "unlearning" phase commonly observed when fine-tuning pre-trained RL models. We evaluate our fast adaptation strategies on top of four state-of-the-art zero-shot RL methods in multiple navigation and locomotion domains. Our results show that they achieve 10-40% improvement over their zero-shot performance in a few tens of episodes, outperforming existing baselines.</p></details> | 25 pages |
| **[FAST: Federated Active Learning with Foundation Models for Communication-efficient Sampling and Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03783v2)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated Active Learning (FAL) has emerged as a promising framework to leverage large quantities of unlabeled data across distributed clients while preserving data privacy. However, real-world deployments remain limited by high annotation costs and communication-intensive sampling processes, particularly in a cross-silo setting, when clients possess substantial local datasets. This paper addresses the crucial question: What is the best practice to reduce communication costs in human-in-the-loop learning with minimal annotator effort? Existing FAL methods typically rely on iterative annotation processes that separate active sampling from federated updates, leading to multiple rounds of expensive communication and annotation. In response, we introduce FAST, a two-pass FAL framework that harnesses foundation models for weak labeling in a preliminary pass, followed by a refinement pass focused exclusively on the most uncertain samples. By leveraging representation knowledge from foundation models and integrating refinement steps into a streamlined workflow, FAST substantially reduces the overhead incurred by iterative active sampling. Extensive experiments on diverse medical and natural image benchmarks demonstrate that FAST outperforms existing FAL methods by an average of 4.36% while reducing communication rounds eightfold under a limited 5% labeling budget.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Multimedia Analytics Model for the Foundation Model Era](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06138v2)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advances in Foundation Models and agentic Artificial Intelligence are transforming multimedia analytics by enabling richer, more sophisticated interactions between humans and analytical systems. Existing conceptual models for visual and multimedia analytics, however, do not adequately capture the complexity introduced by these powerful AI paradigms. To bridge this gap, we propose a comprehensive multimedia analytics model specifically designed for the foundation model era. Building upon established frameworks from visual analytics, multimedia analytics, knowledge generation, analytic task definition, mixed-initiative guidance, and human-in-the-loop reinforcement learning, our model emphasizes integrated human-AI teaming based on visual analytics agents from both technical and conceptual perspectives. Central to the model is a seamless, yet explicitly separable, interaction channel between expert users and semi-autonomous analytical processes, ensuring continuous alignment between user intent and AI behavior. The model addresses practical challenges in sensitive domains such as intelligence analysis, investigative journalism, and other fields handling complex, high-stakes data. We illustrate through detailed case studies how our model facilitates deeper understanding and targeted improvement of multimedia analytics solutions. By explicitly capturing how expert users can optimally interact with and guide AI-powered multimedia analytics systems, our conceptual framework sets a clear direction for system design, comparison, and future research.</p></details> |  |

Our study spans embeddings from pre-trained convolutional and transformer models trained via supervised, self-supervised, and text-image contrastive learning. We assess full fine-tuning and transfer learning (top-tuning) on six diverse e-Commerce datasets: fashion, consumer goods, cars, food, and retail. Results show full fine-tuning consistently performs well, while text-image and self-supervised embeddings can match its performance with less training. While supervised embeddings remain stable across architectures, SSL and contrastive embeddings vary significantly, often benefiting from top-tuning. Top-tuning emerges as an efficient alternative to full fine-tuning, reducing computational costs. We also explore cross-tuning, noting its impact depends on dataset characteristics. Our findings offer practical guidelines for embedding selection and fine-tuning strategies, balancing efficiency and performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted at Future Technologies Conference (FTC 2025)</p></details> |
| **[GPT Carry-On: Training Foundation Model for Customization Could Be Simple, Scalable and Affordable](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07513v1)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern large language foundation models (LLM) have now entered the daily lives of millions of users. We ask a natural question whether it is possible to customize LLM for every user or every task. From system and industrial economy consideration, general continue-training or fine-tuning still require substantial computation and memory of training GPU nodes, whereas most inference nodes under deployment, possibly with lower-end GPUs, are configured to make forward pass fastest possible. We propose a framework to take full advantages of existing LLMs and systems of online service. We train an additional branch of transformer blocks on the final-layer embedding of pretrained LLMs, which is the base, then a carry-on module merge the base models to compose a customized LLM. We can mix multiple layers, or multiple LLMs specialized in different domains such as chat, coding, math, to form a new mixture of LLM that best fit a new task. As the base model don't need to update parameters, we are able to outsource most computation of the training job on inference nodes, and only train a lightweight carry-on on training nodes, where we consume less than 1GB GPU memory to train a 100M carry-on layer on 30B LLM. We tested Qwen and DeepSeek opensourced models for continue-pretraining and got faster loss convergence. We use it to improve solving math questions with extremely small computation and model size, with 1000 data samples of chain-of-thoughts, and as small as 1 MB parameters of two layer layer carry-on, and the results are promising.</p></details> |  |
| **[Resource-efficient Inference with Foundation Model Programs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07247v1)** | 2025-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The inference-time resource costs of large language and vision models present a growing challenge in production deployments. We propose the use of foundation model programs, i.e., programs that can invoke foundation models with varying resource costs and performance, as an approach to this problem. Specifically, we present a method that translates a task into a program, then learns a policy for resource allocation that, on each input, selects foundation model "backends" for each program module. The policy uses smaller, cheaper backends to handle simpler subtasks, while allowing more complex subtasks to leverage larger, more capable models. We evaluate the method on two new "streaming" visual question-answering tasks in which a system answers a question on a sequence of inputs, receiving ground-truth feedback after each answer. Compared to monolithic multi-modal models, our implementation achieves up to 98% resource savings with minimal accuracy loss, demonstrating its potential for scalable and resource-efficient multi-modal inference.</p></details> |  |
| **[Teaching pathology foundation models to accurately predict gene expression with parameter efficient knowledge transfer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07061v1)** | 2025-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Gene expression profiling provides critical insights into cellular heterogeneity, biological processes and disease mechanisms. There has been an increasing interest in computational approaches that can predict gene expression directly from digitalized histopathology images. While image foundation models have shown promise in a variety of pathology downstream analysis, their performances on gene-expression prediction are still limited. Explicitly incorporating information from the transcriptomic models can help image models to address domain shift, yet the fine-tuning and alignment of foundation models can be expensive. In the work, we propose Parameter Efficient Knowledge trAnsfer (PEKA), a novel framework that leverages Block-Affine Adaptation and integrates knowledge distillation and structure alignment losses for cross-modal knowledge transfer. We evaluated PEKA for gene expression prediction using multiple spatial transcriptomics datasets (comprising 206,123 image tiles with matched gene expression profiles) that encompassed various types of tissue. PEKA achieved at least 5\% performance improvement over baseline foundation models while also outperforming alternative parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategies. We will release the code, datasets and aligned models after peer-review to facilitate broader adoption and further development for parameter efficient model alignment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Review of Case-Based Reasoning for LLM Agents: Theoretical Foundations, Architectural Components, and Cognitive Integration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06943v1)** | 2025-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Agents powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated impressive capabilities in various tasks. Still, they face limitations in tasks requiring specific, structured knowledge, flexibility, or accountable decision-making. While agents are capable of perceiving their environments, forming inferences, planning, and executing actions towards goals, they often face issues such as hallucinations and lack of contextual memory across interactions. This paper explores how Case-Based Reasoning (CBR), a strategy that solves new problems by referencing past experiences, can be integrated into LLM agent frameworks. This integration allows LLMs to leverage explicit knowledge, enhancing their effectiveness. We systematically review the theoretical foundations of these enhanced agents, identify critical framework components, and formulate a mathematical model for the CBR processes of case retrieval, adaptation, and learning. We also evaluate CBR-enhanced agents against other methods like Chain-of-Thought reasoning and standard Retrieval-Augmented Generation, analyzing their relative strengths. Moreover, we explore how leveraging CBR's cognitive dimensions (including self-reflection, introspection, and curiosity) via goal-driven autonomy mechanisms can further enhance the LLM agent capabilities. Contributing to the ongoing research on neuro-symbolic hybrid systems, this work posits CBR as a viable technique for enhancing the reasoning skills and cognitive aspects of autonomous LLM agents.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large Language Model Can Be a Foundation for Hidden Rationale-Based Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16615v2)** | 2025-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the recent advancement in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, most retrieval methodologies are often developed for factual retrieval, which assumes query and positive documents are semantically similar. In this paper, we instead propose and study a more challenging type of retrieval task, called hidden rationale retrieval, in which query and document are not similar but can be inferred by reasoning chains, logic relationships, or empirical experiences. To address such problems, an instruction-tuned Large language model (LLM) with a cross-encoder architecture could be a reasonable choice. To further strengthen pioneering LLM-based retrievers, we design a special instruction that transforms the retrieval task into a generative task by prompting LLM to answer a binary-choice question. The model can be fine-tuned with direct preference optimization (DPO). The framework is also optimized for computational efficiency with no performance degradation. We name this retrieval framework by RaHoRe and verify its zero-shot and fine-tuned performance superiority on Emotional Support Conversation (ESC), compared with previous retrieval works. Our study suggests the potential to employ LLM as a foundation for a wider scope of retrieval tasks. Our codes, models, and datasets are available on https://github.com/flyfree5/LaHoRe.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 3 figures, ECIR 2025</p></details> |

However, a significant challenge lies in the scarcity and high cost of obtaining high-quality materials datasets. While foundation models pre-trained on large datasets have excelled in fields like natural language processing by leveraging latent features through transfer learning, their application in materials science remains limited. Here, we present a foundation model specifically designed for composite materials. Pre-trained on a dataset of short-fiber composites to learn robust latent features, the model accurately predicts homogenized stiffness during transfer learning, even with limited training data. Additionally, our model effectively predicts the material's nonlinear behavior by transferring these learned features to an Interaction-based Material Network, which is a constitutive surrogate model. These results demonstrate the potential of our foundation model to capture complex material behaviors. Our findings validate the feasibility and effectiveness of foundation models in composite materials. We anticipate extending this approach to more complex three-dimensional composite materials, polycrystalline materials, and beyond. Moreover, this framework enables high-accuracy predictions even when experimental data are scarce, paving the way for more efficient and cost-effective materials design and analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[RiemannGFM: Learning a Graph Foundation Model from Riemannian Geometry](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03251v2)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The foundation model has heralded a new era in artificial intelligence, pretraining a single model to offer cross-domain transferability on different datasets. Graph neural networks excel at learning graph data, the omnipresent non-Euclidean structure, but often lack the generalization capacity. Hence, graph foundation model is drawing increasing attention, and recent efforts have been made to leverage Large Language Models. On the one hand, existing studies primarily focus on text-attributed graphs, while a wider range of real graphs do not contain fruitful textual attributes. On the other hand, the sequential graph description tailored for the Large Language Model neglects the structural complexity, which is a predominant characteristic of the graph. Such limitations motivate an important question: Can we go beyond Large Language Models, and pretrain a universal model to learn the structural knowledge for any graph? The answer in the language or vision domain is a shared vocabulary. We observe the fact that there also exist shared substructures underlying graph domain, and thereby open a new opportunity of graph foundation model with structural vocabulary. The key innovation is the discovery of a simple yet effective structural vocabulary of trees and cycles, and we explore its inherent connection to Riemannian geometry. Herein, we present a universal pretraining model, RiemannGFM. Concretely, we first construct a novel product bundle to incorporate the diverse geometries of the vocabulary. Then, on this constructed space, we stack Riemannian layers where the structural vocabulary, regardless of specific graph, is learned in Riemannian manifold offering cross-domain transferability. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of RiemannGFM on a diversity of real graphs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by WWW 2025 (Oral)</p></details> |

However, their high-dimensional output features often create a mismatch with downstream task models, which typically require lower-dimensional inputs. A common solution is to apply a dimensionality reduction (DR) layer, but this approach increases parameter overhead, computational costs, and risks losing valuable information. To address these issues, we propose Nested Res2Net (Nes2Net), a lightweight back-end architecture designed to directly process high-dimensional features without DR layers. The nested structure enhances multi-scale feature extraction, improves feature interaction, and preserves high-dimensional information. We first validate Nes2Net on CtrSVDD, a singing voice deepfake detection dataset, and report a 22% performance improvement and an 87% back-end computational cost reduction over the state-of-the-art baseline. Additionally, extensive testing across four diverse datasets: ASVspoof 2021, ASVspoof 5, PartialSpoof, and In-the-Wild, covering fully spoofed speech, adversarial attacks, partial spoofing, and real-world scenarios, consistently highlights Nes2Net's superior robustness and generalization capabilities.

Here, we present a systematic evaluation of transfer learning strategies for brain tumor classification using these models. We analyzed 254 cases comprising five major tumor types: glioblastoma, astrocytoma, oligodendroglioma, primary central nervous system lymphoma, and metastatic tumors. Comparing state-of-the-art foundation models with conventional approaches, we found that foundation models demonstrated robust classification performance with as few as 10 patches per case, despite the traditional assumption that extensive per-case image sampling is necessary. Furthermore, our evaluation revealed that simple transfer learning strategies like linear probing were sufficient, while fine-tuning often degraded model performance. These findings suggest a paradigm shift from "training encoders on extensive pathological data" to "querying pre-trained encoders with labeled datasets", providing practical implications for implementing AI-assisted diagnosis in clinical pathology.</p></details> | 25 pages, 7 figures |

Despite progress, fetal ultrasound images remain a challenging domain for foundation models due to their inherent complexity, often requiring substantial additional training and facing limitations due to the scarcity of paired multimodal data. To overcome these challenges, here we introduce FetalCLIP, a vision-language foundation model capable of generating universal representation of fetal ultrasound images. FetalCLIP was pre-trained using a multimodal learning approach on a diverse dataset of 210,035 fetal ultrasound images paired with text. This represents the largest paired dataset of its kind used for foundation model development to date. This unique training approach allows FetalCLIP to effectively learn the intricate anatomical features present in fetal ultrasound images, resulting in robust representations that can be used for a variety of downstream applications. In extensive benchmarking across a range of key fetal ultrasound applications, including classification, gestational age estimation, congenital heart defect (CHD) detection, and fetal structure segmentation, FetalCLIP outperformed all baselines while demonstrating remarkable generalizability and strong performance even with limited labeled data. We plan to release the FetalCLIP model publicly for the benefit of the broader scientific community.</p></details> |  |
| **[Training state-of-the-art pathology foundation models with orders of magnitude less data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05186v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The field of computational pathology has recently seen rapid advances driven by the development of modern vision foundation models (FMs), typically trained on vast collections of pathology images. Recent studies demonstrate that increasing the training data set and model size and integrating domain-specific image processing techniques can significantly enhance the model's performance on downstream tasks. Building on these insights, our work incorporates several recent modifications to the standard DINOv2 framework from the literature to optimize the training of pathology FMs. We also apply a post-training procedure for fine-tuning models on higher-resolution images to further enrich the information encoded in the embeddings. We present three novel pathology FMs trained on up to two orders of magnitude fewer WSIs than those used to train other state-of-the-art FMs while demonstrating a comparable or superior performance on downstream tasks. Even the model trained on TCGA alone (12k WSIs) outperforms most existing FMs and, on average, matches Virchow2, the second-best FM published to date. This suggests that there still remains a significant potential for further improving the models and algorithms used to train pathology FMs to take full advantage of the vast data collections.</p></details> | 10 pages, 3 figures |

However, existing datasets are limited in size and diversity, making it difficult to study such vulnerabilities. In this paper, we introduce SCAM, the largest and most diverse dataset of real-world typographic attack images to date, containing 1,162 images across hundreds of object categories and attack words. Through extensive benchmarking of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) on SCAM, we demonstrate that typographic attacks significantly degrade performance, and identify that training data and model architecture influence the susceptibility to these attacks. Our findings reveal that typographic attacks persist in state-of-the-art Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) due to the choice of their vision encoder, though larger Large Language Models (LLMs) backbones help mitigate their vulnerability. Additionally, we demonstrate that synthetic attacks closely resemble real-world (handwritten) attacks, validating their use in research. Our work provides a comprehensive resource and empirical insights to facilitate future research toward robust and trustworthy multimodal AI systems.

Their applications in the software engineering of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) are also growing. However, research in this area remains limited. Moreover, existing studies have primarily focused on LLMs-only one type of FM-leaving ample opportunities to explore others, such as vision-language models. We argue that, in addition to LLMs, other FMs utilizing different data modalities (e.g., images, audio) and multimodal models (which integrate multiple modalities) hold great potential for supporting CPS software engineering, given that these systems process diverse data types. To address this, we present a research roadmap for integrating FMs into various phases of CPS software engineering, highlighting key research opportunities and challenges for the software engineering community.</p></details> | 1 figure, 11 pages |

Building upon GroundingDINO, we employed several widely used image augmentation methods and established optimization objectives to effectively navigate the expansive domain space in search of optimal sub-domains. This approach facilitates efficient few-shot object detection and introduces an approach to solving the CD-FSOD problem by efficiently searching for the optimal parameter configuration from the foundation model. Our findings substantially advance the practical deployment of vision-language models in data-scarce environments, offering critical insights into optimizing their cross-domain generalization capabilities without labor-intensive retraining.

We make the first attempt and propose a self-supervised pretraining framework to learn fundamental representations of real face images, FSFM, that leverages the synergy between masked image modeling (MIM) and instance discrimination (ID). We explore various facial masking strategies for MIM and present a simple yet powerful CRFR-P masking, which explicitly forces the model to capture meaningful intra-region consistency and challenging inter-region coherency. Furthermore, we devise the ID network that naturally couples with MIM to establish underlying local-to-global correspondence via tailored self-distillation. These three learning objectives, namely 3C, empower encoding both local features and global semantics of real faces. After pretraining, a vanilla ViT serves as a universal vision foundation model for downstream face security tasks: cross-dataset deepfake detection, cross-domain face anti-spoofing, and unseen diffusion facial forgery detection. Extensive experiments on 10 public datasets demonstrate that our model transfers better than supervised pretraining, visual and facial self-supervised learning arts, and even outperforms task-specialized SOTA methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 11 figures, project page: https://fsfm-3c.github.io</p></details> |

It explicitly models how meaning, interpretation, and analogy emerge from interactions among layered representations, forming a coherent framework capable not only of modeling minds but also of serving as a blueprint for building them. One of the key theoretical insights derived from function alignment is bounded interpretability, which provides a unified explanation for previously fragmented ideas in cognitive science, such as bounded rationality, symbol grounding, and analogy-making. Beyond modeling, the function alignment framework bridges disciplines often kept apart, linking computational architecture, psychological theory, and even contemplative traditions such as Zen. Rather than building on any philosophical systems, it offers a structural foundation upon which multiple ways of understanding the mind may be reconstructed.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 2 figures.

| **[A Self-Supervised Paradigm for Data-Efficient Medical Foundation Model Pre-training: V-information Optimization Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07107v4)** | 2025-04-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-supervised pre-training medical foundation models on large-scale datasets demonstrate exceptional performance. Recent research challenges this common paradigm by introducing data-effective learning approaches, demonstrating that merely increasing pre-training data volume does not necessarily improve model performance. However, current methods still have unclear standards and the underlying theoretical foundation remains unknown. In this paper, as the first attempt to address this limitation, we introduce V-information into self-supervised pre-training of foundation models to provide a theoretical foundation for sample selection. Our derivation confirms that by optimizing V-information, sample selection can be framed as an optimization problem where choosing diverse and challenging samples enhances model performance even under limited training data. Under this guidance, we develop an optimized data-effective learning method (OptiDEL) to optimize V-information in real-world medical domains by generating more diverse and harder samples. We compare the OptiDEL method with state-of-the-art approaches finding that OptiDEL consistently outperforms existing approaches across eight different datasets, with foundation models trained on only 5% of the pre-training data achieving up to 6.2% higher mIoU than those trained on the full dataset. Remarkably, OptiDEL demonstrates an average improvement of 4.7% mIoU over competing methods while using 20x less training data.</p></details> |  |

Yet, the creation of garments remains a time-consuming process, largely due to the manual work involved in designing them. To simplify this process, we introduce AIpparel, a multimodal foundation model for generating and editing sewing patterns. Our model fine-tunes state-of-the-art large multimodal models (LMMs) on a custom-curated large-scale dataset of over 120,000 unique garments, each with multimodal annotations including text, images, and sewing patterns.

However, traditional data-driven methods face challenges in capturing inherently complex and interconnected processes and are further constrained by limited observational data in many environmental applications. Foundation models, which leverages large-scale pre-training and universal representations of complex and heterogeneous data, offer transformative opportunities for capturing spatiotemporal dynamics and dependencies in environmental processes, and facilitate adaptation to a broad range of applications. This survey presents a comprehensive overview of foundation model applications in environmental science, highlighting advancements in common environmental use cases including forward prediction, data generation, data assimilation, downscaling, inverse modeling, model ensembling, and decision-making across domains.

Recent Pathology Foundation Models (PFMs), pretrained on large-scale histopathology data, have significantly enhanced capabilities of extractors and aggregators but lack systematic analysis frameworks. This survey presents a hierarchical taxonomy organizing PFMs through a top-down philosophy that can be utilized to analyze FMs in any domain: model scope, model pretraining, and model design. Additionally, we systematically categorize PFM evaluation tasks into slide-level, patch-level, multimodal, and biological tasks, providing comprehensive benchmarking criteria. Our analysis identifies critical challenges in both PFM development (pathology-specific methodology, end-to-end pretraining, data-model scalability) and utilization (effective adaptation, model maintenance), paving the way for future directions in this promising field.

This survey provides a comprehensive overview of the current state of the art pre-trained foundation models, introducing a novel taxonomy to categorize them across several dimensions. Specifically, we classify models by their architecture design, distinguishing between those leveraging patch-based representations and those operating directly on raw sequences. The taxonomy further includes whether the models provide probabilistic or deterministic predictions, and whether they are designed to work with univariate time series or can handle multivariate time series out of the box. Additionally, the taxonomy encompasses model scale and complexity, highlighting differences between lightweight architectures and large-scale foundation models. A unique aspect of this survey is its categorization by the type of objective function employed during training phase. By synthesizing these perspectives, this survey serves as a resource for researchers and practitioners, providing insights into current trends and identifying promising directions for future research in transformer-based time series modeling.</p></details> |  |

Therefore, the multi-modal methods that combine both modalities offer more robust detection results. However, efficiently fusing LiDAR points and images remains challenging due to the domain gaps. In addition, the performance of many models is limited by the amount of high quality labeled data, which is expensive to create. The recent advances in foundation models, which use large-scale pre-training on different modalities, enable better multi-modal fusion. Combining the prompt engineering techniques for efficient training, we propose the Prompted Foundational 3D Detector (PF3Det), which integrates foundation model encoders and soft prompts to enhance LiDAR-camera feature fusion. PF3Det achieves the state-of-the-art results under limited training data, improving NDS by 1.19% and mAP by 2.42% on the nuScenes dataset, demonstrating its efficiency in 3D detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted to the CVPR 2025 Workshop on Distillation of Foundation Models for Autonomous Driving (WDFM-AD)</p></details> |

To address this critical gap, we introduce CT-RATE, the first dataset that pairs 3D medical images with corresponding textual reports. CT-RATE comprises 25,692 non-contrast 3D chest CT scans from 21,304 unique patients. Through various reconstructions, these scans are expanded to 50,188 volumes, totaling over 14.3 million 2D slices. Each scan is accompanied by its corresponding radiology report. Leveraging CT-RATE, we develop CT-CLIP, a CT-focused contrastive language-image pretraining framework designed for broad applications without the need for task-specific training. We demonstrate how CT-CLIP can be used in two tasks: multi-abnormality detection and case retrieval. Remarkably, in multi-abnormality detection, CT-CLIP outperforms state-of-the-art fully supervised models across all key metrics, effectively eliminating the need for manual annotation. In case retrieval, it efficiently retrieves relevant cases using either image or textual queries, thereby enhancing knowledge dissemination. By combining CT-CLIP's vision encoder with a pretrained large language model, we create CT-CHAT, a vision-language foundational chat model for 3D chest CT volumes. Finetuned on over 2.7 million question-answer pairs derived from the CT-RATE dataset, CT-CHAT surpasses other multimodal AI assistants, underscoring the necessity for specialized methods in 3D medical imaging. Collectively, the open-source release of CT-RATE, CT-CLIP, and CT-CHAT not only addresses critical challenges in 3D medical imaging, but also lays the groundwork for future innovations in medical AI and improved patient care.</p></details> |  |

| **[Benchmarking Vision Foundation Models for Input Monitoring in Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08083v3)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep neural networks (DNNs) remain challenged by distribution shifts in complex open-world domains like automated driving (AD): Robustness against yet unknown novel objects (semantic shift) or styles like lighting conditions (covariate shift) cannot be guaranteed. Hence, reliable operation-time monitors for identification of out-of-training-data-distribution (OOD) scenarios are imperative. Current approaches for OOD classification are untested for complex domains like AD, are limited in the kinds of shifts they detect, or even require supervision with OOD samples. To prepare for unanticipated shifts, we instead establish a framework around a principled, unsupervised and model-agnostic method that unifies detection of semantic and covariate shifts: Find a full model of the training data's feature distribution, to then use its density at new points as in-distribution (ID) score. To implement this, we propose to combine Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) as feature extractors with density modeling techniques. Through a comprehensive benchmark of 4 VFMs with different backbone architectures and 5 density-modeling techniques against established baselines, we provide the first systematic evaluation of OOD classification capabilities of VFMs across diverse conditions. A comparison with state-of-the-art binary OOD classification methods reveals that VFM embeddings with density estimation outperform existing approaches in identifying OOD inputs. Additionally, we show that our method detects high-risk inputs likely to cause errors in downstream tasks, thereby improving overall performance. Overall, VFMs, when coupled with robust density modeling techniques, are promising to realize model-agnostic, unsupervised, reliable safety monitors in complex vision tasks</p></details> |  |
| **[Interpreting Object-level Foundation Models via Visual Precision Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16198v4)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advances in multimodal pre-training have propelled object-level foundation models, such as Grounding DINO and Florence-2, in tasks like visual grounding and object detection. However, interpreting these models' decisions has grown increasingly challenging. Existing interpretable attribution methods for object-level task interpretation have notable limitations: (1) gradient-based methods lack precise localization due to visual-textual fusion in foundation models, and (2) perturbation-based methods produce noisy saliency maps, limiting fine-grained interpretability. To address these, we propose a Visual Precision Search method that generates accurate attribution maps with fewer regions. Our method bypasses internal model parameters to overcome attribution issues from multimodal fusion, dividing inputs into sparse sub-regions and using consistency and collaboration scores to accurately identify critical decision-making regions. We also conducted a theoretical analysis of the boundary guarantees and scope of applicability of our method. Experiments on RefCOCO, MS COCO, and LVIS show our approach enhances object-level task interpretability over SOTA for Grounding DINO and Florence-2 across various evaluation metrics, with faithfulness gains of 23.7%, 31.6%, and 20.1% on MS COCO, LVIS, and RefCOCO for Grounding DINO, and 102.9% and 66.9% on MS COCO and RefCOCO for Florence-2. Additionally, our method can interpret failures in visual grounding and object detection tasks, surpassing existing methods across multiple evaluation metrics.

| **[Mamba as a Bridge: Where Vision Foundation Models Meet Vision Language Models for Domain-Generalized Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03193v1)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have gained traction in Domain Generalized Semantic Segmentation (DGSS) due to their strong generalization capabilities. However, existing DGSS methods often rely exclusively on either VFMs or VLMs, overlooking their complementary strengths. VFMs (e.g., DINOv2) excel at capturing fine-grained features, while VLMs (e.g., CLIP) provide robust text alignment but struggle with coarse granularity. Despite their complementary strengths, effectively integrating VFMs and VLMs with attention mechanisms is challenging, as the increased patch tokens complicate long-sequence modeling. To address this, we propose MFuser, a novel Mamba-based fusion framework that efficiently combines the strengths of VFMs and VLMs while maintaining linear scalability in sequence length. MFuser consists of two key components: MVFuser, which acts as a co-adapter to jointly fine-tune the two models by capturing both sequential and spatial dynamics; and MTEnhancer, a hybrid attention-Mamba module that refines text embeddings by incorporating image priors. Our approach achieves precise feature locality and strong text alignment without incurring significant computational overhead. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MFuser significantly outperforms state-of-the-art DGSS methods, achieving 68.20 mIoU on synthetic-to-real and 71.87 mIoU on real-to-real benchmarks.

However, their application in remote sensing (RS) remains constrained by a fundamental gap: existing models predominantly handle single or limited modalities, overlooking the inherently multi-modal nature of RS observations. Optical, synthetic aperture radar (SAR), and multi-spectral data offer complementary insights that significantly reduce the inherent ambiguity and uncertainty in single-source analysis. To bridge this gap, we introduce RingMoE, a unified multi-modal RS foundation model with 14.7 billion parameters, pre-trained on 400 million multi-modal RS images from nine satellites. RingMoE incorporates three key innovations: (1) A hierarchical Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture comprising modal-specialized, collaborative, and shared experts, effectively modeling intra-modal knowledge while capturing cross-modal dependencies to mitigate conflicts between modal representations; (2) Physics-informed self-supervised learning, explicitly embedding sensor-specific radiometric characteristics into the pre-training objectives; (3) Dynamic expert pruning, enabling adaptive model compression from 14.7B to 1B parameters while maintaining performance, facilitating efficient deployment in Earth observation applications. Evaluated across 23 benchmarks spanning six key RS tasks (i.e., classification, detection, segmentation, tracking, change detection, and depth estimation), RingMoE outperforms existing foundation models and sets new SOTAs, demonstrating remarkable adaptability from single-modal to multi-modal scenarios. Beyond theoretical progress, it has been deployed and trialed in multiple sectors, including emergency response, land management, marine sciences, and urban planning.</p></details> |  |

However, collecting large thermal datasets is costly and labor-intensive due to the specialized equipment required for infrared image capture. To address this challenge, researchers have explored visible-to-thermal image translation. Most existing methods rely on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) or Diffusion Models (DMs), treating the task as a style transfer problem. As a result, these approaches attempt to learn both the modality distribution shift and underlying physical principles from limited training data. In this paper, we propose F-ViTA, a novel approach that leverages the general world knowledge embedded in foundation models to guide the diffusion process for improved translation. Specifically, we condition an InstructPix2Pix Diffusion Model with zero-shot masks and labels from foundation models such as SAM and Grounded DINO. This allows the model to learn meaningful correlations between scene objects and their thermal signatures in infrared imagery. Extensive experiments on five public datasets demonstrate that F-ViTA outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. Furthermore, our model generalizes well to out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios and can generate Long-Wave Infrared (LWIR), Mid-Wave Infrared (MWIR), and Near-Infrared (NIR) translations from the same visible image.

| **[The Foundations of Tokenization: Statistical and Computational Concerns](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11606v4)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tokenization - the practice of converting strings of characters from an alphabet into sequences of tokens over a vocabulary - is a critical step in the NLP pipeline. The use of token representations is widely credited with increased model performance but is also the source of many undesirable behaviors, such as spurious ambiguity or inconsistency. Despite its recognized importance as a standard representation method in NLP, the theoretical underpinnings of tokenization are not yet fully understood. In particular, the impact of tokenization on language model estimation has been investigated primarily through empirical means. The present paper contributes to addressing this theoretical gap by proposing a unified formal framework for representing and analyzing tokenizer models. Based on the category of stochastic maps, this framework enables us to establish general conditions for a principled use of tokenizers and, most importantly, the necessary and sufficient conditions for a tokenizer model to preserve the consistency of statistical estimators. In addition, we discuss statistical and computational concerns crucial for designing and implementing tokenizer models, such as inconsistency, ambiguity, finiteness, and sequentiality. The framework and results advanced in this paper contribute to building robust theoretical foundations for representations in neural language modeling that can inform future theoretical and empirical research.</p></details> |  |

For pixel-wise regression tasks, specifically utilizing remote sensing data from satellite imagery in EO Foundation Models, confidence quantification is a critical challenge. The focus of this research work is on developing a Foundation Model using EO satellite data that computes and assigns a confidence metric alongside regression outputs to improve the reliability and interpretability of predictions generated by deep neural networks. To this end, we develop, train and evaluate the proposed Confidence-Aware Regression Estimation (CARE) Foundation Model. Our model CARE computes and assigns confidence to regression results as downstream tasks of a Foundation Model for EO data, and performs a confidence-aware self-corrective learning method for the low-confidence regions. We evaluate the model CARE, and experimental results on multi-spectral data from the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellite constellation to estimate the building density (i.e. monitoring urban growth), show that the proposed method can be successfully applied to important regression problems in EO and remote sensing.

Recently, foundation models have played a remarkable role in advancing medical AI. The development of an ECG foundation model holds the promise of elevating AI-ECG research to new heights. However, building such a model faces several challenges, including insufficient database sample sizes and inadequate generalization across multiple domains. Additionally, there is a notable performance gap between single-lead and multi-lead ECG analyses. We introduced an ECG Foundation Model (ECGFounder), a general-purpose model that leverages real-world ECG annotations from cardiology experts to broaden the diagnostic capabilities of ECG analysis. ECGFounder was trained on over 10 million ECGs with 150 label categories from the Harvard-Emory ECG Database, enabling comprehensive cardiovascular disease diagnosis through ECG analysis. The model is designed to be both an effective out-of-the-box solution, and a to be fine-tunable for downstream tasks, maximizing usability. Importantly, we extended its application to lower rank ECGs, and arbitrary single-lead ECGs in particular. ECGFounder is applicable to supporting various downstream tasks in mobile monitoring scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that ECGFounder achieves expert-level performance on internal validation sets, with AUROC exceeding 0.95 for eighty diagnoses. It also shows strong classification performance and generalization across various diagnoses on external validation sets. When fine-tuned, ECGFounder outperforms baseline models in demographic analysis, clinical event detection, and cross-modality cardiac rhythm diagnosis.

As training data collections grow, manually managing the samples becomes time-consuming, tedious, and prone to errors. Yet recent research shows that the data mixture and the order in which samples are visited during training can significantly influence model accuracy. We build and present Mixtera, a data plane for foundation model training that enables users to declaratively express which data samples should be used in which proportion and in which order during training. Mixtera is a centralized, read-only layer that is deployed on top of existing training data collections and can be declaratively queried. It operates independently of the filesystem structure and supports mixtures across arbitrary properties (e.g., language, source dataset) as well as dynamic adjustment of the mixture based on model feedback. We experimentally evaluate Mixtera and show that our implementation does not bottleneck training and scales to 256 GH200 superchips. We demonstrate how Mixtera supports recent advancements in mixing strategies by implementing the proposed Adaptive Data Optimization (ADO) algorithm in the system and evaluating its performance impact. We also explore the role of mixtures for vision-language models.</p></details> | under submission |

Real-world challenges like occlusion and non-texture hinder accurate disparity estimation from binocular matching cues. Recently, monocular relative depth estimation has shown remarkable generalization using vision foundation models. Thus, to facilitate robust stereo matching with monocular depth cues, we incorporate a robust monocular relative depth model into the recurrent stereo-matching framework, building a new framework for depth foundation model-based stereo-matching, DEFOM-Stereo. In the feature extraction stage, we construct the combined context and matching feature encoder by integrating features from conventional CNNs and DEFOM. In the update stage, we use the depth predicted by DEFOM to initialize the recurrent disparity and introduce a scale update module to refine the disparity at the correct scale. DEFOM-Stereo is verified to have much stronger zero-shot generalization compared with SOTA methods. Moreover, DEFOM-Stereo achieves top performance on the KITTI 2012, KITTI 2015, Middlebury, and ETH3D benchmarks, ranking $1^{st}$ on many metrics. In the joint evaluation under the robust vision challenge, our model simultaneously outperforms previous models on the individual benchmarks, further demonstrating its outstanding capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/Insta360-Research-Team/DEFOM-Stereo</p></details> |

Many existing deep-learning-based methods for analyzing colonoscopic videos either require task-specific fine-tuning, lack tracking capabilities, or rely on domain-specific pre-training. In this paper, we introduce PolypSegTrack, a novel foundation model that jointly addresses polyp detection, segmentation, classification and unsupervised tracking in colonoscopic videos. Our approach leverages a novel conditional mask loss, enabling flexible training across datasets with either pixel-level segmentation masks or bounding box annotations, allowing us to bypass task-specific fine-tuning. Our unsupervised tracking module reliably associates polyp instances across frames using object queries, without relying on any heuristics. We leverage a robust vision foundation model backbone that is pre-trained unsupervisedly on natural images, thereby removing the need for domain-specific pre-training. Extensive experiments on multiple polyp benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches in detection, segmentation, classification, and tracking.</p></details> |  |

In this position paper, we build on prior work studying the social impacts of earlier technologies to propose a conceptual framework studying foundation models as sociotechnical systems, incorporating social science expertise to better understand how these models affect systems of power, anticipate the impacts of deploying these models in various applications, and study the effectiveness of technical interventions intended to mitigate social harms. We advocate for an interdisciplinary and collaborative research paradigm between AI and social science across all stages of foundation model research and development to promote socially responsible research practices and use cases, and outline several strategies to facilitate such research.</p></details> |  |

However, existing approaches often focus primarily on algorithms and models, overlooking the importance of systematically integrating domain knowledge, data, and models to ensure more comprehensive and effective AI solutions. Therefore, the effective development and deployment of Industrial AI solutions require a more comprehensive and systematic approach. To address this gap, this paper summarizes previous research and rethinks the role of industrial AI and presents a unified industrial AI foundation framework comprising three core modules: knowledge module, data module, and model module. These modules help to extend and enhance the industrial AI methodology platform, supporting various industrial applications. In addition, a case study on rotating machinery diagnosis demonstrates the framework's effectiveness, and several future directions are highlighted for the development of the industrial AI foundation framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper submitted to IJAMD, the International Journal of AI for Materials and Design, has been accepted</p></details> |

In addition, saved checkpoints are dispatched to evaluation tasks or transferred across different training stages (e.g., from pre-training to post-training). All these scenarios require resharding distributed checkpoints from one parallelism to another. In production environments, different LFMs are trained with various frameworks and storage backends, depending on model sizes and training scales. A high-performance checkpointing system is needed to enable efficient checkpoint management at scale throughout the lifecycle of LFM development. We introduce ByteCheckpoint, an industrial-grade checkpointing system for large-scale LFM training. ByteCheckpoint features: a parallelism-agnostic checkpoint representation that enables efficient load-time checkpoint resharding; a generic checkpoint saving/loading workflow to accommodate multiple training frameworks and support different storage backends; full-stack optimizations to ensure high I/O efficiency and scalability; a suite of monitoring tools to streamline large-scale performance analysis and bottleneck detection. Compared to existing open-source checkpointing systems [52, 58], ByteCheckpoint significantly reduces runtime checkpoint stalls, achieving an average reduction of 54.20x. For saving and loading times, ByteCheckpoint achieves improvements of up to 9.96x and 8.80x, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[UniFault: A Fault Diagnosis Foundation Model from Bearing Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01373v1)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine fault diagnosis (FD) is a critical task for predictive maintenance, enabling early fault detection and preventing unexpected failures. Despite its importance, existing FD models are operation-specific with limited generalization across diverse datasets. Foundation models (FM) have demonstrated remarkable potential in both visual and language domains, achieving impressive generalization capabilities even with minimal data through few-shot or zero-shot learning. However, translating these advances to FD presents unique hurdles. Unlike the large-scale, cohesive datasets available for images and text, FD datasets are typically smaller and more heterogeneous, with significant variations in sampling frequencies and the number of channels across different systems and applications. This heterogeneity complicates the design of a universal architecture capable of effectively processing such diverse data while maintaining robust feature extraction and learning capabilities. In this paper, we introduce UniFault, a foundation model for fault diagnosis that systematically addresses these issues. Specifically, the model incorporates a comprehensive data harmonization pipeline featuring two key innovations. First, a unification scheme transforms multivariate inputs into standardized univariate sequences while retaining local inter-channel relationships. Second, a novel cross-domain temporal fusion strategy mitigates distribution shifts and enriches sample diversity and count, improving the model generalization across varying conditions. UniFault is pretrained on over 9 billion data points spanning diverse FD datasets, enabling superior few-shot performance. Extensive experiments on real-world FD datasets demonstrate that UniFault achieves SoTA performance, setting a new benchmark for fault diagnosis models and paving the way for more scalable and robust predictive maintenance solutions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Foundations and Evaluations in NLP](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01342v1)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This memoir explores two fundamental aspects of Natural Language Processing (NLP): the creation of linguistic resources and the evaluation of NLP system performance. Over the past decade, my work has focused on developing a morpheme-based annotation scheme for the Korean language that captures linguistic properties from morphology to semantics. This approach has achieved state-of-the-art results in various NLP tasks, including part-of-speech tagging, dependency parsing, and named entity recognition. Additionally, this work provides a comprehensive analysis of segmentation granularity and its critical impact on NLP system performance. In parallel with linguistic resource development, I have proposed a novel evaluation framework, the jp-algorithm, which introduces an alignment-based method to address challenges in preprocessing tasks like tokenization and sentence boundary detection (SBD). Traditional evaluation methods assume identical tokenization and sentence lengths between gold standards and system outputs, limiting their applicability to real-world data. The jp-algorithm overcomes these limitations, enabling robust end-to-end evaluations across a variety of NLP tasks. It enhances accuracy and flexibility by incorporating linear-time alignment while preserving the complexity of traditional evaluation metrics. This memoir provides key insights into the processing of morphologically rich languages, such as Korean, while offering a generalizable framework for evaluating diverse end-to-end NLP systems. My contributions lay the foundation for future developments, with broader implications for multilingual resource development and system evaluation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Test-time Adaptation for Foundation Medical Segmentation Model without Parametric Updates](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02008v1)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation medical segmentation models, with MedSAM being the most popular, have achieved promising performance across organs and lesions. However, MedSAM still suffers from compromised performance on specific lesions with intricate structures and appearance, as well as bounding box prompt-induced perturbations. Although current test-time adaptation (TTA) methods for medical image segmentation may tackle this issue, partial (e.g., batch normalization) or whole parametric updates restrict their effectiveness due to limited update signals or catastrophic forgetting in large models. Meanwhile, these approaches ignore the computational complexity during adaptation, which is particularly significant for modern foundation models. To this end, our theoretical analyses reveal that directly refining image embeddings is feasible to approach the same goal as parametric updates under the MedSAM architecture, which enables us to realize high computational efficiency and segmentation performance without the risk of catastrophic forgetting. Under this framework, we propose to encourage maximizing factorized conditional probabilities of the posterior prediction probability using a proposed distribution-approximated latent conditional random field loss combined with an entropy minimization loss. Experiments show that we achieve about 3\% Dice score improvements across three datasets while reducing computational complexity by over 7 times.</p></details> | Under review |
| **[TS-RAG: Retrieval-Augmented Generation based Time Series Foundation Models are Stronger Zero-Shot Forecaster](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07649v2)** | 2025-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) and Foundation Models (FMs) have become prevalent for time series forecasting tasks. However, fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) for forecasting enables the adaptation to specific domains but may not generalize well across diverse, unseen datasets. Meanwhile, existing time series foundation models (TSFMs) lack inherent mechanisms for domain adaptation and suffer from limited interpretability, making them suboptimal for zero-shot forecasting. To this end, we present TS-RAG, a retrieval-augmented generation based time series forecasting framework that enhances the generalization capability and interpretability of TSFMs. Specifically, TS-RAG leverages pre-trained time series encoders to retrieve semantically relevant time series segments from a dedicated knowledge database, incorporating contextual patterns for the given time series query. Next, we develop a learnable Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)-based augmentation module, which dynamically fuses retrieved time series patterns with the TSFM's representation of the input query, improving forecasting accuracy without requiring task-specific fine-tuning. Thorough empirical studies on seven public benchmark datasets demonstrate that TS-RAG achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot forecasting performance, outperforming TSFMs by up to 6.51% across diverse domains and showcasing desired interpretability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Consistency-Guided Asynchronous Contrastive Tuning for Few-Shot Class-Incremental Tuning of Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16625v2)** | 2025-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose Consistency-guided Asynchronous Contrastive Tuning (CoACT), a novel method for continuously tuning foundation models to learn new classes in few-shot settings. CoACT consists of three key components:(i) asynchronous contrastive tuning, which learns new classes by including LoRA modules in the pre-trained encoder while enforcing consistency between two asynchronous encoders; (ii) controlled fine-tuning, which facilitates effective tuning of a subset of the foundation model; and (iii) consistency-guided incremental tuning, which enforces additional regularization during later sessions to reduce forgetting of the learned classes. We evaluate our proposed solution on Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL) as well as a new and more challenging setup called Few-Shot Class-Incremental Tuning (FSCIT), which facilitates the continual tuning of vision foundation models to learn new classes with only a few samples per class. Unlike traditional FSCIL, FSCIT does not require a large in-distribution base session for initial fully supervised training prior to the incremental few-shot sessions. We conduct extensive evaluations across 16 diverse datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of CoACT in both FSCIL and FSCIT setups. CoACT outperforms existing methods by up to 5.02% in FSCIL and up to 12.51% in FSCIT for individual datasets, with an average improvement of 2.47%. Furthermore, CoACT exhibits reduced forgetting and enhanced robustness in low-shot experiments. Detailed ablation and sensitivity studies highlight the contribution of each component of CoACT.

However, ADSs are highly complex cyber-physical systems that demand rigorous software engineering practices to ensure reliability and safety. Integrating FMs into ADSs introduces new challenges in system design and evaluation, requiring a systematic review to establish a clear research roadmap. To unlock these challenges, we present a structured roadmap for integrating FMs into autonomous driving, covering three key aspects: the infrastructure of FMs, their application in autonomous driving systems, and their current applications in practice. For each aspect, we review the current research progress, identify existing challenges, and highlight research gaps that need to be addressed by the community.</p></details> |  |
| **[HyperSIGMA: Hyperspectral Intelligence Comprehension Foundation Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11519v2)** | 2025-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate hyperspectral image (HSI) interpretation is critical for providing valuable insights into various earth observation-related applications such as urban planning, precision agriculture, and environmental monitoring. However, existing HSI processing methods are predominantly task-specific and scene-dependent, which severely limits their ability to transfer knowledge across tasks and scenes, thereby reducing the practicality in real-world applications. To address these challenges, we present HyperSIGMA, a vision transformer-based foundation model that unifies HSI interpretation across tasks and scenes, scalable to over one billion parameters. To overcome the spectral and spatial redundancy inherent in HSIs, we introduce a novel sparse sampling attention (SSA) mechanism, which effectively promotes the learning of diverse contextual features and serves as the basic block of HyperSIGMA. HyperSIGMA integrates spatial and spectral features using a specially designed spectral enhancement module. In addition, we construct a large-scale hyperspectral dataset, HyperGlobal-450K, for pre-training, which contains about 450K hyperspectral images, significantly surpassing existing datasets in scale. Extensive experiments on various high-level and low-level HSI tasks demonstrate HyperSIGMA's versatility and superior representational capability compared to current state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, HyperSIGMA shows significant advantages in scalability, robustness, cross-modal transferring capability, real-world applicability, and computational efficiency.

| **[CellVTA: Enhancing Vision Foundation Models for Accurate Cell Segmentation and Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00784v1)** | 2025-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cell instance segmentation is a fundamental task in digital pathology with broad clinical applications. Recently, vision foundation models, which are predominantly based on Vision Transformers (ViTs), have achieved remarkable success in pathology image analysis. However, their improvements in cell instance segmentation remain limited. A key challenge arises from the tokenization process in ViTs, which substantially reduces the spatial resolution of input images, leading to suboptimal segmentation quality, especially for small and densely packed cells. To address this problem, we propose CellVTA (Cell Vision Transformer with Adapter), a novel method that improves the performance of vision foundation models for cell instance segmentation by incorporating a CNN-based adapter module. This adapter extracts high-resolution spatial information from input images and injects it into the ViT through a cross-attention mechanism. Our method preserves the core architecture of ViT, ensuring seamless integration with pretrained foundation models. Extensive experiments show that CellVTA achieves 0.538 mPQ on the CoNIC dataset and 0.506 mPQ on the PanNuke dataset, which significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art cell segmentation methods. Ablation studies confirm the superiority of our approach over other fine-tuning strategies, including decoder-only fine-tuning and full fine-tuning. Our code and models are publicly available at https://github.com/JieZheng-ShanghaiTech/CellVTA.</p></details> |  |
| **[FisherTune: Fisher-Guided Robust Tuning of Vision Foundation Models for Domain Generalized Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17940v2)** | 2025-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) excel in generalization due to large-scale pretraining, but fine-tuning them for Domain Generalized Semantic Segmentation (DGSS) while maintaining this ability remains challenging. Existing approaches either selectively fine-tune parameters or freeze the VFMs and update only the adapters, both of which may underutilize the VFMs' full potential in DGSS tasks. We observe that domain-sensitive parameters in VFMs, arising from task and distribution differences, can hinder generalization. To address this, we propose \textbf{FisherTune}, a robust fine-tuning method guided by the Domain-Related Fisher Information Matrix (DR-FIM). DR-FIM measures parameter sensitivity across tasks and domains, enabling selective updates that preserve generalization and enhance DGSS adaptability. FisherTune incorporates variational inference to stabilize DR-FIM estimation, treating parameters as Gaussian-distributed variables and leveraging pre-trained priors. Extensive experiments show that FisherTune achieves superior cross-domain segmentation while maintaining generalization, outperforming selective-parameter and adapter-based methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Retrieval-augmented Few-shot Medical Image Segmentation with Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08813v2)** | 2025-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical image segmentation is crucial for clinical decision-making, but the scarcity of annotated data presents significant challenges. Few-shot segmentation (FSS) methods show promise but often require training on the target domain and struggle to generalize across different modalities. Similarly, adapting foundation models like the Segment Anything Model (SAM) for medical imaging has limitations, including the need for finetuning and domain-specific adaptation. To address these issues, we propose a novel method that adapts DINOv2 and Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM 2) for retrieval-augmented few-shot medical image segmentation. Our approach uses DINOv2's feature as query to retrieve similar samples from limited annotated data, which are then encoded as memories and stored in memory bank. With the memory attention mechanism of SAM 2, the model leverages these memories as conditions to generate accurate segmentation of the target image. We evaluated our framework on three medical image segmentation tasks, demonstrating superior performance and generalizability across various modalities without the need for any retraining or finetuning. Overall, this method offers a practical and effective solution for few-shot medical image segmentation and holds significant potential as a valuable annotation tool in clinical applications.</p></details> |  |

However, the scarcity of such data presents a significant hurdle to extending these methods to general use cases. To address this concern, we present an automated framework to decompose trajectory data into temporally bounded and natural language-based descriptive sub-tasks by leveraging recent prompting strategies for Foundation Models (FMs) including both Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision Language Models (VLMs). Our framework provides both time-based and language-based descriptions for lower-level sub-tasks that comprise full trajectories. To rigorously evaluate the quality of our automatic labeling framework, we contribute an algorithm SIMILARITY to produce two novel metrics, temporal similarity and semantic similarity. The metrics measure the temporal alignment and semantic fidelity of language descriptions between two sub-task decompositions, namely an FM sub-task decomposition prediction and a ground-truth sub-task decomposition. We present scores for temporal similarity and semantic similarity above 90%, compared to 30% of a randomized baseline, for multiple robotic environments, demonstrating the effectiveness of our proposed framework. Our results enable building diverse, large-scale, language-supervised datasets for improved robotic TAMP.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures.

However, the prediction and interpretation of these sequences remain challenging due to the intricate nature of genetic material. Large language models (LLMs) have introduced new opportunities for biological sequence analysis. Recent developments in genomic language models have underscored the potential of LLMs in deciphering DNA sequences. Nonetheless, existing models often face limitations in robustness and application scope, primarily due to constraints in model structure and training data scale. To address these limitations, we present GENERator, a generative genomic foundation model featuring a context length of 98k base pairs (bp) and 1.2B parameters. Trained on an expansive dataset comprising 386B bp of eukaryotic DNA, the GENERator demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across both established and newly proposed benchmarks. The model adheres to the central dogma of molecular biology, accurately generating protein-coding sequences that translate into proteins structurally analogous to known families. It also shows significant promise in sequence optimization, particularly through the prompt-responsive generation of enhancer sequences with specific activity profiles. These capabilities position the GENERator as a pivotal tool for genomic research and biotechnological advancement, enhancing our ability to interpret and predict complex biological systems and enabling precise genomic interventions.

While recent advances in deep learning have enabled the development of all-atom foundation models for molecular modeling and generation, existing approaches face challenges in generalization due to the multi-modal nature of atomic data and the lack of comprehensive analysis of training and sampling strategies. To address these limitations, we propose PharMolixFM, a unified framework for constructing all-atom foundation models based on multi-modal generative techniques. Our framework includes three variants using state-of-the-art multi-modal generative models. By formulating molecular tasks as a generalized denoising process with task-specific priors, PharMolixFM achieves robust performance across various structural biology applications. Experimental results demonstrate that PharMolixFM-Diff achieves competitive prediction accuracy in protein-small-molecule docking (83.9% vs. 90.2% RMSD < 2{\AA}, given pocket) with significantly improved inference speed. Moreover, we explore the empirical inference scaling law by introducing more sampling repeats or steps. Our code and model are available at https://github.com/PharMolix/OpenBioMed.</p></details> |  |

Traditional approaches have relied on separate models tailored to either grid-based data, representing cities as uniform cells, or graph-based data, modeling cities as networks of nodes and edges. In this paper, we build UniFlow, a foundational model for general urban flow prediction that unifies both grid-based and graphbased data. We first design a multi-view spatio-temporal patching mechanism to standardize different data into a consistent sequential format and then introduce a spatio-temporal transformer architecture to capture complex correlations and dynamics. To leverage shared spatio-temporal patterns across different data types and facilitate effective cross-learning, we propose SpatioTemporal Memory Retrieval Augmentation (ST-MRA). By creating structured memory modules to store shared spatio-temporal patterns, ST-MRA enhances predictions through adaptive memory retrieval. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniFlow outperforms existing models in both grid-based and graph-based flow prediction, excelling particularly in scenarios with limited data availability, showcasing its superior performance and broad applicability.

To address this, we propose a causally grounded rating framework to study the robustness of Foundational Models for Time Series (FMTS) with respect to input perturbations. We evaluate our approach to the stock price prediction problem, a well-studied problem with easily accessible public data, evaluating six state-of-the-art (some multi-modal) FMTS across six prominent stocks spanning three industries. The ratings proposed by our framework effectively assess the robustness of FMTS and also offer actionable insights for model selection and deployment. Within the scope of our study, we find that (1) multi-modal FMTS exhibit better robustness and accuracy compared to their uni-modal versions and, (2) FMTS pre-trained on time series forecasting task exhibit better robustness and forecasting accuracy compared to general-purpose FMTS pre-trained across diverse settings. Further, to validate our framework's usability, we conduct a user study showcasing FMTS prediction errors along with our computed ratings. The study confirmed that our ratings reduced the difficulty for users in comparing the robustness of different systems.</p></details> |  |

Traditional matching methods for natural images often fail to generalize to X-ray images due to inherent differences such as lack of texture, lower contrast, and overlapping structures, compounded by insufficient training data. To address these challenges, we propose a novel pipeline that generates realistic paired coronary angiography images using a diffusion model conditioned on 2D projections of 3D reconstructed meshes from Coronary Computed Tomography Angiography (CCTA), providing high-quality synthetic data for training. Additionally, we employ large-scale image foundation models to guide feature aggregation, enhancing correspondence matching accuracy by focusing on semantically relevant regions and keypoints. Our approach demonstrates superior matching performance on synthetic datasets and effectively generalizes to real-world datasets, offering a practical solution for this task. Furthermore, our work investigates the efficacy of different foundation models in correspondence matching, providing novel insights into leveraging advanced image foundation models for medical imaging applications.</p></details> |  |

While pathology foundation models leveraging AI have catalyzed transformative advancements, their development demands large-scale datasets, considerable storage capacity, and substantial computational resources. Furthermore, ensuring their clinical applicability and generalizability requires rigorous validation across a broad spectrum of clinical tasks. Here, we present PathOrchestra, a versatile pathology foundation model trained via self-supervised learning on a dataset comprising 300K pathological slides from 20 tissue and organ types across multiple centers. The model was rigorously evaluated on 112 clinical tasks using a combination of 61 private and 51 public datasets. These tasks encompass digital slide preprocessing, pan-cancer classification, lesion identification, multi-cancer subtype classification, biomarker assessment, gene expression prediction, and the generation of structured reports. PathOrchestra demonstrated exceptional performance across 27,755 WSIs and 9,415,729 ROIs, achieving over 0.950 accuracy in 47 tasks, including pan-cancer classification across various organs, lymphoma subtype diagnosis, and bladder cancer screening. Notably, it is the first model to generate structured reports for high-incidence colorectal cancer and diagnostically complex lymphoma-areas that are infrequently addressed by foundational models but hold immense clinical potential. Overall, PathOrchestra exemplifies the feasibility and efficacy of a large-scale, self-supervised pathology foundation model, validated across a broad range of clinical-grade tasks.

However, these models require substantial computational resources for pretraining and are further constrained by available data during post-training. As such, scaling computation at test time emerges as both a critical and practical alternative to traditional model enlargement or re-training. In this work, we introduce SWIFT, a test-time scaling framework tailored for WFMs. SWIFT integrates our extensible WFM evaluation toolkit with process-level inference strategies, including fast tokenization, probability-based Top-K pruning, and efficient beam search. Empirical results on the COSMOS model demonstrate that test-time scaling exists even in a compute-optimal way.

| **[The Axiom-Based Atlas: A Structural Mapping of Theorems via Foundational Proof Vectors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00063v1)** | 2025-03-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Axiom-Based Atlas is a novel framework that structurally represents mathematical theorems as proof vectors over foundational axiom systems. By mapping the logical dependencies of theorems onto vectors indexed by axioms - such as those from Hilbert geometry, Peano arithmetic, or ZFC - we offer a new way to visualize, compare, and analyze mathematical knowledge. This vector-based formalism not only captures the logical foundation of theorems but also enables quantitative similarity metrics - such as cosine distance - between mathematical results, offering a new analytic layer for structural comparison. Using heatmaps, vector clustering, and AI-assisted modeling, this atlas enables the grouping of theorems by logical structure, not just by mathematical domain. We also introduce a prototype assistant (Atlas-GPT) that interprets natural language theorems and suggests likely proof vectors, supporting future applications in automated reasoning, mathematical education, and formal verification. This direction is partially inspired by Terence Tao's recent reflections on the convergence of symbolic and structural mathematics. The Axiom-Based Atlas aims to provide a scalable, interpretable model of mathematical reasoning that is both human-readable and AI-compatible, contributing to the future landscape of formal mathematical systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Foundation Models For Seismic Data Processing: An Extensive Review](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24166v1)** | 2025-03-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Seismic processing plays a crucial role in transforming raw data into high-quality subsurface images, pivotal for various geoscience applications. Despite its importance, traditional seismic processing techniques face challenges such as noisy and damaged data and the reliance on manual, time-consuming workflows. The emergence of deep learning approaches has introduced effective and user-friendly alternatives, yet many of these deep learning approaches rely on synthetic datasets and specialized neural networks. Recently, foundation models have gained traction in the seismic domain, due to their success in natural imaging. This paper investigates the application of foundation models in seismic processing on the tasks: demultiple, interpolation, and denoising. It evaluates the impact of different model characteristics, such as pre-training technique and neural network architecture, on performance and efficiency. Rather than proposing a single seismic foundation model, this paper critically examines various natural image foundation models and suggest some promising candidates for future exploration.</p></details> |  |

In the search for algorithms capable of addressing this challenge, foundation models emerge as promising candidates. Their zero-shot or few-shot learning capabilities, facilitate generalization to new data or tasks without extensive fine-tuning. A concept that is particularly advantageous in the medical imaging domain, where large annotated datasets for traditional training are scarce. In this context, a comprehensive evaluation of foundation models for polyp segmentation was conducted, assessing both detection and delimitation. For the study, three different colonoscopy datasets have been employed to compare the performance of five different foundation models, DINOv2, YOLO-World, GroundingDINO, SAM and MedSAM, against two benchmark networks, YOLOv8 and Mask R-CNN. Results show that the success of foundation models in polyp characterization is highly dependent on domain specialization. For optimal performance in medical applications, domain-specific models are essential, and generic models require fine-tuning to achieve effective results. Through this specialization, foundation models demonstrated superior performance compared to state-of-the-art detection and segmentation models, with some models even excelling in zero-shot evaluation; outperforming fine-tuned models on unseen data.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE TMI for possible publication</p></details> |

To address these issues, this paper introduces communication-efficient federated LoRA adaption (CE-LoRA), a method that employs a tri-factorization low-rank adaptation approach with personalized model parameter aggregation. We first presents a novel LoRA parameter factorization by introducing a small-size dense matrix, which can significantly reduce the communication cost and achieve comparable empirical performance than transferring the low-rank parameter matrix used by existing methods. Without violating data privacy, the server considers the client similarity in both training dataset and model parameter space, and learns personalized weights for model aggregation. Our experiments on various LLM and VLM fine-tuning tasks demonstrate that CE-LoRA not only significantly reduces communication overhead but also improves performance under not independently and identically distributed data conditions. In addition, CE-LoRA improves data privacy protection, effectively mitigating gradient-based data reconstruction attacks.</p></details> |  |

Existing research has primarily focused on algorithms for specific tasks, which have limited applicability in a broad range of ARS vision applications. This paper proposes the RingMo-Aerial model, aiming to fill the gap in foundation model research in the field of ARS vision. By introducing the Frequency-Enhanced Multi-Head Self-Attention (FE-MSA) mechanism and an affine transformation-based contrastive learning pre-training method, the model's detection capability for small targets is enhanced and optimized for the tilted viewing angles characteristic of ARS. Furthermore, the ARS-Adapter, an efficient parameter fine-tuning method, is proposed to improve the model's adaptability and effectiveness in various ARS vision tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that RingMo-Aerial achieves SOTA performance on multiple downstream tasks. This indicates the practicality and efficacy of RingMo-Aerial in enhancing the performance of ARS vision tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[FlexiMo: A Flexible Remote Sensing Foundation Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23844v1)** | 2025-03-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid expansion of multi-source satellite imagery drives innovation in Earth observation, opening unprecedented opportunities for Remote Sensing Foundation Models to harness diverse data. However, many existing models remain constrained by fixed spatial resolutions and patch sizes, limiting their ability to fully exploit the heterogeneous spatial characteristics inherent in satellite imagery. To address these challenges, we propose FlexiMo, a flexible remote sensing foundation model that endows the pre-trained model with the flexibility to adapt to arbitrary spatial resolutions. Central to FlexiMo is a spatial resolution-aware module that employs a parameter-free alignment embedding mechanism to dynamically recalibrate patch embeddings based on the input image's resolution and dimensions. This design not only preserves critical token characteristics and ensures multi-scale feature fidelity but also enables efficient feature extraction without requiring modifications to the underlying network architecture. In addition, FlexiMo incorporates a lightweight channel adaptation module that leverages prior spectral information from sensors. This mechanism allows the model to process images with varying numbers of channels while maintaining the data's intrinsic physical properties. Extensive experiments on diverse multimodal, multi-resolution, and multi-scale datasets demonstrate that FlexiMo significantly enhances model generalization and robustness. In particular, our method achieves outstanding performance across a range of downstream tasks, including scene classification, land cover classification, urban building segmentation, and cloud detection. By enabling parameter-efficient and physically consistent adaptation, FlexiMo paves the way for more adaptable and effective foundation models in real-world remote sensing applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Conformal uncertainty quantification to evaluate predictive fairness of foundation AI model for skin lesion classes across patient demographics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23819v1)** | 2025-03-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning based diagnostic AI systems based on medical images are starting to provide similar performance as human experts. However these data hungry complex systems are inherently black boxes and therefore slow to be adopted for high risk applications like healthcare. This problem of lack of transparency is exacerbated in the case of recent large foundation models, which are trained in a self supervised manner on millions of data points to provide robust generalisation across a range of downstream tasks, but the embeddings generated from them happen through a process that is not interpretable, and hence not easily trustable for clinical applications. To address this timely issue, we deploy conformal analysis to quantify the predictive uncertainty of a vision transformer (ViT) based foundation model across patient demographics with respect to sex, age and ethnicity for the tasks of skin lesion classification using several public benchmark datasets. The significant advantage of this method is that conformal analysis is method independent and it not only provides a coverage guarantee at population level but also provides an uncertainty score for each individual. We used a model-agnostic dynamic F1-score-based sampling during model training, which helped to stabilize the class imbalance and we investigate the effects on uncertainty quantification (UQ) with or without this bias mitigation step. Thus we show how this can be used as a fairness metric to evaluate the robustness of the feature embeddings of the foundation model (Google DermFoundation) and thus advance the trustworthiness and fairness of clinical AI.</p></details> |  |
| **[Timeseries Foundation Models for Mobility: A Benchmark Comparison with Traditional and Deep Learning Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03725v1)** | 2025-03-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Crowd and flow predictions have been extensively studied in mobility data science. Traditional forecasting methods have relied on statistical models such as ARIMA, later supplemented by deep learning approaches like ST-ResNet. More recently, foundation models for time series forecasting, such as TimeGPT, Chronos, and LagLlama, have emerged. A key advantage of these models is their ability to generate zero-shot predictions, allowing them to be applied directly to new tasks without retraining. This study evaluates the performance of TimeGPT compared to traditional approaches for predicting city-wide mobility timeseries using two bike-sharing datasets from New York City and Vienna, Austria. Model performance is assessed across short (1-hour), medium (12-hour), and long-term (24-hour) forecasting horizons. The results highlight the potential of foundation models for mobility forecasting while also identifying limitations of our experiments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Will Pre-Training Ever End? A First Step Toward Next-Generation Foundation MLLMs via Self-Improving Systematic Cognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12303v5)** | 2025-03-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent progress in (multimodal) large language models ((M)LLMs) has shifted focus from pre-training to inference-time compute scaling and post-training optimization, driven by concerns over limited high-quality real-world data. However, these strategies alone are insufficient for advancing model capabilities. We hypothesize that effective model improvement requires a strong synergy among pre-training, inference-time compute scaling, and post-training optimization. In this paper, we validate this hypothesis in the context of multimodal pre-training for foundation MLLM construction. We introduce Self-Improving cognition (SIcog), a self-learning framework for constructing next-generation foundation MLLMs by imparting multimodal knowledge and enhancing their systematic cognitive capabilities through multimodal pre-training with self-generated data. Specifically, we introduce Chain-of-Description, a step-by-step visual understanding method to improve comprehensive perception, and integrate structured chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning to support in-depth multimodal reasoning. SIcog first equips a base model with systematic perception and reasoning using minimal external supervision. The enhanced model then generates candidate image captions and CoT-style reasoning responses for unlabeled images and image-question pairs across diverse tasks, which are curated through a self-consistency mechanism. These curated samples are subsequently used for large-scale multimodal pre-training, completing a self-learning cycle that strengthens the model's cognitive foundation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SIcog produces next-generation foundation MLLMs with substantially improved multimodal cognition, outperforming prevailing pre-training approaches. These findings empirically establish SIcog as a promising framework for realizing a complete self-improving paradigm.</p></details> | <details><summary>40 pa...</summary><p>40 pages.

In this work, we are the first to investigate the question: 'Can fine-tuned foundation models help identify critical, and possibly unknown, data properties?' By evaluating our proposed method on a chest x-ray dataset, we show that these models can generate high-resolution, precisely edited images compared to methods that rely on Structural Causal Models (SCMs) according to numerous metrics. For the first time, we demonstrate that fine-tuned VLMs can reveal hidden data relationships that were previously obscured due to available metadata granularity and model capacity limitations. Our experiments demonstrate both the potential of these models to reveal underlying dataset properties while also exposing the limitations of fine-tuned VLMs for accurate image editing and susceptibility to biases and spurious correlations.</p></details> |  |

Camera-based setups offer a cost-effective option by using stereo depth estimation to generate dense, high-resolution depth maps without relying on expensive active sensing. However, existing omnidirectional stereo matching approaches achieve only limited depth accuracy across diverse environments, depth ranges, and lighting conditions, due to the scarcity of real-world data. We present DFI-OmniStereo, a novel omnidirectional stereo matching method that leverages a large-scale pre-trained foundation model for relative monocular depth estimation within an iterative optimization-based stereo matching architecture. We introduce a dedicated two-stage training strategy to utilize the relative monocular depth features for our omnidirectional stereo matching before scale-invariant fine-tuning. DFI-OmniStereo achieves state-of-the-art results on the real-world Helvipad dataset, reducing disparity MAE by approximately 16% compared to the previous best omnidirectional stereo method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://vita-epfl.github.io/DFI-OmniStereo-website/</p></details> |

For foundation models trained on unknown Web data, MI attacks are often used to detect copyrighted training materials, measure test set contamination, or audit machine unlearning. Unfortunately, we find that evaluations of MI attacks for foundation models are flawed, because they sample members and non-members from different distributions. For 8 published MI evaluation datasets, we show that blind attacks -- that distinguish the member and non-member distributions without looking at any trained model -- outperform state-of-the-art MI attacks. Existing evaluations thus tell us nothing about membership leakage of a foundation model's training data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to be presented at DATA-FM @ ICLR 2025 and IEEE DLSP Workshop 2025</p></details> |

Despite the importance of the web, many tasks performed on it are repetitive and time-consuming, negatively impacting overall quality of life. To efficiently handle these tedious daily tasks, one of the most promising approaches is to advance autonomous agents based on Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques, referred to as AI Agents, as they can operate continuously without fatigue or performance degradation. In the context of the web, leveraging AI Agents -- termed WebAgents -- to automatically assist people in handling tedious daily tasks can dramatically enhance productivity and efficiency. Recently, Large Foundation Models (LFMs) containing billions of parameters have exhibited human-like language understanding and reasoning capabilities, showing proficiency in performing various complex tasks. This naturally raises the question: `Can LFMs be utilized to develop powerful AI Agents that automatically handle web tasks, providing significant convenience to users?' To fully explore the potential of LFMs, extensive research has emerged on WebAgents designed to complete daily web tasks according to user instructions, significantly enhancing the convenience of daily human life. In this survey, we comprehensively review existing research studies on WebAgents across three key aspects: architectures, training, and trustworthiness. Additionally, several promising directions for future research are explored to provide deeper insights.</p></details> |  |
| **[OnlineAnySeg: Online Zero-Shot 3D Segmentation by Visual Foundation Model Guided 2D Mask Merging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01309v3)** | 2025-03-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Online zero-shot 3D instance segmentation of a progressively reconstructed scene is both a critical and challenging task for embodied applications. With the success of visual foundation models (VFMs) in the image domain, leveraging 2D priors to address 3D online segmentation has become a prominent research focus. Since segmentation results provided by 2D priors often require spatial consistency to be lifted into final 3D segmentation, an efficient method for identifying spatial overlap among 2D masks is essential - yet existing methods rarely achieve this in real time, mainly limiting its use to offline approaches. To address this, we propose an efficient method that lifts 2D masks generated by VFMs into a unified 3D instance using a hashing technique. By employing voxel hashing for efficient 3D scene querying, our approach reduces the time complexity of costly spatial overlap queries from $O(n^2)$ to $O(n)$. Accurate spatial associations further enable 3D merging of 2D masks through simple similarity-based filtering in a zero-shot manner, making our approach more robust to incomplete and noisy data. Evaluated on the ScanNet and SceneNN benchmarks, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in online, zero-shot 3D instance segmentation with leading efficiency.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing efforts remain limited to fixed spectral sensors, focus solely on the Earth's surface, and overlook valuable metadata beyond imagery. In this work, we take a step towards next-generation EO foundation models with three key components: 1) Copernicus-Pretrain, a massive-scale pretraining dataset that integrates 18.7M aligned images from all major Copernicus Sentinel missions, spanning from the Earth's surface to its atmosphere; 2) Copernicus-FM, a unified foundation model capable of processing any spectral or non-spectral sensor modality using extended dynamic hypernetworks and flexible metadata encoding; and 3) Copernicus-Bench, a systematic evaluation benchmark with 15 hierarchical downstream tasks ranging from preprocessing to specialized applications for each Sentinel mission. Our dataset, model, and benchmark greatly improve the scalability, versatility, and multimodal adaptability of EO foundation models, while also creating new opportunities to connect EO, weather, and climate research.

To optimize this experience and ensure a smooth and efficient workflow, it's important to develop methods for accurately interpreting and understanding the content of handwritten digital notes. We introduce a foundational model called InkFM for analyzing full pages of handwritten content. Trained on a diverse mixture of tasks, this model offers a unique combination of capabilities: recognizing text in 28 different scripts, mathematical expressions recognition, and segmenting pages into distinct elements like text and drawings. Our results demonstrate that these tasks can be effectively unified within a single model, achieving SoTA text line segmentation out-of-the-box quality surpassing public baselines like docTR. Fine- or LoRA-tuning our base model on public datasets further improves the quality of page segmentation, achieves state-of the art text recognition (DeepWriting, CASIA, SCUT, and Mathwriting datasets) and sketch classification (QuickDraw). This adaptability of InkFM provides a powerful starting point for developing applications with handwritten input.</p></details> |  |

Although advances in deep learning have enabled automatic classification of coral reef conditions, conventional deep models struggle to achieve high performance when processing complex underwater ecological images. Vision foundation models, known for their high accuracy and cross-domain generalizability, offer promising solutions. However, fine-tuning these models requires substantial computational resources and results in high carbon emissions. To address these challenges, adapter learning methods such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) have emerged as a solution. This study introduces an approach integrating the DINOv2 vision foundation model with the LoRA fine-tuning method. The approach leverages multi-temporal field images collected through underwater surveys at 15 dive sites at Koh Tao, Thailand, with all images labeled according to universal standards used in citizen science-based conservation programs. The experimental results demonstrate that the DINOv2-LoRA model achieved superior accuracy, with a match ratio of 64.77%, compared to 60.34% achieved by the best conventional model. Furthermore, incorporating LoRA reduced the trainable parameters from 1,100M to 5.91M. Transfer learning experiments conducted under different temporal and spatial settings highlight the exceptional generalizability of DINOv2-LoRA across different seasons and sites. This study is the first to explore the efficient adaptation of foundation models for multi-label classification of coral reef conditions under multi-temporal and multi-spatial settings. The proposed method advances the classification of coral reef conditions and provides a tool for monitoring, conserving, and managing coral reef ecosystems.</p></details> |  |

While excelling at zero-shot generation of robust behaviors, BFMs often require meticulous prompt engineering for specific tasks, potentially yielding suboptimal results. We introduce "Task Tokens", a method to effectively tailor BFMs to specific tasks while preserving their flexibility. Our approach leverages the transformer architecture of BFMs to learn a new task-specific encoder through reinforcement learning, keeping the original BFM frozen. This allows incorporation of user-defined priors, balancing reward design and prompt engineering. By training a task encoder to map observations to tokens, used as additional BFM inputs, we guide performance improvement while maintaining the model's diverse control characteristics. We demonstrate Task Tokens' efficacy across various tasks, including out-of-distribution scenarios, and show their compatibility with other prompting modalities. Our results suggest that Task Tokens offer a promising approach for adapting BFMs to specific control tasks while retaining their generalization capabilities.</p></details> |  |

In this study, we examine their ability towards domain generalization (DG), by conducting a comprehensive experimental study encompassing 6 medical segmentation FMs and 12 public datasets spanning multiple modalities and anatomies. Our findings reveal the potential of promptable FMs in bridging the domain gap via smart prompting techniques. Additionally, by probing into multiple facets of zero-shot DG, we offer valuable insights into the viability of FMs for DG and identify promising avenues for future research.</p></details> |  |

However, causal discovery algorithms over larger sets of variables tend to be brittle against misspecification or when data are limited. For example, single-cell transcriptomics measures thousands of genes, but the nature of their relationships is not known, and there may be as few as tens of cells per intervention setting. To mitigate these challenges, we propose a foundation model-inspired approach: a supervised model trained on large-scale, synthetic data to predict causal graphs from summary statistics -- like the outputs of classical causal discovery algorithms run over subsets of variables and other statistical hints like inverse covariance. Our approach is enabled by the observation that typical errors in the outputs of a discovery algorithm remain comparable across datasets. Theoretically, we show that the model architecture is well-specified, in the sense that it can recover a causal graph consistent with graphs over subsets. Empirically, we train the model to be robust to misspecification and distribution shift using diverse datasets. Experiments on biological and synthetic data confirm that this model generalizes well beyond its training set, runs on graphs with hundreds of variables in seconds, and can be easily adapted to different underlying data assumptions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Our c...</summary><p>Our code is available at https://github.com/rmwu/sea</p></details> |

While deep learning methods have shown promise in automating sea ice segmentation, they often rely on extensive labeled datasets which require expert knowledge and are time-consuming to create. Recently, foundation models (FMs) have shown excellent results for segmenting remote sensing images by utilizing pre-training on large datasets using self-supervised techniques. However, their effectiveness for sea ice segmentation remains unexplored, especially given sea ice's complex structures, seasonal changes, and unique spectral signatures, as well as peculiar Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery characteristics including banding and scalloping noise, and varying ice backscatter characteristics, which are often missing in standard remote sensing pre-training datasets. In particular, SAR images over polar regions are acquired using different modes than used to capture the images at lower latitudes by the same sensors that form training datasets for FMs. This study evaluates ten remote sensing FMs for sea ice type segmentation using Sentinel-1 SAR imagery, focusing on their seasonal and spatial generalization. Among the selected models, Prithvi-600M outperforms the baseline models, while CROMA achieves a very similar performance in F1-score. Our contributions include offering a systematic methodology for selecting FMs for sea ice data analysis, a comprehensive benchmarking study on performances of FMs for sea ice segmentation with tailored performance metrics, and insights into existing gaps and future directions for improving domain-specific models in polar applications using SAR data.</p></details> |  |
| **[FLAM: Foundation Model-Based Body Stabilization for Humanoid Locomotion and Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22249v1)** | 2025-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Humanoid robots have attracted significant attention in recent years. Reinforcement Learning (RL) is one of the main ways to control the whole body of humanoid robots. RL enables agents to complete tasks by learning from environment interactions, guided by task rewards. However, existing RL methods rarely explicitly consider the impact of body stability on humanoid locomotion and manipulation. Achieving high performance in whole-body control remains a challenge for RL methods that rely solely on task rewards. In this paper, we propose a Foundation model-based method for humanoid Locomotion And Manipulation (FLAM for short). FLAM integrates a stabilizing reward function with a basic policy. The stabilizing reward function is designed to encourage the robot to learn stable postures, thereby accelerating the learning process and facilitating task completion. Specifically, the robot pose is first mapped to the 3D virtual human model. Then, the human pose is stabilized and reconstructed through a human motion reconstruction model. Finally, the pose before and after reconstruction is used to compute the stabilizing reward. By combining this stabilizing reward with the task reward, FLAM effectively guides policy learning. Experimental results on a humanoid robot benchmark demonstrate that FLAM outperforms state-of-the-art RL methods, highlighting its effectiveness in improving stability and overall performance.</p></details> | 8 pages, 7 figures |

Most recently, foundation AI models for circuits have emerged as a new technology trend. Unlike traditional task-specific AI solutions, these new AI models are developed through two stages: 1) self-supervised pre-training on a large amount of unlabeled data to learn intrinsic circuit properties; and 2) efficient fine-tuning for specific downstream applications, such as early-stage design quality evaluation, circuit-related context generation, and functional verification. This new paradigm brings many advantages: model generalization, less reliance on labeled circuit data, efficient adaptation to new tasks, and unprecedented generative capability. In this paper, we propose referring to AI models developed with this new paradigm as circuit foundation models (CFMs). This paper provides a comprehensive survey of the latest progress in circuit foundation models, unprecedentedly covering over 130 relevant works. Over 90% of our introduced works were published in or after 2022, indicating that this emerging research trend has attracted wide attention in a short period. In this survey, we propose to categorize all existing circuit foundation models into two primary types: 1) encoder-based methods performing general circuit representation learning for predictive tasks; and 2) decoder-based methods leveraging large language models (LLMs) for generative tasks. For our introduced works, we cover their input modalities, model architecture, pre-training strategies, domain adaptation techniques, and downstream design applications. In addition, this paper discussed the unique properties of circuits from the data perspective. These circuit properties have motivated many works in this domain and differentiated them from general AI techniques.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Self-Supervised Learning of a Foundation Model for Analog Layout Design Automation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22143v1)** | 2025-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a UNet-based foundation model and its self-supervised learning method to address two key challenges: 1) lack of qualified annotated analog layout data, and 2) excessive variety in analog layout design tasks. For self-supervised learning, we propose random patch sampling and random masking techniques automatically to obtain enough training data from a small unannotated layout dataset. The obtained data are greatly augmented, less biased, equally sized, and contain enough information for excessive varieties of qualified layout patterns. By pre-training with the obtained data, the proposed foundation model can learn implicit general knowledge on layout patterns so that it can be fine-tuned for various downstream layout tasks with small task-specific datasets. Fine-tuning provides an efficient and consolidated methodology for diverse downstream tasks, reducing the enormous human effort to develop a model per task separately. In experiments, the foundation model was pre-trained using 324,000 samples obtained from 6 silicon-proved manually designed analog circuits, then it was fine-tuned for the five example downstream tasks: generating contacts, vias, dummy fingers, N-wells, and metal routings. The fine-tuned models successfully performed these tasks for more than one thousand unseen layout inputs, generating DRC/LVS-clean layouts for 96.6% of samples. Compared with training the model from scratch for the metal routing task, fine-tuning required only 1/8 of the data to achieve the same dice score of 0.95. With the same data, fine-tuning achieved a 90% lower validation loss and a 40% higher benchmark score than training from scratch.</p></details> | 8 pages, 11 figures |
| **[FireRedTTS-1S: An Upgraded Streamable Foundation Text-to-Speech System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20499v2)** | 2025-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we propose a high-quality streaming foundation text-to-speech system, FireRedTTS-1S, upgraded from the streamable version of FireRedTTS. FireRedTTS-1S achieves streaming generation via two steps: text-to-semantic decoding and semantic-to-acoustic decoding. In text-to-semantic decoding, a semantic-aware speech tokenizer converts the speech signal into semantic tokens, which can be synthesized from the text via a semantic language model in an auto-regressive manner. Meanwhile, the semantic-to-acoustic decoding module simultaneously translates generated semantic tokens into the speech signal in a streaming way via a super-resolution causal audio codec and a multi-stream acoustic language model. This design enables us to produce high-quality speech audio in zero-shot settings while presenting a real-time generation process with low latency under 150ms. In experiments on zero-shot voice cloning, the objective results validate FireRedTTS-1S as a high-quality foundation model with comparable intelligibility and speaker similarity over industrial baseline systems. Furthermore, the subjective score of FireRedTTS-1S highlights its impressive synthesis performance, achieving comparable quality to the ground-truth recordings. These results validate FireRedTTS-1S as a high-quality streaming foundation TTS system.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Survey on Remote Sensing Foundation Models: From Vision to Multimodality](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22081v1)** | 2025-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of remote sensing foundation models, particularly vision and multimodal models, has significantly enhanced the capabilities of intelligent geospatial data interpretation. These models combine various data modalities, such as optical, radar, and LiDAR imagery, with textual and geographic information, enabling more comprehensive analysis and understanding of remote sensing data. The integration of multiple modalities allows for improved performance in tasks like object detection, land cover classification, and change detection, which are often challenged by the complex and heterogeneous nature of remote sensing data. However, despite these advancements, several challenges remain. The diversity in data types, the need for large-scale annotated datasets, and the complexity of multimodal fusion techniques pose significant obstacles to the effective deployment of these models. Moreover, the computational demands of training and fine-tuning multimodal models require significant resources, further complicating their practical application in remote sensing image interpretation tasks. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art in vision and multimodal foundation models for remote sensing, focusing on their architecture, training methods, datasets and application scenarios. We discuss the key challenges these models face, such as data alignment, cross-modal transfer learning, and scalability, while also identifying emerging research directions aimed at overcoming these limitations. Our goal is to provide a clear understanding of the current landscape of remote sensing foundation models and inspire future research that can push the boundaries of what these models can achieve in real-world applications.

Large pretrained vision foundation models, such as vision-language, video depth prediction, motion tracking, and segmentation models, offer promising capabilities. However, training a single model for comprehensive 4D understanding remains challenging. We introduce Uni4D, a multi-stage optimization framework that harnesses multiple pretrained models to advance dynamic 3D modeling, including static/dynamic reconstruction, camera pose estimation, and dense 3D motion tracking. Our results show state-of-the-art performance in dynamic 4D modeling with superior visual quality.

| **[HyperFree: A Channel-adaptive and Tuning-free Foundation Model for Hyperspectral Remote Sensing Imagery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21841v1)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advanced interpretation of hyperspectral remote sensing images benefits many precise Earth observation tasks. Recently, visual foundation models have promoted the remote sensing interpretation but concentrating on RGB and multispectral images. Due to the varied hyperspectral channels,existing foundation models would face image-by-image tuning situation, imposing great pressure on hardware and time resources. In this paper, we propose a tuning-free hyperspectral foundation model called HyperFree, by adapting the existing visual prompt engineering. To process varied channel numbers, we design a learned weight dictionary covering full-spectrum from $0.4 \sim 2.5 \, \mu\text{m}$, supporting to build the embedding layer dynamically. To make the prompt design more tractable, HyperFree can generate multiple semantic-aware masks for one prompt by treating feature distance as semantic-similarity. After pre-training HyperFree on constructed large-scale high-resolution hyperspectral images, HyperFree (1 prompt) has shown comparable results with specialized models (5 shots) on 5 tasks and 11 datasets.Code and dataset are accessible at https://rsidea.whu.edu.cn/hyperfree.htm.</p></details> | Accepted by CVPR2025 |
| **[GR00T N1: An Open Foundation Model for Generalist Humanoid Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14734v2)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>General-purpose robots need a versatile body and an intelligent mind. Recent advancements in humanoid robots have shown great promise as a hardware platform for building generalist autonomy in the human world. A robot foundation model, trained on massive and diverse data sources, is essential for enabling the robots to reason about novel situations, robustly handle real-world variability, and rapidly learn new tasks. To this end, we introduce GR00T N1, an open foundation model for humanoid robots. GR00T N1 is a Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model with a dual-system architecture. The vision-language module (System 2) interprets the environment through vision and language instructions. The subsequent diffusion transformer module (System 1) generates fluid motor actions in real time. Both modules are tightly coupled and jointly trained end-to-end. We train GR00T N1 with a heterogeneous mixture of real-robot trajectories, human videos, and synthetically generated datasets. We show that our generalist robot model GR00T N1 outperforms the state-of-the-art imitation learning baselines on standard simulation benchmarks across multiple robot embodiments. Furthermore, we deploy our model on the Fourier GR-1 humanoid robot for language-conditioned bimanual manipulation tasks, achieving strong performance with high data efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Autho...</summary><p>Authors are listed alphabetically.

| **[Solving AI Foundational Model Latency with Telco Infrastructure](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03708v1)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Latency remains a critical bottleneck for deploying foundational artificial intelligence (AI) models, such as large language models (LLMs), in customer-facing, real-time applications. While cloud-based inference offers scalability, it frequently introduces delays unacceptable for interactive experiences, such as semantic search, personalized recommendations, or conversational interfaces. Telecommunications operators, historically adept at solving content latency challenges through partnerships with providers like Google and Facebook, now have a unique opportunity to address similar AI latency concerns. This paper presents a technical framework leveraging Telco infrastructure-spanning regional data centers, existing content delivery network (CDN) nodes, and near-radio access network (RAN) sites-as hierarchical "AI edges" for caching and partial inference. We explore the architectural feasibility of embedding semantic and vector-based AI inference caches within existing Telco assets, proposing tiered caching strategies and split-inference architectures that significantly reduce latency and compute costs. Additionally, we address technical challenges specific to Telcos, such as cache synchronization, model distribution, privacy, and hardware acceleration considerations. Finally, we discuss viable partnership models between telcos and AI providers, highlighting how this innovative use of telco infrastructure can unlock both improved AI user experience and new revenue streams.</p></details> | 39 pages |
| **[Lightweight Online Adaption for Time Series Foundation Model Forecasts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12920v2)** | 2025-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models (FMs) have emerged as a promising approach for time series forecasting. While effective, FMs typically remain fixed during deployment due to the high computational costs of learning them online. Consequently, deployed FMs fail to adapt their forecasts to current data characteristics, despite the availability of online feedback from newly arriving data. This raises the question of whether FM performance can be enhanced by the efficient usage of this feedback. We propose AdapTS to answer this question. AdapTS is a lightweight mechanism for the online adaption of FM forecasts in response to online feedback. AdapTS consists of two parts: a) the AdapTS-Forecaster which is used to learn the current data distribution; and b) the AdapTS-Weighter which is used to combine the forecasts of the FM and the AdapTS-Forecaster. We evaluate the performance of AdapTS in conjunction with several recent FMs across a suite of standard time series datasets. In all of our experiments we find that using AdapTS improves performance. This work demonstrates how efficient usage of online feedback can be used to improve FM forecasts.</p></details> | 8 pages, Preprint |
| **[Evaluating Pre-trained Convolutional Neural Networks and Foundation Models as Feature Extractors for Content-based Medical Image Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09430v2)** | 2025-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical image retrieval refers to the task of finding similar images for given query images in a database, with applications such as diagnosis support. While traditional medical image retrieval relied on clinical metadata, content-based medical image retrieval (CBMIR) depends on image features, which can be extracted automatically or semi-automatically. Many approaches have been proposed for CBMIR, and among them, using pre-trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) is a widely utilized approach. However, considering the recent advances in the development of foundation models for various computer vision tasks, their application for CBMIR can also be investigated. In this study, we used several pre-trained feature extractors from well-known pre-trained CNNs and pre-trained foundation models and investigated the CBMIR performance on eight types of two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) medical images. Furthermore, we investigated the effect of image size on the CBMIR performance. Our results show that, overall, for the 2D datasets, foundation models deliver superior performance by a large margin compared to CNNs, with the general-purpose self-supervised model for computational pathology (UNI) providing the best overall performance across all datasets and image sizes. For 3D datasets, CNNs and foundation models deliver more competitive performance, with contrastive learning from captions for histopathology model (CONCH) achieving the best overall performance. Moreover, our findings confirm that while using larger image sizes (especially for 2D datasets) yields slightly better performance, competitive CBMIR performance can still be achieved even with smaller image sizes.
