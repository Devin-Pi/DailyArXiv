| **[Spatial Re-parameterization for N:M Sparsity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05612v2)** | 2024-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a Spatial Re-parameterization (SpRe) method for the N:M sparsity in CNNs. SpRe is stemmed from an observation regarding the restricted variety in spatial sparsity present in N:M sparsity compared with unstructured sparsity. Particularly, N:M sparsity exhibits a fixed sparsity rate within the spatial domains due to its distinctive pattern that mandates N non-zero components among M successive weights in the input channel dimension of convolution filters. On the contrary, we observe that unstructured sparsity displays a substantial divergence in sparsity across the spatial domains, which we experimentally verified to be very crucial for its robust performance retention compared with N:M sparsity. Therefore, SpRe employs the spatial-sparsity distribution of unstructured sparsity to assign an extra branch in conjunction with the original N:M branch at training time, which allows the N:M sparse network to sustain a similar distribution of spatial sparsity with unstructured sparsity. During inference, the extra branch can be further re-parameterized into the main N:M branch, without exerting any distortion on the sparse pattern or additional computation costs. SpRe has achieved a commendable feat by matching the performance of N:M sparsity methods with state-of-the-art unstructured sparsity methods across various benchmarks.

To efficiently handle TkQs, many indexes have been developed, but the effectiveness of TkQ is limited. To improve effectiveness, several deep learning models have recently been proposed, but they suffer severe efficiency issues and there are no efficient indexes specifically designed to accelerate the top-k search process for these deep learning models. To tackle these issues, we consider embedding based spatial keyword queries, which capture the semantic meaning of query keywords and object descriptions in two separate embeddings to evaluate textual relevance. Although various models can be used to generate these embeddings, no indexes have been specifically designed for such queries. To fill this gap, we propose LIST, a novel machine learning based Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search index that Learns to Index the Spatio-Textual data. LIST utilizes a new learning-to-cluster technique to group relevant queries and objects together while separating irrelevant queries and objects. There are two key challenges in building an effective and efficient index, i.e., the absence of high-quality labels and the unbalanced clustering results. We develop a novel pseudo-label generation technique to address the two challenges. Additionally, we introduce a learning based spatial relevance model that can integrates with various text relevance models to form a lightweight yet effective relevance for reranking objects retrieved by LIST.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by VLDB Journal</p></details> |
| **[Fourier analysis of spatial point processes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06403v2)** | 2024-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this article, we develop comprehensive frequency domain methods for estimating and inferring the second-order structure of spatial point processes. The main element here is on utilizing the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) of the point pattern and its tapered counterpart. Under second-order stationarity, we show that both the DFTs and the tapered DFTs are asymptotically jointly independent Gaussian even when the DFTs share the same limiting frequencies. Based on these results, we establish an $\alpha$-mixing central limit theorem for a statistic formulated as a quadratic form of the tapered DFT. As applications, we derive the asymptotic distribution of the kernel spectral density estimator and establish a frequency domain inferential method for parametric stationary point processes. For the latter, the resulting model parameter estimator is computationally tractable and yields meaningful interpretations even in the case of model misspecification. We investigate the finite sample performance of our estimator through simulations, considering scenarios of both correctly specified and misspecified models. Furthermore, we extend our proposed DFT-based frequency domain methods to a class of non-stationary spatial point processes.</p></details> |  |
| **[STARFlow: Spatial Temporal Feature Re-embedding with Attentive Learning for Real-world Scene Flow](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07032v2)** | 2024-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scene flow prediction is a crucial underlying task in understanding dynamic scenes as it offers fundamental motion information. However, contemporary scene flow methods encounter three major challenges. Firstly, flow estimation solely based on local receptive fields lacks long-dependency matching of point pairs. To address this issue, we propose global attentive flow embedding to match all-to-all point pairs in both feature space and Euclidean space, providing global initialization before local refinement. Secondly, there are deformations existing in non-rigid objects after warping, which leads to variations in the spatiotemporal relation between the consecutive frames. For a more precise estimation of residual flow, a spatial temporal feature re-embedding module is devised to acquire the sequence features after deformation. Furthermore, previous methods perform poor generalization due to the significant domain gap between the synthesized and LiDAR-scanned datasets. We leverage novel domain adaptive losses to effectively bridge the gap of motion inference from synthetic to real-world. Experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance across various datasets, with particularly outstanding results on real-world LiDAR-scanned datasets. Our code is available at https://github.com/O-VIGIA/StarFlow.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper was renamed to:"SSRFlow: Semantic-aware Fusion with Spatial Temporal Re-embedding for Real-world Scene Flow" [arXiv:2408.07825] and was accepted in 3DV 2025</p></details> |
| **[Impact of Translation and Viewpoint Transition Methods in VR on Spatial Learning and Cybersickness](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20675v2)** | 2024-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Virtual locomotion technique (VLT) is a fundamental component of virtual reality (VR) systems that translates physical and controller inputs into virtual translational movements and viewpoint transitions. Poorly designed VLTs can result in discomfort, nausea, and reductions in task performance. Understanding the effectiveness of VLTs across various levels of interaction fidelity is crucial to enhance user experience and spatial awareness. The current study addressed a significant gap in VR design research and practice, as few previous efforts have been made to comprehensively evaluate the effectiveness of controller-based VLTs in virtual indoor environments. We conducted a user study in which participants navigated through two complex virtual environments, one focusing on exploratory tasks and the other on goal-oriented navigation. The findings offer insights into the trade-offs among spatial knowledge acquisition, wayfinding performance, cybersickness, and sense of presence, and have design implications for future VR interfaces.</p></details> | <details><summary>The w...</summary><p>The work needs revision and will be updated later</p></details> |
| **[On Long-Term Species Coexistence in Five-Species Evolutionary Spatial Cyclic Games with Ablated and Non-Ablated Dominance Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03807v2)** | 2024-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>I present a replication and, to some extent, a refutation of key results published by Zhong, Zhang, Li, Dai, & Yang in their 2022 paper "Species coexistence in spatial cyclic game of five species" (Chaos, Solitons and Fractals, 156: 111806), where ecosystem species coexistence was explored via simulation studies of the evolutionary spatial cyclic game (ESCG) Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock (RPSLS) with certain predator-prey relationships removed from the game's "interaction structure", i.e. with specific arcs ablated in the ESCG's dominance network, and with the ESCG run for 100,000 Monte Carlo Steps (MCS) to identify its asymptotic behaviors. I replicate the results presented by Zhong et al. for interaction structures with one, two, three, and four arcs ablated from the dominance network. I then empirically demonstrate that the dynamics of the RPSLS ESCG have sufficiently long time constants that the true asymptotic outcomes can often only be identified after running the ablated ESCG for 10,000,000MCS or longer, and that the true long-term outcomes can be markedly less diverse than those reported by Zhong et al. as asymptotic. Finally I demonstrate that, when run for sufficiently many MCS, the original unablated RPSLS system exhibits essentially the same asymptotic outcomes as the ablated RPSLS systems, and in this sense the only causal effect of the ablations is to alter the time required for the system to converge to the long-term asymptotic states that the unablated system eventually settles to anyhow.</p></details> | <details><summary>84 Pa...</summary><p>84 Pages, 49 Figures, 41 References</p></details> |
| **[Textured-GS: Gaussian Splatting with Spatially Defined Color and Opacity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09733v3)** | 2024-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we introduce Textured-GS, an innovative method for rendering Gaussian splatting that incorporates spatially defined color and opacity variations using Spherical Harmonics (SH). This approach enables each Gaussian to exhibit a richer representation by accommodating varying colors and opacities across its surface, significantly enhancing rendering quality compared to traditional methods. To demonstrate the merits of our approach, we have adapted the Mini-Splatting architecture to integrate textured Gaussians without increasing the number of Gaussians. Our experiments across multiple real-world datasets show that Textured-GS consistently outperforms both the baseline Mini-Splatting and standard 3DGS in terms of visual fidelity. The results highlight the potential of Textured-GS to advance Gaussian-based rendering technologies, promising more efficient and high-quality scene reconstructions. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/ZhentaoHuang/Textured-GS.</p></details> | 9 pages |
| **[Clustered Factor Analysis for Multivariate Spatial Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07018v2)** | 2024-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Factor analysis has been extensively used to reveal the dependence structures among multivariate variables, offering valuable insight in various fields. However, it cannot incorporate the spatial heterogeneity that is typically present in spatial data. To address this issue, we introduce an effective method specifically designed to discover the potential dependence structures in multivariate spatial data. Our approach assumes that spatial locations can be approximately divided into a finite number of clusters, with locations within the same cluster sharing similar dependence structures. By leveraging an iterative algorithm that combines spatial clustering with factor analysis, we simultaneously detect spatial clusters and estimate a unique factor model for each cluster. The proposed method is evaluated through comprehensive simulation studies, demonstrating its flexibility. In addition, we apply the proposed method to a dataset of railway station attributes in the Tokyo metropolitan area, highlighting its practical applicability and effectiveness in uncovering complex spatial dependencies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Anonymous Distributed Localisation via Spatial Population Protocols](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08434v1)** | 2024-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the distributed localization problem (DLP), n anonymous robots (agents) A0, A1, ..., A(n-1) begin at arbitrary positions p0, ..., p(n-1) in S, where S is a Euclidean space. The primary goal in DLP is for agents to reach a consensus on a unified coordinate system that accurately reflects the relative positions of all points, p0, ... , p(n-1), in S. Extensive research on DLP has primarily focused on the feasibility and complexity of achieving consensus when agents have limited access to inter-agent distances, often due to missing or imprecise data. In this paper, however, we examine a minimalist, computationally efficient model of distributed computing in which agents have access to all pairwise distances, if needed. Specifically, we introduce a novel variant of population protocols, referred to as the spatial population protocols model. In this variant each agent can memorise one or a fixed number of coordinates, and when agents A(i) and A(j) interact, they can not only exchange their current knowledge but also either determine the distance d(i,j) between them in S (distance query model) or obtain the vector v(i,j) spanning points p(i) and p(j) (vector query model). We examine three DLP scenarios: - Self-stabilising localisation protocol with distance queries We propose and analyse self-stabilising localisation protocol based on pairwise distance adjustment. We also discuss several hard instances in this scenario, and suggest possible improvements for the considered protocol, - Leader-based localisation protocol with distance queries We propose and analyse several leader-based protocols which stabilise in o(n) parallel time. These protocols rely on efficient solution to multi-contact epidemic, and - Self-stabilising localisation protocol with vector queries We propose and analyse superfast self-stabilising DLP protocol which stabilises in O(log n) parallel time.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatially Regularized Graph Attention Autoencoder Framework for Detecting Rainfall Extremes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07753v1)** | 2024-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a novel Graph Attention Autoencoder (GAE) with spatial regularization to address the challenge of scalable anomaly detection in spatiotemporal rainfall data across India from 1990 to 2015. Our model leverages a Graph Attention Network (GAT) to capture spatial dependencies and temporal dynamics in the data, further enhanced by a spatial regularization term ensuring geographic coherence. We construct two graph datasets employing rainfall, pressure, and temperature attributes from the Indian Meteorological Department and ERA5 Reanalysis on Single Levels, respectively. Our network operates on graph representations of the data, where nodes represent geographic locations, and edges, inferred through event synchronization, denote significant co-occurrences of rainfall events. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our GAE effectively identifies anomalous rainfall patterns across the Indian landscape. Our work paves the way for sophisticated spatiotemporal anomaly detection methodologies in climate science, contributing to better climate change preparedness and response strategies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient 3D Perception on Multi-Sweep Point Cloud with Gumbel Spatial Pruning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07742v1)** | 2024-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper studies point cloud perception within outdoor environments. Existing methods face limitations in recognizing objects located at a distance or occluded, due to the sparse nature of outdoor point clouds. In this work, we observe a significant mitigation of this problem by accumulating multiple temporally consecutive LiDAR sweeps, resulting in a remarkable improvement in perception accuracy. However, the computation cost also increases, hindering previous approaches from utilizing a large number of LiDAR sweeps. To tackle this challenge, we find that a considerable portion of points in the accumulated point cloud is redundant, and discarding these points has minimal impact on perception accuracy. We introduce a simple yet effective Gumbel Spatial Pruning (GSP) layer that dynamically prunes points based on a learned end-to-end sampling. The GSP layer is decoupled from other network components and thus can be seamlessly integrated into existing point cloud network architectures. Without incurring additional computational overhead, we increase the number of LiDAR sweeps from 10, a common practice, to as many as 40. Consequently, there is a significant enhancement in perception performance. For instance, in nuScenes 3D object detection and BEV map segmentation tasks, our pruning strategy improves the vanilla TransL baseline and other baseline methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Series ridge regression for spatial data on $\mathbb{R}^d$](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02773v6)** | 2024-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper develops a general asymptotic theory of series estimators for spatial data collected at irregularly spaced locations within a sampling region $R_n \subset \mathbb{R}^d$. We employ a stochastic sampling design that can flexibly generate irregularly spaced sampling sites, encompassing both pure increasing and mixed increasing domain frameworks. Specifically, we focus on a spatial trend regression model and a nonparametric regression model with spatially dependent covariates. For these models, we investigate $L^2$-penalized series estimation of the trend and regression functions. We establish uniform and $L^2$ convergence rates and multivariate central limit theorems for general series estimators as main results. Additionally, we show that spline and wavelet series estimators achieve optimal uniform and $L^2$ convergence rates and propose methods for constructing confidence intervals for these estimators. Finally, we demonstrate that our dependence structure conditions on the underlying spatial processes cover a broad class of random fields, including L\'evy-driven continuous autoregressive and moving average random fields.</p></details> | 55 pages |
| **[Evaluating the Generation of Spatial Relations in Text and Image Generative Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07664v1)** | 2024-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding spatial relations is a crucial cognitive ability for both humans and AI. While current research has predominantly focused on the benchmarking of text-to-image (T2I) models, we propose a more comprehensive evaluation that includes \textit{both} T2I and Large Language Models (LLMs). As spatial relations are naturally understood in a visuo-spatial manner, we develop an approach to convert LLM outputs into an image, thereby allowing us to evaluate both T2I models and LLMs \textit{visually}. We examined the spatial relation understanding of 8 prominent generative models (3 T2I models and 5 LLMs) on a set of 10 common prepositions, as well as assess the feasibility of automatic evaluation methods. Surprisingly, we found that T2I models only achieve subpar performance despite their impressive general image-generation abilities. Even more surprisingly, our results show that LLMs are significantly more accurate than T2I models in generating spatial relations, despite being primarily trained on textual data. We examined reasons for model failures and highlight gaps that can be filled to enable more spatially faithful generations.</p></details> |  |
| **[SCSA: Exploring the Synergistic Effects Between Spatial and Channel Attention](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05128v2)** | 2024-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Channel and spatial attentions have respectively brought significant improvements in extracting feature dependencies and spatial structure relations for various downstream vision tasks. While their combination is more beneficial for leveraging their individual strengths, the synergy between channel and spatial attentions has not been fully explored, lacking in fully harness the synergistic potential of multi-semantic information for feature guidance and mitigation of semantic disparities. Our study attempts to reveal the synergistic relationship between spatial and channel attention at multiple semantic levels, proposing a novel Spatial and Channel Synergistic Attention module (SCSA). Our SCSA consists of two parts: the Shareable Multi-Semantic Spatial Attention (SMSA) and the Progressive Channel-wise Self-Attention (PCSA). SMSA integrates multi-semantic information and utilizes a progressive compression strategy to inject discriminative spatial priors into PCSA's channel self-attention, effectively guiding channel recalibration. Additionally, the robust feature interactions based on the self-attention mechanism in PCSA further mitigate the disparities in multi-semantic information among different sub-features within SMSA. We conduct extensive experiments on seven benchmark datasets, including classification on ImageNet-1K, object detection on MSCOCO 2017, segmentation on ADE20K, and four other complex scene detection datasets. Our results demonstrate that our proposed SCSA not only surpasses the current state-of-the-art attention but also exhibits enhanced generalization capabilities across various task scenarios. The code and models are available at: https://github.com/HZAI-ZJNU/SCSA.</p></details> | <details><summary>We ad...</summary><p>We added experiments for the classification task and updated the corresponding sections accordingly.

We use local observations by robots of each other and Gaussian Belief Propagation message passing combined with continuous swarm movement to build a global and distributed swarm-centric frame of reference.

| **[SIESEF-FusionNet: Spatial Inter-correlation Enhancement and Spatially-Embedded Feature Fusion Network for LiDAR Point Cloud Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06991v1)** | 2024-11-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ambiguity at the boundaries of different semantic classes in point cloud semantic segmentation often leads to incorrect decisions in intelligent perception systems, such as autonomous driving. Hence, accurate delineation of the boundaries is crucial for improving safety in autonomous driving. A novel spatial inter-correlation enhancement and spatially-embedded feature fusion network (SIESEF-FusionNet) is proposed in this paper, enhancing spatial inter-correlation by combining inverse distance weighting and angular compensation to extract more beneficial spatial information without causing redundancy. Meanwhile, a new spatial adaptive pooling module is also designed, embedding enhanced spatial information into semantic features for strengthening the context-awareness of semantic features. Experimental results demonstrate that 83.7% mIoU and 97.8% OA are achieved by SIESEF-FusionNet on the Toronto3D dataset, with performance superior to other baseline methods. A value of 61.1% mIoU is reached on the semanticKITTI dataset, where a marked improvement in segmentation performance is observed. In addition, the effectiveness and plug-and-play capability of the proposed modules are further verified through ablation studies.</p></details> | 9 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Joinable Search over Multi-source Spatial Datasets: Overlap, Coverage, and Efficiency](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13383v2)** | 2024-11-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The search for joinable data is pivotal for numerous applications, such as data integration, data augmentation, and data analysis. Although there have been many successful joinable search studies for table discovery, the study of finding joinable spatial datasets for a given query from multiple spatial data sources has not been well considered. This paper studies two cases of joinable search problems from multiple spatial data sources. In addition to the overlap joinable search problem (OJSP), we also propose a novel coverage joinable search problem (CJSP) that has not been considered before, motivated by many real world applications in the field of spatial search. To support two cases of joinable search over multiple spatial data sources seamlessly, we propose a multi-source spatial dataset search framework. Firstly, we design a DIstributed Tree-based Spatial index structure called DITS, which is used not only to design acceleration strategies to speed up joinable searches, but also to support efficient communication between multiple data sources. Additionally, we prove that the CJSP is NP-hard and design a greedy approximate algorithm to solve the problem. We evaluate the efficiency of our search framework on five real-world data sources, and the experimental results show that our framework can significantly reduce running time and communication costs compared with baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[ENAT: Rethinking Spatial-temporal Interactions in Token-based Image Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06959v1)** | 2024-11-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, token-based generation have demonstrated their effectiveness in image synthesis. As a representative example, non-autoregressive Transformers (NATs) can generate decent-quality images in a few steps. NATs perform generation in a progressive manner, where the latent tokens of a resulting image are incrementally revealed. At each step, the unrevealed image regions are padded with mask tokens and inferred by NAT. In this paper, we delve into the mechanisms behind the effectiveness of NATs and uncover two important patterns that naturally emerge from NATs: Spatially (within a step), although mask and visible tokens are processed uniformly by NATs, the interactions between them are highly asymmetric. In specific, mask tokens mainly gather information for decoding, while visible tokens tend to primarily provide information, and their deep representations can be built only upon themselves. Temporally (across steps), the interactions between adjacent generation steps mostly concentrate on updating the representations of a few critical tokens, while the computation for the majority of tokens is generally repetitive. Driven by these findings, we propose EfficientNAT (ENAT), a NAT model that explicitly encourages these critical interactions inherent in NATs. At the spatial level, we disentangle the computations of visible and mask tokens by encoding visible tokens independently, while decoding mask tokens conditioned on the fully encoded visible tokens. At the temporal level, we prioritize the computation of the critical tokens at each step, while maximally reusing previously computed token representations to supplement necessary information. ENAT improves the performance of NATs notably with significantly reduced computational cost. Experiments on ImageNet-256, ImageNet-512 and MS-COCO validate the effectiveness of ENAT. Code is available at https://github.com/LeapLabTHU/ENAT.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS2024</p></details> |
| **[Electroencephalogram-based Multi-class Decoding of Attended Speakers' Direction with Audio Spatial Spectrum](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06928v1)** | 2024-11-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Decoding the directional focus of an attended speaker from listeners' electroencephalogram (EEG) signals is essential for developing brain-computer interfaces to improve the quality of life for individuals with hearing impairment. Previous works have concentrated on binary directional focus decoding, i.e., determining whether the attended speaker is on the left or right side of the listener. However, a more precise decoding of the exact direction of the attended speaker is necessary for effective speech processing. Additionally, audio spatial information has not been effectively leveraged, resulting in suboptimal decoding results. In this paper, we observe that, on our recently presented dataset with 15-class directional focus, models relying exclusively on EEG inputs exhibits significantly lower accuracy when decoding the directional focus in both leave-one-subject-out and leave-one-trial-out scenarios. By integrating audio spatial spectra with EEG features, the decoding accuracy can be effectively improved. We employ the CNN, LSM-CNN, and EEG-Deformer models to decode the directional focus from listeners' EEG signals with the auxiliary audio spatial spectra. The proposed Sp-Aux-Deformer model achieves notable 15-class decoding accuracies of 57.48% and 61.83% in leave-one-subject-out and leave-one-trial-out scenarios, respectively.</p></details> |  |

| **[Efficient Unsupervised Domain Adaptation Regression for Spatial-Temporal Air Quality Sensor Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06917v1)** | 2024-11-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The deployment of affordable Internet of Things (IoT) sensors for air pollution monitoring has increased in recent years due to their scalability and cost-effectiveness. However, accurately calibrating these sensors in uncontrolled environments remains a significant challenge. While expensive reference sensors can provide accurate ground truth data, they are often deployed on a limited scale due to high costs, leading to a scarcity of labeled data. In diverse urban environments, data distributions constantly shift due to varying factors such as traffic patterns, industrial activities, and weather conditions, which impact sensor readings. Consequently, traditional machine learning models -- despite their increasing deployment for environmental sensor calibration -- often struggle to provide reliable pollutant measurements across different locations due to domain shifts. To address these challenges, we propose a novel unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) method specifically tailored for regression tasks on graph-structured data. Our approach leverages Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to model the relationships between sensors. To effectively capture critical spatial-temporal interactions, we incorporate spatial-temporal graph neural networks (STGNNs), which extend GNNs by incorporating temporal dynamics. To handle the resulting larger embeddings, we propose a domain adaptation method using a closed-form solution inspired by the Tikhonov-regularized least-squares problem. This method leverages Cholesky decomposition and power iteration to align the subspaces between source and target domains. By aligning these subspaces, our approach allows low-cost IoT sensors to learn calibration parameters from expensive reference sensors. This facilitates reliable pollutant measurements in new locations without the need for additional costly equipment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatially Constrained Transformer with Efficient Global Relation Modelling for Spatio-Temporal Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06836v1)** | 2024-11-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate spatio-temporal prediction is crucial for the sustainable development of smart cities. However, current approaches often struggle to capture important spatio-temporal relationships, particularly overlooking global relations among distant city regions. Most existing techniques predominantly rely on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to capture global relations. However, CNNs exhibit neighbourhood bias, making them insufficient for capturing distant relations. To address this limitation, we propose ST-SampleNet, a novel transformer-based architecture that combines CNNs with self-attention mechanisms to capture both local and global relations effectively. Moreover, as the number of regions increases, the quadratic complexity of self-attention becomes a challenge. To tackle this issue, we introduce a lightweight region sampling strategy that prunes non-essential regions and enhances the efficiency of our approach. Furthermore, we introduce a spatially constrained position embedding that incorporates spatial neighbourhood information into the self-attention mechanism, aiding in semantic interpretation and improving the performance of ST-SampleNet. Our experimental evaluation on three real-world datasets demonstrates the effectiveness of ST-SampleNet. Additionally, our efficient variant achieves a 40% reduction in computational costs with only a marginal compromise in performance, approximately 1%.</p></details> |  |

| **[PRAGA: Prototype-aware Graph Adaptive Aggregation for Spatial Multi-modal Omics Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12728v3)** | 2024-11-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial multi-modal omics technology, highlighted by Nature Methods as an advanced biological technique in 2023, plays a critical role in resolving biological regulatory processes with spatial context. Recently, graph neural networks based on K-nearest neighbor (KNN) graphs have gained prominence in spatial multi-modal omics methods due to their ability to model semantic relations between sequencing spots. However, the fixed KNN graph fails to capture the latent semantic relations hidden by the inevitable data perturbations during the biological sequencing process, resulting in the loss of semantic information. In addition, the common lack of spot annotation and class number priors in practice further hinders the optimization of spatial multi-modal omics models. Here, we propose a novel spatial multi-modal omics resolved framework, termed PRototype-Aware Graph Adaptative Aggregation for Spatial Multi-modal Omics Analysis (PRAGA). PRAGA constructs a dynamic graph to capture latent semantic relations and comprehensively integrate spatial information and feature semantics. The learnable graph structure can also denoise perturbations by learning cross-modal knowledge. Moreover, a dynamic prototype contrastive learning is proposed based on the dynamic adaptability of Bayesian Gaussian Mixture Models to optimize the multi-modal omics representations for unknown biological priors. Quantitative and qualitative experiments on simulated and real datasets with 7 competing methods demonstrate the superior performance of PRAGA.</p></details> |  |

We present a general nonparametric method for such studies under the Bayesian ensemble learning paradigm called Soft Bayesian Additive Regression Trees. Our methodological and computational challenges include large number of clusters, variable cluster sizes, and proper statistical augmentation of the unobservable cluster-level covariate using a data registry different from the main survival study. We use an innovative 3-step approach based on latent variables to address our computational challenges. We illustrate our method and its advantages over existing methods by assessing the impacts of intervention in some county-level and patient-level covariates to mitigate existing racial disparity in breast cancer survival in 67 Florida counties (clusters) using two different data resources. Florida Cancer Registry (FCR) is used to obtain clustered survival data with patient-level covariates, and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Survey (BRFSS) is used to obtain further data information on an unobservable county-level covariate of Screening Mammography Utilization (SMU).</p></details> |  |
| **[Regularization of the ensemble Kalman filter using a non-parametric, non-stationary spatial model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14318v5)** | 2024-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The sample covariance matrix of a random vector is a good estimate of the true covariance matrix if the sample size is much larger than the length of the vector. In high-dimensional problems, this condition is never met. As a result, in high dimensions the Ensemble Kalman Filter's (EnKF) ensemble does not contain enough information to specify the prior covariance matrix accurately. This necessitates the need for regularization of the analysis (observation update) problem. We propose a regularization technique based on a new spatial model. The model is a constrained version of the general Gaussian process convolution model. The constraints include local stationarity and smoothness of local spectra. We regularize EnKF by postulating that its prior covariances obey the spatial model. Placing a hyperprior distribution on the model parameters and using the likelihood of the prior ensemble data allows for an optimized use of both the ensemble and the hyperprior. The respective estimator is shown to be consistent. Its neural Bayes implementation proved to be both accurate and computationally efficient. In simulation experiments, the new technique led to substantially better EnKF performance than several existing techniques.</p></details> | 50 pages, 9 figures |

This requires a model with a strong capacity to capture long-range dependencies. Existing models struggle in this regard due to the slow growth of receptive field for Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) based methods and patch-level interactions in Transformer-based methods, which are ineffective for capturing long-range dependencies. Motivated by this, we propose SEM-Net, a novel visual State Space model (SSM) vision network, modelling corrupted images at the pixel level while capturing long-range dependencies (LRDs) in state space, achieving a linear computational complexity. To address the inherent lack of spatial awareness in SSM, we introduce the Snake Mamba Block (SMB) and Spatially-Enhanced Feedforward Network. These innovations enable SEM-Net to outperform state-of-the-art inpainting methods on two distinct datasets, showing significant improvements in capturing LRDs and enhancement in spatial consistency. Additionally, SEM-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance on motion deblurring, demonstrating its generalizability.

Understanding three-dimensional (3D) spatial rotations can involve verbal descriptions and visual or interactive examples, illustrating how objects change orientation in 3D space. Recent studies show Artificial Intelligence (AI) with language and vision capabilities still face limitations in spatial reasoning. In this paper, we have studied generative AI's spatial capabilities of understanding rotations of objects utilizing its image and language processing features. We examined the spatial intelligence of the GPT-4 model with vision in understanding spatial rotation process with diagrams based on the Revised Purdue Spatial Visualization Test: Visualization of Rotations (Revised PSVT:R). Next, we incorporated a layer of coordinate system axes on Revised PSVT:R to study the variations in GPT-4's performance. We also examined GPT-4's understanding of 3D rotations in Augmented Reality (AR) scenes that visualize spatial rotations of an object in 3D space and observed increased accuracy of GPT-4's understanding of the rotations by adding supplementary textual information depicting the rotation process or mathematical representations of the rotation (e.g., matrices). The results indicate that while GPT-4 as a major current Generative AI model lacks the understanding of a spatial rotation process, it has the potential to understand the rotation process with additional information that can be provided by methods such as AR. By combining the potentials in spatial intelligence of AI with AR's interactive visualization abilities, we expect to offer enhanced guidance for students' spatial learning activities. Such spatial guidance can benefit understanding spatial transformations and additionally support processes like assembly, fabrication, and manufacturing.</p></details> |  |
| **[GIS Copilot: Towards an Autonomous GIS Agent for Spatial Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03205v3)** | 2024-11-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in Generative AI offer promising capabilities for spatial analysis. Despite their potential, the integration of generative AI with established GIS platforms remains underexplored. In this study, we propose a framework for integrating LLMs directly into existing GIS platforms, using QGIS as an example. Our approach leverages the reasoning and programming capabilities of LLMs to autonomously generate spatial analysis workflows and code through an informed agent that has comprehensive documentation of key GIS tools and parameters. The implementation of this framework resulted in the development of a "GIS Copilot" that allows GIS users to interact with QGIS using natural language commands for spatial analysis. The GIS Copilot was evaluated with over 100 spatial analysis tasks with three complexity levels: basic tasks that require one GIS tool and typically involve one data layer to perform simple operations; intermediate tasks involving multi-step processes with multiple tools, guided by user instructions; and advanced tasks which involve multi-step processes that require multiple tools but not guided by user instructions, necessitating the agent to independently decide on and executes the necessary steps. The evaluation reveals that the GIS Copilot demonstrates strong potential in automating foundational GIS operations, with a high success rate in tool selection and code generation for basic and intermediate tasks, while challenges remain in achieving full autonomy for more complex tasks. This study contributes to the emerging vision of Autonomous GIS, providing a pathway for non-experts to engage with geospatial analysis with minimal prior expertise. While full autonomy is yet to be achieved, the GIS Copilot demonstrates significant potential for simplifying GIS workflows and enhancing decision-making processes.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Empirical Analysis on Spatial Reasoning Capabilities of Large Multimodal Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06048v1)** | 2024-11-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have achieved strong performance across a range of vision and language tasks. However, their spatial reasoning capabilities are under-investigated. In this paper, we construct a novel VQA dataset, Spatial-MM, to comprehensively study LMMs' spatial understanding and reasoning capabilities. Our analyses on object-relationship and multi-hop reasoning reveal several important findings. Firstly, bounding boxes and scene graphs, even synthetic ones, can significantly enhance LMMs' spatial reasoning. Secondly, LMMs struggle more with questions posed from the human perspective than the camera perspective about the image. Thirdly, chain of thought (CoT) prompting does not improve model performance on complex multi-hop questions involving spatial relations. % Moreover, spatial reasoning steps are much less accurate than non-spatial ones across MLLMs. Lastly, our perturbation analysis on GQA-spatial reveals that LMMs are much stronger at basic object detection than complex spatial reasoning. We believe our benchmark dataset and in-depth analyses can spark further research on LMMs spatial reasoning.

However, sorting through this data for specific scenarios is a meticulous and error-prone process, often dependent on the application, and lacks generality and reproducibility. In this work, we introduce SpREs as a novel querying language for pattern matching over perception streams containing spatial and temporal data derived from multi-modal dynamic environments. To highlight the capabilities of SpREs, we developed the STREM tool as both an offline and online pattern matching framework for perception data. We demonstrate the offline capabilities of STREM through a case study on a publicly available AV dataset (Woven Planet Perception) and its online capabilities through a case study integrating STREM in ROS with the CARLA simulator. We also conduct performance benchmark experiments on various SpRE queries. Using our matching framework, we are able to find over 20,000 matches within 296 ms making STREM applicable in runtime monitoring applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the International Journal on Software Tools for Technology Transfer</p></details> |

Based on this, we explore spatial modulation (SM) and space shift keying (SSK) designs as pivotal techniques to enhance spectral efficiency (SE) and bit-error rate (BER) performance in the LEO satellite-assisted multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. The various performance analysis of these designs are presented in this paper, revealing insightful findings and conclusions through analytical methods and Monte Carlo simulations with perfect and imperfect channel state information (CSI) estimation. The results provide a comprehensive analysis of the merits and trade-offs associated with the investigated schemes, particularly in terms of BER, computational complexity, and SE. This analysis underscores the potential of both schemes as viable candidates for future 6G LEO satellite-assisted wireless communication systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Demystifying Spatial Confounding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16861v2)** | 2024-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial confounding is a fundamental issue in spatial regression models which arises because spatial random effects, included to approximate unmeasured spatial variation, are typically not independent of covariates in the model. This can lead to significant bias in covariate effect estimates. The problem is complex and has been the topic of extensive research with sometimes puzzling and seemingly contradictory results. Here, we develop a broad theoretical framework that brings mathematical clarity to the mechanisms of spatial confounding, providing explicit analytical expressions for the resulting bias. We see that the problem is directly linked to spatial smoothing and identify exactly how the size and occurrence of bias relate to the features of the spatial model as well as the underlying confounding scenario. Using our results, we can explain subtle and counter-intuitive behaviours. Finally, we propose a general approach for dealing with spatial confounding bias in practice, applicable for any spatial model specification. When a covariate has non-spatial information, we show that a general form of the so-called spatial+ method can be used to eliminate bias. When no such information is present, the situation is more challenging but, under the assumption of unconfounded high frequencies, we develop a procedure in which multiple capped versions of spatial+ are applied to assess the bias in this case. We illustrate our approach with an application to air temperature in Germany.</p></details> |  |

While supervised methods demonstrate proficiency, their reliance on extensive pixel-level annotations limits scalability. We introduce DynaSeg, an innovative unsupervised image segmentation approach that overcomes the challenge of balancing feature similarity and spatial continuity without relying on extensive hyperparameter tuning. Unlike traditional methods, DynaSeg employs a dynamic weighting scheme that automates parameter tuning, adapts flexibly to image characteristics, and facilitates easy integration with other segmentation networks. By incorporating a Silhouette Score Phase, DynaSeg prevents undersegmentation failures where the number of predicted clusters might converge to one. DynaSeg uses CNN-based and pre-trained ResNet feature extraction, making it computationally efficient and more straightforward than other complex models. Experimental results showcase state-of-the-art performance, achieving a 12.2% and 14.12% mIOU improvement over current unsupervised segmentation approaches on COCO-All and COCO-Stuff datasets, respectively. We provide qualitative and quantitative results on five benchmark datasets, demonstrating the efficacy of the proposed approach.

| **[Spatial Transformers for Radio Map Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01211v2)** | 2024-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Radio map estimation (RME) involves spatial interpolation of radio measurements to predict metrics such as the received signal strength at locations where no measurements were collected. The most popular estimators nowadays project the measurement locations to a regular grid and complete the resulting measurement tensor with a convolutional deep neural network. Unfortunately, these approaches suffer from poor spatial resolution and require a great number of parameters. The first contribution of this paper addresses these limitations by means of an attention-based estimator named Spatial TransfOrmer for Radio Map estimation (STORM). This scheme not only outperforms the existing estimators, but also exhibits lower computational complexity, translation equivariance, rotation equivariance, and full spatial resolution. The second contribution is an extended transformer architecture that allows STORM to perform active sensing, by which the next measurement location is selected based on the previous measurements. This is particularly useful for minimization of drive tests (MDT) in cellular networks, where operators request user equipment to collect measurements. Finally, STORM is extensively validated by experiments with one ray-tracing and two real-measurement datasets.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we address the challenging task of Multi-Image Super-Resolution in Remote Sensing (MISR-RS), aiming to generate a High-Resolution (HR) image from multiple Low-Resolution (LR) images obtained by satellites. Recently, the weak temporal correlations among LR images have attracted increasing attention in the MISR-RS task. However, existing MISR methods treat the LR images as sequences with strong temporal correlations, overlooking spatial correlations and imposing temporal dependencies. To address this problem, we propose a novel end-to-end framework named Enhancing Spatial Correlations in MISR (ESC-MISR), which fully exploits the spatial-temporal relations of multiple images for HR image reconstruction. Specifically, we first introduce a novel fusion module named Multi-Image Spatial Transformer (MIST), which emphasizes parts with clearer global spatial features and enhances the spatial correlations between LR images. Besides, we perform a random shuffle strategy for the sequential inputs of LR images to attenuate temporal dependencies and capture weak temporal correlations in the training stage. Compared with the state-of-the-art methods, our ESC-MISR achieves 0.70dB and 0.76dB cPSNR improvements on the two bands of the PROBA-V dataset respectively, demonstrating the superiority of our method.</p></details> |  |

Our proposed method aims to achieve the balance between the homogeneity within the clusters and the heterogeneity between clusters. The proposed algorithm maximises the ratio of the variation between clusters and the variation within clusters while adjusting for the number of clusters and number of observations. The proposed algorithm is robust against distributional assumptions and the presence of outliers. Simulations have been used to validate the algorithm. We further evaluated the stability and the efficacy of the proposed algorithm using three real-world datasets. Moreover, we compared the performance of our model with 13 other traditional algorithms for determining the number of clusters. We found that the proposed algorithm outperformed 11 of the algorithms considered for comparison in terms of clustering number determination. The finding demonstrates that the proposed method provides a reliable alternative to determine the number of clusters for multivariate data.</p></details> |  |

Both tasks are solved by a two-step hierarchical algorithm. The first step differs for the two tasks generating either a piecewise-affine or a Dubins reference path. The second step leverages a transformation of vehicle dynamics from the time domain into the spatial domain and linear programming. Benefits such as a hyperparameter-free objective function and spatial constraints useful for area coverage gaps avoidance and precision path planning are discussed. The method, which is a deterministic optimisation-based method, is evaluated on 5 real-world fields solving 19 instances of the first task and 84 instances of the second task.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 11 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

However, current multi-modal medical datasets offer only general text annotations, lacking lesion-specific details critical for extracting nuanced features, especially for fine-grained segmentation of tumor boundaries and small lesions. To address these limitations, we developed datasets with lesion-specific text annotations for liver tumors and introduced the TexLiverNet model. TexLiverNet employs an agent-based cross-attention module that integrates text features efficiently with visual features, significantly reducing computational costs. Additionally, enhanced spatial and adaptive frequency domain perception is proposed to precisely delineate lesion boundaries, reduce background interference, and recover fine details in small lesions. Comprehensive evaluations on public and private datasets demonstrate that TexLiverNet achieves superior performance compared to current state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

This is motivated by the problem arising in demography of estimating the covariance matrix of the total fertility rate (TFR) of 195 different countries when only 11 observations are available. We construct an estimator for high-dimensional covariance matrices by exploiting information about pairwise covariates, such as whether pairs of variables belong to the same cluster, or spatial structure of the variables, and interactions between the covariates. We reformulate the problem in terms of a mixed effects model. This requires the estimation of only a small number of parameters, which are easy to interpret and which can be selected using standard procedures. The estimator is consistent under general conditions, and asymptotically normal. It works if the mean and variance structure of the data is already specified or if some of the data are missing. We assess its performance under our model assumptions, as well as under model misspecification, using simulations. We find that it outperforms several popular alternatives. We apply it to the TFR dataset and draw some conclusions.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 5 figures, submitted to the Annals of Applied Statistics</p></details> |

Due to the diversities of SnS characteristics among different propagation paths, the concurrent channel estimation of multiple paths becomes intractable. To address this challenge, we propose a two-phase channel estimation scheme. In the first phase, the angles of departure (AoDs) on the user side are estimated, and a carefully designed pilot transmission scheme enables the decomposition of the received signal from different paths. In the second phase, the subchannel estimation corresponding to different paths is formulated as a three-layer Bayesian inference problem. Specifically, the first layer captures block sparsity in the angular domain, the second layer promotes SnS property in the antenna domain, and the third layer decouples the subchannels from the observed signals. To efficiently facilitate Bayesian inference, we propose a novel three-layer generalized approximate message passing (TL-GAMP) algorithm based on structured variational massage passing and belief propagation rules. Simulation results validate the convergence and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, showcasing its robustness to different channel scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>A rev...</summary><p>A revised manuscript has been submitted to the IEEE journal for possible publication</p></details> |

While state-space networks, including Mamba, a revolutionary advancement in recurrent neural networks, typically scan input sequences from left to right, they face difficulties in designing effective scanning strategies, especially in the processing of image data. Our method demonstrates that integrating wavelet transformation into Mamba enhances the local structure awareness of visual inputs and better captures long-range relations of frequencies by disentangling them into wavelet subbands, representing both low- and high-frequency components. These wavelet-based outputs are then processed and seamlessly fused with the original Mamba outputs through a cross-attention fusion layer, combining both spatial and frequency information to optimize the order awareness of state-space models which is essential for the details and overall quality of image generation. Besides, we introduce a globally-shared transformer to supercharge the performance of Mamba, harnessing its exceptional power to capture global relationships. Through extensive experiments on standard benchmarks, our method demonstrates superior results compared to DiT and DIFFUSSM, achieving faster training convergence and delivering high-quality outputs.

A significant amount of statistical research has already been introduced, such as generalized least square optimization by incorporating spatial variance-covariance matrix, considering basis functions in the input nodes of the neural networks, and so on. However, for lattice data, there is no available literature about the utilization of asymptotic analysis of neural networks in regression for spatial data. This article proposes a consistent localized two-layer deep neural network-based regression for spatial data. We have proved the consistency of this deep neural network for bounded and unbounded spatial domains under a fixed sampling design of mixed-increasing spatial regions. We have proved that its asymptotic convergence rate is faster than that of \cite{zhan2024neural}'s neural network and an improved generalization of \cite{shen2023asymptotic}'s neural network structure. We empirically observe the rate of convergence of discrepancy measures between the empirical probability distribution of observed and predicted data, which will become faster for a less smooth spatial surface. We have applied our asymptotic analysis of deep neural networks to the estimation of the monthly average temperature of major cities in the USA from its satellite image. This application is an effective showcase of non-linear spatial regression. We demonstrate our methodology with simulated lattice data in various scenarios.</p></details> |  |

While several architectures have been proposed within the commonly employed grounding-by-selection framework, the utilized losses are comparatively under-explored. In particular, most methods rely on a basic supervised cross-entropy loss on the predicted distribution over candidate instances, which fails to model both spatial relations between instances and the internal fine-grained word-level structure of the verbal referral. Sparse attempts to additionally supervise verbal embeddings globally by learning the class of the referred instance from the description or employing verbo-visual contrast to better separate instance embeddings do not fundamentally lift the aforementioned limitations. Responding to these shortcomings, we introduce two novel losses for 3D visual grounding: a visual-level offset loss on regressed vector offsets from each instance to the ground-truth referred instance and a language-related span loss on predictions for the word-level span of the referred instance in the description. In addition, we equip the verbo-visual fusion module of our new 3D visual grounding architecture AsphaltNet with a top-down bidirectional attentive fusion block, which enables the supervisory signals from our two losses to propagate to the respective converse branches of the network and thus aid the latter to learn context-aware instance embeddings and grounding-aware verbal embeddings. AsphaltNet proposes novel auxiliary losses to aid 3D visual grounding with competitive results compared to the state-of-the-art on the ReferIt3D benchmark.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at WACV 2025</p></details> |

In this paper, we propose a unified framework that blindly estimates reverberation time (T60), direct-to-reverberant ratio (DRR), and clarity (C50) across 10 frequency bands using first-order Ambisonics (FOA) speech recordings as inputs. The proposed framework utilizes a novel feature named Spectro-Spatial Covariance Vector (SSCV), efficiently representing temporal, spectral as well as spatial information of the FOA signal. Our models significantly outperform existing single-channel methods with only spectral information, reducing estimation errors by more than half for all three acoustic parameters. Additionally, we introduce FOA-Conv3D, a novel back-end network for effectively utilising the SSCV feature with a 3D convolutional encoder.

The proposed method has two key elements: Spatial Consistency regularization Loss (SCL) and Feature converter Module (FM). SCL prevents overfitting in student models by avoiding excessive imitation of the teacher model. Simultaneously, it facilitates the expansion of normal data features by steering clear of abnormal areas generated through data augmentation. This dual functionality ensures a robust boundary between normal and abnormal data. The FM prevents the learning of ambiguous information from the FE. This protects the learned features and enables more effective detection of structural and logical anomalies. Through these elements, SPACE is available to minimize the influence of the FE while integrating various data augmentations.In this study, we evaluated the proposed method on the MVTec LOCO, MVTec AD, and VisA datasets. Experimental results, through qualitative evaluation, demonstrate the superiority of detection and efficiency of each module compared to state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to WACV 2025</p></details> |

Courtesy of contemporary research on laser attacks, laser-based fault injection (LFI) is becoming even more precise where an adversary can thwart chip security by altering individual flip-flop (FF) values. Different laser models, e.g., bit flip, bit set, and bit reset, have been developed to appreciate LFI on practical targets. As traditional approaches may incorporate substantial overhead, state-based SPARSE and transition-based TAMED countermeasures were proposed in our prior work to improve FSM resiliency efficiently. TAMED overcame SPARSE's limitation of being too conservative, and generating multiple LFI resilient encodings for contemporary LFI models on demand. SPARSE, however, incorporated design layout information into its vulnerability estimation which makes its vulnerability estimation metric more accurate. In this paper, we extend TAMED by proposing a transition-based encoding CAD framework (TRANSPOSE), that incorporates spatial transitional vulnerability metrics to quantify design susceptibility of FSMs based on both the bit flip model and the set-reset models. TRANSPOSE also incorporates floorplan optimization into its framework to accommodate secure spatial inter-distance of FF-sensitive regions.

Recent studies on collaborative perception mostly utilize CNNs or Transformers to learn feature representation and fusion in the spatial dimension, which struggle to handle long-range spatial-temporal features under limited computing and communication resources. Holistically modeling the dependencies over extensive spatial areas and extended temporal frames is crucial to enhancing feature quality. To this end, we propose a resource efficient cross-agent spatial-temporal collaborative state space model (SSM), named CollaMamba. Initially, we construct a foundational backbone network based on spatial SSM. This backbone adeptly captures positional causal dependencies from both single-agent and cross-agent views, yielding compact and comprehensive intermediate features while maintaining linear complexity. Furthermore, we devise a history-aware feature boosting module based on temporal SSM, extracting contextual cues from extended historical frames to refine vague features while preserving low overhead. Extensive experiments across several datasets demonstrate that CollaMamba outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving higher model accuracy while reducing computational and communication overhead by up to 71.9% and 1/64, respectively. This work pioneers the exploration of the Mamba's potential in collaborative perception. The source code will be made available.</p></details> |  |

Delving Into Spatial Reasoning for Vision Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14852v2)** | 2024-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across a wide range of tasks and domains. Despite this promise, spatial understanding and reasoning -- a fundamental component of human cognition -- remains under-explored. We propose SpatialEval, a novel benchmark that covers diverse aspects of spatial reasoning such as relationship understanding, navigation, and counting. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of competitive language and vision-language models. Our findings reveal several counter-intuitive insights that have been overlooked in the literature: (1) Spatial reasoning poses significant challenges where competitive models can fall behind random guessing; (2) Despite additional visual input, VLMs often under-perform compared to their LLM counterparts; (3) When both textual and visual information is available, multi-modal language models become less reliant on visual information if sufficient textual clues are provided. Additionally, we demonstrate that leveraging redundancy between vision and text can significantly enhance model performance. We hope our study will inform the development of multimodal models to improve spatial intelligence and further close the gap with human intelligence.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |
| **[SPACE: 3D Spatial Co-operation and Exploration Framework for Robust Mapping and Coverage with Multi-Robot Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02524v1)** | 2024-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In indoor environments, multi-robot visual (RGB-D) mapping and exploration hold immense potential for application in domains such as domestic service and logistics, where deploying multiple robots in the same environment can significantly enhance efficiency. However, there are two primary challenges: (1) the "ghosting trail" effect, which occurs due to overlapping views of robots impacting the accuracy and quality of point cloud reconstruction, and (2) the oversight of visual reconstructions in selecting the most effective frontiers for exploration. Given these challenges are interrelated, we address them together by proposing a new semi-distributed framework (SPACE) for spatial cooperation in indoor environments that enables enhanced coverage and 3D mapping. SPACE leverages geometric techniques, including "mutual awareness" and a "dynamic robot filter," to overcome spatial mapping constraints. Additionally, we introduce a novel spatial frontier detection system and map merger, integrated with an adaptive frontier assigner for optimal coverage balancing the exploration and reconstruction objectives. In extensive ROS-Gazebo simulations, SPACE demonstrated superior performance over state-of-the-art approaches in both exploration and mapping metrics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Grid-Based Projection of Spatial Data into Knowledge Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02309v1)** | 2024-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Spatial Knowledge Graphs (SKG) are experiencing growing adoption as a means to model real-world entities, proving especially invaluable in domains like crisis management and urban planning. Considering that RDF specifications offer limited support for effectively managing spatial information, it's common practice to include text-based serializations of geometrical features, such as polygons and lines, as string literals in knowledge graphs. Consequently, Spatial Knowledge Graphs (SKGs) often rely on geo-enabled RDF Stores capable of parsing, interpreting, and indexing such serializations. In this paper, we leverage grid cells as the foundational element of SKGs and demonstrate how efficiently the spatial characteristics of real-world entities and their attributes can be encoded within knowledge graphs. Furthermore, we introduce a novel methodology for representing street networks in knowledge graphs, diverging from the conventional practice of individually capturing each street segment. Instead, our approach is based on tessellating the street network using grid cells and creating a simplified representation that could be utilized for various routing and navigation tasks, solely relying on RDF specifications.</p></details> |  |
| **[ManiBox: Enhancing Spatial Grasping Generalization via Scalable Simulation Data Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01850v1)** | 2024-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning a precise robotic grasping policy is crucial for embodied agents operating in complex real-world manipulation tasks. Despite significant advancements, most models still struggle with accurate spatial positioning of objects to be grasped. We first show that this spatial generalization challenge stems primarily from the extensive data requirements for adequate spatial understanding. However, collecting such data with real robots is prohibitively expensive, and relying on simulation data often leads to visual generalization gaps upon deployment. To overcome these challenges, we then focus on state-based policy generalization and present \textbf{ManiBox}, a novel bounding-box-guided manipulation method built on a simulation-based teacher-student framework. The teacher policy efficiently generates scalable simulation data using bounding boxes, which are proven to uniquely determine the objects' spatial positions. The student policy then utilizes these low-dimensional spatial states to enable zero-shot transfer to real robots. Through comprehensive evaluations in simulated and real-world environments, ManiBox demonstrates a marked improvement in spatial grasping generalization and adaptability to diverse objects and backgrounds. Further, our empirical study into scaling laws for policy performance indicates that spatial volume generalization scales positively with data volume. For a certain level of spatial volume, the success rate of grasping empirically follows Michaelis-Menten kinetics relative to data volume, showing a saturation effect as data increases. Our videos and code are available in https://thkkk.github.io/manibox.</p></details> |  |
| **[FedASTA: Federated adaptive spatial-temporal attention for traffic flow prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13090v2)** | 2024-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mobile devices and the Internet of Things (IoT) devices nowadays generate a large amount of heterogeneous spatial-temporal data. It remains a challenging problem to model the spatial-temporal dynamics under privacy concern. Federated learning (FL) has been proposed as a framework to enable model training across distributed devices without sharing original data which reduce privacy concern. Personalized federated learning (PFL) methods further address data heterogenous problem. However, these methods don't consider natural spatial relations among nodes. For the sake of modeling spatial relations, Graph Neural Netowork (GNN) based FL approach have been proposed. But dynamic spatial-temporal relations among edge nodes are not taken into account. Several approaches model spatial-temporal dynamics in a centralized environment, while less effort has been made under federated setting. To overcome these challeges, we propose a novel Federated Adaptive Spatial-Temporal Attention (FedASTA) framework to model the dynamic spatial-temporal relations. On the client node, FedASTA extracts temporal relations and trend patterns from the decomposed terms of original time series. Then, on the server node, FedASTA utilize trend patterns from clients to construct adaptive temporal-spatial aware graph which captures dynamic correlation between clients. Besides, we design a masked spatial attention module with both static graph and constructed adaptive graph to model spatial dependencies among clients. Extensive experiments on five real-world public traffic flow datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-art performance in federated scenario. In addition, the experiments made in centralized setting show the effectiveness of our novel adaptive graph construction approach compared with other popular dynamic spatial-temporal aware methods.</p></details> |  |

An interaction can be either static (based on overlap of space use) or dynamic (based on movement). The goal of this work is to determine the level of static interactions between individuals from the same-species of wild animals using 95\% and 50\% home ranges, as well as to model their movement interactions, which could include attraction, avoidance (or repulsion), or lack of interaction, in order to gain new insights and improve our understanding of ecological processes. Home range estimation methods (minimum convex polygon, kernel density estimator, and autocorrelated kernel density estimator), inhomogeneous multitype (or cross-type) summary statistics, and envelope testing methods (pointwise and global envelope tests) were proposed to study the nature of the same-species wild-animal spatial interactions. Using GPS collar data, we applied the methods to quantify both static and dynamic interactions between black bears in southern Alabama, USA. In general, our findings suggest that the black bears in our dataset showed no significant preference to live together or apart, i.e., there was no significant deviation from independence toward association or avoidance (i.e., segregation) between the bears.</p></details> |  |

However, accurately capturing interactions across multiple spatial and temporal scales remains a significant challenge. We present a novel framework that jointly models spatial and temporal multiscale interactions in molecular dynamics. Our approach leverages Graph Fourier Transforms to decompose molecular structures into different spatial scales and employs Neural Ordinary Differential Equations to model the temporal dynamics in a curated manner influenced by the spatial modes. This unified framework links spatial structures with temporal evolution in a flexible manner, enabling more accurate and comprehensive simulations of molecular systems. We evaluate our model on the MD17 dataset, demonstrating consistent performance improvements over state-of-the-art baselines across multiple molecules, particularly under challenging conditions such as irregular timestep sampling and long-term prediction horizons. Ablation studies confirm the significant contributions of both spatial and temporal multiscale modeling components. Our method advances the simulation of complex molecular systems, potentially accelerating research in computational chemistry, drug discovery, and materials science.</p></details> |  |

However, costs, rapidly evolving technology, and lack of standards have constrained computational methods in ST to narrow tasks and small cohorts. In addition, the underlying tissue morphology, as reflected by H&E-stained whole slide images (WSIs), encodes rich information often overlooked in ST studies. Here, we introduce HEST-1k, a collection of 1,229 spatial transcriptomic profiles, each linked to a WSI and extensive metadata. HEST-1k was assembled from 153 public and internal cohorts encompassing 26 organs, two species (Homo Sapiens and Mus Musculus), and 367 cancer samples from 25 cancer types. HEST-1k processing enabled the identification of 2.1 million expression--morphology pairs and over 76 million nuclei. To support its development, we additionally introduce the HEST-Library, a Python package designed to perform a range of actions with HEST samples. We test HEST-1k and Library on three use cases: (1) benchmarking foundation models for pathology (HEST-Benchmark), (2) biomarker exploration, and (3) multimodal representation learning.

The inherent uncertainty and variability in such data often render deterministic models insufficient, prompting a shift towards probabilistic approaches, where diffusion-based generative models have emerged as effective solutions. In this paper, we present ProGen, a novel framework for probabilistic spatiotemporal time series forecasting that leverages Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs) and diffusion-based generative modeling techniques in the continuous domain. By integrating a novel denoising score model, graph neural networks, and a tailored SDE, ProGen provides a robust solution that effectively captures spatiotemporal dependencies while managing uncertainty. Our extensive experiments on four benchmark traffic datasets demonstrate that ProGen outperforms state-of-the-art deterministic and probabilistic models. This work contributes a continuous, diffusion-based generative approach to spatiotemporal forecasting, paving the way for future research in probabilistic modeling and stochastic processes.</p></details> |  |

We use the setting of spatially invariant systems as an idealization for which concrete and detailed results are given. Such estimators are known to have a degree of spatial localization in the sense that the estimator gains decay in space, with the spatial decay rates serving as a proxy for how far measurements need to be shared in an optimal distributed estimator. In particular, we examine the dependence of spatial decay rates on problem specifications such as system dynamics, measurement and process noise variances, as well as their spatial autocorrelations. We propose non-dimensional parameters that characterize the decay rates as a function of problem specifications. In particular, we find an interesting matching condition between the characteristic lengthscale of the dynamics and the measurement noise correlation lengthscale for which the optimal centralized estimator is completely decentralized. A new technique - termed the Branch Point Locus - is introduced to quantify spatial decay rates in terms of analyticity regions in the complex spatial frequency plane. Our results are illustrated through two case studies of systems with dynamics modeled by diffusion and the Swift-Hohenberg equation, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[Local Indicators of Mark Association for Spatial Marked Point Processes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01065v1)** | 2024-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The emergence of distinct local mark behaviours is becoming increasingly common in the applications of spatial marked point processes. This dynamic highlights the limitations of existing global mark correlation functions in accurately identifying the true patterns of mark associations/variations among points as distinct mark behaviours might dominate one another, giving rise to an incomplete understanding of mark associations. In this paper, we introduce a family of local indicators of mark association (LIMA) functions for spatial marked point processes. These functions are defined on general state spaces and can include marks that are either real-valued or function-valued. Unlike global mark correlation functions, which are often distorted by the existence of distinct mark behaviours, LIMA functions reliably identify all types of mark associations and variations among points. Additionally, they accurately determine the interpoint distances where individual points show significant mark associations. Through simulation studies, featuring various scenarios, and four real applications in forestry, criminology, and urban mobility, we study spatial marked point processes in $\R^2$ and on linear networks with either real-valued or function-valued marks, demonstrating that LIMA functions significantly outperform the existing global mark correlation functions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted for publication</p></details> |

In this study, we develop and enhance score-based diffusion models in field reconstruction tasks, where the goal is to estimate complete spatial fields from partial observations. We introduce a condition encoding approach to construct a tractable mapping mapping between observed and unobserved regions using a learnable integration of sparse observations and interpolated fields as an inductive bias. With refined sensing representations and an unraveled temporal dimension, our method can handle arbitrary moving sensors and effectively reconstruct fields. Furthermore, we conduct a comprehensive benchmark of our approach against a deterministic interpolation-based method across various static and time-dependent PDEs. Our study attempts to addresses the gap in strong baselines for evaluating performance across varying sampling hyperparameters, noise levels, and conditioning methods. Our results show that diffusion models with cross-attention and the proposed conditional encoding generally outperform other methods under noisy conditions, although the deterministic method excels with noiseless data. Additionally, both the diffusion models and the deterministic method surpass the numerical approach in accuracy and computational cost for the steady problem. We also demonstrate the ability of the model to capture possible reconstructions and improve the accuracy of fused results in covariance-based correction tasks using ensemble sampling.</p></details> |  |
| **[How to Bridge Spatial and Temporal Heterogeneity in Link Prediction? A Contrastive Method](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00612v1)** | 2024-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal Heterogeneous Networks play a crucial role in capturing the dynamics and heterogeneity inherent in various real-world complex systems, rendering them a noteworthy research avenue for link prediction. However, existing methods fail to capture the fine-grained differential distribution patterns and temporal dynamic characteristics, which we refer to as spatial heterogeneity and temporal heterogeneity. To overcome such limitations, we propose a novel \textbf{C}ontrastive Learning-based \textbf{L}ink \textbf{P}rediction model, \textbf{CLP}, which employs a multi-view hierarchical self-supervised architecture to encode spatial and temporal heterogeneity. Specifically, aiming at spatial heterogeneity, we develop a spatial feature modeling layer to capture the fine-grained topological distribution patterns from node- and edge-level representations, respectively. Furthermore, aiming at temporal heterogeneity, we devise a temporal information modeling layer to perceive the evolutionary dependencies of dynamic graph topologies from time-level representations. Finally, we encode the spatial and temporal distribution heterogeneity from a contrastive learning perspective, enabling a comprehensive self-supervised hierarchical relation modeling for the link prediction task. Extensive experiments conducted on four real-world dynamic heterogeneous network datasets verify that our \mymodel consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art models, demonstrating an average improvement of 10.10\%, 13.44\% in terms of AUC and AP, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[Human Action Recognition (HAR) Using Skeleton-based Spatial Temporal Relative Transformer Network: ST-RTR](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23806v2)** | 2024-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human Action Recognition (HAR) is an interesting research area in human-computer interaction used to monitor the activities of elderly and disabled individuals affected by physical and mental health. In the recent era, skeleton-based HAR has received much attention because skeleton data has shown that it can handle changes in striking, body size, camera views, and complex backgrounds. One key characteristic of ST-GCN is automatically learning spatial and temporal patterns from skeleton sequences. It has some limitations, as this method only works for short-range correlation due to its limited receptive field. Consequently, understanding human action requires long-range interconnection. To address this issue, we developed a spatial-temporal relative transformer ST-RTR model. The ST-RTR includes joint and relay nodes, which allow efficient communication and data transmission within the network. These nodes help to break the inherent spatial and temporal skeleton topologies, which enables the model to understand long-range human action better. Furthermore, we combine ST-RTR with a fusion model for further performance improvements. To assess the performance of the ST-RTR method, we conducted experiments on three skeleton-based HAR benchmarks: NTU RGB+D 60, NTU RGB+D 120, and UAV-Human. It boosted CS and CV by 2.11 % and 1.45% on NTU RGB+D 60, 1.25% and 1.05% on NTU RGB+D 120. On UAV-Human datasets, accuracy improved by 2.54%. The experimental outcomes explain that the proposed ST-RTR model significantly improves action recognition associated with the standard ST-GCN method.</p></details> |  |

Here, we provide theoretical conditions under which cooperation thrive in spatial PGGs on any population structure, which are accurate under weak selection. We find that PGGs can support cooperation across all kinds of model details and on almost all network structures in contrast to pairwise games. For example, a class of networks that would otherwise fail to produce cooperation, such as star graphs, are particularly conducive to cooperation in spatial PGGs. This fundamental advantage of spatial PGGs derives from reciprocity through second-order interactions, allowing local structures such as the clustering coefficient to play positive roles. We also verify the robustness of spatial PGGs on empirical networks where pairwise games cannot support cooperation, which implies that PGGs could be a universal interaction mode in real-world systems.</p></details> | 56 pages, 9 figures |

Understanding traffic speeds on any given road segment can be highly beneficial for traffic management strategists seeking to reduce congestion. While recent studies have primarily focused on modeling spatial dependencies by using graph convolutional networks (GCNs) over fixed weighted graphs, the relationships between nodes are often more complex, with edges that interact dynamically. This paper addresses both the temporal patterns in traffic data and the intricate spatial dependencies by introducing the Signal-Enhanced Graph Convolutional Network Long Short Term Memory (SGCN-LSTM) model for predicting traffic speeds across road networks. Extensive experiments on the PEMS-BAY road network traffic dataset demonstrate the SGCN-LSTM model's effectiveness, yielding significant improvements in Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) compared to benchmark models on the same dataset.</p></details> | 5 pages, 6 figures |

Most of the existing models achieve either spectral or spatial compression, and do not jointly consider the spatio-spectral redundancies present in HSIs. To address this problem, in this paper we focus our attention on the High Fidelity Compression (HiFiC) model (which is proven to be highly effective for spatial compression problems) and adapt it to perform spatio-spectral compression of HSIs. In detail, we introduce two new models: i) HiFiC using Squeeze and Excitation (SE) blocks (denoted as HiFiC$_{SE}$); and ii) HiFiC with 3D convolutions (denoted as HiFiC$_{3D}$) in the framework of compression of HSIs. We analyze the effectiveness of HiFiC$_{SE}$ and HiFiC$_{3D}$ in compressing the spatio-spectral redundancies with channel attention and inter-dependency analysis. Experimental results show the efficacy of the proposed models in performing spatio-spectral compression, while reconstructing images at reduced bitrates with higher reconstruction quality. The code of the proposed models is publicly available at https://git.tu-berlin.de/rsim/HSI-SSC .</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at 14th IEEE GRSS Workshop on Hyperspectral Image and Signal Processing: Evolution in Remote Sensing (WHISPERS), 2024</p></details> |

To efficiently handle TkQs, many indexes have been developed, but the effectiveness of TkQ is limited. To improve effectiveness, several deep learning models have recently been proposed, but they suffer severe efficiency issues and there are no efficient indexes specifically designed to accelerate the top-k search process for these deep learning models. To tackle these issues, we consider embedding based spatial keyword queries, which capture the semantic meaning of query keywords and object descriptions in two separate embeddings to evaluate textual relevance. Although various models can be used to generate these embeddings, no indexes have been specifically designed for such queries. To fill this gap, we propose LIST, a novel machine learning based Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search index that Learns to Index the Spatio-Textual data. LIST utilizes a new learning-to-cluster technique to group relevant queries and objects together while separating irrelevant queries and objects. There are two key challenges in building an effective and efficient index, i.e., the absence of high-quality labels and the unbalanced clustering results. We develop a novel pseudo-label generation technique to address the two challenges. Additionally, we introduce a learning based spatial relevance model that can integrates with various text relevance models to form a lightweight yet effective relevance for reranking objects retrieved by LIST.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by VLDB Journal</p></details> |

Existing approaches often address these dimensions in isolation, neglecting their critical interdependencies. In this paper, we introduce the Spatio-Temporal Unitized Model (STUM), a unified framework designed to capture both spatial and temporal dependencies while addressing spatio-temporal heterogeneity through techniques such as distribution alignment and feature fusion. It also ensures both predictive accuracy and computational efficiency. Central to STUM is the Adaptive Spatio-temporal Unitized Cell (ASTUC), which utilizes low-rank matrices to seamlessly store, update, and interact with space, time, as well as their correlations. Our framework is also modular, allowing it to integrate with various spatio-temporal graph neural networks through components such as backbone models, feature extractors, residual fusion blocks, and predictive modules to collectively enhance forecasting outcomes. Experimental results across multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that STUM consistently improves prediction performance with minimal computational cost. These findings are further supported by hyperparameter optimization, pre-training analysis, and result visualization. We provide our source code for reproducibility at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/STUM-E4F0.</p></details> |  |

However, current approaches often struggle to capture important spatio-temporal relationships, particularly overlooking global relations among distant city regions. Most existing techniques predominantly rely on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to capture global relations. However, CNNs exhibit neighbourhood bias, making them insufficient for capturing distant relations. To address this limitation, we propose ST-SampleNet, a novel transformer-based architecture that combines CNNs with self-attention mechanisms to capture both local and global relations effectively. Moreover, as the number of regions increases, the quadratic complexity of self-attention becomes a challenge. To tackle this issue, we introduce a lightweight region sampling strategy that prunes non-essential regions and enhances the efficiency of our approach. Furthermore, we introduce a spatially constrained position embedding that incorporates spatial neighbourhood information into the self-attention mechanism, aiding in semantic interpretation and improving the performance of ST-SampleNet. Our experimental evaluation on three real-world datasets demonstrates the effectiveness of ST-SampleNet. Additionally, our efficient variant achieves a 40% reduction in computational costs with only a marginal compromise in performance, approximately 1%.</p></details> |  |

However, most current systems assume a static environment, which limits the system's applicability in real-world scenarios where environments frequently change due to human intervention or the robot's own actions. In this work, we present DynaMem, a new approach to open-world mobile manipulation that uses a dynamic spatio-semantic memory to represent a robot's environment. DynaMem constructs a 3D data structure to maintain a dynamic memory of point clouds, and answers open-vocabulary object localization queries using multimodal LLMs or open-vocabulary features generated by state-of-the-art vision-language models. Powered by DynaMem, our robots can explore novel environments, search for objects not found in memory, and continuously update the memory as objects move, appear, or disappear in the scene. We run extensive experiments on the Stretch SE3 robots in three real and nine offline scenes, and achieve an average pick-and-drop success rate of 70% on non-stationary objects, which is more than a 2x improvement over state-of-the-art static systems.

| **[Prompt-Based Spatio-Temporal Graph Transfer Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12452v2)** | 2024-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal graph neural networks have proven efficacy in capturing complex dependencies for urban computing tasks such as forecasting and kriging. Yet, their performance is constrained by the reliance on extensive data for training on a specific task, thereby limiting their adaptability to new urban domains with varied task demands. Although transfer learning has been proposed to remedy this problem by leveraging knowledge across domains, the cross-task generalization still remains under-explored in spatio-temporal graph transfer learning due to the lack of a unified framework. To bridge the gap, we propose Spatio-Temporal Graph Prompting (STGP), a prompt-based framework capable of adapting to multi-diverse tasks in a data-scarce domain. Specifically, we first unify different tasks into a single template and introduce a task-agnostic network architecture that aligns with this template. This approach enables capturing dependencies shared across tasks. Furthermore, we employ learnable prompts to achieve domain and task transfer in a two-stage prompting pipeline, facilitating the prompts to effectively capture domain knowledge and task-specific properties. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that STGP outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in three tasks-forecasting, kriging, and extrapolation-achieving an improvement of up to 10.7%.</p></details> |  |

While convolutional neural networks are widely used in learning ice layer patterns from raw echogram images captured by airborne snow radar sensors, noise in the echogram images prevents researchers from getting high-quality results. Instead, we focus on geometric deep learning using graph neural networks, aiming to build a spatio-temporal graph neural network that learns from thickness information of the top ice layers and predicts for deeper layers. In this paper, we developed a novel multi-branch spatio-temporal graph neural network that used the GraphSAGE framework for spatio features learning and a temporal convolution operation to capture temporal changes, enabling different branches of the network to be more specialized and focusing on a single learning task. We found that our proposed multi-branch network can consistently outperform the current fused spatio-temporal graph neural network in both accuracy and efficiency.</p></details> |  |

Current state-of-the-art methods typically adopt dual-path networks to separately modeling spatial features and temporal features. However, the uncertain compatibility of the two networks brings a challenge for spatio-temporal features fusion and violate the spatio-temporal coherence and coupling of human motions by nature. To address this issue, we propose a novel graph structure, UnityGraph, which treats spatio-temporal features as a whole, enhancing model coherence and coupling.spatio-temporal features as a whole, enhancing model coherence and coupling. Specifically, UnityGraph is a hypervariate graph based network. The flexibility of the hypergraph allows us to consider the observed motions as graph nodes. We then leverage hyperedges to bridge these nodes for exploring spatio-temporal features. This perspective considers spatio-temporal dynamics unitedly and reformulates multi-person motion prediction into a problem on a single graph. Leveraging the dynamic message passing based on this hypergraph, our model dynamically learns from both types of relations to generate targeted messages that reflect the relevance among nodes. Extensive experiments on several datasets demonstrates that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, confirming its effectiveness and innovative design.</p></details> | <details><summary>13pag...</summary><p>13pages, 12 figures. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2411.03729</p></details> |
| **[Generative AI Enables EEG Super-Resolution via Spatio-Temporal Adaptive Diffusion Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03089v4)** | 2024-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Electroencephalogram (EEG) technology, particularly high-density EEG (HD EEG) devices, are widely used in fields such as neuroscience. HD EEG devices improve the spatial resolution of EEG by placing more electrodes on the scalp, which meet the requirements of clinical diagnostic applications such as epilepsy focus localization. However, this technique faces challenges, such as high acquisition costs and limited usage scenarios. In this paper, spatio-temporal adaptive diffusion models (STAD) are proposed to pioneer the use of diffusion models for achieving spatial SR reconstruction from low-resolution (LR, 64 channels or fewer) EEG to high-resolution (HR, 256 channels) EEG. Specifically, a spatio-temporal condition module is designed to extract the spatio-temporal features of LR EEG, which then used as conditional inputs to direct the reverse denoising process. Additionally, a multi-scale Transformer denoising module is constructed to leverage multi-scale convolution blocks and cross-attention-based diffusion Transformer blocks for conditional guidance to generate subject-adaptive SR EEG. Experimental results demonstrate that the STAD significantly enhances the spatial resolution of LR EEG and quantitatively outperforms existing methods. Furthermore, STAD demonstrate their value by applying synthetic SR EEG to classification and source localization tasks, indicating their potential to Substantially boost the spatial resolution of EEG.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods struggle to address the complex, temporally dynamic nature of endoscopic scenes. This paper presents ST-Endo4DGS, a novel framework that models the spatio-temporal volume of dynamic endoscopic scenes using unbiased 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS) primitives, parameterized by anisotropic ellipses with flexible 4D rotations. This approach enables precise representation of deformable tissue dynamics, capturing intricate spatial and temporal correlations in real time. Additionally, we extend spherindrical harmonics to represent time-evolving appearance, achieving realistic adaptations to lighting and view changes. A new endoscopic normal alignment constraint (ENAC) further enhances geometric fidelity by aligning rendered normals with depth-derived geometry. Extensive evaluations show that ST-Endo4DGS outperforms existing methods in both visual quality and real-time performance, establishing a new state-of-the-art in dynamic scene reconstruction for endoscopic surgery.</p></details> |  |

Our approach captures temporal and feature dependencies within a unified spatio-temporal pipeline by leveraging a GCNN that uses a spatio-temporal graph aimed at optimizing predictive accuracy and interoperability. For graph estimation, we introduce techniques, including one based on the (heterogeneous) Gower distance. Once estimated, we propose two methods for graph construction: one based on the Cartesian product, treating temporal instants homogeneously, and another spatio-temporal approach with distinct graphs per time step. We also propose two GCNN architectures: a standard GCNN with a normalized adjacency matrix and a higher-order polynomial GCNN. In addition to accuracy, we emphasize explainability by designing an inherently interpretable model and performing a thorough interpretability analysis, identifying key feature-time combinations that drive predictions. We evaluate XST-GCNN using real-world Electronic Health Record data from University Hospital of Fuenlabrada to predict Multidrug Resistance (MDR) in ICU patients, a critical healthcare challenge linked to high mortality and complex treatments. Our architecture outperforms traditional models, achieving a mean ROC-AUC score of 81.03 +- 2.43. Furthermore, the interpretability analysis provides actionable insights into clinical factors driving MDR predictions, enhancing model transparency. This work sets a benchmark for tackling complex inference tasks with heterogeneous MTS, offering a versatile, interpretable solution for real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

However, Transformer's complex architecture and black-box nature pose challenges for explainability, a crucial aspect for real-world applications and scientific inquiry. Current Explainable AI (XAI) methods can only provide one-dimensional feature importance, either spatial or temporal explanation, with significant computational complexity. This paper introduces STAA (Spatio-Temporal Attention Attribution), an XAI method for interpreting video Transformer models. Differ from traditional methods that separately apply image XAI techniques for spatial features or segment contribution analysis for temporal aspects, STAA offers both spatial and temporal information simultaneously from attention values in Transformers. The study utilizes the Kinetics-400 dataset, a benchmark collection of 400 human action classes used for action recognition research. We introduce metrics to quantify explanations. We also apply optimization to enhance STAA's raw output. By implementing dynamic thresholding and attention focusing mechanisms, we improve the signal-to-noise ratio in our explanations, resulting in more precise visualizations and better evaluation results. In terms of computational overhead, our method requires less than 3\% of the computational resources of traditional XAI methods, making it suitable for real-time video XAI analysis applications. STAA contributes to the growing field of XAI by offering a method for researchers and practitioners to analyze Transformer models.</p></details> |  |

Current state-of-the-art methods either require multiple independent stages of processing that employ motion cues or, in the case of end-to-end trainable networks, lack in segmentation accuracy, in part due to the difficulty of learning segmentation maps from videos with transient object presence. This limits the application of WSVOS for semantic annotation of surgical videos where multiple surgical tools frequently move in and out of the field of view, a problem that is more difficult than typically encountered in WSVOS. This paper introduces Video Spatio-Temporal Disentanglement Networks (VDST-Net), a framework to disentangle spatiotemporal information using semi-decoupled knowledge distillation to predict high-quality class activation maps (CAMs). A teacher network designed to resolve temporal conflicts when specifics about object location and timing in the video are not provided works with a student network that integrates information over time by leveraging temporal dependencies. We demonstrate the efficacy of our framework on a public reference dataset and on a more challenging surgical video dataset where objects are, on average, present in less than 60\% of annotated frames. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques and generates superior segmentation masks under video-level weak supervision.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV)</p></details> |

If these components are found, they can be modelled univariately. Blind source separation aims to recover the latent components by estimating the unmixing transformation based on the observed data only. The current methods for spatio-temporal blind source separation are restricted to linear unmixing, and nonlinear variants have not been implemented. In this paper, we extend identifiable variational autoencoder to the nonlinear nonstationary spatio-temporal blind source separation setting and demonstrate its performance using comprehensive simulation studies. Additionally, we introduce two alternative methods for the latent dimension estimation, which is a crucial task in order to obtain the correct latent representation. Finally, we illustrate the proposed methods using a meteorological application, where we estimate the latent dimension and the latent components, interpret the components, and show how nonstationarity can be accounted and prediction accuracy can be improved by using the proposed nonlinear blind source separation method as a preprocessing method.</p></details> |  |

This is because whole sequence segmentation is currently a tedious process and inaccurate. Conventional whole sequence segmentation approaches first estimate the motion field between frames, which is then used to propagate the mask along the temporal axis. However, the mask propagation results could be prone to error, especially for the basal and apex slices, where through-plane motion leads to significant morphology and structural change during the cardiac cycle. Inspired by recent advances in video object segmentation (VOS), based on spatio-temporal memory (STM) networks, we propose a continuous STM (CSTM) network for semi-supervised whole heart and whole sequence cMR segmentation. Our CSTM network takes full advantage of the spatial, scale, temporal and through-plane continuity prior of the underlying heart anatomy structures, to achieve accurate and fast 4D segmentation. Results of extensive experiments across multiple cMR datasets show that our method can improve the 4D cMR segmentation performance, especially for the hard-to-segment regions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to WACV 2025</p></details> |
| **[Identifying Spatio-Temporal Drivers of Extreme Events](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24075v1)** | 2024-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The spatio-temporal relations of impacts of extreme events and their drivers in climate data are not fully understood and there is a need of machine learning approaches to identify such spatio-temporal relations from data. The task, however, is very challenging since there are time delays between extremes and their drivers, and the spatial response of such drivers is inhomogeneous. In this work, we propose a first approach and benchmarks to tackle this challenge. Our approach is trained end-to-end to predict spatio-temporally extremes and spatio-temporally drivers in the physical input variables jointly. By enforcing the network to predict extremes from spatio-temporal binary masks of identified drivers, the network successfully identifies drivers that are correlated with extremes. We evaluate our approach on three newly created synthetic benchmarks, where two of them are based on remote sensing or reanalysis climate data, and on two real-world reanalysis datasets.

Recently, transformer based models have shown remarkable potential in weather forecasting achieving state-of-the-art results. However, transformers are discrete and physics-agnostic models which limit their ability to learn the continuous spatio-temporal features of the dynamical weather system. We address this issue with STC-ViT, a Spatio-Temporal Continuous Vision Transformer for weather forecasting. STC-ViT incorporates the continuous time Neural ODE layers with multi-head attention mechanism to learn the continuous weather evolution over time. The attention mechanism is encoded as a differentiable function in the transformer architecture to model the complex weather dynamics. Further, we define a customised physics informed loss for STC-ViT which penalize the model's predictions for deviating away from physical laws. We evaluate STC-ViT against operational Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) model and several deep learning based weather forecasting models. STC-ViT, trained on 1.5-degree 6-hourly data, demonstrates computational efficiency and competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art data-driven models trained on higher-resolution data for global forecasting.</p></details> |  |
| **[Causal Deciphering and Inpainting in Spatio-Temporal Dynamics via Diffusion Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19608v2)** | 2024-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal (ST) prediction has garnered a De facto attention in earth sciences, such as meteorological prediction, human mobility perception. However, the scarcity of data coupled with the high expenses involved in sensor deployment results in notable data imbalances. Furthermore, models that are excessively customized and devoid of causal connections further undermine the generalizability and interpretability. To this end, we establish a causal framework for ST predictions, termed CaPaint, which targets to identify causal regions in data and endow model with causal reasoning ability in a two-stage process. Going beyond this process, we utilize the back-door adjustment to specifically address the sub-regions identified as non-causal in the upstream phase. Specifically, we employ a novel image inpainting technique. By using a fine-tuned unconditional Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) as the generative prior, we in-fill the masks defined as environmental parts, offering the possibility of reliable extrapolation for potential data distributions. CaPaint overcomes the high complexity dilemma of optimal ST causal discovery models by reducing the data generation complexity from exponential to quasi-linear levels. Extensive experiments conducted on five real-world ST benchmarks demonstrate that integrating the CaPaint concept allows models to achieve improvements ranging from 4.3% to 77.3%. Moreover, compared to traditional mainstream ST augmenters, CaPaint underscores the potential of diffusion models in ST enhancement, offering a novel paradigm for this field.

| **[An Overtaking Trajectory Planning Framework Based on Spatio-temporal Topology and Reachable Set Analysis Ensuring Time Efficiency](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22643v1)** | 2024-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating overtaking trajectories in high-speed scenarios presents significant challenges and is typically addressed through hierarchical planning methods. However, this method has two primary drawbacks. First, heuristic algorithms can only provide a single initial solution, which may lead to local optima and consequently diminish the quality of the solution. Second, the time efficiency of trajectory refinement based on numerical optimization is insufficient. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes an overtaking trajectory planning framework based on spatio-temporal topology and reachable set analysis (SROP), to improve trajectory quality and time efficiency. Specifically, this paper introduces topological classes to describe trajectories representing different overtaking behaviors, which support the spatio-temporal topological search method employed by the upper-layer planner to identify diverse initial paths. This approach helps prevent getting stuck in local optima, enhancing the overall solution quality by considering multiple initial solutions from distinct topologies. Moreover, the reachable set method is integrated into the lower-layer planner for parallel trajectory evaluation. This method enhances planning efficiency by decoupling vehicle model constraints from the optimization process, enabling parallel computation while ensuring control feasibility. Simulation results show that the proposed method improves the smoothness of generated trajectories by 66.8% compared to state-of-the-art methods, highlighting its effectiveness in enhancing trajectory quality. Additionally, this method reduces computation time by 62.9%, demonstrating its efficiency.</p></details> |  |

| **[A Hierarchical Framework with Spatio-Temporal Consistency Learning for Emergence Detection in Complex Adaptive Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10300v2)** | 2024-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Emergence, a global property of complex adaptive systems (CASs) constituted by interactive agents, is prevalent in real-world dynamic systems, e.g., network-level traffic congestions. Detecting its formation and evaporation helps to monitor the state of a system, allowing to issue a warning signal for harmful emergent phenomena. Since there is no centralized controller of CAS, detecting emergence based on each agent's local observation is desirable but challenging. Existing works are unable to capture emergence-related spatial patterns, and fail to model the nonlinear relationships among agents. This paper proposes a hierarchical framework with spatio-temporal consistency learning to solve these two problems by learning the system representation and agent representations, respectively. Spatio-temporal encoders composed of spatial and temporal transformers are designed to capture agents' nonlinear relationships and the system's complex evolution. Agents' and the system's representations are learned to preserve the spatio-temporal consistency by minimizing the spatial and temporal dissimilarities in a self-supervised manner in the latent space. Our method achieves more accurate detection than traditional methods and deep learning methods on three datasets with well-known yet hard-to-detect emergent behaviors. Notably, our hierarchical framework is generic in incorporating other deep learning methods for agent-level and system-level detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, accepted by IEEE TNNLS</p></details> |

This massive upscaling motivates a departure from univariate wind forecasting methods that traditionally focused on a single representative height. To fill this gap, we propose DeepMIDE--a statistical deep learning method which jointly models the offshore wind speeds across space, time, and height. DeepMIDE is formulated as a multi-output integro-difference equation model with a multivariate, nonstationary, and state-dependent kernel characterized by a set of advection vectors that encode the physics of wind field formation and propagation. Embedded within DeepMIDE, an advanced deep learning architecture learns these advection vectors from high dimensional streams of exogenous weather information, which, along with other parameters, are plugged back into the statistical model for probabilistic multi-height space-time forecasting. Tested on real-world data from future offshore wind energy sites in the Northeastern United States, the wind speed and power forecasts from DeepMIDE are shown to outperform those from prevalent time series, spatio-temporal, and deep learning methods.</p></details> |  |

Computations are done through a Gaussian Markov random field approximation of the solution of the SPDE, which is constructed through a finite volume method. The new flexible non-separable model is compared to a flexible separable model both for reconstruction and forecasting, and evaluated in terms of root mean square errors and continuous rank probability scores. A simulation study demonstrates that the non-separable model performs better when the data is simulated from a non-separable model with diffusion and advection. Further, we estimate surrogate models for emulating the output of a ocean model in Trondheimsfjorden, Norway, and simulate observations of autonomous underwater vehicles. The results show that the flexible non-separable model outperforms the flexible separable model for real-time prediction of unobserved locations.</p></details> |  |

Leveraging the Line Graph transform, the Line Graph Least Mean Square (LGLMS) algorithm is proposed to conduct adaptive estimation of time-varying edge signals by projecting the edge signals from edge space to node space. LGLMS is an adaptive algorithm analogous to the classical LMS algorithm but applied to graph edges. Unlike edge-specific methods, LGLMS retains all GSP concepts and techniques originally designed for graph nodes, without the need for redefinition on the edges. Experimenting with transportation graphs and meteorological graphs, with the signal observations having noisy and missing values, we confirmed that LGLMS is suitable for the online prediction of time-varying edge signals.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatio-temporal Multivariate Cluster Evolution Analysis for Detecting and Tracking Climate Impacts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16544v1)** | 2024-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent years have seen a growing concern about climate change and its impacts. While Earth System Models (ESMs) can be invaluable tools for studying the impacts of climate change, the complex coupling processes encoded in ESMs and the large amounts of data produced by these models, together with the high internal variability of the Earth system, can obscure important source-to-impact relationships. This paper presents a novel and efficient unsupervised data-driven approach for detecting statistically-significant impacts and tracing spatio-temporal source-impact pathways in the climate through a unique combination of ideas from anomaly detection, clustering and Natural Language Processing (NLP). Using as an exemplar the 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines, we demonstrate that the proposed approach is capable of detecting known post-eruption impacts/events. We additionally describe a methodology for extracting meaningful sequences of post-eruption impacts/events by using NLP to efficiently mine frequent multivariate cluster evolutions, which can be used to confirm or discover the chain of physical processes between a climate source and its impact(s).</p></details> |  |

Similar to Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), high-quality benchmark datasets are of great importance to the advances of SNNs. However, our analysis indicates that many prevalent neuromorphic datasets lack strong temporal correlation, preventing SNNs from fully exploiting their spatio-temporal representation capabilities. Meanwhile, the integration of event and frame modalities offers more comprehensive visual spatio-temporal information. Yet, the SNN-based cross-modality fusion remains underexplored. In this work, we present a neuromorphic dataset called DVS-SLR that can better exploit the inherent spatio-temporal properties of SNNs. Compared to existing datasets, it offers advantages in terms of higher temporal correlation, larger scale, and more varied scenarios. In addition, our neuromorphic dataset contains corresponding frame data, which can be used for developing SNN-based fusion methods. By virtue of the dual-modal feature of the dataset, we propose a Cross-Modality Attention (CMA) based fusion method. The CMA model efficiently utilizes the unique advantages of each modality, allowing for SNNs to learn both temporal and spatial attention scores from the spatio-temporal features of event and frame modalities, subsequently allocating these scores across modalities to enhance their synergy. Experimental results demonstrate that our method not only improves recognition accuracy but also ensures robustness across diverse scenarios.</p></details> |  |

Inevitably, the issue of missing data caused by various disturbances threatens the reliability of data acquisition. Recent studies of diffusion probability models have demonstrated the superiority of deep generative models in imputation tasks by precisely capturing the spatio-temporal correlation of traffic data. One drawback of diffusion models is their slow sampling/denoising process. In this work, we aim to accelerate the imputation process while retaining the performance. We propose a fast conditional diffusion model for spatiotemporal traffic data imputation (FastSTI). To speed up the process yet, obtain better performance, we propose the application of a high-order pseudo-numerical solver. Our method further revs the imputation by introducing a predefined alignment strategy of variance schedule during the sampling process. Evaluating FastSTI on two types of real-world traffic datasets (traffic speed and flow) with different missing data scenarios proves its ability to impute higher-quality samples in only six sampling steps, especially under high missing rates (60\% $\sim$ 90\%). The experimental results illustrate a speed-up of $\textbf{8.3} \times$ faster than the current state-of-the-art model while achieving better performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems for publication.

Existing techniques are often cumbersome, computationally heavy and generally suffer from limitations in wavenumber/frequency response. To address these challenges, we propose Wave (from) Polarized Light Learning (WPLL), a learning based remote sensing method for laboratory implementation, capable of inferring surface elevation and slope maps in high resolution. The method uses the polarization properties of light reflected from the water surface. The WPLL uses a deep neural network (DNN) model that approximates the water surface slopes from the polarized light intensities. Once trained on simple monochromatic wave trains, the WPLL is capable of producing high-resolution and accurate 2D reconstruction of the water surface slopes and elevation in a variety of irregular wave fields. The method's robustness is demonstrated by showcasing its high wavenumber/frequency response, its ability to reconstruct wave fields propagating at arbitrary angles relative to the camera optical axis, and its computational efficiency. This developed methodology is an accurate and cost-effective near-real time remote sensing tool for laboratory water surface waves measurements, setting the path for upscaling to open sea application for research, monitoring, and short-time forecasting.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 17 figures, 5 tables, under review in Applied Ocean Research Journal</p></details> |

To make the cooperation safe for the humans involved, the systems have to follow protocols with rigid real-time and real-space properties, but they also need to be capable of making competitive and collaborative decisions with varying rewards and penalties. Due to these tough requirements, the construction of system control software is often very difficult. This calls for applying a model-based engineering approach, which allows one to formally express the time and space properties and use them as guidance for the whole engineering process from requirement definition via system design to software development. Moreover, it is beneficial, if one can verify with acceptable effort, that the time and space requirements are preserved throughout the development steps. This paper focuses on modelling spatio-temporal properties and their model-checking and simulation using different analysis tools in combination with the methods and tool extensions proposed here. To this end, we provide an informal overview of CASTeL, our CASTeLogic. CASTeL is stochastic and includes real-time concurrency and real-space distribution.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

We present a comprehensive investigation of Graph U-Nets, originally developed for classification tasks, now tailored for mesh-agnostic spatio-temporal forecasting of fluid dynamics. Our focus is on enhancing their performance through systematic hyperparameter tuning and architectural modifications. We propose novel approaches to improve mesh-agnostic spatio-temporal prediction of transient flow fields using Graph U-Nets, enabling accurate prediction on diverse mesh configurations. Key enhancements to the Graph U-Net architecture, including the Gaussian-mixture-model convolutional operator and noise injection approaches, provide increased flexibility in modeling node dynamics: the former reduces prediction error by 95\% compared to conventional convolutional operators, while the latter improves long-term prediction robustness, resulting in an error reduction of 86\%. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these enhancements in both transductive and inductive learning settings, showcasing the adaptability of Graph U-Nets to various flow conditions and mesh structures. This work contributes to the field of reduced-order modeling for computational fluid dynamics by establishing Graph U-Nets as a viable and flexible alternative to convolutional neural networks, capable of accurately and efficiently predicting complex fluid flow phenomena across diverse scenarios.</p></details> |  |

This study aims to develop a methodology for analyzing the occupancy rate from large-scale datasets to identify gaps between supply and demand in public transportation. Leveraging the spatio-temporal granularity of data from Automatic People Counting (APC) and relying on the Generalized Linear Mixed Effects Model and the Generalized Mixed-Effect Random Forest, in this study we propose a methodology for analyzing factors determining undercrowding. The results of the model are examined at both the segment and ride levels. Initially, the analysis focuses on identifying segments more likely associated with undercrowding, understanding factors influencing the probability of undercrowding, and exploring their relationships. Subsequently, the analysis extends to the temporal distribution of undercrowding, encompassing its impact on the entire journey. The proposed methodology is applied to analyze APC data, provided by the company responsible for public transport management in Milan, on a radial route of the surface transportation network.</p></details> | Pre-print version |

Although spatio-temporal graph neural networks have achieved success in modeling various static spatio-temporal forecasting scenarios, real-world spatio-temporal data are typically received in a streaming manner, and the network continuously expands with the installation of new sensors. Thus, spatio-temporal forecasting in streaming scenarios faces dual challenges: the inefficiency of retraining models over newly arrived data and the detrimental effects of catastrophic forgetting over long-term history. To address these challenges, we propose a novel prompt tuning-based continuous forecasting method, following two fundamental tuning principles guided by empirical and theoretical analysis: expand and compress, which effectively resolve the aforementioned problems with lightweight tuning parameters. Specifically, we integrate the base spatio-temporal graph neural network with a continuous prompt pool, utilizing stored prompts (i.e., few learnable parameters) in memory, and jointly optimize them with the base spatio-temporal graph neural network. This method ensures that the model sequentially learns from the spatio-temporal data stream to accomplish tasks for corresponding periods. Extensive experimental results on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate the multi-faceted superiority of our method over the state-of-the-art baselines, including effectiveness, efficiency, universality, etc.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Prompt-Guided Spatio-Temporal Transformer Model for National-Wide Nuclear Radiation Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11924v1)** | 2024-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Nuclear radiation (NR), which refers to the energy emitted from atomic nuclei during decay, poses substantial risks to human health and environmental safety. Accurate forecasting of nuclear radiation levels is crucial for informed decision-making by both individuals and governments. However, this task is challenging due to the imbalanced distribution of monitoring stations over a wide spatial range and the non-stationary radiation variation patterns. In this study, we introduce NRFormer, an innovative framework tailored for national-wide prediction of nuclear radiation variations. By integrating a non-stationary temporal attention module, an imbalance-aware spatial attention module, and a radiation propagation prompting module, NRFormer collectively captures complex spatio-temporal dynamics of nuclear radiation. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed framework against seven baselines. This research not only enhances the accuracy and reliability in nuclear radiation forecasting but also contributes to advancing emergency response strategies and monitoring systems, thereby safeguarding environmental and public health.</p></details> |  |

In the human language system, experimental studies have observed clusters for syntactic and semantic categories, but the mechanisms underlying this functional organization remain unclear. Here, building on work from the vision literature, we develop TopoLM, a transformer language model with an explicit two-dimensional spatial representation of model units. By combining a next-token prediction objective with a spatial smoothness loss, representations in this model assemble into clusters that correspond to semantically interpretable groupings of text and closely match the functional organization in the brain's language system. TopoLM successfully predicts the emergence of the spatio-functional organization of a cortical language system as well as the organization of functional clusters selective for fine-grained linguistic features empirically observed in human cortex. Our results suggest that the functional organization of the human language system is driven by a unified spatial objective, and provide a functionally and spatially aligned model of language processing in the brain.</p></details> |  |

However, the restricted capturing devices and transmission bandwidth lead to the low resolution of ODVs. Video super-resolution (VSR) methods are proposed to enhance the resolution of videos, but ODV projection distortions in the application are not well addressed directly applying such methods. To achieve better super-resolution reconstruction quality, we propose a novel Spatio-Temporal Distortion Aware Network (STDAN) oriented to ODV characteristics. Specifically, a spatio-temporal distortion modulation module is introduced to improve spatial ODV projection distortions and exploit the temporal correlation according to intra and inter alignments. Next, we design a multi-frame reconstruction and fusion mechanism to refine the consistency of reconstructed ODV frames. Furthermore, we incorporate latitude-saliency adaptive maps in the loss function to concentrate on important viewpoint regions with higher texture complexity and human-watching interest. In addition, we collect a new ODV-SR dataset with various scenarios. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed STDAN achieves superior super-resolution performance on ODVs and outperforms state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[MoChat: Joints-Grouped Spatio-Temporal Grounding LLM for Multi-Turn Motion Comprehension and Description](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11404v1)** | 2024-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite continuous advancements in deep learning for understanding human motion, existing models often struggle to accurately identify action timing and specific body parts, typically supporting only single-round interaction. Such limitations in capturing fine-grained motion details reduce their effectiveness in motion understanding tasks. In this paper, we propose MoChat, a multimodal large language model capable of spatio-temporal grounding of human motion and understanding multi-turn dialogue context. To achieve these capabilities, we group the spatial information of each skeleton frame based on human anatomical structure and then apply them with Joints-Grouped Skeleton Encoder, whose outputs are combined with LLM embeddings to create spatio-aware and temporal-aware embeddings separately. Additionally, we develop a pipeline for extracting timestamps from skeleton sequences based on textual annotations, and construct multi-turn dialogues for spatially grounding. Finally, various task instructions are generated for jointly training. Experimental results demonstrate that MoChat achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple metrics in motion understanding tasks, making it as the first model capable of fine-grained spatio-temporal grounding of human motion.</p></details> |  |
| **[Echo State Networks for Spatio-Temporal Area-Level Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10641v1)** | 2024-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal area-level datasets play a critical role in official statistics, providing valuable insights for policy-making and regional planning. Accurate modeling and forecasting of these datasets can be extremely useful for policymakers to develop informed strategies for future planning. Echo State Networks (ESNs) are efficient methods for capturing nonlinear temporal dynamics and generating forecasts. However, ESNs lack a direct mechanism to account for the neighborhood structure inherent in area-level data. Ignoring these spatial relationships can significantly compromise the accuracy and utility of forecasts. In this paper, we incorporate approximate graph spectral filters at the input stage of the ESN, thereby improving forecast accuracy while preserving the model's computational efficiency during training. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach using Eurostat's tourism occupancy dataset and show how it can support more informed decision-making in policy and planning contexts.</p></details> | 23 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Get Rid of Task Isolation: A Continuous Multi-task Spatio-Temporal Learning Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10524v1)** | 2024-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatiotemporal learning has become a pivotal technique to enable urban intelligence. Traditional spatiotemporal models mostly focus on a specific task by assuming a same distribution between training and testing sets. However, given that urban systems are usually dynamic, multi-sourced with imbalanced data distributions, current specific task-specific models fail to generalize to new urban conditions and adapt to new domains without explicitly modeling interdependencies across various dimensions and types of urban data. To this end, we argue that there is an essential to propose a Continuous Multi-task Spatio-Temporal learning framework (CMuST) to empower collective urban intelligence, which reforms the urban spatiotemporal learning from single-domain to cooperatively multi-dimensional and multi-task learning. Specifically, CMuST proposes a new multi-dimensional spatiotemporal interaction network (MSTI) to allow cross-interactions between context and main observations as well as self-interactions within spatial and temporal aspects to be exposed, which is also the core for capturing task-level commonality and personalization. To ensure continuous task learning, a novel Rolling Adaptation training scheme (RoAda) is devised, which not only preserves task uniqueness by constructing data summarization-driven task prompts, but also harnesses correlated patterns among tasks by iterative model behavior modeling. We further establish a benchmark of three cities for multi-task spatiotemporal learning, and empirically demonstrate the superiority of CMuST via extensive evaluations on these datasets. The impressive improvements on both few-shot streaming data and new domain tasks against existing SOAT methods are achieved. Code is available at https://github.com/DILab-USTCSZ/CMuST.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |
| **[Graph Masked Autoencoder for Spatio-Temporal Graph Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10915v1)** | 2024-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Effective spatio-temporal prediction frameworks play a crucial role in urban sensing applications, including traffic analysis, human mobility behavior modeling, and citywide crime prediction. However, the presence of data noise and label sparsity in spatio-temporal data presents significant challenges for existing neural network models in learning effective and robust region representations. To address these challenges, we propose a novel spatio-temporal graph masked autoencoder paradigm that explores generative self-supervised learning for effective spatio-temporal data augmentation. Our proposed framework introduces a spatial-temporal heterogeneous graph neural encoder that captures region-wise dependencies from heterogeneous data sources, enabling the modeling of diverse spatial dependencies. In our spatio-temporal self-supervised learning paradigm, we incorporate a masked autoencoding mechanism on node representations and structures. This mechanism automatically distills heterogeneous spatio-temporal dependencies across regions over time, enhancing the learning process of dynamic region-wise spatial correlations. To validate the effectiveness of our STGMAE framework, we conduct extensive experiments on various spatio-temporal mining tasks. We compare our approach against state-of-the-art baselines. The results of these evaluations demonstrate the superiority of our proposed framework in terms of performance and its ability to address the challenges of spatial and temporal data noise and sparsity in practical urban sensing scenarios.</p></details> | 12 pages |

Our focus lies in the parametric estimation of its intensity function, incorporating both spatial factors (such as altitude) and spatio-temporal covariates (such as field temperature, precipitation, etc.). The events are observed in France over a span of three years. Spatio-temporal covariates are observed with resolution $0.1^\circ \times 0.1^\circ$ ($\approx 100$km$^2$) and six-hour periods. This results in an extensive dataset, further characterized by a significant excess of zeroes (i.e., spatio-temporal cells with no observed events). We reexamine composite likelihood methods commonly employed for spatial point processes, especially in situations where covariates are piecewise constant. Additionally, we extend these methods to account for zero-deflated subsampling, a strategy involving dependent subsampling, with a focus on selecting more cells in regions where events are observed. A simulation study is conducted to illustrate these novel methodologies, followed by their application to the dataset of lightning strikes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Gridded Transformer Neural Processes for Large Unstructured Spatio-Temporal Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06731v2)** | 2024-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many important problems require modelling large-scale spatio-temporal datasets, with one prevalent example being weather forecasting. Recently, transformer-based approaches have shown great promise in a range of weather forecasting problems. However, these have mostly focused on gridded data sources, neglecting the wealth of unstructured, off-the-grid data from observational measurements such as those at weather stations. A promising family of models suitable for such tasks are neural processes (NPs), notably the family of transformer neural processes (TNPs). Although TNPs have shown promise on small spatio-temporal datasets, they are unable to scale to the quantities of data used by state-of-the-art weather and climate models. This limitation stems from their lack of efficient attention mechanisms. We address this shortcoming through the introduction of gridded pseudo-token TNPs which employ specialised encoders and decoders to handle unstructured observations and utilise a processor containing gridded pseudo-tokens that leverage efficient attention mechanisms. Our method consistently outperforms a range of strong baselines on various synthetic and real-world regression tasks involving large-scale data, while maintaining competitive computational efficiency. The real-life experiments are performed on weather data, demonstrating the potential of our approach to bring performance and computational benefits when applied at scale in a weather modelling pipeline.</p></details> |  |

Enhanced by anthropogenic activities and global warming, cyanobacterial blooms are expected to increase in frequency and global distribution. Early warning systems (EWS) for cyanobacterial blooms development allow timely implementation of management measures, reducing the risks associated to these blooms. In this paper, we propose an effective EWS for cyanobacterial bloom forecasting, which uses 6 years of incomplete high-frequency spatio-temporal data from multiparametric probes, including phycocyanin (PC) fluorescence as a proxy for cyanobacteria. A probe agnostic and replicable method is proposed to pre-process the data and to generate time series specific for cyanobacterial bloom forecasting. Using these pre-processed data, six different non-site/species-specific predictive models were compared including the autoregressive and multivariate versions of Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Long-Term Short-Term (LSTM) neural networks. Results were analyzed for seven forecasting time horizons ranging from 4 to 28 days evaluated with a hybrid system that combined regression metrics (MSE, R2, MAPE) for PC values, classification metrics (Accuracy, F1, Kappa) for a proposed alarm level of 10 ug PC/L, and a forecasting-specific metric to measure prediction improvement over the displaced signal (skill). The multivariate version of LSTM showed the best and most consistent results across all forecasting horizons and metrics, achieving accuracies of up to 90% in predicting the proposed PC alarm level. Additionally, positive skill values indicated its outstanding effectiveness to forecast cyanobacterial blooms from 16 to 28 days in advance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning from Spatio-temporal Correlation for Semi-Supervised LiDAR Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06893v1)** | 2024-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We address the challenges of the semi-supervised LiDAR segmentation (SSLS) problem, particularly in low-budget scenarios. The two main issues in low-budget SSLS are the poor-quality pseudo-labels for unlabeled data, and the performance drops due to the significant imbalance between ground-truth and pseudo-labels. This imbalance leads to a vicious training cycle. To overcome these challenges, we leverage the spatio-temporal prior by recognizing the substantial overlap between temporally adjacent LiDAR scans. We propose a proximity-based label estimation, which generates highly accurate pseudo-labels for unlabeled data by utilizing semantic consistency with adjacent labeled data. Additionally, we enhance this method by progressively expanding the pseudo-labels from the nearest unlabeled scans, which helps significantly reduce errors linked to dynamic classes. Additionally, we employ a dual-branch structure to mitigate performance degradation caused by data imbalance. Experimental results demonstrate remarkable performance in low-budget settings (i.e., <= 5%) and meaningful improvements in normal budget settings (i.e., 5 - 50%). Finally, our method has achieved new state-of-the-art results on SemanticKITTI and nuScenes in semi-supervised LiDAR segmentation. With only 5% labeled data, it offers competitive results against fully-supervised counterparts. Moreover, it surpasses the performance of the previous state-of-the-art at 100% labeled data (75.2%) using only 20% of labeled data (76.0%) on nuScenes. The code is available on https://github.com/halbielee/PLE.</p></details> |  |

By leveraging real-time environmental data, JC\&S improves resource allocation, reduces latency, and enhances power efficiency, while also supporting simulations and predictive modeling. This makes it a key technology for reactive systems and digital twins. These systems can respond to environmental events in real-time, offering transformative potential in sectors like smart cities, healthcare, and Industry 5.0, where adaptive and multimodal interaction is critical to enhance real-time decision-making. In this work, we present a transformer-based architecture that processes temporal Channel State Information (CSI) data, specifically amplitude and phase, to generate 3D point clouds of indoor environments. The model utilizes a multi-head attention to capture complex spatio-temporal relationships in CSI data and is adaptable to different CSI configurations. We evaluate the architecture on the MM-Fi dataset, using two different protocols to capture human presence in indoor environments. The system demonstrates strong potential for accurate 3D reconstructions and effectively distinguishes between close and distant objects, advancing JC\&S applications for spatial sensing in future wireless networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 5 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

Different from the common penalty-based approach, this work promotes adherence to the underlying physical mechanism that facilitates statistical procedures. The motivating application concerns modeling fluorescence recovery after photobleaching, which is used for characterization of diffusion processes. We propose a physics-encoded regression model for handling spatio-temporally distributed data, which enables principled interpretability, parsimonious computation and efficient estimation by exploiting the structure of solutions of a governing evolution equation. The rate of convergence attaining the minimax optimality is theoretically demonstrated, generalizing the result obtained for the spatial regression. We conduct simulation studies to assess the performance of our proposed estimator and illustrate its usage in the aforementioned real data example.</p></details> |  |
| **[Language Model Empowered Spatio-Temporal Forecasting via Physics-Aware Reprogramming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14505v2)** | 2024-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal forecasting is pivotal in numerous real-world applications, including transportation planning, energy management, and climate monitoring. In this work, we aim to harness the reasoning and generalization abilities of Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) for more effective spatio-temporal forecasting, particularly in data-scarce scenarios. However, recent studies uncover that PLMs, which are primarily trained on textual data, often falter when tasked with modeling the intricate correlations in numerical time series, thereby limiting their effectiveness in comprehending spatio-temporal data. To bridge the gap, we propose RePST, a physics-aware PLM reprogramming framework tailored for spatio-temporal forecasting. Specifically, we first propose a physics-aware decomposer that adaptively disentangles spatially correlated time series into interpretable sub-components, which facilitates PLM to understand sophisticated spatio-temporal dynamics via a divide-and-conquer strategy. Moreover, we propose a selective discrete reprogramming scheme, which introduces an expanded spatio-temporal vocabulary space to project spatio-temporal series into discrete representations. This scheme minimizes the information loss during reprogramming and enriches the representations derived by PLMs. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that the proposed RePST outperforms twelve state-of-the-art baseline methods, particularly in data-scarce scenarios, highlighting the effectiveness and superior generalization capabilities of PLMs for spatio-temporal forecasting.</p></details> |  |

However, multimedia technology for contact interaction is less mature than non-contact multimedia technologies and requires further development. Specialized haptic media technologies, requiring low latency and bitrates, are essential to enable haptic interaction, necessitating haptic information compression. Existing vibrotactile signal compression methods, based on the perceptual model, do not consider the characteristics of fused tactile perception at multiple spatially distributed interaction points. In fact, differences in tactile perceptual importance are not limited to conventional frequency and time domains, but also encompass differences in the spatial locations on the skin unique to tactile perception. For the most frequently used tactile information, vibrotactile texture perception, we have developed a model to predict its perceptual importance at multiple points, based on self-supervised learning and Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Network. Current experimental results indicate that this model can effectively predict the perceptual importance of various points in multi-point tactile perception scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a conference paper at Eurohaptics 2024</p></details> |

However, these models often struggle with balancing computational efficiency and model flexibility. To address this challenge, this study develops a fast and flexible method for STVC modeling. For enhanced flexibility in modeling, we assume multiple processes in each varying coefficient, including purely spatial, purely temporal, and spatio-temporal interaction processes with or without time cyclicity. While considering multiple processes can be time consuming, we combine a pre-conditioning method with a model selection procedure, inspired by reluctant interaction modeling. This approach allows us to computationally efficiently select and specify the latent space-time structure. Monte Carlo experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms alternatives in terms of coefficient estimation accuracy and computational efficiency. Finally, we apply the proposed method to crime analysis using a sample size of 279,360, confirming that the proposed method provides reasonable estimates of varying coefficients. The STVC model is implemented in an R package spmoran.</p></details> |  |

Effective monitoring of transformer health is critical to maintain grid stability and performance. Thermal insulation ageing is a key transformer failure mode, which is generally tracked by monitoring the hotspot temperature (HST). However, HST measurement is complex, costly, and often estimated from indirect measurements. Existing HST models focus on space-agnostic thermal models, providing worst-case HST estimates. This article introduces a spatio-temporal model for transformer winding temperature and ageing estimation, which leverages physics-based partial differential equations (PDEs) with data-driven Neural Networks (NN) in a Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) configuration to improve prediction accuracy and acquire spatio-temporal resolution. The computational accuracy of the PINN model is improved through the implementation of the Residual-Based Attention (PINN-RBA) scheme that accelerates the PINN model convergence. The PINN-RBA model is benchmarked against self-adaptive attention schemes and classical vanilla PINN configurations. For the first time, PINN based oil temperature predictions are used to estimate spatio-temporal transformer winding temperature values, validated through PDE numerical solution and fiber optic sensor measurements. Furthermore, the spatio-temporal transformer ageing model is inferred, which supports transformer health management decision-making. Results are validated with a distribution transformer operating on a floating photovoltaic power plant.</p></details> | 23 pages, 18 figures |
| **[A Spatio-Temporal Machine Learning Model for Mortgage Credit Risk: Default Probabilities and Loan Portfolios](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02846v1)** | 2024-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a novel machine learning model for credit risk by combining tree-boosting with a latent spatio-temporal Gaussian process model accounting for frailty correlation. This allows for modeling non-linearities and interactions among predictor variables in a flexible data-driven manner and for accounting for spatio-temporal variation that is not explained by observable predictor variables. We also show how estimation and prediction can be done in a computationally efficient manner. In an application to a large U.S. mortgage credit risk data set, we find that both predictive default probabilities for individual loans and predictive loan portfolio loss distributions obtained with our novel approach are more accurate compared to conventional independent linear hazard models and also linear spatio-temporal models. Using interpretability tools for machine learning models, we find that the likely reasons for this outperformance are strong interaction and non-linear effects in the predictor variables and the presence of large spatio-temporal frailty effects.</p></details> |  |
| **[Arges: Spatio-Temporal Transformer for Ulcerative Colitis Severity Assessment in Endoscopy Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00536v1)** | 2024-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate assessment of disease severity from endoscopy videos in ulcerative colitis (UC) is crucial for evaluating drug efficacy in clinical trials. Severity is often measured by the Mayo Endoscopic Subscore (MES) and Ulcerative Colitis Endoscopic Index of Severity (UCEIS) score. However, expert MES/UCEIS annotation is time-consuming and susceptible to inter-rater variability, factors addressable by automation. Automation attempts with frame-level labels face challenges in fully-supervised solutions due to the prevalence of video-level labels in clinical trials. CNN-based weakly-supervised models (WSL) with end-to-end (e2e) training lack generalization to new disease scores and ignore spatio-temporal information crucial for accurate scoring. To address these limitations, we propose "Arges", a deep learning framework that utilizes a transformer with positional encoding to incorporate spatio-temporal information from frame features to estimate disease severity scores in endoscopy video. Extracted features are derived from a foundation model (ArgesFM), pre-trained on a large diverse dataset from multiple clinical trials (61M frames, 3927 videos). We evaluate four UC disease severity scores, including MES and three UCEIS component scores. Test set evaluation indicates significant improvements, with F1 scores increasing by 4.1% for MES and 18.8%, 6.6%, 3.8% for the three UCEIS component scores compared to state-of-the-art methods. Prospective validation on previously unseen clinical trial data further demonstrates the model's successful generalization.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 2 figures, 5 tables, accepted at MLMI, MICCAI</p></details> |
| **[Towards Unifying Diffusion Models for Probabilistic Spatio-Temporal Graph Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17360v2)** | 2024-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal graph learning is a fundamental problem in modern urban systems. Existing approaches tackle different tasks independently, tailoring their models to unique task characteristics. These methods, however, fall short of modeling intrinsic uncertainties in the spatio-temporal data. Meanwhile, their specialized designs misalign with the current research efforts toward unifying spatio-temporal graph learning solutions. In this paper, we propose to model these tasks in a unified probabilistic perspective, viewing them as predictions based on conditional information with shared dependencies. Based on this proposal, we introduce Unified Spatio-Temporal Diffusion Models (USTD) to address the tasks uniformly under the uncertainty-aware diffusion framework. USTD is holistically designed, comprising a shared spatio-temporal encoder and attention-based denoising decoders that are task-specific. The encoder, optimized by pre-training strategies, effectively captures conditional spatio-temporal patterns. The decoders, utilizing attention mechanisms, generate predictions by leveraging learned patterns. Opting for forecasting and kriging, the decoders are designed as Spatial Gated Attention (SGA) and Temporal Gated Attention (TGA) for each task, with different emphases on the spatial and temporal dimensions. Combining the advantages of deterministic encoders and probabilistic decoders, USTD achieves state-of-the-art performances compared to both deterministic and probabilistic baselines, while also providing valuable uncertainty estimates.</p></details> |  |

Our proposed method applies DETR to each frame and uses feature shift to incorporate temporal information. However, DETR's object queries in each frame may correspond to different objects, making a simple feature shift ineffective. To overcome this issue, we propose query matching across different frames, ensuring that queries for the same object are matched and used for the feature shift. Experimental results show that performance on the JHMDB21 dataset improves significantly when query features are shifted using the proposed query matching.</p></details> |  |

The complexity of the underlying systems often makes finding the optimal decision challenging, especially when the safety-critical system is time-varying. Overcoming the problem of optimizing an unknown time-varying reward subject to unknown time-varying safety constraints, we propose TVSafeOpt, a new algorithm built on Bayesian optimization with a spatio-temporal kernel. The algorithm is capable of safely tracking a time-varying safe region without the need for explicit change detection. Optimality guarantees are also provided for the algorithm when the optimization problem becomes stationary. We show that TVSafeOpt compares favorably against SafeOpt on synthetic data, both regarding safety and optimality. Evaluation on a realistic case study with gas compressors confirms that TVSafeOpt ensures safety when solving time-varying optimization problems with unknown reward and safety functions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |

Existing RGB-E tracking methods model event characteristics utilising attention mechanism of Transformer before integrating both modalities. Nevertheless, these methods involve aggregating the event stream into a single event frame, lacking the utilisation of the temporal information inherent in the event stream.Moreover, the traditional attention mechanism is well-suited for dense semantic features, while the attention mechanism for sparse event features require revolution. In this paper, we propose a dynamic event subframe splitting strategy to split the event stream into more fine-grained event clusters, aiming to capture spatio-temporal features that contain motion cues. Based on this, we design an event-based sparse attention mechanism to enhance the interaction of event features in temporal and spatial dimensions. The experimental results indicate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on the FE240 and COESOT datasets, providing an effective processing manner for the event data.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 8 figures, conference</p></details> |

This paper introduces SEA-ViT, an advanced deep learning model that integrates Vision Transformer (ViT) with bidirectional Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) to capture spatio-temporal covariance for predicting sea surface currents (U, V) using high-frequency radar (HF) data. The name SEA-ViT is derived from ``Sea Surface Currents Forecasting using Vision Transformer,'' highlighting the model's emphasis on ocean dynamics and its use of the ViT architecture to enhance forecasting capabilities. SEA-ViT is designed to unravel complex dependencies by leveraging a rich dataset spanning over 30 years and incorporating ENSO indices (El Ni\~no, La Ni\~na, and neutral phases) to address the intricate relationship between geographic coordinates and climatic variations. This development enhances the predictive capabilities for sea surface currents, supporting the efforts of the Geo-Informatics and Space Technology Development Agency (GISTDA) in Thailand's maritime regions.

| **[AutoSTF: Decoupled Neural Architecture Search for Cost-Effective Automated Spatio-Temporal Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16586v1)** | 2024-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal forecasting is a critical component of various smart city applications, such as transportation optimization, energy management, and socio-economic analysis. Recently, several automated spatio-temporal forecasting methods have been proposed to automatically search the optimal neural network architecture for capturing complex spatio-temporal dependencies. However, the existing automated approaches suffer from expensive neural architecture search overhead, which hinders their practical use and the further exploration of diverse spatio-temporal operators in a finer granularity. In this paper, we propose AutoSTF, a decoupled automatic neural architecture search framework for cost-effective automated spatio-temporal forecasting. From the efficiency perspective, we first decouple the mixed search space into temporal space and spatial space and respectively devise representation compression and parameter-sharing schemes to mitigate the parameter explosion. The decoupled spatio-temporal search not only expedites the model optimization process but also leaves new room for more effective spatio-temporal dependency modeling. From the effectiveness perspective, we propose a multi-patch transfer module to jointly capture multi-granularity temporal dependencies and extend the spatial search space to enable finer-grained layer-wise spatial dependency search. Extensive experiments on eight datasets demonstrate the superiority of AutoSTF in terms of both accuracy and efficiency. Specifically, our proposed method achieves up to 13.48x speed-up compared to state-of-the-art automatic spatio-temporal forecasting methods while maintaining the best forecasting accuracy.</p></details> | 16 pages, 13 figures |
| **[Automated Spatio-Temporal Weather Modeling for Load Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16326v1)** | 2024-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Electricity is difficult to store, except at prohibitive cost, and therefore the balance between generation and load must be maintained at all times. Electricity is traditionally managed by anticipating demand and intermittent production (wind, solar) and matching flexible production (hydro, nuclear, coal and gas). Accurate forecasting of electricity load and renewable production is therefore essential to ensure grid performance and stability. Both are highly dependent on meteorological variables (temperature, wind, sunshine). These dependencies are complex and difficult to model. On the one hand, spatial variations do not have a uniform impact because population, industry, and wind and solar farms are not evenly distributed across the territory. On the other hand, temporal variations can have delayed effects on load (due to the thermal inertia of buildings). With access to observations from different weather stations and simulated data from meteorological models, we believe that both phenomena can be modeled together. In today's state-of-the-art load forecasting models, the spatio-temporal modeling of the weather is fixed. In this work, we aim to take advantage of the automated representation and spatio-temporal feature extraction capabilities of deep neural networks to improve spatio-temporal weather modeling for load forecasting. We compare our deep learning-based methodology with the state-of-the-art on French national load. This methodology could also be fully adapted to forecasting renewable energy production.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatio-Temporal Motion Retargeting for Quadruped Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11557v2)** | 2024-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work introduces a motion retargeting approach for legged robots, which aims to create motion controllers that imitate the fine behavior of animals. Our approach, namely spatio-temporal motion retargeting (STMR), guides imitation learning procedures by transferring motion from source to target, effectively bridging the morphological disparities by ensuring the feasibility of imitation on the target system. Our STMR method comprises two components: spatial motion retargeting (SMR) and temporal motion retargeting (TMR). On the one hand, SMR tackles motion retargeting at the kinematic level by generating kinematically feasible whole-body motions from keypoint trajectories. On the other hand, TMR aims to retarget motion at the dynamic level by optimizing motion in the temporal domain. We showcase the effectiveness of our method in facilitating Imitation Learning (IL) for complex animal movements through a series of simulation and hardware experiments. In these experiments, our STMR method successfully tailored complex animal motions from various media, including video captured by a hand-held camera, to fit the morphology and physical properties of the target robots. This enabled RL policy training for precise motion tracking, while baseline methods struggled with highly dynamic motion involving flying phases. Moreover, we validated that the control policy can successfully imitate six different motions in two quadruped robots with different dimensions and physical properties in real-world settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>34 pa...</summary><p>34 pages, 7 figures, videos available at https://terry97-guel.github.io/STMR-RL.github.io/</p></details> |

Traditional rPPG models often struggle with poor generalization capacity in unseen domains. Current solutions to this problem is to improve its generalization in the target domain through Domain Generalization (DG) or Domain Adaptation (DA). However, both traditional methods require access to both source domain data and target domain data, which cannot be implemented in scenarios with limited access to source data, and another issue is the privacy of accessing source domain data. In this paper, we propose the first Source-free Domain Adaptation benchmark for rPPG measurement (SFDA-rPPG), which overcomes these limitations by enabling effective domain adaptation without access to source domain data. Our framework incorporates a Three-Branch Spatio-Temporal Consistency Network (TSTC-Net) to enhance feature consistency across domains. Furthermore, we propose a new rPPG distribution alignment loss based on the Frequency-domain Wasserstein Distance (FWD), which leverages optimal transport to align power spectrum distributions across domains effectively and further enforces the alignment of the three branches. Extensive cross-domain experiments and ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method in source-free domain adaptation settings. Our findings highlight the significant contribution of the proposed FWD loss for distributional alignment, providing a valuable reference for future research and applications.

| **[EventAug: Multifaceted Spatio-Temporal Data Augmentation Methods for Event-based Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11813v1)** | 2024-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The event camera has demonstrated significant success across a wide range of areas due to its low time latency and high dynamic range. However, the community faces challenges such as data deficiency and limited diversity, often resulting in over-fitting and inadequate feature learning. Notably, the exploration of data augmentation techniques in the event community remains scarce. This work aims to address this gap by introducing a systematic augmentation scheme named EventAug to enrich spatial-temporal diversity. In particular, we first propose Multi-scale Temporal Integration (MSTI) to diversify the motion speed of objects, then introduce Spatial-salient Event Mask (SSEM) and Temporal-salient Event Mask (TSEM) to enrich object variants. Our EventAug can facilitate models learning with richer motion patterns, object variants and local spatio-temporal relations, thus improving model robustness to varied moving speeds, occlusions, and action disruptions. Experiment results show that our augmentation method consistently yields significant improvements across different tasks and backbones (e.g., a 4.87% accuracy gain on DVS128 Gesture). Our code will be publicly available for this community.</p></details> |  |
| **[Modelling Volatility of Spatio-temporal Integer-valued Data with Network Structure and Asymmetry](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01521v2)** | 2024-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes a spatial threshold GARCH-type model for dynamic spatio-temporal integer-valued data with network structure. The proposed model can simplify the parameterization by using network structure in data, and can capture the asymmetric property in dynamic volatility by adopting a threshold structure. The proposed model assumes the conditional distribution is Poisson distribution. Asymptotic theory of maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) for the spatial model is derived when both sample size and network dimension are large. We obtain asymptotic statistical inferences via investigation of the weak dependence of components of the model and application of limit theorems for weakly dependent random fields. Simulation studies and a real data example are presented to support our methodology.</p></details> |  |
| **[STCMOT: Spatio-Temporal Cohesion Learning for UAV-Based Multiple Object Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11234v1)** | 2024-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiple object tracking (MOT) in Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) videos is important for diverse applications in computer vision. Current MOT trackers rely on accurate object detection results and precise matching of target reidentification (ReID). These methods focus on optimizing target spatial attributes while overlooking temporal cues in modelling object relationships, especially for challenging tracking conditions such as object deformation and blurring, etc. To address the above-mentioned issues, we propose a novel Spatio-Temporal Cohesion Multiple Object Tracking framework (STCMOT), which utilizes historical embedding features to model the representation of ReID and detection features in a sequential order. Concretely, a temporal embedding boosting module is introduced to enhance the discriminability of individual embedding based on adjacent frame cooperation. While the trajectory embedding is then propagated by a temporal detection refinement module to mine salient target locations in the temporal field. Extensive experiments on the VisDrone2019 and UAVDT datasets demonstrate our STCMOT sets a new state-of-the-art performance in MOTA and IDF1 metrics.

| **[Spatio-Temporal-Network Point Processes for Modeling Crime Events with Landmarks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10882v1)** | 2024-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-exciting point processes are widely used to model the contagious effects of crime events living within continuous geographic space, using their occurrence time and locations. However, in urban environments, most events are naturally constrained within the city's street network structure, and the contagious effects of crime are governed by such a network geography. Meanwhile, the complex distribution of urban infrastructures also plays an important role in shaping crime patterns across space. We introduce a novel spatio-temporal-network point process framework for crime modeling that integrates these urban environmental characteristics by incorporating self-attention graph neural networks. Our framework incorporates the street network structure as the underlying event space, where crime events can occur at random locations on the network edges. To realistically capture criminal movement patterns, distances between events are measured using street network distances. We then propose a new mark for a crime event by concatenating the event's crime category with the type of its nearby landmark, aiming to capture how the urban design influences the mixing structures of various crime types. A graph attention network architecture is adopted to learn the existence of mark-to-mark interactions. Extensive experiments on crime data from Valencia, Spain, demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in understanding the crime landscape and forecasting crime risks across regions.</p></details> |  |

While limiting the variety of training data can make training easier, it can also lead to a lack of knowledge and information for the model, resulting in a decrease in performance. To address this challenge, we presented an innovative paradigm that incorporates three separate forms of curriculum learning specifically targeting from spatial, temporal, and quantile perspectives. Furthermore, our framework incorporates a stacking fusion module to combine diverse information from three types of curriculum learning, resulting in a strong and thorough learning process. We demonstrated the effectiveness of this framework with extensive empirical evaluations, highlighting its better performance in addressing complex ST challenges. We provided thorough ablation studies to investigate the effectiveness of our curriculum and to explain how it contributes to the improvement of learning efficiency on ST data.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accept by sigspatial 2024</p></details> |

Task dependencies in this form are then represented by a task graph, which we assume to be acyclic. From the given task graph, we provide an algorithmic approach to define a distributed sampled-data controller prioritizing the fulfilment of collaborative tasks as the primary objective, while fulfilling independent tasks unless they conflict with collaborative ones. Moreover, communication maintenance among collaborating agents is seamlessly enforced within the proposed control framework.

However, scalability and generalization challenges remain significant obstacles. Advanced models often rely on Graph Neural Networks to encode spatial and temporal correlations, but struggle with the increased complexity of large-scale datasets. The recursive GNN-based message passing schemes used in these models hinder their training and deployment in real-life urban sensing scenarios. Moreover, long-spanning large-scale spatio-temporal data introduce distribution shifts, necessitating improved generalization performance. To address these challenges, we propose a simple framework for spatio-temporal prediction - EasyST paradigm. It learns lightweight and robust Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) by effectively distilling knowledge from complex spatio-temporal GNNs. We ensure robust knowledge distillation by integrating the spatio-temporal information bottleneck with teacher-bounded regression loss, filtering out task-irrelevant noise and avoiding erroneous guidance. We further enhance the generalization ability of the student model by incorporating spatial and temporal prompts to provide downstream task contexts. Evaluation on three spatio-temporal datasets for urban computing tasks demonstrates that EasyST surpasses state-of-the-art approaches in terms of efficiency and accuracy. The implementation code is available at: https://github.com/HKUDS/EasyST.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CIKM'2024, full paper</p></details> |
| **[A general reduced-order neural operator for spatio-temporal predictive learning on complex spatial domains](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05508v1)** | 2024-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predictive learning for spatio-temporal processes (PL-STP) on complex spatial domains plays a critical role in various scientific and engineering fields, with its essence being the construction of operators between infinite-dimensional function spaces. This paper focuses on the unequal-domain mappings in PL-STP and categorising them into increase-domain and decrease-domain mapping. Recent advances in deep learning have revealed the great potential of neural operators (NOs) to learn operators directly from observational data. However, existing NOs require input space and output space to be the same domain, which pose challenges in ensuring predictive accuracy and stability for unequal-domain mappings. To this end, this study presents a general reduced-order neural operator named Reduced-Order Neural Operator on Riemannian Manifolds (RO-NORM), which consists of two parts: the unequal-domain encoder/decoder and the same-domain approximator. Motivated by the variable separation in classical modal decomposition, the unequal-domain encoder/decoder uses the pre-computed bases to reformulate the spatio-temporal function as a sum of products between spatial (or temporal) bases and corresponding temporally (or spatially) distributed weight functions, thus the original unequal-domain mapping can be converted into a same-domain mapping. Consequently, the same-domain approximator NORM is applied to model the transformed mapping. The performance of our proposed method has been evaluated on six benchmark cases, including parametric PDEs, engineering and biomedical applications, and compared with four baseline algorithms: DeepONet, POD-DeepONet, PCA-Net, and vanilla NORM. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of RO-NORM in prediction accuracy and training efficiency for PL-STP.</p></details> |  |

However, low accuracy in student classroom behavior detection is a prevalent issue. To address this issue, we propose a Spatio-Temporal Attention-Based Method for Detecting Student Classroom Behaviors (BDSTA). Firstly, the SlowFast network is used to generate motion and environmental information feature maps from the video. Then, the spatio-temporal attention module is applied to the feature maps, including information aggregation, compression and stimulation processes. Subsequently, attention maps in the time, channel and space dimensions are obtained, and multi-label behavior classification is performed based on these attention maps. To solve the long-tail data problem that exists in student classroom behavior datasets, we use an improved focal loss function to assign more weight to the tail class data during training. Experimental results are conducted on a self-made student classroom behavior dataset named STSCB. Compared with the SlowFast model, the average accuracy of student behavior classification detection improves by 8.94\% using BDSTA.</p></details> |  |

However, the lack of publicly available spatio-temporal datasets on student behavior, as well as the high cost of manually labeling such datasets, pose significant challenges for researchers in this field. To address this issue, we proposed a method for extending the spatio-temporal behavior dataset in Student Classroom Scenarios (SCB-ST-Dataset4) through image dataset. Our SCB-ST-Dataset4 comprises 757265 images with 25810 labels, focusing on 3 behaviors: hand-raising, reading, writing. Our proposed method can rapidly generate spatio-temporal behavior datasets without requiring extra manual labeling. Furthermore, we proposed a Behavior Similarity Index (BSI) to explore the similarity of behaviors. We evaluated the dataset using the YOLOv5, YOLOv7, YOLOv8, and SlowFast algorithms, achieving a mean average precision (map) of up to 82.3%. Last, we fused multiple models to generate student behavior-related data from various perspectives. The experiment further demonstrates the effectiveness of our method. And SCB-ST-Dataset4 provides a robust foundation for future research in student behavior detection, potentially contributing to advancements in this field.

Developing techniques to identify and analyze communities in these time-varying graph structures is an important challenge. In this work, we generalize existing spectral clustering algorithms from static to dynamic graphs using canonical correlation analysis (CCA) to capture the temporal evolution of clusters. Based on this extended canonical correlation framework, we define the spatio-temporal graph Laplacian and investigate its spectral properties. We connect these concepts to dynamical systems theory via transfer operators, and illustrate the advantages of our method on benchmark graphs by comparison with existing methods. We show that the spatio-temporal graph Laplacian allows for a clear interpretation of cluster structure evolution over time for directed and undirected graphs.</p></details> |  |

A critical component of disease behavior is the velocity with which disease spreads, defined as the rate of change between time and space. In this paper, we propose a spatio-temporal modeling approach to determine the velocities of infectious disease spread. Our approach assumes that the locations and times of people infected can be considered as a spatio-temporal point pattern that arises as a realization of a spatio-temporal log-Gaussian Cox process. The intensity of this process is estimated using fast Bayesian inference by employing the integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA) and the Stochastic Partial Differential Equations (SPDE) approaches. The velocity is then calculated using finite differences that approximate the derivatives of the intensity function. Finally, the directions and magnitudes of the velocities can be mapped at specific times to examine better the spread of the disease throughout the region. We demonstrate our method by analyzing COVID-19 spread in Cali, Colombia, during the 2020-2021 pandemic.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 46 figures, Journal American Statistican, submitted on 3rd of September</p></details> |

A video tutorial for this library is available on YouTube. We consider two types of methods to estimate a non-homogeneous Poisson process in space and time. The methods approximate the arrival intensity function of the Poisson process by discretizing space and time, and estimating arrival intensity as a function of subregion and time interval. With such methods, it is typical that the dimension of the estimator is large relative to the amount of data, and therefore the performance of the estimator can be improved by using additional data. The first method uses additional data to add a regularization term to the likelihood function for calibrating the intensity of the Poisson process. The second method uses additional data to estimate arrival intensity as a function of covariates. We describe a Python package to perform various types of space and time discretization. We also describe two packages for the calibration of the models, one in Matlab and one in C++. We demonstrate the advantages of our methods compared to basic maximum likelihood estimation with simulated and real data. The experiments with real data calibrate models of the arrival process of emergencies to be handled by the Rio de Janeiro emergency medical service.</p></details> |  |

Recently, the forecasting models have employed multi-source data as the multi-modality input, thus improving the prediction accuracy. However, the prevailing methods usually suffer from the desynchronization of multi-source variables, the insufficient capability of capturing spatio-temporal dependency, and unsatisfactory performance in predicting extreme precipitation events. To fix these problems, we propose a short-term precipitation forecasting model based on spatio-temporal alignment attention, with SATA as the temporal alignment module and STAU as the spatio-temporal feature extractor to filter high-pass features from precipitation signals and capture multi-term temporal dependencies. Based on satellite and ERA5 data from the southwestern region of China, our model achieves improvements of 12.61\% in terms of RMSE, in comparison with the state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

Designing spatio-temporal forecasting models separately in a task-wise and city-wise manner to forecast demand and supply-demand gap in a ride-hailing system poses a burden for the expanding transportation network companies. Therefore, a multi-task learning architecture is proposed in this study by developing gated ensemble of spatio-temporal mixture of experts network (GESME-Net) with convolutional recurrent neural network (CRNN), convolutional neural network (CNN), and recurrent neural network (RNN) for simultaneously forecasting these spatio-temporal tasks in a city as well as across different cities. Furthermore, a task adaptation layer is integrated with the architecture for learning joint representation in multi-task learning and revealing the contribution of the input features utilized in prediction. The proposed architecture is tested with data from Didi Chuxing for: (i) simultaneously forecasting demand and supply-demand gap in Beijing, and (ii) simultaneously forecasting demand across Chengdu and Xian. In both scenarios, models from our proposed architecture outperformed the single-task and multi-task deep learning benchmarks and ensemble-based machine learning algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2012.08868</p></details> |

Although adopting a surrogate gradient (SG) makes the non-differentiability SNN trainable, achieving comparable accuracy for ANNs and keeping low-power features simultaneously is still tricky. In this paper, we proposed an energy-efficient spike-train level spiking neural network with spatio-temporal conversion, which has low computational cost and high accuracy. In the STCSNN, spatio-temporal conversion blocks (STCBs) are proposed to keep the low power features of SNNs and improve accuracy. However, STCSNN cannot adopt backpropagation algorithms directly due to the non-differentiability nature of spike trains. We proposed a suitable learning rule for STCSNNs by deducing the equivalent gradient of STCB.

| **[DSLO: Deep Sequence LiDAR Odometry Based on Inconsistent Spatio-temporal Propagation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00744v1)** | 2024-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces a 3D point cloud sequence learning model based on inconsistent spatio-temporal propagation for LiDAR odometry, termed DSLO. It consists of a pyramid structure with a spatial information reuse strategy, a sequential pose initialization module, a gated hierarchical pose refinement module, and a temporal feature propagation module. First, spatial features are encoded using a point feature pyramid, with features reused in successive pose estimations to reduce computational overhead. Second, a sequential pose initialization method is introduced, leveraging the high-frequency sampling characteristic of LiDAR to initialize the LiDAR pose. Then, a gated hierarchical pose refinement mechanism refines poses from coarse to fine by selectively retaining or discarding motion information from different layers based on gate estimations. Finally, temporal feature propagation is proposed to incorporate the historical motion information from point cloud sequences, and address the spatial inconsistency issue when transmitting motion information embedded in point clouds between frames. Experimental results on the KITTI odometry dataset and Argoverse dataset demonstrate that DSLO outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving at least a 15.67\% improvement on RTE and a 12.64\% improvement on RRE, while also achieving a 34.69\% reduction in runtime compared to baseline methods. Our implementation will be available at https://github.com/IRMVLab/DSLO.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 5 figures, accepted by IROS 2024</p></details> |

However, existing methods encounter difficulties when applied to problems on unstructured grids and irregular domains. Spatial graph neural networks utilize local convolution in a neighborhood to potentially address these challenges, yet they often suffer from issues such as over-smoothing and over-squashing in deep architectures. Conversely, spectral graph neural networks leverage global convolution to capture extensive features and long-range dependencies in domain graphs, albeit at a high computational cost due to Eigenvalue decomposition. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach, referred to as Spatio-Spectral Graph Neural Operator (Sp$^2$GNO) that integrates spatial and spectral GNNs effectively. This framework mitigates the limitations of individual methods and enables the learning of solution operators across arbitrary geometries, thus catering to a wide range of real-world problems. Sp$^2$GNO demonstrates exceptional performance in solving both time-dependent and time-independent partial differential equations on regular and irregular domains. Our approach is validated through comprehensive benchmarks and practical applications drawn from computational mechanics and scientific computing literature.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mending of Spatio-Temporal Dependencies in Block Adjacency Matrix](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02606v2)** | 2024-08-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the realm of applications where data dynamically evolves across spatial and temporal dimensions, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are often complemented by sequence modeling architectures, such as RNNs and transformers, to effectively model temporal changes. These hybrid models typically arrange the spatial and temporal learning components in series. A pioneering effort to jointly model the spatio-temporal dependencies using only GNNs was the introduction of the Block Adjacency Matrix \(\mathbf{A_B}\) \cite{1}, which was constructed by diagonally concatenating adjacency matrices from graphs at different time steps. This approach resulted in a single graph encompassing complete spatio-temporal data; however, the graphs from different time steps remained disconnected, limiting GNN message-passing to spatially connected nodes only. Addressing this critical challenge, we propose a novel end-to-end learning architecture specifically designed to mend the temporal dependencies, resulting in a well-connected graph. Thus, we provide a framework for the learnable representation of spatio-temporal data as graphs. Our methodology demonstrates superior performance on benchmark datasets, such as SurgVisDom and C2D2, surpassing existing state-of-the-art graph models in terms of accuracy. Our model also achieves significantly lower computational complexity, having far fewer parameters than methods reliant on CLIP and 3D CNN architectures.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICONIP 2024</p></details> |
| **[Eigen-Cluster VIS: Improving Weakly-supervised Video Instance Segmentation by Leveraging Spatio-temporal Consistency](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16661v1)** | 2024-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The performance of Video Instance Segmentation (VIS) methods has improved significantly with the advent of transformer networks. However, these networks often face challenges in training due to the high annotation cost. To address this, unsupervised and weakly-supervised methods have been developed to reduce the dependency on annotations. This work introduces a novel weakly-supervised method called Eigen-cluster VIS that, without requiring any mask annotations, achieves competitive accuracy compared to other VIS approaches. This method is based on two key innovations: a Temporal Eigenvalue Loss (TEL) and a clip-level Quality Cluster Coefficient (QCC). The TEL ensures temporal coherence by leveraging the eigenvalues of the Laplacian matrix derived from graph adjacency matrices. By minimizing the mean absolute error (MAE) between the eigenvalues of adjacent frames, this loss function promotes smooth transitions and stable segmentation boundaries over time, reducing temporal discontinuities and improving overall segmentation quality. The QCC employs the K-means method to ensure the quality of spatio-temporal clusters without relying on ground truth masks. Using the Davies-Bouldin score, the QCC provides an unsupervised measure of feature discrimination, allowing the model to self-evaluate and adapt to varying object distributions, enhancing robustness during the testing phase. These enhancements are computationally efficient and straightforward, offering significant performance gains without additional annotated data. The proposed Eigen-Cluster VIS method is evaluated on the YouTube-VIS 2019/2021 and OVIS datasets, demonstrating that it effectively narrows the performance gap between the fully-supervised and weakly-supervised VIS approaches. The code is available on: https://github.com/farnooshar/EigenClusterVIS</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 6 Figures, 5 tabels</p></details> |

While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) excel at modeling and forecasting spatio-temporal data, they often lack the ability to directly incorporate underlying physical laws. This work presents TG-PhyNN, a novel Temporal Graph Physics-Informed Neural Network framework. TG-PhyNN leverages the power of GNNs for graph-based modeling while simultaneously incorporating physical constraints as a guiding principle during training. This is achieved through a two-step prediction strategy that enables the calculation of physical equation derivatives within the GNN architecture. Our findings demonstrate that TG-PhyNN significantly outperforms traditional forecasting models (e.g., GRU, LSTM, GAT) on real-world spatio-temporal datasets like PedalMe (traffic flow), COVID-19 spread, and Chickenpox outbreaks. These datasets are all governed by well-defined physical principles, which TG-PhyNN effectively exploits to offer more reliable and accurate forecasts in various domains where physical processes govern the dynamics of data. This paves the way for improved forecasting in areas like traffic flow prediction, disease outbreak prediction, and potentially other fields where physics plays a crucial role.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatio-Temporal Context Prompting for Zero-Shot Action Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15996v2)** | 2024-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal action detection encompasses the tasks of localizing and classifying individual actions within a video. Recent works aim to enhance this process by incorporating interaction modeling, which captures the relationship between people and their surrounding context. However, these approaches have primarily focused on fully-supervised learning, and the current limitation lies in the lack of generalization capability to recognize unseen action categories. In this paper, we aim to adapt the pretrained image-language models to detect unseen actions. To this end, we propose a method which can effectively leverage the rich knowledge of visual-language models to perform Person-Context Interaction. Meanwhile, our Context Prompting module will utilize contextual information to prompt labels, thereby enhancing the generation of more representative text features. Moreover, to address the challenge of recognizing distinct actions by multiple people at the same timestamp, we design the Interest Token Spotting mechanism which employs pretrained visual knowledge to find each person's interest context tokens, and then these tokens will be used for prompting to generate text features tailored to each individual. To evaluate the ability to detect unseen actions, we propose a comprehensive benchmark on J-HMDB, UCF101-24, and AVA datasets. The experiments show that our method achieves superior results compared to previous approaches and can be further extended to multi-action videos, bringing it closer to real-world applications.

| **[Marked Neural Spatio-Temporal Point Process Involving a Dynamic Graph Neural Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.03469v2)** | 2024-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal Point Processes (TPPs) have recently become increasingly interesting for learning dynamics in graph data. A reason for this is that learning on dynamic graph data is becoming more relevant, since data from many scientific fields, ranging from mathematics, biology, social sciences, and physics to computer science, is naturally related and inherently dynamic. In addition, TPPs provide a meaningful characterization of event streams and a prediction mechanism for future events. Therefore, (semi-)parameterized Neural TPPs have been introduced whose characterization can be (partially) learned and, thus, enable the representation of more complex phenomena. However, the research on modeling dynamic graphs with TPPs is relatively young, and only a few models for node attribute changes or evolving edges have been proposed yet. To allow for learning on fully dynamic graph streams, i.e., graphs that can change in their structure (addition/deletion of nodes/edge) and in their node/edge attributes, we propose a Marked Neural Spatio-Temporal Point Process (MNSTPP). It leverages a Dynamic Graph Neural Network to learn a Marked TPP that handles attributes and spatial data to model and predict any event in a graph stream.</p></details> |  |

Human-centric VAD, a specialized area within this domain, faces additional complexities, including variations in human behavior, potential biases in data, and substantial privacy concerns related to human subjects. These issues complicate the development of models that are both robust and generalizable. To address these challenges, recent advancements have focused on pose-based VAD, which leverages human pose as a high-level feature to mitigate privacy concerns, reduce appearance biases, and minimize background interference. In this paper, we introduce PoseWatch, a novel transformer-based architecture designed specifically for human-centric pose-based VAD. PoseWatch features an innovative Spatio-Temporal Pose and Relative Pose (ST-PRP) tokenization method that enhances the representation of human motion over time, which is also beneficial for broader human behavior analysis tasks. The architecture's core, a Unified Encoder Twin Decoders (UETD) transformer, significantly improves the detection of anomalous behaviors in video data. Extensive evaluations across multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that PoseWatch consistently outperforms existing methods, establishing a new state-of-the-art in pose-based VAD. This work not only demonstrates the efficacy of PoseWatch but also highlights the potential of integrating Natural Language Processing techniques with computer vision to advance human behavior analysis.</p></details> |  |

Traditional forecasting methods, however, struggle with the irregular traffic time series resulting from adaptive traffic signal controls, presenting challenges in asynchronous spatial dependency, irregular temporal dependency, and predicting variable-length sequences. To this end, we propose an Asynchronous Spatio-tEmporal graph convolutional nEtwoRk (ASeer) tailored for irregular traffic time series forecasting. Specifically, we first propose an Asynchronous Graph Diffusion Network to capture the spatial dependency between asynchronously measured traffic states regulated by adaptive traffic signals. After that, to capture the temporal dependency within irregular traffic state sequences, a personalized time encoding is devised to embed the continuous time signals. Then, we propose a Transformable Time-aware Convolution Network, which adapts meta-filters for time-aware convolution on the sequences with inconsistent temporal flow. Additionally, a Semi-Autoregressive Prediction Network, comprising a state evolution unit and a semi-autoregressive predictor, is designed to predict variable-length traffic sequences effectively and efficiently. Extensive experiments on a newly established benchmark demonstrate the superiority of ASeer compared with twelve competitive baselines across six metrics.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work is published in the research track of KDD 2024</p></details> |

To overcome this limitation, we introduce a hybrid approach that combines the strengths of open-source large and small-scale language models (LLMs and LMs) with traditional forecasting methods. We augment traditional methods with dynamic prompting and a grouped-query, multi-head attention mechanism to more effectively capture both intra-series and inter-series dependencies in evolving nonlinear time series data.

Although various neural networks with intricate architectures have been developed to address this problem, they still face two key challenges: i) Recent advancements in network designs for modeling spatio-temporal correlations are starting to see diminishing returns in performance enhancements. ii) Additionally, most models do not account for the spatio-temporal heterogeneity inherent in traffic data, i.e., traffic distribution varies significantly across different regions and traffic flow patterns fluctuate across various time slots. To tackle these challenges, we introduce the Spatio-Temporal Graph Transformer (STGormer), which effectively integrates attribute and structure information inherent in traffic data for learning spatio-temporal correlations, and a mixture-of-experts module for capturing heterogeneity along spaital and temporal axes. Specifically, we design two straightforward yet effective spatial encoding methods based on the graph structure and integrate time position encoding into the vanilla transformer to capture spatio-temporal traffic patterns. Additionally, a mixture-of-experts enhanced feedforward neural network (FNN) module adaptively assigns suitable expert layers to distinct patterns via a spatio-temporal gating network, further improving overall prediction accuracy. Experiments on real-world traffic datasets demonstrate that STGormer achieves state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  |

In this study, we focus on an instance of spatio-temporal learning problem--traffic prediction--to demonstrate an advanced deep learning model developed for making accurate and reliable forecast. Despite the significant progress in traffic prediction, limited studies have incorporated both explicit and implicit traffic patterns simultaneously to improve prediction performance. Meanwhile, the variability nature of traffic states necessitates quantifying the uncertainty of model predictions in a statistically principled way; however, extant studies offer no provable guarantee on the statistical validity of confidence intervals in reflecting its actual likelihood of containing the ground truth. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end traffic prediction framework that leverages three primary components to generate accurate and reliable traffic predictions: dynamic causal structure learning for discovering implicit traffic patterns from massive traffic data, causally-aware spatio-temporal multi-graph convolution network (CASTMGCN) for learning spatio-temporal dependencies, and conformal prediction for uncertainty quantification. CASTMGCN fuses several graphs that characterize different important aspects of traffic networks and an auxiliary graph that captures the effect of exogenous factors on the road network. On this basis, a conformal prediction approach tailored to spatio-temporal data is further developed for quantifying the uncertainty in node-wise traffic predictions over varying prediction horizons. Experimental results on two real-world traffic datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms several state-of-the-art models in prediction accuracy; moreover, it generates more efficient prediction regions than other methods while strictly satisfying the statistical validity in coverage.</p></details> |  |

Among the different numerical methods available, the discrete element method (DEM) provides one of the most accurate representations of a wide range of physical systems involving granular and discontinuous materials. Consequently, DEM has become a widely accepted approach for tackling engineering problems connected to granular flows and powder mechanics. Additionally, DEM can be integrated with grid-based computational fluid dynamics (CFD) methods, enabling the simulation of chemical processes taking place, e.g., in fluidized beds. However, DEM is computationally intensive because of the intrinsic multiscale nature of particulate systems, restricting simulation duration or number of particles. Towards this end, NeuralDEM presents an end-to-end approach to replace slow numerical DEM routines with fast, adaptable deep learning surrogates. NeuralDEM is capable of picturing long-term transport processes across different regimes using macroscopic observables without any reference to microscopic model parameters. First, NeuralDEM treats the Lagrangian discretization of DEM as an underlying continuous field, while simultaneously modeling macroscopic behavior directly as additional auxiliary fields. Second, NeuralDEM introduces multi-branch neural operators scalable to real-time modeling of industrially-sized scenarios - from slow and pseudo-steady to fast and transient. Such scenarios have previously posed insurmountable challenges for deep learning models. Notably, NeuralDEM faithfully models coupled CFD-DEM fluidized bed reactors of 160k CFD cells and 500k DEM particles for trajectories of 28s. NeuralDEM will open many new doors to advanced engineering and much faster process cycles.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://nx-ai.github.io/NeuralDEM/</p></details> |

These global tasks involve not only absolute and relative temporal and spatial constraints, but also group behaviors, including task completion times, agent capabilities, and task interdependencies such as the need for synchronous execution. The global tasks are formally formulated into global signal temporal logic (STL) formulae, and a synchronous robustness metric is designed to evaluate the synchronization quality with real values. A mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) encoding method is further proposed to realize task-satisfied motion planning with high synchronicity and minimum control efforts. The encoding method uses a logarithmic number of binary variables to fully capture synchronous robustness, leading to only linear computational complexity. Simulations are conducted to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed control strategy.</p></details> | 10 pages, 4 figures |

One critical issue is bridging the gap between discrete entities in low-level observations and the abstract concepts required for effective planning. A common solution is building hierarchical agents, where VLMs serve as high-level reasoners that break down tasks into executable sub-tasks, typically specified using language. However, language suffers from the inability to communicate detailed spatial information. We propose visual-temporal context prompting, a novel communication protocol between VLMs and policy models. This protocol leverages object segmentation from past observations to guide policy-environment interactions. Using this approach, we train ROCKET-1, a low-level policy that predicts actions based on concatenated visual observations and segmentation masks, supported by real-time object tracking from SAM-2. Our method unlocks the potential of VLMs, enabling them to tackle complex tasks that demand spatial reasoning. Experiments in Minecraft show that our approach enables agents to achieve previously unattainable tasks, with a $\mathbf{76}\%$ absolute improvement in open-world interaction performance.

Dual Temporal Grounding for Video Dialog](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05767v2)** | 2024-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the realm of video dialog response generation, the understanding of video content and the temporal nuances of conversation history are paramount. While a segment of current research leans heavily on large-scale pretrained visual-language models and often overlooks temporal dynamics, another delves deep into spatial-temporal relationships within videos but demands intricate object trajectory pre-extractions and sidelines dialog temporal dynamics. This paper introduces the Dual Temporal Grounding-enhanced Video Dialog model (DTGVD), strategically designed to merge the strengths of both dominant approaches. It emphasizes dual temporal relationships by predicting dialog turn-specific temporal regions, filtering video content accordingly, and grounding responses in both video and dialog contexts. One standout feature of DTGVD is its heightened attention to chronological interplay. By recognizing and acting upon the dependencies between different dialog turns, it captures more nuanced conversational dynamics. To further bolster the alignment between video and dialog temporal dynamics, we've implemented a list-wise contrastive learning strategy. Within this framework, accurately grounded turn-clip pairings are designated as positive samples, while less precise pairings are categorized as negative. This refined classification is then funneled into our holistic end-to-end response generation mechanism. Evaluations using AVSD@DSTC-7 and AVSD@DSTC-8 datasets underscore the superiority of our methodology.</p></details> |  |

Its novel architecture is inspired by Deep Latent Gaussian Model (DLGM). Our model is trained to minimize a loss function based on the negative log loss. One contributing factor to Time Deep Latent Gaussian Model (tDLGM) robustness is our regularizer, which accounts for data trends. Experiments conducted show that tDLGM is able to reconstruct and generate complex time series data, and that it is robust against to noise and faulty data.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches often address these dimensions in isolation, neglecting their critical interdependencies. In this paper, we introduce the Spatio-Temporal Unitized Model (STUM), a unified framework designed to capture both spatial and temporal dependencies while addressing spatio-temporal heterogeneity through techniques such as distribution alignment and feature fusion. It also ensures both predictive accuracy and computational efficiency. Central to STUM is the Adaptive Spatio-temporal Unitized Cell (ASTUC), which utilizes low-rank matrices to seamlessly store, update, and interact with space, time, as well as their correlations. Our framework is also modular, allowing it to integrate with various spatio-temporal graph neural networks through components such as backbone models, feature extractors, residual fusion blocks, and predictive modules to collectively enhance forecasting outcomes. Experimental results across multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that STUM consistently improves prediction performance with minimal computational cost. These findings are further supported by hyperparameter optimization, pre-training analysis, and result visualization.

| **[STARFlow: Spatial Temporal Feature Re-embedding with Attentive Learning for Real-world Scene Flow](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07032v2)** | 2024-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scene flow prediction is a crucial underlying task in understanding dynamic scenes as it offers fundamental motion information. However, contemporary scene flow methods encounter three major challenges. Firstly, flow estimation solely based on local receptive fields lacks long-dependency matching of point pairs. To address this issue, we propose global attentive flow embedding to match all-to-all point pairs in both feature space and Euclidean space, providing global initialization before local refinement. Secondly, there are deformations existing in non-rigid objects after warping, which leads to variations in the spatiotemporal relation between the consecutive frames. For a more precise estimation of residual flow, a spatial temporal feature re-embedding module is devised to acquire the sequence features after deformation. Furthermore, previous methods perform poor generalization due to the significant domain gap between the synthesized and LiDAR-scanned datasets.

Previous studies under this theory have examined myriad characteristics of recombined knowledge and their performance implications. One such feature that has received much attention is technological knowledge age. Yet, little is known about how the age of scientific knowledge influences the impact of inventions, despite the widely known catalyzing role of science in the creation of new technologies. Here we use a large corpus of patents and derive features characterizing how patents temporally search in the scientific space. We find that patents that cite scientific papers have more citations and substantially more likely to become breakthroughs. Conditional on searching in the scientific space, referencing more recent papers increases the impact of patents and the likelihood of being breakthroughs. However, this positive effect can be offset if patents cite papers whose ages exhibit a low variance. These effects are consistent across technological fields.</p></details> |  |
| **[DeBaTeR: Denoising Bipartite Temporal Graph for Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09181v1)** | 2024-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to the difficulty of acquiring large-scale explicit user feedback, implicit feedback (e.g., clicks or other interactions) is widely applied as an alternative source of data, where user-item interactions can be modeled as a bipartite graph. Due to the noisy and biased nature of implicit real-world user-item interactions, identifying and rectifying noisy interactions are vital to enhance model performance and robustness. Previous works on purifying user-item interactions in collaborative filtering mainly focus on mining the correlation between user/item embeddings and noisy interactions, neglecting the benefit of temporal patterns in determining noisy interactions. Time information, while enhancing the model utility, also bears its natural advantage in helping to determine noisy edges, e.g., if someone usually watches horror movies at night and talk shows in the morning, a record of watching a horror movie in the morning is more likely to be noisy interaction. Armed with this observation, we introduce a simple yet effective mechanism for generating time-aware user/item embeddings and propose two strategies for denoising bipartite temporal graph in recommender systems (DeBaTeR): the first is through reweighting the adjacency matrix (DeBaTeR-A), where a reliability score is defined to reweight the edges through both soft assignment and hard assignment; the second is through reweighting the loss function (DeBaTeR-L), where weights are generated to reweight user-item samples in the losses. Extensive experiments have been conducted to demonstrate the efficacy of our methods and illustrate how time information indeed helps identifying noisy edges.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Edge-Based Decomposition Framework for Temporal Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11843v2)** | 2024-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A temporal network is a dynamic graph where every edge is assigned an integer time label that indicates at which discrete time step the edge is available. We consider the problem of hierarchically decomposing the network and introduce an edge-based decomposition framework that unifies the core and truss decompositions for temporal networks while allowing us to consider the network's temporal dimension. Based on our new framework, we introduce the $(k,\Delta)$-core and $(k,\Delta)$-truss decompositions, which are generalizations of the classic $k$-core and $k$-truss decompositions for multigraphs. Moreover, we show how $(k,\Delta)$-cores and $(k,\Delta)$-trusses can be efficiently further decomposed to obtain spatially and temporally connected components. We evaluate the characteristics of our new decompositions and the efficiency of our algorithms. Moreover, we demonstrate how our $(k,\Delta)$-decompositions can be applied to analyze malicious content in a Twitter network to obtain insights that state-of-the-art baselines cannot obtain.</p></details> | Accepted at WSDM'25 |
| **[Goal-oriented Semantic Communication for Robot Arm Reconstruction in Digital Twin: Feature and Temporal Selections](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08835v1)** | 2024-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As one of the most promising technologies in industry, the Digital Twin (DT) facilitates real-time monitoring and predictive analysis for real-world systems by precisely reconstructing virtual replicas of physical entities. However, this reconstruction faces unprecedented challenges due to the everincreasing communication overhead, especially for digital robot arm reconstruction. To this end, we propose a novel goal-oriented semantic communication (GSC) framework to extract the GSC information for the robot arm reconstruction task in the DT, with the aim of minimising the communication load under the strict and relaxed reconstruction error constraints. Unlike the traditional reconstruction framework that periodically transmits a reconstruction message for real-time DT reconstruction, our framework implements a feature selection (FS) algorithm to extract the semantic information from the reconstruction message, and a deep reinforcement learning-based temporal selection algorithm to selectively transmit the semantic information over time. We validate our proposed GSC framework through both Pybullet simulations and lab experiments based on the Franka Research 3 robot arm. For a range of distinct robotic tasks, simulation results show that our framework can reduce the communication load by at least 59.5% under strict reconstruction error constraints and 80% under relaxed reconstruction error constraints, compared with traditional communication framework. Also, experimental results confirm the effectiveness of our framework, where the communication load is reduced by 53% in strict constraint case and 74% in relaxed constraint case.

These sophisticated MLLMs exhibit remarkable proficiency in comprehending videos, swiftly attaining unprecedented performance levels across diverse benchmarks. However, their operation demands substantial memory and computational resources, underscoring the continued importance of traditional models in video comprehension tasks. In this paper, we introduce a novel learning paradigm termed MLLM4WTAL. This paradigm harnesses the potential of MLLM to offer temporal action key semantics and complete semantic priors for conventional Weakly-supervised Temporal Action Localization (WTAL) methods. MLLM4WTAL facilitates the enhancement of WTAL by leveraging MLLM guidance. It achieves this by integrating two distinct modules: Key Semantic Matching (KSM) and Complete Semantic Reconstruction (CSR). These modules work in tandem to effectively address prevalent issues like incomplete and over-complete outcomes common in WTAL methods. Rigorous experiments are conducted to validate the efficacy of our proposed approach in augmenting the performance of various heterogeneous WTAL models.</p></details> |  |

The imitation learning-based robot motion generation method, however, has the drawback of depending on the demonstrator's task execution speed. This paper presents a novel temporal ensemble approach applied to imitation learning algorithms, allowing for execution of future actions. The proposed method leverages existing demonstration data and pre-trained policies, offering the advantages of requiring no additional computation and being easy to implement. The algorithms performance was validated through real-world experiments involving robotic block color sorting, demonstrating up to 3x increase in task execution speed while maintaining a high success rate compared to the action chunking with transformer method. This study highlights the potential for significantly improving the performance of imitation learning-based policies, which were previously limited by the demonstrator's speed.

While recent advances in temporal grounding have led to impressive performance, they have also driven network architectures toward greater complexity, with a range of methods to (1) capture temporal relationships and (2) achieve effective multimodal fusion. In contrast, this paper explores the question: How effective can a simplified approach be? To investigate, we design SimBase, a network that leverages lightweight, one-dimensional temporal convolutional layers instead of complex temporal structures. For cross-modal interaction, SimBase only employs an element-wise product instead of intricate multimodal fusion. Remarkably, SimBase achieves state-of-the-art results on two large-scale datasets. As a simple yet powerful baseline, we hope SimBase will spark new ideas and streamline future evaluations in temporal video grounding.</p></details> | Technical report |

Robots can significantly enhance plant and temporal fruit monitoring by providing precise, high-throughput assessments that overcome the limitations of traditional manual methods. Fruit monitoring is a challenging task due to the significant variation in size, shape, orientation, and occlusion of fruits. Also, fruits may be harvested or newly grown between recording sessions. Most methods are 2D image-based and they lack the 3D structure, depth, and spatial information, which represent key aspects of fruit monitoring. 3D colored point clouds, instead, can offer this information but they introduce challenges such as their sparsity and irregularity. In this paper, we present a novel approach for temporal fruit monitoring that addresses point clouds collected in a greenhouse over time. Our method segments fruits using a learning-based instance segmentation approach directly on the point cloud. Each segmented fruit is processed by a 3D sparse convolutional neural network to extract descriptors, which are used in an attention-based matching network to associate fruits with their instances from previous data collections. Experimental results on a real dataset of strawberries demonstrate that our approach outperforms other methods for fruits re-identification over time, allowing for precise temporal fruit monitoring in real and complex scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters</p></details> |
| **[TUNeS: A Temporal U-Net with Self-Attention for Video-based Surgical Phase Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09997v5)** | 2024-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To enable context-aware computer assistance in the operating room of the future, cognitive systems need to understand automatically which surgical phase is being performed by the medical team. The primary source of information for surgical phase recognition is typically video, which presents two challenges: extracting meaningful features from the video stream and effectively modeling temporal information in the sequence of visual features. For temporal modeling, attention mechanisms have gained popularity due to their ability to capture long-range dependencies. In this paper, we explore design choices for attention in existing temporal models for surgical phase recognition and propose a novel approach that uses attention more effectively and does not require hand-crafted constraints: TUNeS, an efficient and simple temporal model that incorporates self-attention at the core of a convolutional U-Net structure. In addition, we propose to train the feature extractor, a standard CNN, together with an LSTM on preferably long video segments, i.e., with long temporal context. In our experiments, almost all temporal models performed better on top of feature extractors that were trained with longer temporal context. On these contextualized features, TUNeS achieves state-of-the-art results on the Cholec80 dataset. This study offers new insights on how to use attention mechanisms to build accurate and efficient temporal models for surgical phase recognition. Implementing automatic surgical phase recognition is essential to automate the analysis and optimization of surgical workflows and to enable context-aware computer assistance during surgery, thus ultimately improving patient care.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we explore the concept of equilibrium design, where incentives are designed to obtain a desirable equilibrium that satisfies a specific temporal logic property. Our study is based on a framework where system specifications are represented as temporal logic formulae, games as quantitative concurrent game structures, and players' goals as mean-payoff objectives. We consider system specifications given by LTL and GR(1) formulae, and show that designing incentives to ensure that a given temporal logic property is satisfied on some/every Nash equilibrium of the game can be achieved in PSPACE for LTL properties and in NP/{\Sigma}P 2 for GR(1) specifications. We also examine the complexity of related decision and optimisation problems, such as optimality and uniqueness of solutions, as well as considering social welfare, and show that the complexities of these problems lie within the polynomial hierarchy. Equilibrium design can be used as an alternative solution to rational synthesis and verification problems for concurrent games with mean-payoff objectives when no solution exists or as a technique to repair concurrent games with undesirable Nash equilibria in an optimal way.</p></details> | <details><summary>The m...</summary><p>The manuscript is going to be submitted to the Journal on Logical Methods in Computer Science. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2106.10192</p></details> |

Converting sparse events to dense intensity frames faithfully has long been an ill-posed problem. Previous methods have primarily focused on converting events to video in dynamic scenes or with a moving camera. In this paper, for the first time, we realize events to dense intensity image conversion using a stationary event camera in static scenes with a transmittance adjustment device for brightness modulation. Different from traditional methods that mainly rely on event integration, the proposed Event-Based Temporal Mapping Photography (EvTemMap) measures the time of event emitting for each pixel. Then, the resulting Temporal Matrix is converted to an intensity frame with a temporal mapping neural network. At the hardware level, the proposed EvTemMap is implemented by combining a transmittance adjustment device with a DVS, named Adjustable Transmittance Dynamic Vision Sensor (AT-DVS). Additionally, we collected TemMat dataset under various conditions including low-light and high dynamic range scenes. The experimental results showcase the high dynamic range, fine-grained details, and high-grayscale resolution of the proposed EvTemMap.

First, traffic data is segmented by a sliding window to construct a feature sequence and a corresponding label sequence for network traffic. Next, the proposed spectral label generation methods, SSPE and COAP, are applied to transform the label sequence into spectral labels and the feature sequence into temporal features. Spectral labels and temporal features are used to capture and represent behavioral patterns of attacks. Finally, the constructed temporal features and spectral labels are used to train models, which subsequently detects and identifies network attack behaviors. Experimental results demonstrate that compared to traditional methods, models trained with the SSPE or COAP method improve identification accuracy by 10%, and exhibit strong robustness, particularly in noisy environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 7 figures, 7 tables, 8 formulas</p></details> |

Assuming three processes that unfold concurrently in the translating mind, it integrates the Task Segment Framework (Munoz & Apfelthaler 2022) and the HOF taxonomy (Carl et al 2024) into a coherent architecture: uninterrupted translation production is caused by routinized/automated processes, cognitive/reflective interventions lead to longer keystroke pauses, while emotional/affective states of the mind are identified by distinctive gazing patterns. Utilizing data from the CRITT Translation Process Research Database (TPR-DB), the paper illustrates how the temporal structure of keystroke and gazing data can be related to the three assumed hidden mental processes that are believed to cause the observable data. The paper relates this embedded generative model with Robinsons (2023) ideosomatic theory of translation, opening exciting, new theoretical horizons for Cognitive Translation Studies, grounded in empirical data and evaluation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Translation of Temporal Logic for Efficient Infinite-State Reactive Synthesis (Full Version)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07078v1)** | 2024-11-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Infinite-state reactive synthesis has attracted significant attention in recent years, which has led to the emergence of novel symbolic techniques for solving infinite-state games. Temporal logics featuring variables over infinite domains offer an expressive high-level specification language for infinite-state reactive systems. Currently, the only way to translate these temporal logics into symbolic games is by naively encoding the specification to use techniques designed for the Boolean case. An inherent limitation of this approach is that it results in games in which the semantic structure of the temporal and first-order constraints present in the formula is lost. There is a clear need for techniques that leverage this information in the translation process to speed up solving the generated games. In this work, we propose the first approach that addresses this gap. Our technique constructs a monitor incorporating first-order and temporal reasoning at the formula level, enriching the constructed game with semantic information that leads to more efficient solving. We demonstrate that thanks to this, our method outperforms the state-of-the-art techniques across a range of benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is a full version of paper accepted at POPL 2025</p></details> |
| **[ENAT: Rethinking Spatial-temporal Interactions in Token-based Image Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06959v1)** | 2024-11-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, token-based generation have demonstrated their effectiveness in image synthesis. As a representative example, non-autoregressive Transformers (NATs) can generate decent-quality images in a few steps. NATs perform generation in a progressive manner, where the latent tokens of a resulting image are incrementally revealed. At each step, the unrevealed image regions are padded with mask tokens and inferred by NAT. In this paper, we delve into the mechanisms behind the effectiveness of NATs and uncover two important patterns that naturally emerge from NATs: Spatially (within a step), although mask and visible tokens are processed uniformly by NATs, the interactions between them are highly asymmetric. In specific, mask tokens mainly gather information for decoding, while visible tokens tend to primarily provide information, and their deep representations can be built only upon themselves. Temporally (across steps), the interactions between adjacent generation steps mostly concentrate on updating the representations of a few critical tokens, while the computation for the majority of tokens is generally repetitive. Driven by these findings, we propose EfficientNAT (ENAT), a NAT model that explicitly encourages these critical interactions inherent in NATs. At the spatial level, we disentangle the computations of visible and mask tokens by encoding visible tokens independently, while decoding mask tokens conditioned on the fully encoded visible tokens. At the temporal level, we prioritize the computation of the critical tokens at each step, while maximally reusing previously computed token representations to supplement necessary information. ENAT improves the performance of NATs notably with significantly reduced computational cost. Experiments on ImageNet-256, ImageNet-512 and MS-COCO validate the effectiveness of ENAT.

| **[Efficient Unsupervised Domain Adaptation Regression for Spatial-Temporal Air Quality Sensor Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06917v1)** | 2024-11-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The deployment of affordable Internet of Things (IoT) sensors for air pollution monitoring has increased in recent years due to their scalability and cost-effectiveness. However, accurately calibrating these sensors in uncontrolled environments remains a significant challenge. While expensive reference sensors can provide accurate ground truth data, they are often deployed on a limited scale due to high costs, leading to a scarcity of labeled data. In diverse urban environments, data distributions constantly shift due to varying factors such as traffic patterns, industrial activities, and weather conditions, which impact sensor readings. Consequently, traditional machine learning models -- despite their increasing deployment for environmental sensor calibration -- often struggle to provide reliable pollutant measurements across different locations due to domain shifts. To address these challenges, we propose a novel unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) method specifically tailored for regression tasks on graph-structured data. Our approach leverages Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to model the relationships between sensors. To effectively capture critical spatial-temporal interactions, we incorporate spatial-temporal graph neural networks (STGNNs), which extend GNNs by incorporating temporal dynamics. To handle the resulting larger embeddings, we propose a domain adaptation method using a closed-form solution inspired by the Tikhonov-regularized least-squares problem. This method leverages Cholesky decomposition and power iteration to align the subspaces between source and target domains. By aligning these subspaces, our approach allows low-cost IoT sensors to learn calibration parameters from expensive reference sensors. This facilitates reliable pollutant measurements in new locations without the need for additional costly equipment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatially Constrained Transformer with Efficient Global Relation Modelling for Spatio-Temporal Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06836v1)** | 2024-11-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate spatio-temporal prediction is crucial for the sustainable development of smart cities. However, current approaches often struggle to capture important spatio-temporal relationships, particularly overlooking global relations among distant city regions. Most existing techniques predominantly rely on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to capture global relations. However, CNNs exhibit neighbourhood bias, making them insufficient for capturing distant relations. To address this limitation, we propose ST-SampleNet, a novel transformer-based architecture that combines CNNs with self-attention mechanisms to capture both local and global relations effectively. Moreover, as the number of regions increases, the quadratic complexity of self-attention becomes a challenge. To tackle this issue, we introduce a lightweight region sampling strategy that prunes non-essential regions and enhances the efficiency of our approach. Furthermore, we introduce a spatially constrained position embedding that incorporates spatial neighbourhood information into the self-attention mechanism, aiding in semantic interpretation and improving the performance of ST-SampleNet. Our experimental evaluation on three real-world datasets demonstrates the effectiveness of ST-SampleNet. Additionally, our efficient variant achieves a 40% reduction in computational costs with only a marginal compromise in performance, approximately 1%.</p></details> |  |

Building on these advancements, early methods have been developed for dynamic surface reconstruction by globally optimizing entire sequences. However, reconstructing dynamic scenes with significant topology changes, emerging or disappearing objects, and rapid movements remains a substantial challenge, particularly for long sequences. To address these issues, we propose AT-GS, a novel method for reconstructing high-quality dynamic surfaces from multi-view videos through per-frame incremental optimization. To avoid local minima across frames, we introduce a unified and adaptive gradient-aware densification strategy that integrates the strengths of conventional cloning and splitting techniques. Additionally, we reduce temporal jittering in dynamic surfaces by ensuring consistency in curvature maps across consecutive frames. Our method achieves superior accuracy and temporal coherence in dynamic surface reconstruction, delivering high-fidelity space-time novel view synthesis, even in complex and challenging scenes. Extensive experiments on diverse multi-view video datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, showing clear advantages over baseline methods.

Policy evaluation is complicated in the rare event setting by the long timescale of the event and by the need for \emph{relative accuracy} in estimates of very small values. Specifically, we focus on least-squares TD (LSTD) prediction for finite state Markov chains, and show that LSTD can achieve relative accuracy far more efficiently than MC. We prove a central limit theorem for the LSTD estimator and upper bound the \emph{relative asymptotic variance} by simple quantities characterizing the connectivity of states relative to the transition probabilities between them. Using this bound, we show that, even when both the timescale of the rare event and the relative accuracy of the MC estimator are exponentially large in the number of states, LSTD maintains a fixed level of relative accuracy with a total number of observed transitions of the Markov chain that is only \emph{polynomially} large in the number of states.</p></details> | <details><summary>camer...</summary><p>camera-ready version published at NeurIPS 2024.

Nevertheless, vanilla RNNs are confronted with the well-known issue of gradient vanishing and exploding, posing a significant challenge for learning and establishing long-range dependencies. Additionally, gated RNNs tend to be over-parameterized, resulting in poor computational efficiency and network generalization. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel Delayed Memory Unit (DMU). The DMU incorporates a delay line structure along with delay gates into vanilla RNN, thereby enhancing temporal interaction and facilitating temporal credit assignment. Specifically, the DMU is designed to directly distribute the input information to the optimal time instant in the future, rather than aggregating and redistributing it over time through intricate network dynamics. Our proposed DMU demonstrates superior temporal modeling capabilities across a broad range of sequential modeling tasks, utilizing considerably fewer parameters than other state-of-the-art gated RNN models in applications such as speech recognition, radar gesture recognition, ECG waveform segmentation, and permuted sequential image classification.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems, 2024</p></details> |

We introduce a cost function that recursively computes the robustness of temporal logic specifications while penalizing time and control effort, striking a balance between path feasibility and logical correctness. We validate our approach with simulations and real-world experiments in complex environments, demonstrating its effectiveness in producing robust and practical motion plans. This work represents a significant step towards expanding the applicability of motion planning algorithms to more complex, real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  |

To address these issues, we propose a novel approach that more accurately reflects human cognition. This paper introduces HERMES: temporal-coHERent long-forM understanding with Episodes and Semantics, a model that simulates episodic memory accumulation to capture action sequences and reinforces them with semantic knowledge dispersed throughout the video. Our work makes two key contributions: First, we develop an Episodic COmpressor (ECO) that efficiently aggregates crucial representations from micro to semi-macro levels, overcoming the challenge of long-range dependencies. Second, we propose a Semantics ReTRiever (SeTR) that enhances these aggregated representations with semantic information by focusing on the broader context, dramatically reducing feature dimensionality while preserving relevant macro-level information. This addresses the issues of redundancy and lack of high-level concept extraction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HERMES achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple long-video understanding benchmarks in both zero-shot and fully-supervised settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is an improved and expanded version of our EVAL-FoMo Workshop at ECCV'24 (v1 of this paper).

In temporal data, static path-based centralities like closeness or betweenness can give misleading results about the true importance of nodes in a temporal graph. To address this issue, temporal generalizations of betweenness and closeness have been defined that are based on the shortest time-respecting paths between pairs of nodes. However, a major issue of those generalizations is that the calculation of such paths is computationally expensive. Addressing this issue, we study the application of De Bruijn Graph Neural Networks (DBGNN), a time-aware graph neural network architecture, to predict temporal path-based centralities in time series data. We experimentally evaluate our approach in 13 temporal graphs from biological and social systems and show that it considerably improves the prediction of betweenness and closeness centrality compared to (i) a static Graph Convolutional Neural Network, (ii) an efficient sampling-based approximation technique for temporal betweenness, and (iii) two state-of-the-art time-aware graph learning techniques for dynamic graphs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |

In fact, simple heuristic approaches such as persistent forecasts and moving averages over ground-truth labels significantly and consistently outperform TGNs. Building on this observation, we find that computing heuristics over messages is an equally competitive approach, outperforming TGN and all current temporal graph (TG) models on dynamic node affinity prediction. In this paper, we prove that no formulation of TGN can represent persistent forecasting or moving averages over messages, and propose to enhance the expressivity of TGNs by adding source-target identification to each interaction event message. We show that this modification is required to represent persistent forecasting, moving averages, and the broader class of autoregressive models over messages. Our proposed method, TGNv2, significantly outperforms TGN and all current TG models on all Temporal Graph Benchmark (TGB) dynamic node affinity prediction datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS Symmetry and Geometry in Neural Representations Workshop 2024</p></details> |

We consider a network with $n$ nodes and $m$ edges where the capacity and length of each edge is a piecewise constant function, and use $\mu=\Omega(m)$ to denote the total number of pieces in all of the $2m$ functions. Our goal is to design exact algorithms for various flow problems that run in time polynomial in the parameter $\mu$. Importantly, the algorithms we design are strongly polynomial, i.e. have no dependence on the capacities, flow value, or the time horizon of the flow process, all of which can be exponentially large relative to the other parameters; and return an integral flow when all input parameters are integral. Our main result is an algorithm for checking feasibility of a dynamic transshipment problem on temporal networks -- given multiple sources and sinks with supply and demand values, is it possible to satisfy the desired supplies and demands within a given time horizon? We develop a fast ($O(\mu^3)$ time) algorithm for this feasibility problem when the input network has a certain canonical form, by exploiting the cut structure of the associated time expanded network. We then adapt an approach of \cite{hoppe2000} to show how other flow problems on temporal networks can be reduced to the canonical format. For computing dynamic transshipments on temporal networks, this results in a $O(\mu^7)$ time algorithm, whereas the previous best integral exact algorithm runs in time $\tilde O(\mu^{19})$. We achieve similar improvements for other flow problems on temporal networks.</p></details> | 33 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Sampling-guided Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network with Temporal Smoothing for Scalable Longitudinal Data Imputation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04899v1)** | 2024-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose a novel framework, the Sampling-guided Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network (SHT-GNN), to effectively tackle the challenge of missing data imputation in longitudinal studies. Unlike traditional methods, which often require extensive preprocessing to handle irregular or inconsistent missing data, our approach accommodates arbitrary missing data patterns while maintaining computational efficiency. SHT-GNN models both observations and covariates as distinct node types, connecting observation nodes at successive time points through subject-specific longitudinal subnetworks, while covariate-observation interactions are represented by attributed edges within bipartite graphs. By leveraging subject-wise mini-batch sampling and a multi-layer temporal smoothing mechanism, SHT-GNN efficiently scales to large datasets, while effectively learning node representations and imputing missing data. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets, including the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset, demonstrate that SHT-GNN significantly outperforms existing imputation methods, even with high missing data rates. The empirical results highlight SHT-GNN's robust imputation capabilities and superior performance, particularly in the context of complex, large-scale longitudinal data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Zero-Shot Temporal Resolution Domain Adaptation for Spiking Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04760v1)** | 2024-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are biologically-inspired deep neural networks that efficiently extract temporal information while offering promising gains in terms of energy efficiency and latency when deployed on neuromorphic devices. However, SNN model parameters are sensitive to temporal resolution, leading to significant performance drops when the temporal resolution of target data at the edge is not the same with that of the pre-deployment source data used for training, especially when fine-tuning is not possible at the edge. To address this challenge, we propose three novel domain adaptation methods for adapting neuron parameters to account for the change in time resolution without re-training on target time-resolution. The proposed methods are based on a mapping between neuron dynamics in SNNs and State Space Models (SSMs); and are applicable to general neuron models. We evaluate the proposed methods under spatio-temporal data tasks, namely the audio keyword spotting datasets SHD and MSWC as well as the image classification NMINST dataset. Our methods provide an alternative to - and in majority of the cases significantly outperform - the existing reference method that simply scales the time constant. Moreover, our results show that high accuracy on high temporal resolution data can be obtained by time efficient training on lower temporal resolution data and model adaptation.</p></details> |  |

They were widely investigated both as an unsupervised learning method in artificial intelligence and as a model of biological neural dynamics in computational neuroscience. The complexity features of biological neural networks have attracted the scientific community's interest for the last two decades. More recently, concepts and tools borrowed from complex network theory were applied to artificial neural networks and learning, thus focusing on the topological aspects. However, the temporal structure is also a crucial property displayed by biological neural networks and investigated in the framework of systems displaying complex intermittency. The Intermittency-Driven Complexity (IDC) approach indeed focuses on the metastability of self-organized states, whose signature is a power-decay in the inter-event time distribution or a scaling behaviour in the related event-driven diffusion processes. The investigation of IDC in neural dynamics and its relationship with network topology is still in its early stages. In this work, we present the preliminary results of an IDC analysis carried out on a bio-inspired Hopfield-type neural network comparing two different connectivities, i.e., scale-free vs. random network topology. We found that random networks can trigger complexity features similar to that of scale-free networks, even if with some differences and for different parameter values, in particular for different noise levels</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-temporal crack segmentation in concrete structure using deep learning approaches](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04620v1)** | 2024-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cracks are among the earliest indicators of deterioration in concrete structures. Early automatic detection of these cracks can significantly extend the lifespan of critical infrastructures, such as bridges, buildings, and tunnels, while simultaneously reducing maintenance costs and facilitating efficient structural health monitoring. This study investigates whether leveraging multi-temporal data for crack segmentation can enhance segmentation quality. Therefore, we compare a Swin UNETR trained on multi-temporal data with a U-Net trained on mono-temporal data to assess the effect of temporal information compared with conventional single-epoch approaches. To this end, a multi-temporal dataset comprising 1356 images, each with 32 sequential crack propagation images, was created. After training the models, experiments were conducted to analyze their generalization ability, temporal consistency, and segmentation quality. The multi-temporal approach consistently outperformed its mono-temporal counterpart, achieving an IoU of $82.72\%$ and a F1-score of $90.54\%$, representing a significant improvement over the mono-temporal model's IoU of $76.69\%$ and F1-score of $86.18\%$, despite requiring only half of the trainable parameters. The multi-temporal model also displayed a more consistent segmentation quality, with reduced noise and fewer errors. These results suggest that temporal information significantly enhances the performance of segmentation models, offering a promising solution for improved crack detection and the long-term monitoring of concrete structures, even with limited sequential data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Identifying Performance Issues in Cloud Service Systems Based on Relational-Temporal Features](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10869v3)** | 2024-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cloud systems are susceptible to performance issues, which may cause service-level agreement violations and financial losses. In current practice, crucial metrics are monitored periodically to provide insight into the operational status of components. Identifying performance issues is often formulated as an anomaly detection problem, which is tackled by analyzing each metric independently. However, this approach overlooks the complex dependencies existing among cloud components. Some graph neural network-based methods take both temporal and relational information into account, however, the correlation violations in the metrics that serve as indicators of underlying performance issues are difficult for them to identify. Furthermore, a large volume of components in a cloud system results in a vast array of noisy metrics. This complexity renders it impractical for engineers to fully comprehend the correlations, making it challenging to identify performance issues accurately. To address these limitations, we propose Identifying Performance Issues based on Relational-Temporal Features (ISOLATE ), a learning-based approach that leverages both the relational and temporal features of metrics to identify performance issues. In particular, it adopts a graph neural network with attention to characterizing the relations among metrics and extracts long-term and multi-scale temporal patterns using a GRU and a convolution network, respectively. The learned graph attention weights can be further used to localize the correlation-violated metrics. Moreover, to relieve the impact of noisy data, ISOLATE utilizes a positive unlabeled learning strategy that tags pseudo-labels based on a small portion of confirmed negative examples. Extensive evaluation on both public and industrial datasets shows that ISOLATE outperforms all baseline models with 0.945 F1-score and 0.920 Hit rate@3.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology (TOSEM)</p></details> |
| **[Prompt-Based Spatio-Temporal Graph Transfer Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12452v2)** | 2024-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal graph neural networks have proven efficacy in capturing complex dependencies for urban computing tasks such as forecasting and kriging. Yet, their performance is constrained by the reliance on extensive data for training on a specific task, thereby limiting their adaptability to new urban domains with varied task demands. Although transfer learning has been proposed to remedy this problem by leveraging knowledge across domains, the cross-task generalization still remains under-explored in spatio-temporal graph transfer learning due to the lack of a unified framework. To bridge the gap, we propose Spatio-Temporal Graph Prompting (STGP), a prompt-based framework capable of adapting to multi-diverse tasks in a data-scarce domain. Specifically, we first unify different tasks into a single template and introduce a task-agnostic network architecture that aligns with this template. This approach enables capturing dependencies shared across tasks. Furthermore, we employ learnable prompts to achieve domain and task transfer in a two-stage prompting pipeline, facilitating the prompts to effectively capture domain knowledge and task-specific properties. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that STGP outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in three tasks-forecasting, kriging, and extrapolation-achieving an improvement of up to 10.7%.</p></details> |  |

To estimate realistic 3D human mesh sequences based on incomplete features, we propose Temporally-alignable Probability Guided Graph Topological Modeling for 3D Human Reconstruction (ProGraph). For missing parts recovery, we exploit the explicit topological-aware probability distribution across the entire motion sequence. To restore the complete human, Graph Topological Modeling (GTM) learns the underlying topological structure, focusing on the relationships inherent in the individual parts. Next, to generate blurred motion parts, Temporal-alignable Probability Distribution (TPDist) utilizes the GTM to predict features based on distribution. This interactive mechanism facilitates motion consistency, allowing the restoration of human parts. Furthermore, Hierarchical Human Loss (HHLoss) constrains the probability distribution errors of inter-frame features during topological structure variation. Our Method achieves superior results than other SOTA methods in addressing occlusions and blurriness on 3DPW.</p></details> |  |

Mixture models of temporal point processes have been proposed to solve this problem, but they often suffer from overfitting, leading to excessive cluster generation with a lack of diversity. To overcome these limitations, we propose a Bayesian mixture model of Temporal Point Processes with Determinantal Point Process prior (TP$^2$DP$^2$) and accordingly an efficient posterior inference algorithm based on conditional Gibbs sampling. Our work provides a flexible learning framework for event sequence clustering, enabling automatic identification of the potential number of clusters and accurate grouping of sequences with similar features. It is applicable to a wide range of parametric temporal point processes, including neural network-based models. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world data suggest that our framework could produce moderately fewer yet more diverse mixture components, and achieve outstanding results across multiple evaluation metrics.</p></details> |  |

I show that experimental data have an auxiliary role in this context. They bring no identifying power without additional modeling assumptions. When modeling assumptions are imposed, experimental data serve to amplify their identifying power. If the assumptions fail, adding experimental data may only yield results that are farther from the truth. Motivated by this, I introduce two assumptions on treatment response that may be defensible based on economic theory or intuition. To utilize them, I develop a novel two-step identification approach that centers on bounding temporal link functions -- the relationship between short-term and mean long-term potential outcomes. The approach provides sharp bounds on LTEs for a general class of assumptions, and allows for imperfect experimental compliance -- extending existing results.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robust Real-Time Mortality Prediction in the Intensive Care Unit using Temporal Difference Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04285v1)** | 2024-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The task of predicting long-term patient outcomes using supervised machine learning is a challenging one, in part because of the high variance of each patient's trajectory, which can result in the model over-fitting to the training data. Temporal difference (TD) learning, a common reinforcement learning technique, may reduce variance by generalising learning to the pattern of state transitions rather than terminal outcomes. However, in healthcare this method requires several strong assumptions about patient states, and there appears to be limited literature evaluating the performance of TD learning against traditional supervised learning methods for long-term health outcome prediction tasks. In this study, we define a framework for applying TD learning to real-time irregularly sampled time series data using a Semi-Markov Reward Process. We evaluate the model framework in predicting intensive care mortality and show that TD learning under this framework can result in improved model robustness compared to standard supervised learning methods. and that this robustness is maintained even when validated on external datasets. This approach may offer a more reliable method when learning to predict patient outcomes using high-variance irregular time series data.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be published in the Proceedings of the 4th Machine Learning for Health symposium, Proceedings of Machine Learning Research (PMLR)</p></details> |

While convolutional neural networks are widely used in learning ice layer patterns from raw echogram images captured by airborne snow radar sensors, noise in the echogram images prevents researchers from getting high-quality results. Instead, we focus on geometric deep learning using graph neural networks, aiming to build a spatio-temporal graph neural network that learns from thickness information of the top ice layers and predicts for deeper layers. In this paper, we developed a novel multi-branch spatio-temporal graph neural network that used the GraphSAGE framework for spatio features learning and a temporal convolution operation to capture temporal changes, enabling different branches of the network to be more specialized and focusing on a single learning task. We found that our proposed multi-branch network can consistently outperform the current fused spatio-temporal graph neural network in both accuracy and efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Temporal Network Creation Games: The Impact of Non-Locality and Terminals](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03973v1)** | 2024-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We live in a world full of networks where our economy, our communication, and even our social life crucially depends on them. These networks typically emerge from the interaction of many entities, which is why researchers study agent-based models of network formation. While traditionally static networks with a fixed set of links were considered, a recent stream of works focuses on networks whose behavior may change over time. In particular, Bil\`o et al. (IJCAI 2023) recently introduced a game-theoretic network formation model that embeds temporal aspects in networks. More precisely, a network is formed by selfish agents corresponding to nodes in a given host network with edges having labels denoting their availability over time. Each agent strategically selects local, i.e., incident, edges to ensure temporal reachability towards everyone at low cost. In this work we set out to explore the impact of two novel conceptual features: agents are no longer restricted to creating incident edges, called the global setting, and agents might only want to ensure that they can reach a subset of the other nodes, called the terminal model. For both, we study the existence, structure, and quality of equilibrium networks. For the terminal model, we prove that many core properties crucially depend on the number of terminals. We also develop a novel tool that allows translating equilibrium constructions from the non-terminal model to the terminal model. For the global setting, we show the surprising result that equilibria in the global and the local model are incomparable and we establish a high lower bound on the Price of Anarchy of the global setting that matches the upper bound of the local model. This shows the counter-intuitive fact that allowing agents more flexibility in edge creation does not improve the quality of equilibrium networks.</p></details> |  |

Current state-of-the-art methods typically adopt dual-path networks to separately modeling spatial features and temporal features. However, the uncertain compatibility of the two networks brings a challenge for spatio-temporal features fusion and violate the spatio-temporal coherence and coupling of human motions by nature.

This perspective considers spatio-temporal dynamics unitedly and reformulates multi-person motion prediction into a problem on a single graph. Leveraging the dynamic message passing based on this hypergraph, our model dynamically learns from both types of relations to generate targeted messages that reflect the relevance among nodes. Extensive experiments on several datasets demonstrates that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, confirming its effectiveness and innovative design.</p></details> | <details><summary>13pag...</summary><p>13pages, 12 figures. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2411.03729</p></details> |

The existing mainstream solutions generally leverage temporal information by roughly stacking history frames to supplement the current frame, such straightforward temporal modeling inevitably diminishes valid clues and increases learning difficulty. To address this problem, we present HTCL, a novel Hierarchical Temporal Context Learning paradigm for improving camera-based semantic scene completion. The primary innovation of this work involves decomposing temporal context learning into two hierarchical steps: (a) cross-frame affinity measurement and (b) affinity-based dynamic refinement. Firstly, to separate critical relevant context from redundant information, we introduce the pattern affinity with scale-aware isolation and multiple independent learners for fine-grained contextual correspondence modeling. Subsequently, to dynamically compensate for incomplete observations, we adaptively refine the feature sampling locations based on initially identified locations with high affinity and their neighboring relevant regions. Our method ranks $1^{st}$ on the SemanticKITTI benchmark and even surpasses LiDAR-based methods in terms of mIoU on the OpenOccupancy benchmark.

Much research suggests that NAc dopamine encodes temporal-difference (TD) errors for learning value predictions. However, dopamine is synchronously distributed in regionally homogeneous concentrations, which does not support explicit credit assignment (like used by backpropagation). It is unclear whether distributed errors alone are sufficient for synapses to make coordinated updates to learn complex, nonlinear reward-based learning tasks. We design a new deep Q-learning algorithm, Artificial Dopamine, to computationally demonstrate that synchronously distributed, per-layer TD errors may be sufficient to learn surprisingly complex RL tasks. We empirically evaluate our algorithm on MinAtar, the DeepMind Control Suite, and classic control tasks, and show it often achieves comparable performance to deep RL algorithms that use backpropagation.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, to be published at NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |

| **[Temporal Smoothness Regularisers for Neural Link Predictors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09045v2)** | 2024-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most algorithms for representation learning and link prediction on relational data are designed for static data. However, the data to which they are applied typically evolves over time, including online social networks or interactions between users and items in recommender systems. This is also the case for graph-structured knowledge bases -- knowledge graphs -- which contain facts that are valid only for specific points in time. In such contexts, it becomes crucial to correctly identify missing links at a precise time point, i.e. the temporal prediction link task. Recently, Lacroix et al. and Sadeghian et al. proposed a solution to the problem of link prediction for knowledge graphs under temporal constraints inspired by the canonical decomposition of 4-order tensors, where they regularise the representations of time steps by enforcing temporal smoothing, i.e. by learning similar transformation for adjacent timestamps. However, the impact of the choice of temporal regularisation terms is still poorly understood. In this work, we systematically analyse several choices of temporal smoothing regularisers using linear functions and recurrent architectures. In our experiments, we show that by carefully selecting the temporal smoothing regulariser and regularisation weight, a simple method like TNTComplEx can produce significantly more accurate results than state-of-the-art methods on three widely used temporal link prediction datasets. Furthermore, we evaluate the impact of a wide range of temporal smoothing regularisers on two state-of-the-art temporal link prediction models. Our work shows that simple tensor factorisation models can produce new state-of-the-art results using newly proposed temporal regularisers, highlighting a promising avenue for future research.</p></details> |  |

HD EEG devices improve the spatial resolution of EEG by placing more electrodes on the scalp, which meet the requirements of clinical diagnostic applications such as epilepsy focus localization. However, this technique faces challenges, such as high acquisition costs and limited usage scenarios. In this paper, spatio-temporal adaptive diffusion models (STAD) are proposed to pioneer the use of diffusion models for achieving spatial SR reconstruction from low-resolution (LR, 64 channels or fewer) EEG to high-resolution (HR, 256 channels) EEG. Specifically, a spatio-temporal condition module is designed to extract the spatio-temporal features of LR EEG, which then used as conditional inputs to direct the reverse denoising process. Additionally, a multi-scale Transformer denoising module is constructed to leverage multi-scale convolution blocks and cross-attention-based diffusion Transformer blocks for conditional guidance to generate subject-adaptive SR EEG. Experimental results demonstrate that the STAD significantly enhances the spatial resolution of LR EEG and quantitatively outperforms existing methods. Furthermore, STAD demonstrate their value by applying synthetic SR EEG to classification and source localization tasks, indicating their potential to Substantially boost the spatial resolution of EEG.</p></details> |  |

While recent radar-camera fusion methods have made significant progress by fusing information in the bird's-eye view (BEV) representation, they often struggle to effectively capture the motion of dynamic objects, leading to limited performance in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we introduce CRT-Fusion, a novel framework that integrates temporal information into radar-camera fusion to address this challenge. Our approach comprises three key modules: Multi-View Fusion (MVF), Motion Feature Estimator (MFE), and Motion Guided Temporal Fusion (MGTF). The MVF module fuses radar and image features within both the camera view and bird's-eye view, thereby generating a more precise unified BEV representation. The MFE module conducts two simultaneous tasks: estimation of pixel-wise velocity information and BEV segmentation. Based on the velocity and the occupancy score map obtained from the MFE module, the MGTF module aligns and fuses feature maps across multiple timestamps in a recurrent manner. By considering the motion of dynamic objects, CRT-Fusion can produce robust BEV feature maps, thereby improving detection accuracy and robustness. Extensive evaluations on the challenging nuScenes dataset demonstrate that CRT-Fusion achieves state-of-the-art performance for radar-camera-based 3D object detection. Our approach outperforms the previous best method in terms of NDS by +1.7%, while also surpassing the leading approach in mAP by +1.4%. These significant improvements in both metrics showcase the effectiveness of our proposed fusion strategy in enhancing the reliability and accuracy of 3D object detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS2024</p></details> |

In this paper, we introduce temporal Wasserstein imputation, a novel method for imputing missing data in time series. Unlike existing techniques, our approach is fully nonparametric, circumventing the need for model specification prior to imputation, making it suitable for potential nonlinear dynamics. Its principled algorithmic implementation can seamlessly handle univariate or multivariate time series with any missing pattern. In addition, the plausible range and side information of the missing entries (such as box constraints) can easily be incorporated. As a key advantage, our method mitigates the distributional bias typical of many existing approaches, ensuring more reliable downstream statistical analysis using the imputed series. Leveraging the benign landscape of the optimization formulation, we establish the convergence of an alternating minimization algorithm to critical points. Furthermore, we provide conditions under which the marginal distributions of the underlying time series can be identified. Our numerical experiments, including extensive simulations covering linear and nonlinear time series models and an application to a real-world groundwater dataset laden with missing data, corroborate the practical usefulness of the proposed method.</p></details> |  |

A promising optimization approach is to leverage the intrinsic physical characteristics of targets, which remain invariable regardless of environmental conditions, to provide robust insights. However, our study reveals that while physical characteristics exhibit robust properties, they may lack class-specific discriminative patterns. Consequently, directly incorporating physical characteristics into model training can potentially introduce unintended inductive biases, leading to performance degradation. To utilize the benefits of physical characteristics while mitigating possible detrimental effects, we propose DEMONet in this study, which utilizes the detection of envelope modulation on noise (DEMON) to provide robust insights into the shaft frequency or blade counts of targets. DEMONet is a multi-expert network that allocates various underwater signals to their best-matched expert layer based on DEMON spectra for fine-grained signal processing. Thereinto, DEMON spectra are solely responsible for providing implicit physical characteristics without establishing a mapping relationship with the target category. Furthermore, to mitigate noise and spurious modulation spectra in DEMON features, we introduce a cross-temporal alignment strategy and employ a variational autoencoder (VAE) to reconstruct noise-resistant DEMON spectra to replace the raw DEMON features. The effectiveness of the proposed DEMONet with cross-temporal VAE was primarily evaluated on the DeepShip dataset and our proprietary datasets. Experimental results demonstrated that our approach could achieve state-of-the-art performance on both datasets.</p></details> |  |

Recent studies on collaborative perception mostly utilize CNNs or Transformers to learn feature representation and fusion in the spatial dimension, which struggle to handle long-range spatial-temporal features under limited computing and communication resources. Holistically modeling the dependencies over extensive spatial areas and extended temporal frames is crucial to enhancing feature quality. To this end, we propose a resource efficient cross-agent spatial-temporal collaborative state space model (SSM), named CollaMamba. Initially, we construct a foundational backbone network based on spatial SSM. This backbone adeptly captures positional causal dependencies from both single-agent and cross-agent views, yielding compact and comprehensive intermediate features while maintaining linear complexity. Furthermore, we devise a history-aware feature boosting module based on temporal SSM, extracting contextual cues from extended historical frames to refine vague features while preserving low overhead. Extensive experiments across several datasets demonstrate that CollaMamba outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving higher model accuracy while reducing computational and communication overhead by up to 71.9% and 1/64, respectively. This work pioneers the exploration of the Mamba's potential in collaborative perception. The source code will be made available.</p></details> |  |

We notice the challenge that large language models (LLMs) face when engaging in temporal reasoning. Our preliminary experiments show that methods involving the generation of intermediate reasoning steps, such as chain-of-thought and program-aided language models, do not consistently boost the performance of complex temporal question-answering tasks. This limitation can be attributed to the LLMs' inadequate understanding of temporal information. To address this problem, we propose TempLogic, a novel framework designed specifically for temporal question-answering tasks across three levels of reasoning. TempLogic incorporates retrieval-guided context distillation, temporal data extraction, and tailor-made logic reasoning. Extensive experiments and analysis demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in solving intricate time-bound reasoning tasks.</p></details> | Work in progress |
| **[AM Flow: Adapters for Temporal Processing in Action Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02065v1)** | 2024-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning models, in particular \textit{image} models, have recently gained generalisability and robustness. %are becoming more general and robust by the day. In this work, we propose to exploit such advances in the realm of \textit{video} classification. Video foundation models suffer from the requirement of extensive pretraining and a large training time. Towards mitigating such limitations, we propose "\textit{Attention Map (AM) Flow}" for image models, a method for identifying pixels relevant to motion in each input video frame. In this context, we propose two methods to compute AM flow, depending on camera motion. AM flow allows the separation of spatial and temporal processing, while providing improved results over combined spatio-temporal processing (as in video models). Adapters, one of the popular techniques in parameter efficient transfer learning, facilitate the incorporation of AM flow into pretrained image models, mitigating the need for full-finetuning. We extend adapters to "\textit{temporal processing adapters}" by incorporating a temporal processing unit into the adapters. Our work achieves faster convergence, therefore reducing the number of epochs needed for training. Moreover, we endow an image model with the ability to achieve state-of-the-art results on popular action recognition datasets. This reduces training time and simplifies pretraining. We present experiments on Kinetics-400, Something-Something v2, and Toyota Smarthome datasets, showcasing state-of-the-art or comparable results.</p></details> |  |
| **[TRACE: Temporal Grounding Video LLM via Causal Event Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05643v2)** | 2024-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Temporal Grounding (VTG) is a crucial capability for video understanding models and plays a vital role in downstream tasks such as video browsing and editing. To effectively handle various tasks simultaneously and enable zero-shot prediction, there is a growing trend in employing video LLMs for VTG tasks. However, current video LLM-based methods rely exclusively on natural language generation, lacking the ability to model the clear structure inherent in videos, which restricts their effectiveness in tackling VTG tasks. To address this issue, this paper first formally introduces causal event modeling framework, which represents videos as sequences of events, and predict the current event using previous events, video inputs, and textural instructions. Each event consists of three components: timestamps, salient scores, and textual captions. We then propose a novel task-interleaved video LLM called TRACE to effectively implement the causal event modeling framework in practice. The TRACE processes visual frames, timestamps, salient scores, and text as distinct tasks, employing various encoders and decoding heads for each. Task tokens are arranged in an interleaved sequence according to the causal event modeling framework's formulation. Extensive experiments on various VTG tasks and datasets demonstrate the superior performance of TRACE compared to state-of-the-art video LLMs. Our model and code are available at \url{https://github.com/gyxxyg/TRACE}.</p></details> |  |

Traditional methods often focus solely on spatial or temporal features, limiting their ability to comprehend complex human activities fully. Our proposed model integrates joint, motion, and temporal information through a multi-stream fusion architecture. Specifically, it comprises a joint stream for extracting skeleton features, a temporal stream for capturing dynamic temporal features, and an ARN-LSTM block that utilizes Time-Distributed Long Short-Term Memory (TD-LSTM) layers followed by an Attention Relation Network (ARN) to model temporal relations. The outputs from these streams are fused in a fully connected layer to provide the final action prediction. Evaluations on the NTU RGB+D 60 and NTU RGB+D 120 datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our model, achieving effective performance, particularly in group activity recognition.</p></details> |  |
| **[FedASTA: Federated adaptive spatial-temporal attention for traffic flow prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13090v2)** | 2024-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mobile devices and the Internet of Things (IoT) devices nowadays generate a large amount of heterogeneous spatial-temporal data. It remains a challenging problem to model the spatial-temporal dynamics under privacy concern. Federated learning (FL) has been proposed as a framework to enable model training across distributed devices without sharing original data which reduce privacy concern. Personalized federated learning (PFL) methods further address data heterogenous problem. However, these methods don't consider natural spatial relations among nodes. For the sake of modeling spatial relations, Graph Neural Netowork (GNN) based FL approach have been proposed. But dynamic spatial-temporal relations among edge nodes are not taken into account. Several approaches model spatial-temporal dynamics in a centralized environment, while less effort has been made under federated setting. To overcome these challeges, we propose a novel Federated Adaptive Spatial-Temporal Attention (FedASTA) framework to model the dynamic spatial-temporal relations. On the client node, FedASTA extracts temporal relations and trend patterns from the decomposed terms of original time series. Then, on the server node, FedASTA utilize trend patterns from clients to construct adaptive temporal-spatial aware graph which captures dynamic correlation between clients. Besides, we design a masked spatial attention module with both static graph and constructed adaptive graph to model spatial dependencies among clients. Extensive experiments on five real-world public traffic flow datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-art performance in federated scenario. In addition, the experiments made in centralized setting show the effectiveness of our novel adaptive graph construction approach compared with other popular dynamic spatial-temporal aware methods.</p></details> |  |

However, accurately capturing interactions across multiple spatial and temporal scales remains a significant challenge. We present a novel framework that jointly models spatial and temporal multiscale interactions in molecular dynamics. Our approach leverages Graph Fourier Transforms to decompose molecular structures into different spatial scales and employs Neural Ordinary Differential Equations to model the temporal dynamics in a curated manner influenced by the spatial modes. This unified framework links spatial structures with temporal evolution in a flexible manner, enabling more accurate and comprehensive simulations of molecular systems. We evaluate our model on the MD17 dataset, demonstrating consistent performance improvements over state-of-the-art baselines across multiple molecules, particularly under challenging conditions such as irregular timestep sampling and long-term prediction horizons. Ablation studies confirm the significant contributions of both spatial and temporal multiscale modeling components. Our method advances the simulation of complex molecular systems, potentially accelerating research in computational chemistry, drug discovery, and materials science.</p></details> |  |

To address these limitations, we propose BiT-MamSleep, a novel architecture that integrates the Triple-Resolution CNN (TRCNN) for efficient multi-scale feature extraction with the Bidirectional Mamba (BiMamba) mechanism, which models both short- and long-term temporal dependencies through bidirectional processing of EEG data. Additionally, BiT-MamSleep incorporates an Adaptive Feature Recalibration (AFR) module and a temporal enhancement block to dynamically refine feature importance, optimizing classification accuracy without increasing computational complexity. To further improve robustness, we apply optimization techniques such as Focal Loss and SMOTE to mitigate class imbalance. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate that BiT-MamSleep significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly in handling long EEG sequences and addressing class imbalance, leading to more accurate and scalable sleep stage classification.</p></details> |  |

Predicting future events typically relies on closely related historical facts, yielding more accurate results for repetitive or periodic events. However, for future events with sparse historical interactions, the effectiveness of this method, which focuses on leveraging high-frequency historical information, diminishes. Recently, the capabilities of diffusion models in image generation have opened new opportunities for TKG reasoning. Therefore, we propose a graph node diffusion model with dual-domain periodic contrastive learning (DPCL-Diff). Graph node diffusion model (GNDiff) introduces noise into sparsely related events to simulate new events, generating high-quality data that better conforms to the actual distribution. This generative mechanism significantly enhances the model's ability to reason about new events. Additionally, the dual-domain periodic contrastive learning (DPCL) maps periodic and non-periodic event entities to Poincar\'e and Euclidean spaces, leveraging their characteristics to distinguish similar periodic events effectively. Experimental results on four public datasets demonstrate that DPCL-Diff significantly outperforms state-of-the-art TKG models in event prediction, demonstrating our approach's effectiveness. This study also investigates the combined effectiveness of GNDiff and DPCL in TKG tasks.</p></details> | 11 pages, 2 figures |
| **[Learning Hidden Subgoals under Temporal Ordering Constraints in Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01425v1)** | 2024-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In real-world applications, the success of completing a task is often determined by multiple key steps which are distant in time steps and have to be achieved in a fixed time order. For example, the key steps listed on the cooking recipe should be achieved one-by-one in the right time order. These key steps can be regarded as subgoals of the task and their time orderings are described as temporal ordering constraints. However, in many real-world problems, subgoals or key states are often hidden in the state space and their temporal ordering constraints are also unknown, which make it challenging for previous RL algorithms to solve this kind of tasks. In order to address this issue, in this work we propose a novel RL algorithm for {\bf l}earning hidden {\bf s}ubgoals under {\bf t}emporal {\bf o}rdering {\bf c}onstraints (LSTOC). We propose a new contrastive learning objective which can effectively learn hidden subgoals (key states) and their temporal orderings at the same time, based on first-occupancy representation and temporal geometric sampling. In addition, we propose a sample-efficient learning strategy to discover subgoals one-by-one following their temporal order constraints by building a subgoal tree to represent discovered subgoals and their temporal ordering relationships. Specifically, this tree can be used to improve the sample efficiency of trajectory collection, fasten the task solving and generalize to unseen tasks. The LSTOC framework is evaluated on several environments with image-based observations, showing its significant improvement over baseline methods.</p></details> |  |

The inherent uncertainty and variability in such data often render deterministic models insufficient, prompting a shift towards probabilistic approaches, where diffusion-based generative models have emerged as effective solutions. In this paper, we present ProGen, a novel framework for probabilistic spatiotemporal time series forecasting that leverages Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs) and diffusion-based generative modeling techniques in the continuous domain. By integrating a novel denoising score model, graph neural networks, and a tailored SDE, ProGen provides a robust solution that effectively captures spatiotemporal dependencies while managing uncertainty. Our extensive experiments on four benchmark traffic datasets demonstrate that ProGen outperforms state-of-the-art deterministic and probabilistic models. This work contributes a continuous, diffusion-based generative approach to spatiotemporal forecasting, paving the way for future research in probabilistic modeling and stochastic processes.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods struggle to address the complex, temporally dynamic nature of endoscopic scenes. This paper presents ST-Endo4DGS, a novel framework that models the spatio-temporal volume of dynamic endoscopic scenes using unbiased 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS) primitives, parameterized by anisotropic ellipses with flexible 4D rotations. This approach enables precise representation of deformable tissue dynamics, capturing intricate spatial and temporal correlations in real time. Additionally, we extend spherindrical harmonics to represent time-evolving appearance, achieving realistic adaptations to lighting and view changes. A new endoscopic normal alignment constraint (ENAC) further enhances geometric fidelity by aligning rendered normals with depth-derived geometry. Extensive evaluations show that ST-Endo4DGS outperforms existing methods in both visual quality and real-time performance, establishing a new state-of-the-art in dynamic scene reconstruction for endoscopic surgery.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Unifying Approach to Product Constructions for Quantitative Temporal Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10465v2)** | 2024-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Probabilistic programs are a powerful and convenient approach to formalise distributions over system executions. A classical verification problem for probabilistic programs is temporal inference: to compute the likelihood that the execution traces satisfy a given temporal property. This paper presents a general framework for temporal inference, which applies to a rich variety of quantitative models including those that arise in the operational semantics of probabilistic and weighted programs. The key idea underlying our framework is that in a variety of existing approaches, the main construction that enables temporal inference is that of a product between the system of interest and the temporal property. We provide a unifying mathematical definition of product constructions, enabled by the realisation that 1) both systems and temporal properties can be modelled as coalgebras and 2) product constructions are distributive laws in this context. Our categorical framework leads us to our main contribution: a sufficient condition for correctness, which is precisely what enables to use the product construction for temporal inference. We show that our framework can be instantiated to naturally recover a number of disparate approaches from the literature including, e.g., partial expected rewards in Markov reward models, resource-sensitive reachability analysis, and weighted optimization problems. Further, we demonstrate a product of weighted programs and weighted temporal properties as a new instance to show the scalability of our approach.</p></details> | Preprint |

At the core of the framework is an adaptive memory designed to accommodate dynamic changes in context over time, alongside a feature augmentation module that enhances the frames with the memory. In addition, we propose a post-processing approach to mitigate the severe over-segmentation in the online setting. On three common segmentation benchmarks, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 4 figures, 12 tables.

| **[Robot Policy Learning with Temporal Optimal Transport Reward](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21795v2)** | 2024-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reward specification is one of the most tricky problems in Reinforcement Learning, which usually requires tedious hand engineering in practice. One promising approach to tackle this challenge is to adopt existing expert video demonstrations for policy learning. Some recent work investigates how to learn robot policies from only a single/few expert video demonstrations. For example, reward labeling via Optimal Transport (OT) has been shown to be an effective strategy to generate a proxy reward by measuring the alignment between the robot trajectory and the expert demonstrations. However, previous work mostly overlooks that the OT reward is invariant to temporal order information, which could bring extra noise to the reward signal. To address this issue, in this paper, we introduce the Temporal Optimal Transport (TemporalOT) reward to incorporate temporal order information for learning a more accurate OT-based proxy reward. Extensive experiments on the Meta-world benchmark tasks validate the efficacy of the proposed method. Code is available at: https://github.com/fuyw/TemporalOT</p></details> | NeurIPS 2024 |

Our approach captures temporal and feature dependencies within a unified spatio-temporal pipeline by leveraging a GCNN that uses a spatio-temporal graph aimed at optimizing predictive accuracy and interoperability. For graph estimation, we introduce techniques, including one based on the (heterogeneous) Gower distance. Once estimated, we propose two methods for graph construction: one based on the Cartesian product, treating temporal instants homogeneously, and another spatio-temporal approach with distinct graphs per time step. We also propose two GCNN architectures: a standard GCNN with a normalized adjacency matrix and a higher-order polynomial GCNN. In addition to accuracy, we emphasize explainability by designing an inherently interpretable model and performing a thorough interpretability analysis, identifying key feature-time combinations that drive predictions. We evaluate XST-GCNN using real-world Electronic Health Record data from University Hospital of Fuenlabrada to predict Multidrug Resistance (MDR) in ICU patients, a critical healthcare challenge linked to high mortality and complex treatments. Our architecture outperforms traditional models, achieving a mean ROC-AUC score of 81.03 +- 2.43. Furthermore, the interpretability analysis provides actionable insights into clinical factors driving MDR predictions, enhancing model transparency. This work sets a benchmark for tackling complex inference tasks with heterogeneous MTS, offering a versatile, interpretable solution for real-world applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[CTPD: Cross-Modal Temporal Pattern Discovery for Enhanced Multimodal Electronic Health Records Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00696v1)** | 2024-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Integrating multimodal Electronic Health Records (EHR) data, such as numerical time series and free-text clinical reports, has great potential in predicting clinical outcomes. However, prior work has primarily focused on capturing temporal interactions within individual samples and fusing multimodal information, overlooking critical temporal patterns across patients. These patterns, such as trends in vital signs like abnormal heart rate or blood pressure, can indicate deteriorating health or an impending critical event. Similarly, clinical notes often contain textual descriptions that reflect these patterns. Identifying corresponding temporal patterns across different modalities is crucial for improving the accuracy of clinical outcome predictions, yet it remains a challenging task. To address this gap, we introduce a Cross-Modal Temporal Pattern Discovery (CTPD) framework, designed to efficiently extract meaningful cross-modal temporal patterns from multimodal EHR data. Our approach introduces shared initial temporal pattern representations which are refined using slot attention to generate temporal semantic embeddings. To ensure rich cross-modal temporal semantics in the learned patterns, we introduce a contrastive-based TPNCE loss for cross-modal alignment, along with two reconstruction losses to retain core information of each modality. Evaluations on two clinically critical tasks, 48-hour in-hospital mortality and 24-hour phenotype classification, using the MIMIC-III database demonstrate the superiority of our method over existing approaches.</p></details> | Technical report |

However, Transformer's complex architecture and black-box nature pose challenges for explainability, a crucial aspect for real-world applications and scientific inquiry. Current Explainable AI (XAI) methods can only provide one-dimensional feature importance, either spatial or temporal explanation, with significant computational complexity. This paper introduces STAA (Spatio-Temporal Attention Attribution), an XAI method for interpreting video Transformer models. Differ from traditional methods that separately apply image XAI techniques for spatial features or segment contribution analysis for temporal aspects, STAA offers both spatial and temporal information simultaneously from attention values in Transformers. The study utilizes the Kinetics-400 dataset, a benchmark collection of 400 human action classes used for action recognition research. We introduce metrics to quantify explanations. We also apply optimization to enhance STAA's raw output. By implementing dynamic thresholding and attention focusing mechanisms, we improve the signal-to-noise ratio in our explanations, resulting in more precise visualizations and better evaluation results. In terms of computational overhead, our method requires less than 3\% of the computational resources of traditional XAI methods, making it suitable for real-time video XAI analysis applications. STAA contributes to the growing field of XAI by offering a method for researchers and practitioners to analyze Transformer models.</p></details> |  |

A Contrastive Method](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00612v1)** | 2024-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal Heterogeneous Networks play a crucial role in capturing the dynamics and heterogeneity inherent in various real-world complex systems, rendering them a noteworthy research avenue for link prediction. However, existing methods fail to capture the fine-grained differential distribution patterns and temporal dynamic characteristics, which we refer to as spatial heterogeneity and temporal heterogeneity. To overcome such limitations, we propose a novel \textbf{C}ontrastive Learning-based \textbf{L}ink \textbf{P}rediction model, \textbf{CLP}, which employs a multi-view hierarchical self-supervised architecture to encode spatial and temporal heterogeneity. Specifically, aiming at spatial heterogeneity, we develop a spatial feature modeling layer to capture the fine-grained topological distribution patterns from node- and edge-level representations, respectively. Furthermore, aiming at temporal heterogeneity, we devise a temporal information modeling layer to perceive the evolutionary dependencies of dynamic graph topologies from time-level representations. Finally, we encode the spatial and temporal distribution heterogeneity from a contrastive learning perspective, enabling a comprehensive self-supervised hierarchical relation modeling for the link prediction task. Extensive experiments conducted on four real-world dynamic heterogeneous network datasets verify that our \mymodel consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art models, demonstrating an average improvement of 10.10\%, 13.44\% in terms of AUC and AP, respectively.</p></details> |  |

Current state-of-the-art methods either require multiple independent stages of processing that employ motion cues or, in the case of end-to-end trainable networks, lack in segmentation accuracy, in part due to the difficulty of learning segmentation maps from videos with transient object presence. This limits the application of WSVOS for semantic annotation of surgical videos where multiple surgical tools frequently move in and out of the field of view, a problem that is more difficult than typically encountered in WSVOS. This paper introduces Video Spatio-Temporal Disentanglement Networks (VDST-Net), a framework to disentangle spatiotemporal information using semi-decoupled knowledge distillation to predict high-quality class activation maps (CAMs). A teacher network designed to resolve temporal conflicts when specifics about object location and timing in the video are not provided works with a student network that integrates information over time by leveraging temporal dependencies. We demonstrate the efficacy of our framework on a public reference dataset and on a more challenging surgical video dataset where objects are, on average, present in less than 60\% of annotated frames. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques and generates superior segmentation masks under video-level weak supervision.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV)</p></details> |

Recent catastrophic events in Pakistan and New Zealand underscore the urgent need for precise flood mapping to guide restoration efforts, understand vulnerabilities, and prepare for future occurrences. While Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) remote sensing offers day-and-night, all-weather imaging capabilities, its application in deep learning for flood segmentation is limited by the lack of large annotated datasets. To address this, we introduce Kuro Siwo, a manually annotated multi-temporal dataset, spanning 43 flood events globally. Our dataset maps more than 338 billion $m^2$ of land, with 33 billion designated as either flooded areas or permanent water bodies. Kuro Siwo includes a highly processed product optimized for flood mapping based on SAR Ground Range Detected, and a primal SAR Single Look Complex product with minimal preprocessing, designed to promote research on the exploitation of both the phase and amplitude information and to offer maximum flexibility for downstream task preprocessing. To leverage advances in large scale self-supervised pretraining methods for remote sensing data, we augment Kuro Siwo with a large unlabeled set of SAR samples. Finally, we provide an extensive benchmark, namely BlackBench, offering strong baselines for a diverse set of flood events from Europe, America, Africa, Asia and Australia.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 38th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2024) Track on Datasets and Benchmarks</p></details> |

If these components are found, they can be modelled univariately. Blind source separation aims to recover the latent components by estimating the unmixing transformation based on the observed data only. The current methods for spatio-temporal blind source separation are restricted to linear unmixing, and nonlinear variants have not been implemented. In this paper, we extend identifiable variational autoencoder to the nonlinear nonstationary spatio-temporal blind source separation setting and demonstrate its performance using comprehensive simulation studies. Additionally, we introduce two alternative methods for the latent dimension estimation, which is a crucial task in order to obtain the correct latent representation. Finally, we illustrate the proposed methods using a meteorological application, where we estimate the latent dimension and the latent components, interpret the components, and show how nonstationarity can be accounted and prediction accuracy can be improved by using the proposed nonlinear blind source separation method as a preprocessing method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Human Action Recognition (HAR) Using Skeleton-based Spatial Temporal Relative Transformer Network: ST-RTR](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23806v2)** | 2024-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human Action Recognition (HAR) is an interesting research area in human-computer interaction used to monitor the activities of elderly and disabled individuals affected by physical and mental health. In the recent era, skeleton-based HAR has received much attention because skeleton data has shown that it can handle changes in striking, body size, camera views, and complex backgrounds. One key characteristic of ST-GCN is automatically learning spatial and temporal patterns from skeleton sequences. It has some limitations, as this method only works for short-range correlation due to its limited receptive field. Consequently, understanding human action requires long-range interconnection. To address this issue, we developed a spatial-temporal relative transformer ST-RTR model. The ST-RTR includes joint and relay nodes, which allow efficient communication and data transmission within the network. These nodes help to break the inherent spatial and temporal skeleton topologies, which enables the model to understand long-range human action better. Furthermore, we combine ST-RTR with a fusion model for further performance improvements. To assess the performance of the ST-RTR method, we conducted experiments on three skeleton-based HAR benchmarks: NTU RGB+D 60, NTU RGB+D 120, and UAV-Human. It boosted CS and CV by 2.11 % and 1.45% on NTU RGB+D 60, 1.25% and 1.05% on NTU RGB+D 120. On UAV-Human datasets, accuracy improved by 2.54%. The experimental outcomes explain that the proposed ST-RTR model significantly improves action recognition associated with the standard ST-GCN method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving Traffic Flow Predictions with SGCN-LSTM: A Hybrid Model for Spatial and Temporal Dependencies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00282v1)** | 2024-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large amounts of traffic can lead to negative effects such as increased car accidents, air pollution, and significant time wasted. Understanding traffic speeds on any given road segment can be highly beneficial for traffic management strategists seeking to reduce congestion. While recent studies have primarily focused on modeling spatial dependencies by using graph convolutional networks (GCNs) over fixed weighted graphs, the relationships between nodes are often more complex, with edges that interact dynamically. This paper addresses both the temporal patterns in traffic data and the intricate spatial dependencies by introducing the Signal-Enhanced Graph Convolutional Network Long Short Term Memory (SGCN-LSTM) model for predicting traffic speeds across road networks. Extensive experiments on the PEMS-BAY road network traffic dataset demonstrate the SGCN-LSTM model's effectiveness, yielding significant improvements in Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) compared to benchmark models on the same dataset.</p></details> | 5 pages, 6 figures |

We construct a dataset containing audio samples from music covers on YouTube along with the audio of the original song, and sentiment scores derived from user comments, serving as proxy labels for content quality. Our approach involves extensive pre-processing, segmenting audio signals into 30-second windows, and extracting high-dimensional feature representations through Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC), Chroma, Spectral Contrast, and Temporal characteristics. Leveraging these features, we train regression models to predict sentiment scores on a 0-100 scale, achieving root mean square error (RMSE) values of 3.420, 5.482, 2.783, and 4.212, respectively. Improvements over a baseline model based on absolute difference metrics are observed. These results demonstrate the potential of machine learning to capture sentiment and similarity in audio, offering an adaptable framework for AI applications in media analysis.</p></details> | 6 pages, 6 figures |

This is because whole sequence segmentation is currently a tedious process and inaccurate. Conventional whole sequence segmentation approaches first estimate the motion field between frames, which is then used to propagate the mask along the temporal axis. However, the mask propagation results could be prone to error, especially for the basal and apex slices, where through-plane motion leads to significant morphology and structural change during the cardiac cycle. Inspired by recent advances in video object segmentation (VOS), based on spatio-temporal memory (STM) networks, we propose a continuous STM (CSTM) network for semi-supervised whole heart and whole sequence cMR segmentation. Our CSTM network takes full advantage of the spatial, scale, temporal and through-plane continuity prior of the underlying heart anatomy structures, to achieve accurate and fast 4D segmentation. Results of extensive experiments across multiple cMR datasets show that our method can improve the 4D cMR segmentation performance, especially for the hard-to-segment regions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to WACV 2025</p></details> |
| **[Identifying Spatio-Temporal Drivers of Extreme Events](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24075v1)** | 2024-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The spatio-temporal relations of impacts of extreme events and their drivers in climate data are not fully understood and there is a need of machine learning approaches to identify such spatio-temporal relations from data. The task, however, is very challenging since there are time delays between extremes and their drivers, and the spatial response of such drivers is inhomogeneous. In this work, we propose a first approach and benchmarks to tackle this challenge. Our approach is trained end-to-end to predict spatio-temporally extremes and spatio-temporally drivers in the physical input variables jointly. By enforcing the network to predict extremes from spatio-temporal binary masks of identified drivers, the network successfully identifies drivers that are correlated with extremes. We evaluate our approach on three newly created synthetic benchmarks, where two of them are based on remote sensing or reanalysis climate data, and on two real-world reanalysis datasets.

Large Language Models (LLM) have recently shown promising performance in temporal reasoning tasks such as temporal question answering. Nevertheless, recent studies have tested the LLMs' performance in detecting temporal relations of closed-source models only, limiting the interpretability of those results. In this work, we investigate LLMs' performance and decision process in the Temporal Relation Classification task. First, we assess the performance of seven open and closed-sourced LLMs experimenting with in-context learning and lightweight fine-tuning approaches. Results show that LLMs with in-context learning significantly underperform smaller encoder-only models based on RoBERTa. Then, we delve into the possible reasons for this gap by applying explainable methods. The outcome suggests a limitation of LLMs in this task due to their autoregressive nature, which causes them to focus only on the last part of the sequence. Additionally, we evaluate the word embeddings of these two models to better understand their pre-training differences. The code and the fine-tuned models can be found respectively on GitHub.</p></details> |  |
| **[Asynchronous Jump Testing and Estimation in High Dimensions Under Complex Temporal Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23706v1)** | 2024-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most high dimensional changepoint detection methods assume the error process is stationary and changepoints occur synchronously across dimensions. The violation of these assumptions, which in applied settings is increasingly likely as the dimensionality of the time series being analyzed grows, can dramatically curtail the sensitivity or the accuracy of these methods. We propose AJDN (Asynchronous Jump Detection under Nonstationary noise). AJDN is a high dimensional multiscale jump detection method that tests and estimates jumps in an otherwise smoothly varying mean function for high dimensional time series with nonstationary noise where the jumps across dimensions may not occur at the same time. AJDN is correct in the sense that it detects the correct number of jumps with a prescribed probability asymptotically and its accuracy in estimating the locations of the jumps is asymptotically nearly optimal under the asynchronous jump assumption. Through a simulation study we demonstrate AJDN's robustness across a wide variety of stationary and nonstationary high dimensional time series, and we show its strong performance relative to some existing high dimensional changepoint detection methods. We apply AJDN to a seismic time series to demonstrate its ability to accurately detect jumps in real-world high dimensional time series with complex temporal dynamics.</p></details> |  |

Traditional methods rely on the use of LSTM, GRU networks, and even Transformer architectures for the prediction of spatio-temporal series. This study proposes a viable alternative for predicting these trajectories using only GNSS positions. It considers this spatio-temporal problem as a natural language processing problem. The latitude/longitude coordinates of AIS messages are transformed into cell identifiers using the H3 index. Thanks to the pseudo-octal representation, it becomes easier for language models to learn the spatial hierarchy of the H3 index. The method is compared with a classical Kalman filter, widely used in the maritime domain, and introduces the Fr\'echet distance as the main evaluation metric. We show that it is possible to predict ship trajectories quite precisely up to 8 hours ahead with 30 minutes of context, using solely GNSS positions, without relying on any additional information such as speed, course, or external conditions - unlike many traditional methods. We demonstrate that this alternative works well enough to predict trajectories worldwide.</p></details> | 28 pages, 18 figures |

This paper focuses on the integrated design of UAV trajectories and the precoders at both the transmitter and UAV in a UAV-assisted relay communication system, accounting for transmit power constraints and UAV flight limitations. Unlike previous works that primarily address multiple-input single-output (MISO) systems with Gaussian inputs, we investigate a more realistic scenario involving multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems with finite-alphabet inputs. To tackle the challenging and inherently non-convex problem, we propose an efficient solution algorithm that leverages successive convex approximation and alternating optimization techniques. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, demonstrating its capability to optimize system performance.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing approaches have overlooked the potential of these environments, focusing instead on static contexts without considering userspecific factors. Employing the CREATTIVE3D dataset, our work models trajectories recorded in virtual reality (VR) scenes for diverse situations including road-crossing tasks with user interactions and simulated visual impairments. We propose Diverse Context VR Human Motion Prediction (DiVR), a cross-modal transformer based on the Perceiver architecture that integrates both static and dynamic scene context using a heterogeneous graph convolution network. We conduct extensive experiments comparing DiVR against existing architectures including MLP, LSTM, and transformers with gaze and point cloud context. Additionally, we also stress test our model's generalizability across different users, tasks, and scenes. Results show that DiVR achieves higher accuracy and adaptability compared to other models and to static graphs. This work highlights the advantages of using VR datasets for context-aware human trajectory modeling, with potential applications in enhancing user experiences in the metaverse.

The proposed method takes point cloud as input and efficiently constructs a multi-level map using triangular patches as the basic elements. A kinematic path search is adopted on the patches, where motion primitives on different patches combine to form the global min-time cost initial trajectory. We use a same-level expansion method to locate the nearest obstacle for each trajectory waypoint and construct an objective function with curvature, smoothness and obstacle terms for optimization. We evaluate the method on several complex 3D point cloud maps. Compared to existing methods, our method demonstrates higher robustness to point cloud noise, enabling the generation of high quality trajectory while maintaining high computational efficiency. Our code will be publicly available at https://github.com/ck-tian/MLMC-planner.</p></details> |  |
| **[In-Trajectory Inverse Reinforcement Learning: Learn Incrementally Before An Ongoing Trajectory Terminates](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15612v2)** | 2024-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) aims to learn a reward function and a corresponding policy that best fit the demonstrated trajectories of an expert. However, current IRL works cannot learn incrementally from an ongoing trajectory because they have to wait to collect at least one complete trajectory to learn. To bridge the gap, this paper considers the problem of learning a reward function and a corresponding policy while observing the initial state-action pair of an ongoing trajectory and keeping updating the learned reward and policy when new state-action pairs of the ongoing trajectory are observed. We formulate this problem as an online bi-level optimization problem where the upper level dynamically adjusts the learned reward according to the newly observed state-action pairs with the help of a meta-regularization term, and the lower level learns the corresponding policy. We propose a novel algorithm to solve this problem and guarantee that the algorithm achieves sub-linear local regret $O(\sqrt{T}+\log T+\sqrt{T}\log T)$. If the reward function is linear, we prove that the proposed algorithm achieves sub-linear regret $O(\log T)$. Experiments are used to validate the proposed algorithm.</p></details> |  |
| **[UniTE: A Survey and Unified Pipeline for Pre-training Spatiotemporal Trajectory Embeddings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12550v2)** | 2024-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatiotemporal trajectories are sequences of timestamped locations, which enable a variety of analyses that in turn enable important real-world applications. It is common to map trajectories to vectors, called embeddings, before subsequent analyses. Thus, the qualities of embeddings are very important. Methods for pre-training embeddings, which leverage unlabeled trajectories for training universal embeddings, have shown promising applicability across different tasks, thus attracting considerable interest. However, research progress on this topic faces two key challenges: a lack of a comprehensive overview of existing methods, resulting in several related methods not being well-recognized, and the absence of a unified pipeline, complicating the development of new methods and the analysis of methods. We present UniTE, a survey and a unified pipeline for this domain. In doing so, we present a comprehensive list of existing methods for pre-training trajectory embeddings, which includes methods that either explicitly or implicitly employ pre-training techniques. Further, we present a unified and modular pipeline with publicly available underlying code, simplifying the process of constructing and evaluating methods for pre-training trajectory embeddings. Additionally, we contribute a selection of experimental results using the proposed pipeline on real-world datasets. Implementation of the pipeline is publicly available at https://github.com/Logan-Lin/UniTE.</p></details> |  |

However, existing solutions are often tailored to specific traffic networks at particular time periods. Consequently, deep learning models trained on one network may struggle to generalize effectively to unseen networks. To address this, we proposed a novel spatial-temporal trajectory prediction framework that performs cross-domain adaption on the attention representation of a Transformer-based model. A graph convolutional network is also integrated to construct dynamic graph feature embeddings that accurately model the complex spatial-temporal interactions between the multi-agent vehicles across multiple traffic domains. The proposed framework is validated on two case studies involving the cross-city and cross-period settings. Experimental results show that our proposed framework achieves superior trajectory prediction and domain adaptation performances over the state-of-the-art models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics 2024</p></details> |

Diffusion is an iterative algorithm in which samples are generated step-by-step, starting from pure noise. This process introduces the notion of diffusion trajectories, i.e., paths from the standard Gaussian distribution to the target image distribution. In this context, we study discriminative algorithms operating on these trajectories. Specifically, given a pre-trained diffusion model, we consider the problem of classifying images as part of the training dataset, generated by the model or originating from an external source. Our approach demonstrates the presence of patterns across steps that can be leveraged for classification. We also conduct ablation studies, which reveal that using higher-order gradient features to characterize the trajectories leads to significant performance gains and more robust algorithms.</p></details> |  |
| **['Explaining RL Decisions with Trajectories': A Reproducibility Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07200v1)** | 2024-11-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work investigates the reproducibility of the paper 'Explaining RL decisions with trajectories'. The original paper introduces a novel approach in explainable reinforcement learning based on the attribution decisions of an agent to specific clusters of trajectories encountered during training. We verify the main claims from the paper, which state that (i) training on less trajectories induces a lower initial state value, (ii) trajectories in a cluster present similar high-level patterns, (iii) distant trajectories influence the decision of an agent, and (iv) humans correctly identify the attributed trajectories to the decision of the agent. We recover the environments used by the authors based on the partial original code they provided for one of the environments (Grid-World), and implemented the remaining from scratch (Seaquest, HalfCheetah, Breakout and Q*Bert). While we confirm that (i), (ii), and (iii) partially hold, we extend on the largely qualitative experiments from the authors by introducing a quantitative metric to further support (iii), and new experiments and visual results for (i). Moreover, we investigate the use of different clustering algorithms and encoder architectures to further support (ii). We could not support (iv), given the limited extent of the original experiments. We conclude that, while some of the claims can be supported, further investigations and experiments could be of interest. We recognise the novelty of the work from the authors and hope that our work paves the way for clearer and more transparent approaches.</p></details> |  |

The base transcription algorithm for which we establish the refinement algorithm is a direct multiple shooting technique -- $\mathsf{QuITO}$ $\textsf{v.2}$ (Quasi-Interpolation based Trajectory Optimization).

| **[Online Omnidirectional Jumping Trajectory Planning for Quadrupedal Robots on Uneven Terrains](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04494v2)** | 2024-11-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Natural terrain complexity often necessitates agile movements like jumping in animals to improve traversal efficiency. To enable similar capabilities in quadruped robots, complex real-time jumping maneuvers are required. Current research does not adequately address the problem of online omnidirectional jumping and neglects the robot's kinodynamic constraints during trajectory generation. This paper proposes a general and complete cascade online optimization framework for omnidirectional jumping for quadruped robots. Our solution systematically encompasses jumping trajectory generation, a trajectory tracking controller, and a landing controller. It also incorporates environmental perception to navigate obstacles that standard locomotion cannot bypass, such as jumping from high platforms. We introduce a novel jumping plane to parameterize omnidirectional jumping motion and formulate a tightly coupled optimization problem accounting for the kinodynamic constraints, simultaneously optimizing CoM trajectory, Ground Reaction Forces (GRFs), and joint states. To meet the online requirements, we propose an accelerated evolutionary algorithm as the trajectory optimizer to address the complexity of kinodynamic constraints. To ensure stability and accuracy in environmental perception post-landing, we introduce a coarse-to-fine relocalization method that combines global Branch and Bound (BnB) search with Maximum a Posteriori (MAP) estimation for precise positioning during navigation and jumping. The proposed framework achieves jump trajectory generation in approximately 0.1 seconds with a warm start and has been successfully validated on two quadruped robots on uneven terrains. Additionally, we extend the framework's versatility to humanoid robots.</p></details> | Submitted to IJRR |

As a first step, we train a backup policy to generate evasive movements from arbitrary initial robot states using model-free reinforcement learning. When learning policies for other tasks, the backup policy can be used to estimate the potential risk of a collision and to offer an alternative action if the estimated risk is considered too high. No matter which action is selected, our action space ensures that the kinematic limits of the robot joints are not violated. We analyze and evaluate two different methods for estimating the risk of a collision. A physics simulation performed in the background is computationally expensive but provides the best results in deterministic environments. If a data-based risk estimator is used instead, the computational effort is significantly reduced, but an additional source of error is introduced. For evaluation, we successfully learn a reaching task and a basketball task while keeping the risk of collisions low. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach for deterministic and stochastic environments, including a human-robot scenario and a ball environment, where no state can be considered permanently safe. By conducting experiments with a real robot, we show that our approach can generate safe trajectories in real time.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L); 8 pages; 7 figures</p></details> |

However, adjusting specific elements in generated videos, such as object motion or camera movement, is often a tedious process of trial and error, e.g., involving re-generating videos with different random seeds. Recent techniques address this issue by fine-tuning a pre-trained model to follow conditioning signals, such as bounding boxes or point trajectories. Yet, this fine-tuning procedure can be computationally expensive, and it requires datasets with annotated object motion, which can be difficult to procure.

| **[Optimal Flow Matching: Learning Straight Trajectories in Just One Step](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13117v3)** | 2024-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Over the several recent years, there has been a boom in development of Flow Matching (FM) methods for generative modeling. One intriguing property pursued by the community is the ability to learn flows with straight trajectories which realize the Optimal Transport (OT) displacements. Straightness is crucial for the fast integration (inference) of the learned flow's paths. Unfortunately, most existing flow straightening methods are based on non-trivial iterative FM procedures which accumulate the error during training or exploit heuristics based on minibatch OT. To address these issues, we develop and theoretically justify the novel \textbf{Optimal Flow Matching} (OFM) approach which allows recovering the straight OT displacement for the quadratic transport in just one FM step. The main idea of our approach is the employment of vector field for FM which are parameterized by convex functions.</p></details> |  |

Predicting future movement enables cameras to automatically track and predict a player's future trajectory without human intervention. Predicting future human movement in the context of complex physical tasks is also intellectually satisfying. Swift advancements in sports analytics and the wide availability of videos for tennis have inspired us to propose a novel method called Pose2Trajectory, which predicts a tennis player's future trajectory as a sequence derived from their body joints' data and ball position. Demonstrating impressive accuracy, our approach capitalizes on body joint information to provide a comprehensive understanding of the human body's geometry and motion, thereby enhancing the prediction of the player's trajectory. We use encoder-decoder Transformer architecture trained on the joints and trajectory information of the players with ball positions. The predicted sequence can provide information to help close-up cameras to keep tracking the tennis player, following centroid coordinates. We generate a high-quality dataset from multiple videos to assist tennis player movement prediction using object detection and human pose estimation methods. It contains bounding boxes and joint information for tennis players and ball positions in singles tennis games. Our method shows promising results in predicting the tennis player's movement trajectory with different sequence prediction lengths using the joints and trajectory information with the ball position.</p></details> |  |
| **[TrajGPT: Controlled Synthetic Trajectory Generation Using a Multitask Transformer-Based Spatiotemporal Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04381v1)** | 2024-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human mobility modeling from GPS-trajectories and synthetic trajectory generation are crucial for various applications, such as urban planning, disaster management and epidemiology. Both of these tasks often require filling gaps in a partially specified sequence of visits - a new problem that we call "controlled" synthetic trajectory generation. Existing methods for next-location prediction or synthetic trajectory generation cannot solve this problem as they lack the mechanisms needed to constrain the generated sequences of visits. Moreover, existing approaches (1) frequently treat space and time as independent factors, an assumption that fails to hold true in real-world scenarios, and (2) suffer from challenges in accuracy of temporal prediction as they fail to deal with mixed distributions and the inter-relationships of different modes with latent variables (e.g., day-of-the-week). These limitations become even more pronounced when the task involves filling gaps within sequences instead of solely predicting the next visit. We introduce TrajGPT, a transformer-based, multi-task, joint spatiotemporal generative model to address these issues. Taking inspiration from large language models, TrajGPT poses the problem of controlled trajectory generation as that of text infilling in natural language. TrajGPT integrates the spatial and temporal models in a transformer architecture through a Bayesian probability model that ensures that the gaps in a visit sequence are filled in a spatiotemporally consistent manner. Our experiments on public and private datasets demonstrate that TrajGPT not only excels in controlled synthetic visit generation but also outperforms competing models in next-location prediction tasks - Relatively, TrajGPT achieves a 26-fold improvement in temporal accuracy while retaining more than 98% of spatial accuracy on average.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 3 figures, 32nd ACM SIGSPATIAL International Conference on Advances in Geographic Information Systems (ACM SIGSPATIAL 2024)</p></details> |

Data augmentation techniques, such as noise injection and data synthesizing, aim to improve Q-function approximation by smoothing the learned state-action region. However, these methods often fall short of directly improving the quality of offline datasets, leading to suboptimal results. In response, we introduce GTA, Generative Trajectory Augmentation, a novel generative data augmentation approach designed to enrich offline data by augmenting trajectories to be both high-rewarding and dynamically plausible. GTA applies a diffusion model within the data augmentation framework. GTA partially noises original trajectories and then denoises them with classifier-free guidance via conditioning on amplified return value. Our results show that GTA, as a general data augmentation strategy, enhances the performance of widely used offline RL algorithms across various tasks with unique challenges. Furthermore, we conduct a quality analysis of data augmented by GTA and demonstrate that GTA improves the quality of the data.

While prior research has typically focused on either prediction or generation, our approach unifies these tasks to provide a versatile framework and achieve state-of-the-art performance. While diffusion models excel in trajectory generation, their iterative sampling process is computationally intensive, hindering robotic systems' dynamic capabilities. We introduce Trajectory Conditional Flow Matching (T-CFM), a novel approach using flow matching techniques to learn a solver time-varying vector field for efficient, fast trajectory generation. T-CFM demonstrates effectiveness in adversarial tracking, real-world aircraft trajectory forecasting, and long-horizon planning, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines with 35% higher predictive accuracy and 142% improved planning performance. Crucially, T-CFM achieves up to 100$\times$ speed-up compared to diffusion models without sacrificing accuracy, enabling real-time decision making in robotics.

| **[Optimal Convex Cover as Collision-free Space Approximation for Trajectory Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09631v2)** | 2024-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose an online iterative algorithm to find an optimal convex cover to under-approximate the free space for autonomous navigation to delineate Safe Flight Corridors (SFC). The convex cover consists of a set of polytopes such that the union of the polytopes represents obstacle-free space, allowing us to find trajectories for robots that lie within the convex cover. In order to find the SFC that facilitates optimal trajectory generation, we iteratively find overlapping polytopes of maximum volumes that include specified waypoints initialized by a geometric or kinematic planner. Constraints at waypoints appear in two alternating stages of a joint optimization problem, which is solved by a method inspired by the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) with partially distributed variables. We validate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm using a range of parameterized environments and show its applications for two-stage motion planning.</p></details> |  |

However, extensive demonstrations are required for policy robustness and generalization. To reduce the demonstration reliance, we leverage spatial symmetry and propose ET-SEED, an efficient trajectory-level SE(3) equivariant diffusion model for generating action sequences in complex robot manipulation tasks. Further, previous equivariant diffusion models require the per-step equivariance in the Markov process, making it difficult to learn policy under such strong constraints. We theoretically extend equivariant Markov kernels and simplify the condition of equivariant diffusion process, thereby significantly improving training efficiency for trajectory-level SE(3) equivariant diffusion policy in an end-to-end manner. We evaluate ET-SEED on representative robotic manipulation tasks, involving rigid body, articulated and deformable object. Experiments demonstrate superior data efficiency and manipulation proficiency of our proposed method, as well as its ability to generalize to unseen configurations with only a few demonstrations.

| **[Efficient and Robust Freeway Traffic Speed Estimation under Oblique Grid using Vehicle Trajectory Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05842v1)** | 2024-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurately estimating spatiotemporal traffic states on freeways is a significant challenge due to limited sensor deployment and potential data corruption. In this study, we propose an efficient and robust low-rank model for precise spatiotemporal traffic speed state estimation (TSE) using lowpenetration vehicle trajectory data. Leveraging traffic wave priors, an oblique grid-based matrix is first designed to transform the inherent dependencies of spatiotemporal traffic states into the algebraic low-rankness of a matrix. Then, with the enhanced traffic state low-rankness in the oblique matrix, a low-rank matrix completion method is tailored to explicitly capture spatiotemporal traffic propagation characteristics and precisely reconstruct traffic states. In addition, an anomaly-tolerant module based on a sparse matrix is developed to accommodate corrupted data input and thereby improve the TSE model robustness. Notably, driven by the understanding of traffic waves, the computational complexity of the proposed efficient method is only correlated with the problem size itself, not with dataset size and hyperparameter selection prevalent in existing studies. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness, robustness, and efficiency of the proposed model. The performance of the proposed method achieves up to a 12% improvement in Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) in the TSE scenarios and an 18% improvement in RMSE in the robust TSE scenarios, and it runs more than 20 times faster than the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.</p></details> | accepted by T-ITS |

However, current robotic-assisted physiotherapy methods struggle including biomechanical metrics in their control algorithms, crucial for safe and effective therapy. This paper introduces BATON, a Biomechanics-Aware Trajectory Optimization approach to robotic Navigation of human musculoskeletal loads. The method integrates a high-fidelity musculoskeletal model of the human shoulder into real-time control of robot-patient interaction during rotator cuff tendon rehabilitation. We extract skeletal dynamics and tendon loading information from an OpenSim shoulder model to solve an optimal control problem, generating strain-minimizing trajectories. Trajectories were realized on a healthy subject by an impedance-controlled robot while estimating the state of the subject's shoulder. Target poses were prescribed to design personalized rehabilitation across a wide range of shoulder motion avoiding high-strain areas. BATON was designed with real-time capabilities, enabling continuous trajectory replanning to address unforeseen variations in tendon strain, such as those from changing muscle activation of the subject.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 9 figures, under review</p></details> |

However, existing methods are often tailored to specific tasks and regions, resulting in limitations related to task specificity, regional dependency, and data quality sensitivity. Addressing these challenges requires a universal human trajectory foundation model capable of generalizing and scaling across diverse tasks and geographic contexts. To this end, we propose UniTraj, a Universal human Trajectory foundation model that is task-adaptive, region-independent, and highly generalizable. To further enhance performance, we construct WorldTrace, the first large-scale, high-quality, globally distributed dataset sourced from open web platforms, encompassing 2.45 million trajectories with billions of points across 70 countries. Through multiple resampling and masking strategies designed for pre-training, UniTraj effectively overcomes geographic and task constraints, adapting to heterogeneous data quality. Extensive experiments across multiple trajectory analysis tasks and real-world datasets demonstrate that UniTraj consistently outperforms existing approaches in terms of scalability and adaptability. These results underscore the potential of UniTraj as a versatile, robust solution for a wide range of trajectory analysis applications, with WorldTrace serving as an ideal but non-exclusive foundation for training.</p></details> |  |
| **[How to Drawjectory? -- Trajectory Planning using Programming by Demonstration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03815v1)** | 2024-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A flight trajectory defines how exactly a quadrocopter moves in the three-dimensional space from one position to another. Automatic flight trajectory planning faces challenges such as high computational effort and a lack of precision. Hence, when low computational effort or precise control is required, programming the flight route trajectory manually might be preferable. However, this requires in-depth knowledge of how to accurately plan flight trajectories in three-dimensional space. We propose planning quadrocopter flight trajectories manually using the Programming by Demonstration (PbD) approach -- simply drawing the trajectory in the three-dimensional space by hand. This simplifies the planning process and reduces the level of in-depth knowledge required. We implemented the approach in the context of the Quadcopter Lab at Ulm University. In order to evaluate our approach, we compare the precision and accuracy of the trajectories drawn by a user using our approach as well as the required time with those manually programmed using a domain specific language. The evaluation shows that the Drawjectory workflow is, on average, 78.7 seconds faster without a significant loss of precision, shown by an average deviation 6.67 cm.</p></details> |  |
| **[Revisiting CNNs for Trajectory Similarity Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19761v2)** | 2024-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Similarity search is a fundamental but expensive operator in querying trajectory data, due to its quadratic complexity of distance computation. To mitigate the computational burden for long trajectories, neural networks have been widely employed for similarity learning and each trajectory is encoded as a high-dimensional vector for similarity search with linear complexity. Given the sequential nature of trajectory data, previous efforts have been primarily devoted to the utilization of RNNs or Transformers. In this paper, we argue that the common practice of treating trajectory as sequential data results in excessive attention to capturing long-term global dependency between two sequences. Instead, our investigation reveals the pivotal role of local similarity, prompting a revisit of simple CNNs for trajectory similarity learning. We introduce ConvTraj, incorporating both 1D and 2D convolutions to capture sequential and geo-distribution features of trajectories, respectively. In addition, we conduct a series of theoretical analyses to justify the effectiveness of ConvTraj. Experimental results on four real-world large-scale datasets demonstrate that ConvTraj achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in trajectory similarity search. Owing to the simple network structure of ConvTraj, the training and inference speed on the Porto dataset with 1.6 million trajectories are increased by at least $240$x and $2.16$x, respectively.

Asteroids are often discovered using optical telescopes and their trajectories are calculated from images, resulting in an inherent asymmetric uncertainty in their position and velocity. Consequently, we typically cannot determine the exact trajectory of an asteroid, and an ensemble of trajectories must be generated to estimate an asteroid's movement over time. When propagating these ensembles over decades, it is challenging to visualize the varying paths and determine their potential impact on Earth, which could cause catastrophic damage. NEOviz equips experts with the necessary tools to effectively analyze the existing catalog of asteroid observations. In particular, we present a novel approach for visualizing the 3D uncertainty region through which an asteroid travels, while providing accurate spatial context in relation to system-critical infrastructure such as Earth, the Moon, and artificial satellites. Furthermore, we use NEOviz to visualize the divergence of asteroid trajectories, capturing high-variance events in an asteroid's orbital properties. For potential impactors, we combine the 3D visualization with an uncertainty-aware impact map to illustrate the potential risks to human populations. NEOviz was developed with continuous input from members of the planetary defense community through a participatory design process. It is exemplified in three real-world use cases and evaluated via expert feedback interviews.</p></details> |  |

We employ state-of-the-art computer vision and deep learning to create an end-to-end pipeline that enhances vehicle detection, tracking, and trajectory stabilization. Conducted in the Songdo International Business District, South Korea, the study used a multi-drone experiment over 20 intersections, capturing approximately 12TB of 4K video data over four days. We developed a novel track stabilization method that uses detected vehicle bounding boxes as exclusion masks during image registration, which, combined with advanced georeferencing techniques, accurately transforms vehicle coordinates into real-world geographical data. Additionally, our framework includes robust vehicle dimension estimation and detailed road segmentation for in-depth traffic analysis. The framework produced two high-quality datasets: the Songdo Traffic dataset, comprising nearly 1 million unique vehicle trajectories, and the Songdo Vision dataset, containing over 5,000 human-annotated frames with about 300,000 vehicle instances in four classes. Comparisons between drone-derived data and high-precision sensor data from an instrumented probe vehicle highlight the accuracy and consistency of our framework's extraction in dense urban settings. By publicly releasing these datasets and the pipeline source code, this work sets new benchmarks for data quality, reproducibility, and scalability in traffic research. Results demonstrate the potential of integrating drone technology with advanced computer vision for precise, cost-effective urban traffic monitoring, providing valuable resources for the research community to develop intelligent transportation systems and improve traffic management strategies.</p></details> |  |

Current distillation techniques often dichotomize into two distinct aspects: i) ODE Trajectory Preservation; and ii) ODE Trajectory Reformulation. However, these approaches suffer from severe performance degradation or domain shifts. To address these limitations, we propose Hyper-SD, a novel framework that synergistically amalgamates the advantages of ODE Trajectory Preservation and Reformulation, while maintaining near-lossless performance during step compression. Firstly, we introduce Trajectory Segmented Consistency Distillation to progressively perform consistent distillation within pre-defined time-step segments, which facilitates the preservation of the original ODE trajectory from a higher-order perspective. Secondly, we incorporate human feedback learning to boost the performance of the model in a low-step regime and mitigate the performance loss incurred by the distillation process. Thirdly, we integrate score distillation to further improve the low-step generation capability of the model and offer the first attempt to leverage a unified LoRA to support the inference process at all steps. Extensive experiments and user studies demonstrate that Hyper-SD achieves SOTA performance from 1 to 8 inference steps for both SDXL and SD1.5. For example, Hyper-SDXL surpasses SDXL-Lightning by +0.68 in CLIP Score and +0.51 in Aes Score in the 1-step inference.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2024 (Camera-Ready Version).

Principal component analysis (PCA) is applied to trajectory data consisting of $n_s = 4,000,000$ datapoints, of the FPUT $\beta$ model with $N = 32$ coupled oscillators, revealing a critical relationship between $m^{\ast}$ and the model's nonlinear strength. For weak nonlinearities, $m^{\ast} \ll n$, where $n = 2N$. In contrast, for strong nonlinearities, $m^{\ast} \rightarrow n - 1$, consistently with the ergodic hypothesis. Furthermore, one of the potential limitations of PCA is addressed through an analysis with t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding ($t$-SNE). Accordingly, we found strong evidence suggesting that the datapoints lie near or on a curved low-dimensional manifold for weak nonlinearities.</p></details> | 20 pages, 18 figures |

The number of features is comparable to the sample size and errors may be heavy-tailed.

These estimators are provably consistent under suitable conditions. The results are illustrated through several examples, including Huber regression, pseudo-Huber regression, and their penalized variants with non-smooth regularizer. We provide explicit generalization error estimates for iterates generated from GD and SGD, or from proximal SGD in the presence of a non-smooth regularizer. The proposed risk estimates serve as effective proxies for the actual generalization error, allowing us to determine the optimal stopping iteration that minimizes the generalization error.

Despite intensive research on driver behavior prediction, existing approaches typically overlook the interactions between AVs and HDVs assuming that HDV trajectories are not affected by AV actions. To address this gap, we present a transformer-transfer learning-based interaction-aware trajectory predictor for safe motion planning of autonomous driving, focusing on a vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) interaction scenario consisting of an AV and an HDV. Specifically, we construct a transformer-based interaction-aware trajectory predictor using widely available datasets of HDV trajectory data and further transfer the learned predictor using a small set of AV-HDV interaction data. Then, to better incorporate the proposed trajectory predictor into the motion planning module of AVs, we introduce an uncertainty quantification method to characterize the errors of the predictor, which are integrated into the path-planning process. Our experimental results demonstrate the value of explicitly considering interactions and handling uncertainties.</p></details> |  |

Current graph-based routing pipelines, while effective, involve substantial costs in constructing, maintaining, and updating road network graphs to reflect real-time conditions. In this study, we propose a new trajectory-based routing paradigm that bypasses current workflows by directly utilizing raw trajectory data to compute efficient routes. Our method, named TrajRoute, uniquely "follows" historical trajectories from a source to a destination, constructing paths that reflect actual driver behavior and implicit preferences. To supplement areas with sparse trajectory data, the road network is also incorporated into TrajRoute's index, and tunable parameters are introduced to control the balance between road segments and trajectories, ensuring a unified and adaptable routing approach. We experimentally verify our approach by comparing it to an existing online routing service. Our results demonstrate that as the number of trajectories covering the road network increases, TrajRoute produces increasingly accurate travel time and route length estimates while gradually eliminating the need to downgrade to the road network. This highlights the potential of simpler, data-driven pipelines for routing, offering lower-maintenance alternatives to conventional systems.</p></details> |  |

To bolster the adoption of the continuous-time paradigm, we propose a so-called Gaussian Process Trajectory Representation (GPTR) framework for continuous-time motion estimation (CTME) tasks. Our approach stands out by employing a third-order random jerk model, featuring closed-form expressions for both rotational and translational state derivatives. This model provides smooth, continuous trajectory representations that are crucial for precise estimation of complex motion. To support the wider robotics and computer vision communities, we have made the source code for GPTR available as a light-weight header-only library. This format was chosen for its ease of integration, allowing developers to incorporate GPTR into existing systems without needing extensive code modifications. Moreover, we also provide a set of optimization examples with LiDAR, camera, IMU, UWB factors, and closed-form analytical Jacobians under the proposed GP framework. Our experiments demonstrate the efficacy and efficiency of GP-based trajectory representation in various motion estimation tasks, and the examples can serve as the prototype to help researchers quickly develop future applications such as batch optimization, calibration, sensor fusion, trajectory planning, etc., with continuous-time trajectory representation.

The key idea is to capture each task by an object-centric representation, specifically the SE(3) object pose trajectory relative to the target. This approach decouples embodiment actions from sensory inputs, facilitating learning from various demonstration types, including both action-based and action-less human hand demonstrations, as well as cross-embodiment generalization. Additionally, object pose trajectories inherently capture planning constraints from demonstrations without the need for manually crafted rules. To guide the robot in executing the task, the object trajectory is used to condition a diffusion policy. We show improvement compared to prior work on RLBench simulated tasks.

At the heart of RopeTP is a hierarchical attention mechanism that significantly improves context awareness, which is essential for accurately inferring the posture of occluded body parts. This is achieved by exploiting the relationships with visible anatomical structures, enhancing the accuracy of local pose estimations. The improved robustness of these local estimations allows for the reconstruction of precise and stable global trajectories. Additionally, RopeTP incorporates a diffusion trajectory model that predicts realistic human motion from local pose sequences. This model ensures that the generated trajectories are not only consistent with observed local actions but also unfold naturally over time, thereby improving the realism and stability of 3D human motion reconstruction.

| **[Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction with Missing Data: Datasets, Imputation, and Benchmarking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00174v1)** | 2024-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pedestrian trajectory prediction is crucial for several applications such as robotics and self-driving vehicles. Significant progress has been made in the past decade thanks to the availability of pedestrian trajectory datasets, which enable trajectory prediction methods to learn from pedestrians' past movements and predict future trajectories. However, these datasets and methods typically assume that the observed trajectory sequence is complete, ignoring real-world issues such as sensor failure, occlusion, and limited fields of view that can result in missing values in observed trajectories. To address this challenge, we present TrajImpute, a pedestrian trajectory prediction dataset that simulates missing coordinates in the observed trajectory, enhancing real-world applicability. TrajImpute maintains a uniform distribution of missing data within the observed trajectories. In this work, we comprehensively examine several imputation methods to reconstruct the missing coordinates and benchmark them for imputing pedestrian trajectories. Furthermore, we provide a thorough analysis of recent trajectory prediction methods and evaluate the performance of these models on the imputed trajectories. Our experimental evaluation of the imputation and trajectory prediction methods offers several valuable insights. Our dataset provides a foundational resource for future research on imputation-aware pedestrian trajectory prediction, potentially accelerating the deployment of these methods in real-world applications. Publicly accessible links to the datasets and code files are available at https://github.com/Pranav-chib/TrajImpute.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |
| **[Conformalized Prediction of Post-Fault Voltage Trajectories Using Pre-trained and Finetuned Attention-Driven Neural Operators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24162v1)** | 2024-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes a new data-driven methodology for predicting intervals of post-fault voltage trajectories in power systems. We begin by introducing the Quantile Attention-Fourier Deep Operator Network (QAF-DeepONet), designed to capture the complex dynamics of voltage trajectories and reliably estimate quantiles of the target trajectory without any distributional assumptions. The proposed operator regression model maps the observed portion of the voltage trajectory to its unobserved post-fault trajectory. Our methodology employs a pre-training and fine-tuning process to address the challenge of limited data availability. To ensure data privacy in learning the pre-trained model, we use merging via federated learning with data from neighboring buses, enabling the model to learn the underlying voltage dynamics from such buses without directly sharing their data. After pre-training, we fine-tune the model with data from the target bus, allowing it to adapt to unique dynamics and operating conditions. Finally, we integrate conformal prediction into the fine-tuned model to ensure coverage guarantees for the predicted intervals. We evaluated the performance of the proposed methodology using the New England 39-bus test system considering detailed models of voltage and frequency controllers. Two metrics, Prediction Interval Coverage Probability (PICP) and Prediction Interval Normalized Average Width (PINAW), are used to numerically assess the model's performance in predicting intervals. The results show that the proposed approach offers practical and reliable uncertainty quantification in predicting the interval of post-fault voltage trajectories.</p></details> |  |

Existing research mainly focuses on leveraging single-frame cooperative information to enhance the limited perception capability of the ego vehicle, while underutilizing the motion and interaction context of traffic participants observed from cooperative devices. In this paper, we propose a forecasting-oriented representation paradigm to utilize motion and interaction features from cooperative information. Specifically, we present V2X-Graph, a representative framework to achieve interpretable and end-to-end trajectory feature fusion for cooperative motion forecasting. V2X-Graph is evaluated on V2X-Seq in vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) scenarios. To further evaluate on vehicle-to-everything (V2X) scenario, we construct the first real-world V2X motion forecasting dataset V2X-Traj, which contains multiple autonomous vehicles and infrastructure in every scenario. Experimental results on both V2X-Seq and V2X-Traj show the advantage of our method. We hope both V2X-Graph and V2X-Traj will benefit the further development of cooperative motion forecasting.

| **[Continuous Dynamic Modeling via Neural ODEs for Popularity Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18742v2)** | 2024-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Popularity prediction for information cascades has significant applications across various domains, including opinion monitoring and advertising recommendations. While most existing methods consider this as a discrete problem, popularity actually evolves continuously, exhibiting rich dynamic properties such as change rates and growth patterns. In this paper, we argue that popularity trajectory prediction is more practical, as it aims to forecast the entire trajectory of how popularity unfolds over arbitrary future time. This approach offers insights into both instantaneous popularity and the underlying dynamic properties. However, traditional methods for popularity trajectory prediction primarily rely on specific diffusion mechanism assumptions, which may not align well with real-world dynamics and compromise their performance. To address these limitations, we propose NODEPT, a novel approach based on neural ordinary differential equations (ODEs) for popularity trajectory prediction. NODEPT models the continuous dynamics of the underlying diffusion system using neural ODEs. We first employ an encoder to initialize the latent state representations of information cascades, consisting of two representation learning modules that capture the co-evolution structural characteristics and temporal patterns of cascades from different perspectives. More importantly, we then introduce an ODE-based generative module that learns the dynamics of the diffusion system in the latent space. Finally, a decoder transforms the latent state into the prediction of the future popularity trajectory. Our experimental results on three real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority and rationality of the proposed NODEPT method.</p></details> | <details><summary>The t...</summary><p>The time complexity analysis in section 4.4 contains error; we overlooked the impact of the memory module</p></details> |

However, for most problems of interest, MPC relies on the recursive solution of highly non-convex trajectory optimization problems, leading to high computational complexity and strong dependency on initialization. In this work, we present a unified framework to combine the main strengths of optimization-based and learning-based methods for MPC. Our approach entails embedding high-capacity, transformer-based neural network models within the optimization process for trajectory generation, whereby the transformer provides a near-optimal initial guess, or target plan, to a non-convex optimization problem. Our experiments, performed in simulation and the real world onboard a free flyer platform, demonstrate the capabilities of our framework to improve MPC convergence and runtime. Compared to purely optimization-based approaches, results show that our approach can improve trajectory generation performance by up to 75%, reduce the number of solver iterations by up to 45%, and improve overall MPC runtime by 7x without loss in performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 7 figures.

We study generative modeling for planning with datasets repurposed from offline reinforcement learning. Specifically, we identify temporal consistency in the absence of step-wise rewards as one key technical challenge. We introduce the Latent Plan Transformer (LPT), a novel model that leverages a latent variable to connect a Transformer-based trajectory generator and the final return. LPT can be learned with maximum likelihood estimation on trajectory-return pairs. In learning, posterior sampling of the latent variable naturally integrates sub-trajectories to form a consistent abstraction despite the finite context. At test time, the latent variable is inferred from an expected return before policy execution, realizing the idea of planning as inference. Our experiments demonstrate that LPT can discover improved decisions from sub-optimal trajectories, achieving competitive performance across several benchmarks, including Gym-Mujoco, Franka Kitchen, Maze2D, and Connect Four. It exhibits capabilities in nuanced credit assignments, trajectory stitching, and adaptation to environmental contingencies. These results validate that latent variable inference can be a strong alternative to step-wise reward prompting.</p></details> |  |

Trajectory optimization is a powerful and widely used algorithm in control, parameterized by a cost and a dynamics function. The key to our approach is to leverage the recent progress in differentiable trajectory optimization, which enables computing the gradients of the loss with respect to the parameters of trajectory optimization. As a result, the cost and dynamics functions of trajectory optimization can be learned end-to-end. DiffTORI addresses the ``objective mismatch'' issue of prior model-based RL algorithms, as the dynamics model in DiffTORI is learned to directly maximize task performance by differentiating the policy gradient loss through the trajectory optimization process. We further benchmark DiffTORI for imitation learning on standard robotic manipulation task suites with high-dimensional sensory observations and compare our method to feed-forward policy classes as well as Energy-Based Models (EBM) and Diffusion. Across 15 model-based RL tasks and 35 imitation learning tasks with high-dimensional image and point cloud inputs, DiffTORI outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods in both domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2024 (Spotlight)</p></details> |
| **[Dual Agent Learning Based Aerial Trajectory Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23571v1)** | 2024-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a novel reinforcement learning framework for trajectory tracking of unmanned aerial vehicles in cluttered environments using a dual-agent architecture. Traditional optimization methods for trajectory tracking face significant computational challenges and lack robustness in dynamic environments. Our approach employs deep reinforcement learning (RL) to overcome these limitations, leveraging 3D pointcloud data to perceive the environment without relying on memory-intensive obstacle representations like occupancy grids. The proposed system features two RL agents: one for predicting UAV velocities to follow a reference trajectory and another for managing collision avoidance in the presence of obstacles. This architecture ensures real-time performance and adaptability to uncertainties. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach through simulated and real-world experiments, highlighting improvements over state-of-the-art RL and optimization-based methods. Additionally, a curriculum learning paradigm is employed to scale the algorithms to more complex environments, ensuring robust trajectory tracking and obstacle avoidance in both static and dynamic scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[DisCo: Distributed Contact-Rich Trajectory Optimization for Forceful Multi-Robot Collaboration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23283v1)** | 2024-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present DisCo, a distributed algorithm for contact-rich, multi-robot tasks. DisCo is a distributed contact-implicit trajectory optimization algorithm, which allows a group of robots to optimize a time sequence of forces to objects and to their environment to accomplish tasks such as collaborative manipulation, robot team sports, and modular robot locomotion. We build our algorithm on a variant of the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM), where each robot computes its own contact forces and contact-switching events from a smaller single-robot, contact-implicit trajectory optimization problem, while cooperating with other robots through dual variables, enforcing constraints between robots. Each robot iterates between solving its local problem, and communicating over a wireless mesh network to enforce these consistency constraints with its neighbors, ultimately converging to a coordinated plan for the group. The local problems solved by each robot are significantly less challenging than a centralized problem with all robots' contact forces and switching events, improving the computational efficiency, while also preserving the privacy of some aspects of each robot's operation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm in simulations of collaborative manipulation, multi-robot team sports scenarios, and in modular robot locomotion, where DisCo achieves $3$x higher success rates with a 2.5x to 5x faster computation time. Further, we provide results of hardware experiments on a modular truss robot, with three collaborating truss nodes planning individually while working together to produce a punctuated rolling-gate motion of the composite structure.

| **[Long-Term Human Trajectory Prediction using 3D Dynamic Scene Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00552v4)** | 2024-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a novel approach for long-term human trajectory prediction in indoor human-centric environments, which is essential for long-horizon robot planning in these environments. State-of-the-art human trajectory prediction methods are limited by their focus on collision avoidance and short-term planning, and their inability to model complex interactions of humans with the environment. In contrast, our approach overcomes these limitations by predicting sequences of human interactions with the environment and using this information to guide trajectory predictions over a horizon of up to 60s. We leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to predict interactions with the environment by conditioning the LLM prediction on rich contextual information about the scene. This information is given as a 3D Dynamic Scene Graph that encodes the geometry, semantics, and traversability of the environment into a hierarchical representation. We then ground these interaction sequences into multi-modal spatio-temporal distributions over human positions using a probabilistic approach based on continuous-time Markov Chains. To evaluate our approach, we introduce a new semi-synthetic dataset of long-term human trajectories in complex indoor environments, which also includes annotations of human-object interactions. We show in thorough experimental evaluations that our approach achieves a 54% lower average negative log-likelihood and a 26.5% lower Best-of-20 displacement error compared to the best non-privileged (i.e., evaluated in a zero-shot fashion on the dataset) baselines for a time horizon of 60s.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures.

Detection methods in generative language models (GLMs) mainly focus on uncertainty estimation and embedding distance measurement, with the latter proven to be most effective in traditional linguistic tasks like summarization and translation. However, another complex generative scenario mathematical reasoning poses significant challenges to embedding-based methods due to its high-density feature of output spaces, but this feature causes larger discrepancies in the embedding shift trajectory between different samples in latent spaces. Hence, we propose a trajectory-based method TV score, which uses trajectory volatility for OOD detection in mathematical reasoning. Experiments show that our method outperforms all traditional algorithms on GLMs under mathematical reasoning scenarios and can be extended to more applications with high-density features in output spaces, such as multiple-choice questions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |

In this letter, we extend the recently proposed Hybrid iLQR method [1] to handle state and input constraints within an indirect optimization framework, aiming to preserve computational efficiency and ensure dynamic feasibility. Specifically, we incorporate two constraint handling mechanisms into the Hybrid iLQR: Discrete Barrier State and Augmented Lagrangian methods. Comprehensive simulations across various operational situations are conducted to evaluate and compare the performance of these extended methods in terms of convergence and their ability to handle infeasible starting trajectories. Results indicate that while the Discrete Barrier State approach is more computationally efficient, the Augmented Lagrangian method outperforms it in complex and real-world scenarios with infeasible initial trajectories.</p></details> | 6 pages 4 figures |

By combining sampling-based Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) control with gradient-based Interior-Point Differential Dynamic Programming (IPDDP), we leverage their respective strengths in exploration and smoothing. The proposed method, MPPI-IPDDP, involves three steps: First, MPPI control is used to generate a coarse trajectory. Second, a collision-free convex corridor is constructed. Third, IPDDP is applied to smooth the coarse trajectory, utilizing the collision-free corridor from the second step. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we apply the proposed algorithm to trajectory optimization for differential-drive wheeled mobile robots and point-mass quadrotors. In comparisons with other MPPI variants and continuous optimization-based solvers, our method shows superior performance in terms of computational robustness and trajectory smoothness.

| **[Choice between Partial Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22690v1)** | 2024-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As AI agents generate increasingly sophisticated behaviors, manually encoding human preferences to guide these agents becomes more challenging. To address this, it has been suggested that agents instead learn preferences from human choice data. This approach requires a model of choice behavior that the agent can use to interpret the data. For choices between partial trajectories of states and actions, previous models assume choice probabilities to be determined by the partial return or the cumulative advantage. We consider an alternative model based instead on the bootstrapped return, which adds to the partial return an estimate of the future return. Benefits of the bootstrapped return model stem from its treatment of human beliefs. Unlike partial return, choices based on bootstrapped return reflect human beliefs about the environment. Further, while recovering the reward function from choices based on cumulative advantage requires that those beliefs are correct, doing so from choices based on bootstrapped return does not. To motivate the bootstrapped return model, we formulate axioms and prove an Alignment Theorem. This result formalizes how, for a general class of human preferences, such models are able to disentangle goals from beliefs. This ensures recovery of an aligned reward function when learning from choices based on bootstrapped return. The bootstrapped return model also affords greater robustness to choice behavior. Even when choices are based on partial return, learning via a bootstrapped return model recovers an aligned reward function. The same holds with choices based on the cumulative advantage if the human and the agent both adhere to correct and consistent beliefs about the environment. On the other hand, if choices are based on bootstrapped return, learning via partial return or cumulative advantage models does not generally produce an aligned reward function.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Overtaking Trajectory Planning Framework Based on Spatio-temporal Topology and Reachable Set Analysis Ensuring Time Efficiency](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22643v1)** | 2024-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating overtaking trajectories in high-speed scenarios presents significant challenges and is typically addressed through hierarchical planning methods. However, this method has two primary drawbacks. First, heuristic algorithms can only provide a single initial solution, which may lead to local optima and consequently diminish the quality of the solution. Second, the time efficiency of trajectory refinement based on numerical optimization is insufficient. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes an overtaking trajectory planning framework based on spatio-temporal topology and reachable set analysis (SROP), to improve trajectory quality and time efficiency. Specifically, this paper introduces topological classes to describe trajectories representing different overtaking behaviors, which support the spatio-temporal topological search method employed by the upper-layer planner to identify diverse initial paths. This approach helps prevent getting stuck in local optima, enhancing the overall solution quality by considering multiple initial solutions from distinct topologies. Moreover, the reachable set method is integrated into the lower-layer planner for parallel trajectory evaluation. This method enhances planning efficiency by decoupling vehicle model constraints from the optimization process, enabling parallel computation while ensuring control feasibility. Simulation results show that the proposed method improves the smoothness of generated trajectories by 66.8% compared to state-of-the-art methods, highlighting its effectiveness in enhancing trajectory quality. Additionally, this method reduces computation time by 62.9%, demonstrating its efficiency.</p></details> |  |

The parameters of LCGA-MSMs can be consistently estimated using different estimators, such as inverse probability weighting (IPW), g-computation, and pooled longitudinal targeted maximum likelihood estimation (pooled LTMLE). These three estimators of the parameters of LCGA-MSMs are currently implemented in our package. In the context of a time-dependent outcome, we previously proposed a combination of LCGA and history-restricted MSMs (LCGA-HRMSMs).

However, they face challenges due to their high-dimensional and unstable dynamics, as well as the complex contact-rich nature of the tasks. Model-based optimal control methods offer precise and systematic control but are limited by high computational complexity and accurate contact sensing. On the other hand, reinforcement learning (RL) provides robustness and handles high-dimensional spaces but suffers from inefficient learning, unnatural motion, and sim-to-real gaps. To address these challenges, we introduce Opt2Skill, an end-to-end pipeline that combines model-based trajectory optimization with RL to achieve robust whole-body loco-manipulation. We generate reference motions for the Digit humanoid robot using differential dynamic programming (DDP) and train RL policies to track these trajectories. Our results demonstrate that Opt2Skill outperforms pure RL methods in both training efficiency and task performance, with optimal trajectories that account for torque limits enhancing trajectory tracking. We successfully transfer our approach to real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we provide a method for the learning of the recovery trajectory of an individual patient, as they undertake exercises as part of their physical therapy towards recovery of their loss of movement ability, following a critical illness. The difference between the Movement Recovery Scores (MRSs) attained by a patient, when undertaking a given exercise routine on successive instances, is given by a statistical distance/divergence between the (posterior) probabilities of random graphs that are Bayesianly learnt using time series data on locations of 20 of the patient's joints, recorded on an e-platform as the patient exercises. This allows for the computation of the MRS on every occasion the patient undertakes this exercise, using which, the recovery trajectory is drawn. We learn each graph as a Random Geometric Graph drawn in a probabilistic metric space, and identify the closed-form marginal posterior of any edge of the graph, given the correlation structure of the multivariate time series data on joint locations. On the basis of our recovery learning, we offer recommendations on the optimal exercise routines for patients with given level of mobility impairment.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we develop a strategy to locally adapt the step size parameter of HMC at every iteration by evaluating a low-rank approximation of the local Hessian and estimating its largest eigenvalue. We combine it with a strategy to similarly adapt the trajectory length by monitoring the no U-turn condition, resulting in an adaptive sampler, ATLAS: adapting trajectory length and step-size. We further use a delayed rejection framework for making multiple proposals that improves the computational efficiency of ATLAS, and develop an approach for automatically tuning its hyperparameters during warmup. We compare ATLAS with state-of-the-art samplers like NUTS on a suite of synthetic and real world examples, and show that i) unlike NUTS, ATLAS is able to accurately sample difficult distributions with complex geometries, ii) it is computationally competitive to NUTS for simpler distributions, and iii) it is more robust to the tuning of hyperparamters.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code available at https://github.com/modichirag/AtlasSampler</p></details> |

These individuals often face earlier onset and higher prevalence of MLTCs, yet specific co-occurrence patterns remain unexplored. This study applies an unsupervised approach to characterise MLTC clusters based on shared disease trajectories using electronic health records (EHRs) from 13069 individuals with ID in Wales (2000-2021). The population consisted of 52.3% males and 47.7% females, with an average of 4.5 conditions per patient. Disease associations and temporal directionality were assessed, followed by spectral clustering to group shared trajectories. Males under 45 formed a single cluster dominated by neurological conditions (32.4%), while males above 45 had three clusters, the largest featuring circulatory conditions (51.8%). Females under 45 formed one cluster with digestive conditions (24.6%) as most prevalent, while those aged 45 and older showed two clusters: one dominated by circulatory conditions (34.1%), and the other by digestive (25.9%) and musculoskeletal (21.9%) issues. Mental illness, epilepsy, and reflux were common across groups. Individuals above 45 had higher rates of circulatory and musculoskeletal issues. These clusters offer insights into disease progression in individuals with ID, informing targeted interventions and personalised healthcare strategies.</p></details> |  |

Neural stochastic differential equations (Neural SDEs) are an attractive modeling technique for this problem, which parameterize the drift and diffusion terms of an SDE with neural networks. However, current algorithms for training Neural SDEs require backpropagation through the SDE dynamics, greatly limiting their scalability and stability. To address this, we propose Trajectory Flow Matching (TFM), which trains a Neural SDE in a simulation-free manner, bypassing backpropagation through the dynamics. TFM leverages the flow matching technique from generative modeling to model time series. In this work we first establish necessary conditions for TFM to learn time series data. Next, we present a reparameterization trick which improves training stability. Finally, we adapt TFM to the clinical time series setting, demonstrating improved performance on three clinical time series datasets both in terms of absolute performance and uncertainty prediction.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2024 Spotlight</p></details> |

However, ensuring safety throughout both the learning process and policy deployment remains a key challenge due to the risky exploration inherent in DRL, as well as the discrete nature of actions taken at intervals. These discontinuities, despite being part of a continuous action space, can lead to abrupt changes between successive actions, causing instability and unsafe intermediate states. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an integrated framework that combines DRL with a jerk-bounded trajectory generator (JBTG) and a robust low-level control strategy, significantly enhancing the safety, stability, and reliability of robotic manipulators. The low-level controller ensures the precise execution of DRL-generated commands, while the JBTG refines these motions to produce smooth, continuous trajectories that prevent abrupt or unsafe actions. The framework also includes pre-calculated safe velocity zones for smooth braking, preventing joint limit violations and ensuring compliance with kinematic constraints. This approach not only guarantees the robustness and safety of the robotic system but also optimizes motion control, making it suitable for practical applications. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is demonstrated through its application to a highly complex heavy-duty manipulator.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been submitted to the IEEE for potential publication</p></details> |

Modeling the interactions among agents is the key to understanding and predicting the dynamics of the complex system, e.g., predicting the trajectories of traffic participants in the city. Compared with interaction modeling in homogeneous systems such as pedestrians in a crowded scene, heterogeneous interaction modeling is less explored. Worse still, the error accumulation problem becomes more severe since the interactions are more complex. To tackle the two problems, this paper proposes heterogeneous interaction modeling with reduced accumulated error for multi-agent trajectory prediction. Based on the historical trajectories, our method infers the dynamic interaction graphs among agents, featured by directed interacting relations and interacting effects. A heterogeneous attention mechanism is defined on the interaction graphs for aggregating the influence from heterogeneous neighbors to the target agent. To alleviate the error accumulation problem, this paper analyzes the error sources from the spatial and temporal perspectives, and proposes to introduce the graph entropy and the mixup training strategy for reducing the two types of errors respectively. Our method is examined on three real-world datasets containing heterogeneous agents, and the experimental results validate the superiority of our method.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, accepted by IEEE TNNLS</p></details> |

However, due to the heterogeneity of data and the diversity of trajectory tasks, achieving unified trajectory modelling remains an important yet challenging task. In this paper, we propose TrajAgent, a large language model-based agentic framework, to unify various trajectory modelling tasks. In TrajAgent, we first develop UniEnv, an execution environment with a unified data and model interface, to support the execution and training of various models. Building on UniEnv, we introduce TAgent, an agentic workflow designed for automatic trajectory modelling across various trajectory tasks. Specifically, we design AutOpt, a systematic optimization module within TAgent, to further improve the performance of the integrated model. With diverse trajectory tasks input in natural language, TrajAgent automatically generates competitive results via training and executing appropriate models. Extensive experiments on four tasks using four real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of TrajAgent in unified trajectory modelling, achieving an average performance improvement of 15.43% over baseline methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages; the code will be openly accessible at: https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/TrajAgent</p></details> |
| **[Is Mamba Compatible with Trajectory Optimization in Offline Reinforcement Learning?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12094v2)** | 2024-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformer-based trajectory optimization methods have demonstrated exceptional performance in offline Reinforcement Learning (offline RL). Yet, it poses challenges due to substantial parameter size and limited scalability, which is particularly critical in sequential decision-making scenarios where resources are constrained such as in robots and drones with limited computational power. Mamba, a promising new linear-time sequence model, offers performance on par with transformers while delivering substantially fewer parameters on long sequences. As it remains unclear whether Mamba is compatible with trajectory optimization, this work aims to conduct comprehensive experiments to explore the potential of Decision Mamba (dubbed DeMa) in offline RL from the aspect of data structures and essential components with the following insights: (1) Long sequences impose a significant computational burden without contributing to performance improvements since DeMa's focus on sequences diminishes approximately exponentially. Consequently, we introduce a Transformer-like DeMa as opposed to an RNN-like DeMa. (2) For the components of DeMa, we identify the hidden attention mechanism as a critical factor in its success, which can also work well with other residual structures and does not require position embedding. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our specially designed DeMa is compatible with trajectory optimization and surpasses previous methods, outperforming Decision Transformer (DT) with higher performance while using 30\% fewer parameters in Atari, and exceeding DT with only a quarter of the parameters in MuJoCo.</p></details> | 23 pages, 11 figures |
| **[DAWN-ICL: Strategic Planning of Problem-solving Trajectories for Zero-Shot In-Context Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20215v1)** | 2024-10-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Zero-shot in-context learning (ZS-ICL) aims to conduct in-context learning (ICL) without using human-annotated demonstrations. Most ZS-ICL methods use large language models (LLMs) to generate (input, label) pairs as pseudo-demonstrations and leverage historical pseudo-demonstrations to help solve the current problem. They assume that problems are from the same task and traverse them in a random order. However, in real-world scenarios, problems usually come from diverse tasks, and only a few belong to the same task. The random traversing order may generate unreliable pseudo-demonstrations and lead to error accumulation. To address this problem, we reformulate ZS-ICL as a planning problem and propose a Demonstration-aware Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) approach (DAWN-ICL), which leverages MCTS to strategically plan the problem-solving trajectories for ZS-ICL. In addition, to achieve effective and efficient Q value estimation, we propose a novel demonstration-aware Q-value function and use it to enhance the selection phase and accelerate the expansion and simulation phases in MCTS. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of DAWN-ICL on in-domain and cross-domain scenarios, and it even outperforms ICL using human-annotated labels.

| **[PMM-Net: Single-stage Multi-agent Trajectory Prediction with Patching-based Embedding and Explicit Modal Modulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19544v1)** | 2024-10-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Analyzing and forecasting trajectories of agents like pedestrians plays a pivotal role for embodied intelligent applications. The inherent indeterminacy of human behavior and complex social interaction among a rich variety of agents make this task more challenging than common time-series forecasting. In this letter, we aim to explore a distinct formulation for multi-agent trajectory prediction framework. Specifically, we proposed a patching-based temporal feature extraction module and a graph-based social feature extraction module, enabling effective feature extraction and cross-scenario generalization. Moreover, we reassess the role of social interaction and present a novel method based on explicit modality modulation to integrate temporal and social features, thereby constructing an efficient single-stage inference pipeline. Results on public benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our model compared with the state-of-the-art methods.

| **[Context-Aware Trajectory Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19136v1)** | 2024-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory anomaly detection is crucial for effective decision-making in urban and human mobility management. Existing methods of trajectory anomaly detection generally focus on training a trajectory generative model and evaluating the likelihood of reconstructing a given trajectory. However, previous work often lacks important contextual information on the trajectory, such as the agent's information (e.g., agent ID) or geographic information (e.g., Points of Interest (POI)), which could provide additional information on accurately capturing anomalous behaviors. To fill this gap, we propose a context-aware anomaly detection approach that models contextual information related to trajectories. The proposed method is based on a trajectory reconstruction framework guided by contextual factors such as agent ID and contextual POI embedding. The injection of contextual information aims to improve the performance of anomaly detection. We conducted experiments in two cities and demonstrated that the proposed approach significantly outperformed existing methods by effectively modeling contextual information. Overall, this paper paves a new direction for advancing trajectory anomaly detection.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Historical Trajectory Assisted Optimization Method for Zeroth-Order Federated Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15955v5)** | 2024-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated learning heavily relies on distributed gradient descent techniques. In the situation where gradient information is not available, the gradients need to be estimated from zeroth-order information, which typically involves computing finite-differences along isotropic random directions. This method suffers from high estimation errors, as the geometric features of the objective landscape may be overlooked during the isotropic sampling. In this work, we propose a non-isotropic sampling method to improve the gradient estimation procedure. Gradients in our method are estimated in a subspace spanned by historical trajectories of solutions, aiming to encourage the exploration of promising regions and hence improve the convergence. The proposed method uses a covariance matrix for sampling which is a convex combination of two parts. The first part is a thin projection matrix containing the basis of the subspace which is designed to improve the exploitation ability. The second part is the historical trajectories. We implement this method in zeroth-order federated settings, and show that the convergence rate aligns with existing ones while introducing no significant overheads in communication or local computation. The effectiveness of our proposal is verified on several numerical experiments in comparison to several commonly-used zeroth-order federated optimization algorithms.</p></details> |  |
| **[VECTOR: Velocity-Enhanced GRU Neural Network for Real-Time 3D UAV Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23305v1)** | 2024-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper tackles the challenge of real-time 3D trajectory prediction for UAVs, which is critical for applications such as aerial surveillance and defense. Existing prediction models that rely primarily on position data struggle with accuracy, especially when UAV movements fall outside the position domain used in training. Our research identifies a gap in utilizing velocity estimates, first-order dynamics, to better capture the dynamics and enhance prediction accuracy and generalizability in any position domain. To bridge this gap, we propose a new trajectory prediction method using Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) within sequence-based neural networks. Unlike traditional methods that rely on RNNs or transformers, this approach forecasts future velocities and positions based on historical velocity data instead of positions. This is designed to enhance prediction accuracy and scalability, overcoming challenges faced by conventional models in handling complex UAV dynamics. The methodology employs both synthetic and real-world 3D UAV trajectory data, capturing a wide range of flight patterns, speeds, and agility. Synthetic data is generated using the Gazebo simulator and PX4 Autopilot, while real-world data comes from the UZH-FPV and Mid-Air drone racing datasets. The GRU-based models significantly outperform state-of-the-art RNN approaches, with a mean square error (MSE) as low as 2 x 10^-8. Overall, our findings confirm the effectiveness of incorporating velocity data in improving the accuracy of UAV trajectory predictions across both synthetic and real-world scenarios, in and out of position data distributions. Finally, we open-source our 5000 trajectories dataset and a ROS 2 package to facilitate the integration with existing ROS-based UAV systems.</p></details> |  |

Advances in machine learning have made traditional image and text-based CAPTCHAs vulnerable to attacks, leading modern CAPTCHAs, such as GeeTest and Akamai, to incorporate behavioral analysis like mouse trajectory detection. Existing bypass techniques struggle to fully mimic human behavior, making it difficult to evaluate the effectiveness of anti-bot measures. To address this, we propose a diffusion model-based mouse trajectory generation framework (DMTG), which controls trajectory complexity and produces realistic human-like mouse movements. DMTG also provides white-box and black-box testing methods to assess its ability to bypass CAPTCHA systems. In experiments, DMTG reduces bot detection accuracy by 4.75%-9.73% compared to other models. Additionally, it mimics physical human behaviors, such as slow initiation and directional force differences, demonstrating improved performance in both simulation and real-world CAPTCHA scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory Optimization for Spatial Microstructure Control in Electron Beam Metal Additive Manufacturing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18207v1)** | 2024-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Metal additive manufacturing (AM) opens the possibility for spatial control of as-fabricated microstructure and properties. However, since the solid state diffusional transformations that drive microstructure outcomes are governed by nonlinear ODEs in terms of temperature, which is itself governed by PDEs over the entire part domain, solving for the system inputs needed to achieve desired microstructure distributions has proven difficult. In this work, we present a trajectory optimization approach for spatial control of microstructure in metal AM, which we demonstrate by controlling the hardness of a low-alloy steel in electron beam powder bed fusion (EB-PBF). To this end, we present models for thermal and microstructural dynamics. Next, we use experimental data to identify the parameters of the microstructure transformation dynamics. We then pose spatial microstructure control as a finite-horizon optimal control problem. The optimal power field trajectory is computed using an augmented Lagrangian differential dynamic programming (AL-DDP) method with GPU acceleration. The resulting time-varying power fields are then realized on an EB-PBF machine through an approximation scheme. Measurements of the resultant hardness shows that the optimized power field trajectory is able to closely produce the desired hardness distribution.</p></details> | 6 pages, 6 figures |

Traditional methods rely on the use of LSTM, GRU networks, and even Transformer architectures for the prediction of spatio-temporal series. This study proposes a viable alternative for predicting these trajectories using only GNSS positions. It considers this spatio-temporal problem as a natural language processing problem. The latitude/longitude coordinates of AIS messages are transformed into cell identifiers using the H3 index. Thanks to the pseudo-octal representation, it becomes easier for language models to learn the spatial hierarchy of the H3 index. The method is compared with a classical Kalman filter, widely used in the maritime domain, and introduces the Fr\'echet distance as the main evaluation metric. We show that it is possible to predict ship trajectories quite precisely up to 8 hours ahead with 30 minutes of context, using solely GNSS positions, without relying on any additional information such as speed, course, or external conditions - unlike many traditional methods. We demonstrate that this alternative works well enough to predict trajectories worldwide.</p></details> | 28 pages, 18 figures |

This paper focuses on the integrated design of UAV trajectories and the precoders at both the transmitter and UAV in a UAV-assisted relay communication system, accounting for transmit power constraints and UAV flight limitations. Unlike previous works that primarily address multiple-input single-output (MISO) systems with Gaussian inputs, we investigate a more realistic scenario involving multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems with finite-alphabet inputs. To tackle the challenging and inherently non-convex problem, we propose an efficient solution algorithm that leverages successive convex approximation and alternating optimization techniques. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, demonstrating its capability to optimize system performance.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing approaches have overlooked the potential of these environments, focusing instead on static contexts without considering userspecific factors. Employing the CREATTIVE3D dataset, our work models trajectories recorded in virtual reality (VR) scenes for diverse situations including road-crossing tasks with user interactions and simulated visual impairments. We propose Diverse Context VR Human Motion Prediction (DiVR), a cross-modal transformer based on the Perceiver architecture that integrates both static and dynamic scene context using a heterogeneous graph convolution network. We conduct extensive experiments comparing DiVR against existing architectures including MLP, LSTM, and transformers with gaze and point cloud context. Additionally, we also stress test our model's generalizability across different users, tasks, and scenes. Results show that DiVR achieves higher accuracy and adaptability compared to other models and to static graphs. This work highlights the advantages of using VR datasets for context-aware human trajectory modeling, with potential applications in enhancing user experiences in the metaverse.

The proposed method takes point cloud as input and efficiently constructs a multi-level map using triangular patches as the basic elements. A kinematic path search is adopted on the patches, where motion primitives on different patches combine to form the global min-time cost initial trajectory. We use a same-level expansion method to locate the nearest obstacle for each trajectory waypoint and construct an objective function with curvature, smoothness and obstacle terms for optimization. We evaluate the method on several complex 3D point cloud maps. Compared to existing methods, our method demonstrates higher robustness to point cloud noise, enabling the generation of high quality trajectory while maintaining high computational efficiency. Our code will be publicly available at https://github.com/ck-tian/MLMC-planner.</p></details> |  |
| **[In-Trajectory Inverse Reinforcement Learning: Learn Incrementally Before An Ongoing Trajectory Terminates](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15612v2)** | 2024-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) aims to learn a reward function and a corresponding policy that best fit the demonstrated trajectories of an expert. However, current IRL works cannot learn incrementally from an ongoing trajectory because they have to wait to collect at least one complete trajectory to learn. To bridge the gap, this paper considers the problem of learning a reward function and a corresponding policy while observing the initial state-action pair of an ongoing trajectory and keeping updating the learned reward and policy when new state-action pairs of the ongoing trajectory are observed. We formulate this problem as an online bi-level optimization problem where the upper level dynamically adjusts the learned reward according to the newly observed state-action pairs with the help of a meta-regularization term, and the lower level learns the corresponding policy. We propose a novel algorithm to solve this problem and guarantee that the algorithm achieves sub-linear local regret $O(\sqrt{T}+\log T+\sqrt{T}\log T)$. If the reward function is linear, we prove that the proposed algorithm achieves sub-linear regret $O(\log T)$. Experiments are used to validate the proposed algorithm.</p></details> |  |
| **[UniTE: A Survey and Unified Pipeline for Pre-training Spatiotemporal Trajectory Embeddings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12550v2)** | 2024-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatiotemporal trajectories are sequences of timestamped locations, which enable a variety of analyses that in turn enable important real-world applications. It is common to map trajectories to vectors, called embeddings, before subsequent analyses. Thus, the qualities of embeddings are very important. Methods for pre-training embeddings, which leverage unlabeled trajectories for training universal embeddings, have shown promising applicability across different tasks, thus attracting considerable interest. However, research progress on this topic faces two key challenges: a lack of a comprehensive overview of existing methods, resulting in several related methods not being well-recognized, and the absence of a unified pipeline, complicating the development of new methods and the analysis of methods. We present UniTE, a survey and a unified pipeline for this domain. In doing so, we present a comprehensive list of existing methods for pre-training trajectory embeddings, which includes methods that either explicitly or implicitly employ pre-training techniques. Further, we present a unified and modular pipeline with publicly available underlying code, simplifying the process of constructing and evaluating methods for pre-training trajectory embeddings. Additionally, we contribute a selection of experimental results using the proposed pipeline on real-world datasets. Implementation of the pipeline is publicly available at https://github.com/Logan-Lin/UniTE.</p></details> |  |

However, existing solutions are often tailored to specific traffic networks at particular time periods. Consequently, deep learning models trained on one network may struggle to generalize effectively to unseen networks. To address this, we proposed a novel spatial-temporal trajectory prediction framework that performs cross-domain adaption on the attention representation of a Transformer-based model. A graph convolutional network is also integrated to construct dynamic graph feature embeddings that accurately model the complex spatial-temporal interactions between the multi-agent vehicles across multiple traffic domains. The proposed framework is validated on two case studies involving the cross-city and cross-period settings. Experimental results show that our proposed framework achieves superior trajectory prediction and domain adaptation performances over the state-of-the-art models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics 2024</p></details> |

Diffusion is an iterative algorithm in which samples are generated step-by-step, starting from pure noise. This process introduces the notion of diffusion trajectories, i.e., paths from the standard Gaussian distribution to the target image distribution. In this context, we study discriminative algorithms operating on these trajectories. Specifically, given a pre-trained diffusion model, we consider the problem of classifying images as part of the training dataset, generated by the model or originating from an external source. Our approach demonstrates the presence of patterns across steps that can be leveraged for classification. We also conduct ablation studies, which reveal that using higher-order gradient features to characterize the trajectories leads to significant performance gains and more robust algorithms.</p></details> |  |

The original paper introduces a novel approach in explainable reinforcement learning based on the attribution decisions of an agent to specific clusters of trajectories encountered during training. We verify the main claims from the paper, which state that (i) training on less trajectories induces a lower initial state value, (ii) trajectories in a cluster present similar high-level patterns, (iii) distant trajectories influence the decision of an agent, and (iv) humans correctly identify the attributed trajectories to the decision of the agent. We recover the environments used by the authors based on the partial original code they provided for one of the environments (Grid-World), and implemented the remaining from scratch (Seaquest, HalfCheetah, Breakout and Q*Bert). While we confirm that (i), (ii), and (iii) partially hold, we extend on the largely qualitative experiments from the authors by introducing a quantitative metric to further support (iii), and new experiments and visual results for (i). Moreover, we investigate the use of different clustering algorithms and encoder architectures to further support (ii). We could not support (iv), given the limited extent of the original experiments. We conclude that, while some of the claims can be supported, further investigations and experiments could be of interest. We recognise the novelty of the work from the authors and hope that our work paves the way for clearer and more transparent approaches.</p></details> |  |

Theoretical approximation guarantees on uniform grids are presented for optimal controls with certain regularity properties, along with guarantees of localization of change points by wavelet transform. Numerical illustrations are provided for control profiles involving discontinuities to show the effectiveness of the localization and refinement strategy.

This interest necessitates accurate initial orbit determination (IOD) and orbit prediction (OP) in this domain, which faces significant challenges such as severe nonlinearity, sensitivity to initial conditions, large state-space volume, and sparse, faint, and unreliable measurements. This paper explores the capability of data-driven Koopman operator-based approximations for OP in these scenarios. Three stable periodic trajectories from distinct cislunar families are analyzed. The analysis includes theoretical justification for using a linear time-invariant system as the data-driven surrogate. This theoretical framework is supported by experimental validation.

| **[Online Omnidirectional Jumping Trajectory Planning for Quadrupedal Robots on Uneven Terrains](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04494v2)** | 2024-11-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Natural terrain complexity often necessitates agile movements like jumping in animals to improve traversal efficiency. To enable similar capabilities in quadruped robots, complex real-time jumping maneuvers are required. Current research does not adequately address the problem of online omnidirectional jumping and neglects the robot's kinodynamic constraints during trajectory generation. This paper proposes a general and complete cascade online optimization framework for omnidirectional jumping for quadruped robots. Our solution systematically encompasses jumping trajectory generation, a trajectory tracking controller, and a landing controller. It also incorporates environmental perception to navigate obstacles that standard locomotion cannot bypass, such as jumping from high platforms. We introduce a novel jumping plane to parameterize omnidirectional jumping motion and formulate a tightly coupled optimization problem accounting for the kinodynamic constraints, simultaneously optimizing CoM trajectory, Ground Reaction Forces (GRFs), and joint states. To meet the online requirements, we propose an accelerated evolutionary algorithm as the trajectory optimizer to address the complexity of kinodynamic constraints. To ensure stability and accuracy in environmental perception post-landing, we introduce a coarse-to-fine relocalization method that combines global Branch and Bound (BnB) search with Maximum a Posteriori (MAP) estimation for precise positioning during navigation and jumping. The proposed framework achieves jump trajectory generation in approximately 0.1 seconds with a warm start and has been successfully validated on two quadruped robots on uneven terrains. Additionally, we extend the framework's versatility to humanoid robots.</p></details> | Submitted to IJRR |

Traditional data-driven approaches often handle these tasks separately with specialized models. We introduce TranSPORTmer, a unified transformer-based framework capable of addressing all these tasks, showcasing its application to the intricate dynamics of multi-agent sports scenarios like soccer and basketball. Using Set Attention Blocks, TranSPORTmer effectively captures temporal dynamics and social interactions in an equivariant manner.

Additionally, we introduce a CLS extra agent to classify states along soccer trajectories, including passes, possessions, uncontrolled states, and out-of-play intervals, contributing to an enhancement in modeling trajectories. Evaluations on soccer and basketball datasets show that TranSPORTmer outperforms state-of-the-art task-specific models in player forecasting, player forecasting-imputation, ball inference, and ball imputation. https://youtu.be/8VtSRm8oGoE</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACCV 2024</p></details> |

| **[Safe Reinforcement Learning of Robot Trajectories in the Presence of Moving Obstacles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05784v1)** | 2024-11-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we present an approach for learning collision-free robot trajectories in the presence of moving obstacles. As a first step, we train a backup policy to generate evasive movements from arbitrary initial robot states using model-free reinforcement learning. When learning policies for other tasks, the backup policy can be used to estimate the potential risk of a collision and to offer an alternative action if the estimated risk is considered too high. No matter which action is selected, our action space ensures that the kinematic limits of the robot joints are not violated. We analyze and evaluate two different methods for estimating the risk of a collision. A physics simulation performed in the background is computationally expensive but provides the best results in deterministic environments. If a data-based risk estimator is used instead, the computational effort is significantly reduced, but an additional source of error is introduced. For evaluation, we successfully learn a reaching task and a basketball task while keeping the risk of collisions low. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach for deterministic and stochastic environments, including a human-robot scenario and a ball environment, where no state can be considered permanently safe. By conducting experiments with a real robot, we show that our approach can generate safe trajectories in real time.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L); 8 pages; 7 figures</p></details> |

However, adjusting specific elements in generated videos, such as object motion or camera movement, is often a tedious process of trial and error, e.g., involving re-generating videos with different random seeds. Recent techniques address this issue by fine-tuning a pre-trained model to follow conditioning signals, such as bounding boxes or point trajectories. Yet, this fine-tuning procedure can be computationally expensive, and it requires datasets with annotated object motion, which can be difficult to procure. In this work, we introduce SG-I2V, a framework for controllable image-to-video generation that is self-guided$\unicode{x2013}$offering zero-shot control by relying solely on the knowledge present in a pre-trained image-to-video diffusion model without the need for fine-tuning or external knowledge.

| **[Optimal Flow Matching: Learning Straight Trajectories in Just One Step](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13117v3)** | 2024-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Over the several recent years, there has been a boom in development of Flow Matching (FM) methods for generative modeling. One intriguing property pursued by the community is the ability to learn flows with straight trajectories which realize the Optimal Transport (OT) displacements. Straightness is crucial for the fast integration (inference) of the learned flow's paths. Unfortunately, most existing flow straightening methods are based on non-trivial iterative FM procedures which accumulate the error during training or exploit heuristics based on minibatch OT. To address these issues, we develop and theoretically justify the novel \textbf{Optimal Flow Matching} (OFM) approach which allows recovering the straight OT displacement for the quadratic transport in just one FM step. The main idea of our approach is the employment of vector field for FM which are parameterized by convex functions.</p></details> |  |

Predicting future movement enables cameras to automatically track and predict a player's future trajectory without human intervention. Predicting future human movement in the context of complex physical tasks is also intellectually satisfying. Swift advancements in sports analytics and the wide availability of videos for tennis have inspired us to propose a novel method called Pose2Trajectory, which predicts a tennis player's future trajectory as a sequence derived from their body joints' data and ball position. Demonstrating impressive accuracy, our approach capitalizes on body joint information to provide a comprehensive understanding of the human body's geometry and motion, thereby enhancing the prediction of the player's trajectory. We use encoder-decoder Transformer architecture trained on the joints and trajectory information of the players with ball positions. The predicted sequence can provide information to help close-up cameras to keep tracking the tennis player, following centroid coordinates. We generate a high-quality dataset from multiple videos to assist tennis player movement prediction using object detection and human pose estimation methods. It contains bounding boxes and joint information for tennis players and ball positions in singles tennis games. Our method shows promising results in predicting the tennis player's movement trajectory with different sequence prediction lengths using the joints and trajectory information with the ball position.</p></details> |  |
| **[TrajGPT: Controlled Synthetic Trajectory Generation Using a Multitask Transformer-Based Spatiotemporal Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04381v1)** | 2024-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human mobility modeling from GPS-trajectories and synthetic trajectory generation are crucial for various applications, such as urban planning, disaster management and epidemiology. Both of these tasks often require filling gaps in a partially specified sequence of visits - a new problem that we call "controlled" synthetic trajectory generation. Existing methods for next-location prediction or synthetic trajectory generation cannot solve this problem as they lack the mechanisms needed to constrain the generated sequences of visits. Moreover, existing approaches (1) frequently treat space and time as independent factors, an assumption that fails to hold true in real-world scenarios, and (2) suffer from challenges in accuracy of temporal prediction as they fail to deal with mixed distributions and the inter-relationships of different modes with latent variables (e.g., day-of-the-week). These limitations become even more pronounced when the task involves filling gaps within sequences instead of solely predicting the next visit. We introduce TrajGPT, a transformer-based, multi-task, joint spatiotemporal generative model to address these issues. Taking inspiration from large language models, TrajGPT poses the problem of controlled trajectory generation as that of text infilling in natural language. TrajGPT integrates the spatial and temporal models in a transformer architecture through a Bayesian probability model that ensures that the gaps in a visit sequence are filled in a spatiotemporally consistent manner. Our experiments on public and private datasets demonstrate that TrajGPT not only excels in controlled synthetic visit generation but also outperforms competing models in next-location prediction tasks - Relatively, TrajGPT achieves a 26-fold improvement in temporal accuracy while retaining more than 98% of spatial accuracy on average.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 3 figures, 32nd ACM SIGSPATIAL International Conference on Advances in Geographic Information Systems (ACM SIGSPATIAL 2024)</p></details> |

Data augmentation techniques, such as noise injection and data synthesizing, aim to improve Q-function approximation by smoothing the learned state-action region. However, these methods often fall short of directly improving the quality of offline datasets, leading to suboptimal results. In response, we introduce GTA, Generative Trajectory Augmentation, a novel generative data augmentation approach designed to enrich offline data by augmenting trajectories to be both high-rewarding and dynamically plausible. GTA applies a diffusion model within the data augmentation framework. GTA partially noises original trajectories and then denoises them with classifier-free guidance via conditioning on amplified return value. Our results show that GTA, as a general data augmentation strategy, enhances the performance of widely used offline RL algorithms across various tasks with unique challenges. Furthermore, we conduct a quality analysis of data augmented by GTA and demonstrate that GTA improves the quality of the data.

While prior research has typically focused on either prediction or generation, our approach unifies these tasks to provide a versatile framework and achieve state-of-the-art performance. While diffusion models excel in trajectory generation, their iterative sampling process is computationally intensive, hindering robotic systems' dynamic capabilities. We introduce Trajectory Conditional Flow Matching (T-CFM), a novel approach using flow matching techniques to learn a solver time-varying vector field for efficient, fast trajectory generation. T-CFM demonstrates effectiveness in adversarial tracking, real-world aircraft trajectory forecasting, and long-horizon planning, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines with 35% higher predictive accuracy and 142% improved planning performance. Crucially, T-CFM achieves up to 100$\times$ speed-up compared to diffusion models without sacrificing accuracy, enabling real-time decision making in robotics.

The convex cover consists of a set of polytopes such that the union of the polytopes represents obstacle-free space, allowing us to find trajectories for robots that lie within the convex cover. In order to find the SFC that facilitates optimal trajectory generation, we iteratively find overlapping polytopes of maximum volumes that include specified waypoints initialized by a geometric or kinematic planner. Constraints at waypoints appear in two alternating stages of a joint optimization problem, which is solved by a method inspired by the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) with partially distributed variables. We validate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm using a range of parameterized environments and show its applications for two-stage motion planning.</p></details> |  |

However, extensive demonstrations are required for policy robustness and generalization. To reduce the demonstration reliance, we leverage spatial symmetry and propose ET-SEED, an efficient trajectory-level SE(3) equivariant diffusion model for generating action sequences in complex robot manipulation tasks. Further, previous equivariant diffusion models require the per-step equivariance in the Markov process, making it difficult to learn policy under such strong constraints. We theoretically extend equivariant Markov kernels and simplify the condition of equivariant diffusion process, thereby significantly improving training efficiency for trajectory-level SE(3) equivariant diffusion policy in an end-to-end manner. We evaluate ET-SEED on representative robotic manipulation tasks, involving rigid body, articulated and deformable object. Experiments demonstrate superior data efficiency and manipulation proficiency of our proposed method, as well as its ability to generalize to unseen configurations with only a few demonstrations.

In this study, we propose an efficient and robust low-rank model for precise spatiotemporal traffic speed state estimation (TSE) using lowpenetration vehicle trajectory data. Leveraging traffic wave priors, an oblique grid-based matrix is first designed to transform the inherent dependencies of spatiotemporal traffic states into the algebraic low-rankness of a matrix. Then, with the enhanced traffic state low-rankness in the oblique matrix, a low-rank matrix completion method is tailored to explicitly capture spatiotemporal traffic propagation characteristics and precisely reconstruct traffic states. In addition, an anomaly-tolerant module based on a sparse matrix is developed to accommodate corrupted data input and thereby improve the TSE model robustness. Notably, driven by the understanding of traffic waves, the computational complexity of the proposed efficient method is only correlated with the problem size itself, not with dataset size and hyperparameter selection prevalent in existing studies. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness, robustness, and efficiency of the proposed model. The performance of the proposed method achieves up to a 12% improvement in Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) in the TSE scenarios and an 18% improvement in RMSE in the robust TSE scenarios, and it runs more than 20 times faster than the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.</p></details> | accepted by T-ITS |

However, current robotic-assisted physiotherapy methods struggle including biomechanical metrics in their control algorithms, crucial for safe and effective therapy. This paper introduces BATON, a Biomechanics-Aware Trajectory Optimization approach to robotic Navigation of human musculoskeletal loads. The method integrates a high-fidelity musculoskeletal model of the human shoulder into real-time control of robot-patient interaction during rotator cuff tendon rehabilitation. We extract skeletal dynamics and tendon loading information from an OpenSim shoulder model to solve an optimal control problem, generating strain-minimizing trajectories. Trajectories were realized on a healthy subject by an impedance-controlled robot while estimating the state of the subject's shoulder. Target poses were prescribed to design personalized rehabilitation across a wide range of shoulder motion avoiding high-strain areas. BATON was designed with real-time capabilities, enabling continuous trajectory replanning to address unforeseen variations in tendon strain, such as those from changing muscle activation of the subject.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 9 figures, under review</p></details> |

However, existing methods are often tailored to specific tasks and regions, resulting in limitations related to task specificity, regional dependency, and data quality sensitivity. Addressing these challenges requires a universal human trajectory foundation model capable of generalizing and scaling across diverse tasks and geographic contexts. To this end, we propose UniTraj, a Universal human Trajectory foundation model that is task-adaptive, region-independent, and highly generalizable. To further enhance performance, we construct WorldTrace, the first large-scale, high-quality, globally distributed dataset sourced from open web platforms, encompassing 2.45 million trajectories with billions of points across 70 countries. Through multiple resampling and masking strategies designed for pre-training, UniTraj effectively overcomes geographic and task constraints, adapting to heterogeneous data quality. Extensive experiments across multiple trajectory analysis tasks and real-world datasets demonstrate that UniTraj consistently outperforms existing approaches in terms of scalability and adaptability. These results underscore the potential of UniTraj as a versatile, robust solution for a wide range of trajectory analysis applications, with WorldTrace serving as an ideal but non-exclusive foundation for training.</p></details> |  |

Automatic flight trajectory planning faces challenges such as high computational effort and a lack of precision. Hence, when low computational effort or precise control is required, programming the flight route trajectory manually might be preferable. However, this requires in-depth knowledge of how to accurately plan flight trajectories in three-dimensional space. We propose planning quadrocopter flight trajectories manually using the Programming by Demonstration (PbD) approach -- simply drawing the trajectory in the three-dimensional space by hand. This simplifies the planning process and reduces the level of in-depth knowledge required. We implemented the approach in the context of the Quadcopter Lab at Ulm University. In order to evaluate our approach, we compare the precision and accuracy of the trajectories drawn by a user using our approach as well as the required time with those manually programmed using a domain specific language. The evaluation shows that the Drawjectory workflow is, on average, 78.7 seconds faster without a significant loss of precision, shown by an average deviation 6.67 cm.</p></details> |  |
| **[Revisiting CNNs for Trajectory Similarity Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19761v2)** | 2024-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Similarity search is a fundamental but expensive operator in querying trajectory data, due to its quadratic complexity of distance computation. To mitigate the computational burden for long trajectories, neural networks have been widely employed for similarity learning and each trajectory is encoded as a high-dimensional vector for similarity search with linear complexity. Given the sequential nature of trajectory data, previous efforts have been primarily devoted to the utilization of RNNs or Transformers. In this paper, we argue that the common practice of treating trajectory as sequential data results in excessive attention to capturing long-term global dependency between two sequences. Instead, our investigation reveals the pivotal role of local similarity, prompting a revisit of simple CNNs for trajectory similarity learning. We introduce ConvTraj, incorporating both 1D and 2D convolutions to capture sequential and geo-distribution features of trajectories, respectively. In addition, we conduct a series of theoretical analyses to justify the effectiveness of ConvTraj. Experimental results on four real-world large-scale datasets demonstrate that ConvTraj achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in trajectory similarity search. Owing to the simple network structure of ConvTraj, the training and inference speed on the Porto dataset with 1.6 million trajectories are increased by at least $240$x and $2.16$x, respectively.

Asteroids are often discovered using optical telescopes and their trajectories are calculated from images, resulting in an inherent asymmetric uncertainty in their position and velocity. Consequently, we typically cannot determine the exact trajectory of an asteroid, and an ensemble of trajectories must be generated to estimate an asteroid's movement over time. When propagating these ensembles over decades, it is challenging to visualize the varying paths and determine their potential impact on Earth, which could cause catastrophic damage. NEOviz equips experts with the necessary tools to effectively analyze the existing catalog of asteroid observations. In particular, we present a novel approach for visualizing the 3D uncertainty region through which an asteroid travels, while providing accurate spatial context in relation to system-critical infrastructure such as Earth, the Moon, and artificial satellites. Furthermore, we use NEOviz to visualize the divergence of asteroid trajectories, capturing high-variance events in an asteroid's orbital properties. For potential impactors, we combine the 3D visualization with an uncertainty-aware impact map to illustrate the potential risks to human populations. NEOviz was developed with continuous input from members of the planetary defense community through a participatory design process. It is exemplified in three real-world use cases and evaluated via expert feedback interviews.</p></details> |  |

We employ state-of-the-art computer vision and deep learning to create an end-to-end pipeline that enhances vehicle detection, tracking, and trajectory stabilization. Conducted in the Songdo International Business District, South Korea, the study used a multi-drone experiment over 20 intersections, capturing approximately 12TB of 4K video data over four days. We developed a novel track stabilization method that uses detected vehicle bounding boxes as exclusion masks during image registration, which, combined with advanced georeferencing techniques, accurately transforms vehicle coordinates into real-world geographical data. Additionally, our framework includes robust vehicle dimension estimation and detailed road segmentation for in-depth traffic analysis. The framework produced two high-quality datasets: the Songdo Traffic dataset, comprising nearly 1 million unique vehicle trajectories, and the Songdo Vision dataset, containing over 5,000 human-annotated frames with about 300,000 vehicle instances in four classes. Comparisons between drone-derived data and high-precision sensor data from an instrumented probe vehicle highlight the accuracy and consistency of our framework's extraction in dense urban settings. By publicly releasing these datasets and the pipeline source code, this work sets new benchmarks for data quality, reproducibility, and scalability in traffic research. Results demonstrate the potential of integrating drone technology with advanced computer vision for precise, cost-effective urban traffic monitoring, providing valuable resources for the research community to develop intelligent transportation systems and improve traffic management strategies.</p></details> |  |

Current distillation techniques often dichotomize into two distinct aspects: i) ODE Trajectory Preservation; and ii) ODE Trajectory Reformulation. However, these approaches suffer from severe performance degradation or domain shifts. To address these limitations, we propose Hyper-SD, a novel framework that synergistically amalgamates the advantages of ODE Trajectory Preservation and Reformulation, while maintaining near-lossless performance during step compression. Firstly, we introduce Trajectory Segmented Consistency Distillation to progressively perform consistent distillation within pre-defined time-step segments, which facilitates the preservation of the original ODE trajectory from a higher-order perspective. Secondly, we incorporate human feedback learning to boost the performance of the model in a low-step regime and mitigate the performance loss incurred by the distillation process. Thirdly, we integrate score distillation to further improve the low-step generation capability of the model and offer the first attempt to leverage a unified LoRA to support the inference process at all steps. Extensive experiments and user studies demonstrate that Hyper-SD achieves SOTA performance from 1 to 8 inference steps for both SDXL and SD1.5. For example, Hyper-SDXL surpasses SDXL-Lightning by +0.68 in CLIP Score and +0.51 in Aes Score in the 1-step inference.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2024 (Camera-Ready Version).

Principal component analysis (PCA) is applied to trajectory data consisting of $n_s = 4,000,000$ datapoints, of the FPUT $\beta$ model with $N = 32$ coupled oscillators, revealing a critical relationship between $m^{\ast}$ and the model's nonlinear strength. For weak nonlinearities, $m^{\ast} \ll n$, where $n = 2N$. In contrast, for strong nonlinearities, $m^{\ast} \rightarrow n - 1$, consistently with the ergodic hypothesis. Furthermore, one of the potential limitations of PCA is addressed through an analysis with t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding ($t$-SNE). Accordingly, we found strong evidence suggesting that the datapoints lie near or on a curved low-dimensional manifold for weak nonlinearities.</p></details> | 20 pages, 18 figures |

The number of features is comparable to the sample size and errors may be heavy-tailed. We introduce estimators that precisely track the generalization error of the iterates along the trajectory of the iterative algorithm. These estimators are provably consistent under suitable conditions. The results are illustrated through several examples, including Huber regression, pseudo-Huber regression, and their penalized variants with non-smooth regularizer. We provide explicit generalization error estimates for iterates generated from GD and SGD, or from proximal SGD in the presence of a non-smooth regularizer. The proposed risk estimates serve as effective proxies for the actual generalization error, allowing us to determine the optimal stopping iteration that minimizes the generalization error.

Despite intensive research on driver behavior prediction, existing approaches typically overlook the interactions between AVs and HDVs assuming that HDV trajectories are not affected by AV actions. To address this gap, we present a transformer-transfer learning-based interaction-aware trajectory predictor for safe motion planning of autonomous driving, focusing on a vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) interaction scenario consisting of an AV and an HDV. Specifically, we construct a transformer-based interaction-aware trajectory predictor using widely available datasets of HDV trajectory data and further transfer the learned predictor using a small set of AV-HDV interaction data. Then, to better incorporate the proposed trajectory predictor into the motion planning module of AVs, we introduce an uncertainty quantification method to characterize the errors of the predictor, which are integrated into the path-planning process. Our experimental results demonstrate the value of explicitly considering interactions and handling uncertainties.</p></details> |  |

Current graph-based routing pipelines, while effective, involve substantial costs in constructing, maintaining, and updating road network graphs to reflect real-time conditions. In this study, we propose a new trajectory-based routing paradigm that bypasses current workflows by directly utilizing raw trajectory data to compute efficient routes. Our method, named TrajRoute, uniquely "follows" historical trajectories from a source to a destination, constructing paths that reflect actual driver behavior and implicit preferences. To supplement areas with sparse trajectory data, the road network is also incorporated into TrajRoute's index, and tunable parameters are introduced to control the balance between road segments and trajectories, ensuring a unified and adaptable routing approach. We experimentally verify our approach by comparing it to an existing online routing service. Our results demonstrate that as the number of trajectories covering the road network increases, TrajRoute produces increasingly accurate travel time and route length estimates while gradually eliminating the need to downgrade to the road network. This highlights the potential of simpler, data-driven pipelines for routing, offering lower-maintenance alternatives to conventional systems.</p></details> |  |

To bolster the adoption of the continuous-time paradigm, we propose a so-called Gaussian Process Trajectory Representation (GPTR) framework for continuous-time motion estimation (CTME) tasks. Our approach stands out by employing a third-order random jerk model, featuring closed-form expressions for both rotational and translational state derivatives. This model provides smooth, continuous trajectory representations that are crucial for precise estimation of complex motion. To support the wider robotics and computer vision communities, we have made the source code for GPTR available as a light-weight header-only library. This format was chosen for its ease of integration, allowing developers to incorporate GPTR into existing systems without needing extensive code modifications. Moreover, we also provide a set of optimization examples with LiDAR, camera, IMU, UWB factors, and closed-form analytical Jacobians under the proposed GP framework.

The key idea is to capture each task by an object-centric representation, specifically the SE(3) object pose trajectory relative to the target. This approach decouples embodiment actions from sensory inputs, facilitating learning from various demonstration types, including both action-based and action-less human hand demonstrations, as well as cross-embodiment generalization. Additionally, object pose trajectories inherently capture planning constraints from demonstrations without the need for manually crafted rules. To guide the robot in executing the task, the object trajectory is used to condition a diffusion policy. We show improvement compared to prior work on RLBench simulated tasks. In real-world evaluation, using only eight demonstrations shot on an iPhone, our approach completed all tasks while fully complying with task constraints.

| **[RopeTP: Global Human Motion Recovery via Integrating Robust Pose Estimation with Diffusion Trajectory Prior](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20358v2)** | 2024-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present RopeTP, a novel framework that combines Robust pose estimation with a diffusion Trajectory Prior to reconstruct global human motion from videos. At the heart of RopeTP is a hierarchical attention mechanism that significantly improves context awareness, which is essential for accurately inferring the posture of occluded body parts. This is achieved by exploiting the relationships with visible anatomical structures, enhancing the accuracy of local pose estimations. The improved robustness of these local estimations allows for the reconstruction of precise and stable global trajectories. Additionally, RopeTP incorporates a diffusion trajectory model that predicts realistic human motion from local pose sequences. This model ensures that the generated trajectories are not only consistent with observed local actions but also unfold naturally over time, thereby improving the realism and stability of 3D human motion reconstruction. Extensive experimental validation shows that RopeTP surpasses current methods on two benchmark datasets, particularly excelling in scenarios with occlusions. It also outperforms methods that rely on SLAM for initial camera estimates and extensive optimization, delivering more accurate and realistic trajectories.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by WACV 2025 (Round 1)</p></details> |
| **[Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction with Missing Data: Datasets, Imputation, and Benchmarking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00174v1)** | 2024-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pedestrian trajectory prediction is crucial for several applications such as robotics and self-driving vehicles. Significant progress has been made in the past decade thanks to the availability of pedestrian trajectory datasets, which enable trajectory prediction methods to learn from pedestrians' past movements and predict future trajectories. However, these datasets and methods typically assume that the observed trajectory sequence is complete, ignoring real-world issues such as sensor failure, occlusion, and limited fields of view that can result in missing values in observed trajectories. To address this challenge, we present TrajImpute, a pedestrian trajectory prediction dataset that simulates missing coordinates in the observed trajectory, enhancing real-world applicability. TrajImpute maintains a uniform distribution of missing data within the observed trajectories. In this work, we comprehensively examine several imputation methods to reconstruct the missing coordinates and benchmark them for imputing pedestrian trajectories. Furthermore, we provide a thorough analysis of recent trajectory prediction methods and evaluate the performance of these models on the imputed trajectories. Our experimental evaluation of the imputation and trajectory prediction methods offers several valuable insights. Our dataset provides a foundational resource for future research on imputation-aware pedestrian trajectory prediction, potentially accelerating the deployment of these methods in real-world applications. Publicly accessible links to the datasets and code files are available at https://github.com/Pranav-chib/TrajImpute.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |

We begin by introducing the Quantile Attention-Fourier Deep Operator Network (QAF-DeepONet), designed to capture the complex dynamics of voltage trajectories and reliably estimate quantiles of the target trajectory without any distributional assumptions. The proposed operator regression model maps the observed portion of the voltage trajectory to its unobserved post-fault trajectory. Our methodology employs a pre-training and fine-tuning process to address the challenge of limited data availability. To ensure data privacy in learning the pre-trained model, we use merging via federated learning with data from neighboring buses, enabling the model to learn the underlying voltage dynamics from such buses without directly sharing their data. After pre-training, we fine-tune the model with data from the target bus, allowing it to adapt to unique dynamics and operating conditions. Finally, we integrate conformal prediction into the fine-tuned model to ensure coverage guarantees for the predicted intervals. We evaluated the performance of the proposed methodology using the New England 39-bus test system considering detailed models of voltage and frequency controllers. Two metrics, Prediction Interval Coverage Probability (PICP) and Prediction Interval Normalized Average Width (PINAW), are used to numerically assess the model's performance in predicting intervals. The results show that the proposed approach offers practical and reliable uncertainty quantification in predicting the interval of post-fault voltage trajectories.</p></details> |  |

Existing research mainly focuses on leveraging single-frame cooperative information to enhance the limited perception capability of the ego vehicle, while underutilizing the motion and interaction context of traffic participants observed from cooperative devices. In this paper, we propose a forecasting-oriented representation paradigm to utilize motion and interaction features from cooperative information. Specifically, we present V2X-Graph, a representative framework to achieve interpretable and end-to-end trajectory feature fusion for cooperative motion forecasting. V2X-Graph is evaluated on V2X-Seq in vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) scenarios. To further evaluate on vehicle-to-everything (V2X) scenario, we construct the first real-world V2X motion forecasting dataset V2X-Traj, which contains multiple autonomous vehicles and infrastructure in every scenario. Experimental results on both V2X-Seq and V2X-Traj show the advantage of our method. We hope both V2X-Graph and V2X-Traj will benefit the further development of cooperative motion forecasting.

| **[Continuous Dynamic Modeling via Neural ODEs for Popularity Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18742v2)** | 2024-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Popularity prediction for information cascades has significant applications across various domains, including opinion monitoring and advertising recommendations. While most existing methods consider this as a discrete problem, popularity actually evolves continuously, exhibiting rich dynamic properties such as change rates and growth patterns. In this paper, we argue that popularity trajectory prediction is more practical, as it aims to forecast the entire trajectory of how popularity unfolds over arbitrary future time. This approach offers insights into both instantaneous popularity and the underlying dynamic properties. However, traditional methods for popularity trajectory prediction primarily rely on specific diffusion mechanism assumptions, which may not align well with real-world dynamics and compromise their performance. To address these limitations, we propose NODEPT, a novel approach based on neural ordinary differential equations (ODEs) for popularity trajectory prediction. NODEPT models the continuous dynamics of the underlying diffusion system using neural ODEs. We first employ an encoder to initialize the latent state representations of information cascades, consisting of two representation learning modules that capture the co-evolution structural characteristics and temporal patterns of cascades from different perspectives. More importantly, we then introduce an ODE-based generative module that learns the dynamics of the diffusion system in the latent space. Finally, a decoder transforms the latent state into the prediction of the future popularity trajectory. Our experimental results on three real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority and rationality of the proposed NODEPT method.</p></details> | <details><summary>The t...</summary><p>The time complexity analysis in section 4.4 contains error; we overlooked the impact of the memory module</p></details> |

However, for most problems of interest, MPC relies on the recursive solution of highly non-convex trajectory optimization problems, leading to high computational complexity and strong dependency on initialization. In this work, we present a unified framework to combine the main strengths of optimization-based and learning-based methods for MPC. Our approach entails embedding high-capacity, transformer-based neural network models within the optimization process for trajectory generation, whereby the transformer provides a near-optimal initial guess, or target plan, to a non-convex optimization problem. Our experiments, performed in simulation and the real world onboard a free flyer platform, demonstrate the capabilities of our framework to improve MPC convergence and runtime. Compared to purely optimization-based approaches, results show that our approach can improve trajectory generation performance by up to 75%, reduce the number of solver iterations by up to 45%, and improve overall MPC runtime by 7x without loss in performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 7 figures.

We study generative modeling for planning with datasets repurposed from offline reinforcement learning. Specifically, we identify temporal consistency in the absence of step-wise rewards as one key technical challenge. We introduce the Latent Plan Transformer (LPT), a novel model that leverages a latent variable to connect a Transformer-based trajectory generator and the final return. LPT can be learned with maximum likelihood estimation on trajectory-return pairs. In learning, posterior sampling of the latent variable naturally integrates sub-trajectories to form a consistent abstraction despite the finite context. At test time, the latent variable is inferred from an expected return before policy execution, realizing the idea of planning as inference. Our experiments demonstrate that LPT can discover improved decisions from sub-optimal trajectories, achieving competitive performance across several benchmarks, including Gym-Mujoco, Franka Kitchen, Maze2D, and Connect Four. It exhibits capabilities in nuanced credit assignments, trajectory stitching, and adaptation to environmental contingencies. These results validate that latent variable inference can be a strong alternative to step-wise reward prompting.</p></details> |  |

Trajectory optimization is a powerful and widely used algorithm in control, parameterized by a cost and a dynamics function. The key to our approach is to leverage the recent progress in differentiable trajectory optimization, which enables computing the gradients of the loss with respect to the parameters of trajectory optimization. As a result, the cost and dynamics functions of trajectory optimization can be learned end-to-end. DiffTORI addresses the ``objective mismatch'' issue of prior model-based RL algorithms, as the dynamics model in DiffTORI is learned to directly maximize task performance by differentiating the policy gradient loss through the trajectory optimization process. We further benchmark DiffTORI for imitation learning on standard robotic manipulation task suites with high-dimensional sensory observations and compare our method to feed-forward policy classes as well as Energy-Based Models (EBM) and Diffusion. Across 15 model-based RL tasks and 35 imitation learning tasks with high-dimensional image and point cloud inputs, DiffTORI outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods in both domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2024 (Spotlight)</p></details> |

Traditional optimization methods for trajectory tracking face significant computational challenges and lack robustness in dynamic environments. Our approach employs deep reinforcement learning (RL) to overcome these limitations, leveraging 3D pointcloud data to perceive the environment without relying on memory-intensive obstacle representations like occupancy grids. The proposed system features two RL agents: one for predicting UAV velocities to follow a reference trajectory and another for managing collision avoidance in the presence of obstacles. This architecture ensures real-time performance and adaptability to uncertainties. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach through simulated and real-world experiments, highlighting improvements over state-of-the-art RL and optimization-based methods. Additionally, a curriculum learning paradigm is employed to scale the algorithms to more complex environments, ensuring robust trajectory tracking and obstacle avoidance in both static and dynamic scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[DisCo: Distributed Contact-Rich Trajectory Optimization for Forceful Multi-Robot Collaboration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23283v1)** | 2024-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present DisCo, a distributed algorithm for contact-rich, multi-robot tasks. DisCo is a distributed contact-implicit trajectory optimization algorithm, which allows a group of robots to optimize a time sequence of forces to objects and to their environment to accomplish tasks such as collaborative manipulation, robot team sports, and modular robot locomotion. We build our algorithm on a variant of the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM), where each robot computes its own contact forces and contact-switching events from a smaller single-robot, contact-implicit trajectory optimization problem, while cooperating with other robots through dual variables, enforcing constraints between robots. Each robot iterates between solving its local problem, and communicating over a wireless mesh network to enforce these consistency constraints with its neighbors, ultimately converging to a coordinated plan for the group. The local problems solved by each robot are significantly less challenging than a centralized problem with all robots' contact forces and switching events, improving the computational efficiency, while also preserving the privacy of some aspects of each robot's operation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm in simulations of collaborative manipulation, multi-robot team sports scenarios, and in modular robot locomotion, where DisCo achieves $3$x higher success rates with a 2.5x to 5x faster computation time. Further, we provide results of hardware experiments on a modular truss robot, with three collaborating truss nodes planning individually while working together to produce a punctuated rolling-gate motion of the composite structure.

State-of-the-art human trajectory prediction methods are limited by their focus on collision avoidance and short-term planning, and their inability to model complex interactions of humans with the environment. In contrast, our approach overcomes these limitations by predicting sequences of human interactions with the environment and using this information to guide trajectory predictions over a horizon of up to 60s. We leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to predict interactions with the environment by conditioning the LLM prediction on rich contextual information about the scene. This information is given as a 3D Dynamic Scene Graph that encodes the geometry, semantics, and traversability of the environment into a hierarchical representation. We then ground these interaction sequences into multi-modal spatio-temporal distributions over human positions using a probabilistic approach based on continuous-time Markov Chains. To evaluate our approach, we introduce a new semi-synthetic dataset of long-term human trajectories in complex indoor environments, which also includes annotations of human-object interactions. We show in thorough experimental evaluations that our approach achieves a 54% lower average negative log-likelihood and a 26.5% lower Best-of-20 displacement error compared to the best non-privileged (i.e., evaluated in a zero-shot fashion on the dataset) baselines for a time horizon of 60s.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures.

Detection methods in generative language models (GLMs) mainly focus on uncertainty estimation and embedding distance measurement, with the latter proven to be most effective in traditional linguistic tasks like summarization and translation. However, another complex generative scenario mathematical reasoning poses significant challenges to embedding-based methods due to its high-density feature of output spaces, but this feature causes larger discrepancies in the embedding shift trajectory between different samples in latent spaces. Hence, we propose a trajectory-based method TV score, which uses trajectory volatility for OOD detection in mathematical reasoning. Experiments show that our method outperforms all traditional algorithms on GLMs under mathematical reasoning scenarios and can be extended to more applications with high-density features in output spaces, such as multiple-choice questions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |

In this letter, we extend the recently proposed Hybrid iLQR method [1] to handle state and input constraints within an indirect optimization framework, aiming to preserve computational efficiency and ensure dynamic feasibility. Specifically, we incorporate two constraint handling mechanisms into the Hybrid iLQR: Discrete Barrier State and Augmented Lagrangian methods. Comprehensive simulations across various operational situations are conducted to evaluate and compare the performance of these extended methods in terms of convergence and their ability to handle infeasible starting trajectories. Results indicate that while the Discrete Barrier State approach is more computationally efficient, the Augmented Lagrangian method outperforms it in complex and real-world scenarios with infeasible initial trajectories.</p></details> | 6 pages 4 figures |

By combining sampling-based Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) control with gradient-based Interior-Point Differential Dynamic Programming (IPDDP), we leverage their respective strengths in exploration and smoothing. The proposed method, MPPI-IPDDP, involves three steps: First, MPPI control is used to generate a coarse trajectory. Second, a collision-free convex corridor is constructed. Third, IPDDP is applied to smooth the coarse trajectory, utilizing the collision-free corridor from the second step. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we apply the proposed algorithm to trajectory optimization for differential-drive wheeled mobile robots and point-mass quadrotors. In comparisons with other MPPI variants and continuous optimization-based solvers, our method shows superior performance in terms of computational robustness and trajectory smoothness.

| **[Choice between Partial Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22690v1)** | 2024-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As AI agents generate increasingly sophisticated behaviors, manually encoding human preferences to guide these agents becomes more challenging. To address this, it has been suggested that agents instead learn preferences from human choice data. This approach requires a model of choice behavior that the agent can use to interpret the data. For choices between partial trajectories of states and actions, previous models assume choice probabilities to be determined by the partial return or the cumulative advantage. We consider an alternative model based instead on the bootstrapped return, which adds to the partial return an estimate of the future return. Benefits of the bootstrapped return model stem from its treatment of human beliefs. Unlike partial return, choices based on bootstrapped return reflect human beliefs about the environment. Further, while recovering the reward function from choices based on cumulative advantage requires that those beliefs are correct, doing so from choices based on bootstrapped return does not. To motivate the bootstrapped return model, we formulate axioms and prove an Alignment Theorem. This result formalizes how, for a general class of human preferences, such models are able to disentangle goals from beliefs. This ensures recovery of an aligned reward function when learning from choices based on bootstrapped return. The bootstrapped return model also affords greater robustness to choice behavior. Even when choices are based on partial return, learning via a bootstrapped return model recovers an aligned reward function. The same holds with choices based on the cumulative advantage if the human and the agent both adhere to correct and consistent beliefs about the environment. On the other hand, if choices are based on bootstrapped return, learning via partial return or cumulative advantage models does not generally produce an aligned reward function.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Overtaking Trajectory Planning Framework Based on Spatio-temporal Topology and Reachable Set Analysis Ensuring Time Efficiency](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22643v1)** | 2024-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating overtaking trajectories in high-speed scenarios presents significant challenges and is typically addressed through hierarchical planning methods. However, this method has two primary drawbacks. First, heuristic algorithms can only provide a single initial solution, which may lead to local optima and consequently diminish the quality of the solution. Second, the time efficiency of trajectory refinement based on numerical optimization is insufficient. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes an overtaking trajectory planning framework based on spatio-temporal topology and reachable set analysis (SROP), to improve trajectory quality and time efficiency. Specifically, this paper introduces topological classes to describe trajectories representing different overtaking behaviors, which support the spatio-temporal topological search method employed by the upper-layer planner to identify diverse initial paths. This approach helps prevent getting stuck in local optima, enhancing the overall solution quality by considering multiple initial solutions from distinct topologies. Moreover, the reachable set method is integrated into the lower-layer planner for parallel trajectory evaluation. This method enhances planning efficiency by decoupling vehicle model constraints from the optimization process, enabling parallel computation while ensuring control feasibility. Simulation results show that the proposed method improves the smoothness of generated trajectories by 66.8% compared to state-of-the-art methods, highlighting its effectiveness in enhancing trajectory quality. Additionally, this method reduces computation time by 62.9%, demonstrating its efficiency.</p></details> |  |

However, they face challenges due to their high-dimensional and unstable dynamics, as well as the complex contact-rich nature of the tasks. Model-based optimal control methods offer precise and systematic control but are limited by high computational complexity and accurate contact sensing. On the other hand, reinforcement learning (RL) provides robustness and handles high-dimensional spaces but suffers from inefficient learning, unnatural motion, and sim-to-real gaps. To address these challenges, we introduce Opt2Skill, an end-to-end pipeline that combines model-based trajectory optimization with RL to achieve robust whole-body loco-manipulation. We generate reference motions for the Digit humanoid robot using differential dynamic programming (DDP) and train RL policies to track these trajectories. Our results demonstrate that Opt2Skill outperforms pure RL methods in both training efficiency and task performance, with optimal trajectories that account for torque limits enhancing trajectory tracking. We successfully transfer our approach to real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we provide a method for the learning of the recovery trajectory of an individual patient, as they undertake exercises as part of their physical therapy towards recovery of their loss of movement ability, following a critical illness. The difference between the Movement Recovery Scores (MRSs) attained by a patient, when undertaking a given exercise routine on successive instances, is given by a statistical distance/divergence between the (posterior) probabilities of random graphs that are Bayesianly learnt using time series data on locations of 20 of the patient's joints, recorded on an e-platform as the patient exercises. This allows for the computation of the MRS on every occasion the patient undertakes this exercise, using which, the recovery trajectory is drawn. We learn each graph as a Random Geometric Graph drawn in a probabilistic metric space, and identify the closed-form marginal posterior of any edge of the graph, given the correlation structure of the multivariate time series data on joint locations. On the basis of our recovery learning, we offer recommendations on the optimal exercise routines for patients with given level of mobility impairment.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we develop a strategy to locally adapt the step size parameter of HMC at every iteration by evaluating a low-rank approximation of the local Hessian and estimating its largest eigenvalue. We combine it with a strategy to similarly adapt the trajectory length by monitoring the no U-turn condition, resulting in an adaptive sampler, ATLAS: adapting trajectory length and step-size. We further use a delayed rejection framework for making multiple proposals that improves the computational efficiency of ATLAS, and develop an approach for automatically tuning its hyperparameters during warmup. We compare ATLAS with state-of-the-art samplers like NUTS on a suite of synthetic and real world examples, and show that i) unlike NUTS, ATLAS is able to accurately sample difficult distributions with complex geometries, ii) it is computationally competitive to NUTS for simpler distributions, and iii) it is more robust to the tuning of hyperparamters.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code available at https://github.com/modichirag/AtlasSampler</p></details> |

These individuals often face earlier onset and higher prevalence of MLTCs, yet specific co-occurrence patterns remain unexplored. This study applies an unsupervised approach to characterise MLTC clusters based on shared disease trajectories using electronic health records (EHRs) from 13069 individuals with ID in Wales (2000-2021). The population consisted of 52.3% males and 47.7% females, with an average of 4.5 conditions per patient. Disease associations and temporal directionality were assessed, followed by spectral clustering to group shared trajectories. Males under 45 formed a single cluster dominated by neurological conditions (32.4%), while males above 45 had three clusters, the largest featuring circulatory conditions (51.8%). Females under 45 formed one cluster with digestive conditions (24.6%) as most prevalent, while those aged 45 and older showed two clusters: one dominated by circulatory conditions (34.1%), and the other by digestive (25.9%) and musculoskeletal (21.9%) issues. Mental illness, epilepsy, and reflux were common across groups. Individuals above 45 had higher rates of circulatory and musculoskeletal issues. These clusters offer insights into disease progression in individuals with ID, informing targeted interventions and personalised healthcare strategies.</p></details> |  |

Neural stochastic differential equations (Neural SDEs) are an attractive modeling technique for this problem, which parameterize the drift and diffusion terms of an SDE with neural networks. However, current algorithms for training Neural SDEs require backpropagation through the SDE dynamics, greatly limiting their scalability and stability. To address this, we propose Trajectory Flow Matching (TFM), which trains a Neural SDE in a simulation-free manner, bypassing backpropagation through the dynamics. TFM leverages the flow matching technique from generative modeling to model time series. In this work we first establish necessary conditions for TFM to learn time series data. Next, we present a reparameterization trick which improves training stability. Finally, we adapt TFM to the clinical time series setting, demonstrating improved performance on three clinical time series datasets both in terms of absolute performance and uncertainty prediction.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2024 Spotlight</p></details> |

However, ensuring safety throughout both the learning process and policy deployment remains a key challenge due to the risky exploration inherent in DRL, as well as the discrete nature of actions taken at intervals. These discontinuities, despite being part of a continuous action space, can lead to abrupt changes between successive actions, causing instability and unsafe intermediate states. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an integrated framework that combines DRL with a jerk-bounded trajectory generator (JBTG) and a robust low-level control strategy, significantly enhancing the safety, stability, and reliability of robotic manipulators. The low-level controller ensures the precise execution of DRL-generated commands, while the JBTG refines these motions to produce smooth, continuous trajectories that prevent abrupt or unsafe actions. The framework also includes pre-calculated safe velocity zones for smooth braking, preventing joint limit violations and ensuring compliance with kinematic constraints. This approach not only guarantees the robustness and safety of the robotic system but also optimizes motion control, making it suitable for practical applications. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is demonstrated through its application to a highly complex heavy-duty manipulator.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been submitted to the IEEE for potential publication</p></details> |
| **[Heterogeneous Interaction Modeling With Reduced Accumulated Error for Multi-Agent Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21342v1)** | 2024-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dynamical complex systems composed of interactive heterogeneous agents are prevalent in the world, including urban traffic systems and social networks. Modeling the interactions among agents is the key to understanding and predicting the dynamics of the complex system, e.g., predicting the trajectories of traffic participants in the city. Compared with interaction modeling in homogeneous systems such as pedestrians in a crowded scene, heterogeneous interaction modeling is less explored. Worse still, the error accumulation problem becomes more severe since the interactions are more complex. To tackle the two problems, this paper proposes heterogeneous interaction modeling with reduced accumulated error for multi-agent trajectory prediction. Based on the historical trajectories, our method infers the dynamic interaction graphs among agents, featured by directed interacting relations and interacting effects. A heterogeneous attention mechanism is defined on the interaction graphs for aggregating the influence from heterogeneous neighbors to the target agent. To alleviate the error accumulation problem, this paper analyzes the error sources from the spatial and temporal perspectives, and proposes to introduce the graph entropy and the mixup training strategy for reducing the two types of errors respectively. Our method is examined on three real-world datasets containing heterogeneous agents, and the experimental results validate the superiority of our method.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, accepted by IEEE TNNLS</p></details> |

Numerous methods have been proposed to address specific problems within trajectory modelling. However, due to the heterogeneity of data and the diversity of trajectory tasks, achieving unified trajectory modelling remains an important yet challenging task. In this paper, we propose TrajAgent, a large language model-based agentic framework, to unify various trajectory modelling tasks. In TrajAgent, we first develop UniEnv, an execution environment with a unified data and model interface, to support the execution and training of various models. Building on UniEnv, we introduce TAgent, an agentic workflow designed for automatic trajectory modelling across various trajectory tasks. Specifically, we design AutOpt, a systematic optimization module within TAgent, to further improve the performance of the integrated model. With diverse trajectory tasks input in natural language, TrajAgent automatically generates competitive results via training and executing appropriate models. Extensive experiments on four tasks using four real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of TrajAgent in unified trajectory modelling, achieving an average performance improvement of 15.43% over baseline methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages; the code will be openly accessible at: https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/TrajAgent</p></details> |
| **[Is Mamba Compatible with Trajectory Optimization in Offline Reinforcement Learning?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12094v2)** | 2024-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformer-based trajectory optimization methods have demonstrated exceptional performance in offline Reinforcement Learning (offline RL). Yet, it poses challenges due to substantial parameter size and limited scalability, which is particularly critical in sequential decision-making scenarios where resources are constrained such as in robots and drones with limited computational power. Mamba, a promising new linear-time sequence model, offers performance on par with transformers while delivering substantially fewer parameters on long sequences. As it remains unclear whether Mamba is compatible with trajectory optimization, this work aims to conduct comprehensive experiments to explore the potential of Decision Mamba (dubbed DeMa) in offline RL from the aspect of data structures and essential components with the following insights: (1) Long sequences impose a significant computational burden without contributing to performance improvements since DeMa's focus on sequences diminishes approximately exponentially. Consequently, we introduce a Transformer-like DeMa as opposed to an RNN-like DeMa. (2) For the components of DeMa, we identify the hidden attention mechanism as a critical factor in its success, which can also work well with other residual structures and does not require position embedding. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our specially designed DeMa is compatible with trajectory optimization and surpasses previous methods, outperforming Decision Transformer (DT) with higher performance while using 30\% fewer parameters in Atari, and exceeding DT with only a quarter of the parameters in MuJoCo.</p></details> | 23 pages, 11 figures |
| **[DAWN-ICL: Strategic Planning of Problem-solving Trajectories for Zero-Shot In-Context Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20215v1)** | 2024-10-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Zero-shot in-context learning (ZS-ICL) aims to conduct in-context learning (ICL) without using human-annotated demonstrations. Most ZS-ICL methods use large language models (LLMs) to generate (input, label) pairs as pseudo-demonstrations and leverage historical pseudo-demonstrations to help solve the current problem. They assume that problems are from the same task and traverse them in a random order. However, in real-world scenarios, problems usually come from diverse tasks, and only a few belong to the same task. The random traversing order may generate unreliable pseudo-demonstrations and lead to error accumulation. To address this problem, we reformulate ZS-ICL as a planning problem and propose a Demonstration-aware Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) approach (DAWN-ICL), which leverages MCTS to strategically plan the problem-solving trajectories for ZS-ICL. In addition, to achieve effective and efficient Q value estimation, we propose a novel demonstration-aware Q-value function and use it to enhance the selection phase and accelerate the expansion and simulation phases in MCTS. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of DAWN-ICL on in-domain and cross-domain scenarios, and it even outperforms ICL using human-annotated labels.

The inherent indeterminacy of human behavior and complex social interaction among a rich variety of agents make this task more challenging than common time-series forecasting. In this letter, we aim to explore a distinct formulation for multi-agent trajectory prediction framework. Specifically, we proposed a patching-based temporal feature extraction module and a graph-based social feature extraction module, enabling effective feature extraction and cross-scenario generalization. Moreover, we reassess the role of social interaction and present a novel method based on explicit modality modulation to integrate temporal and social features, thereby constructing an efficient single-stage inference pipeline. Results on public benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our model compared with the state-of-the-art methods.

| **[Context-Aware Trajectory Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19136v1)** | 2024-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory anomaly detection is crucial for effective decision-making in urban and human mobility management. Existing methods of trajectory anomaly detection generally focus on training a trajectory generative model and evaluating the likelihood of reconstructing a given trajectory. However, previous work often lacks important contextual information on the trajectory, such as the agent's information (e.g., agent ID) or geographic information (e.g., Points of Interest (POI)), which could provide additional information on accurately capturing anomalous behaviors. To fill this gap, we propose a context-aware anomaly detection approach that models contextual information related to trajectories. The proposed method is based on a trajectory reconstruction framework guided by contextual factors such as agent ID and contextual POI embedding. The injection of contextual information aims to improve the performance of anomaly detection. We conducted experiments in two cities and demonstrated that the proposed approach significantly outperformed existing methods by effectively modeling contextual information. Overall, this paper paves a new direction for advancing trajectory anomaly detection.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Historical Trajectory Assisted Optimization Method for Zeroth-Order Federated Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15955v5)** | 2024-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated learning heavily relies on distributed gradient descent techniques. In the situation where gradient information is not available, the gradients need to be estimated from zeroth-order information, which typically involves computing finite-differences along isotropic random directions. This method suffers from high estimation errors, as the geometric features of the objective landscape may be overlooked during the isotropic sampling. In this work, we propose a non-isotropic sampling method to improve the gradient estimation procedure. Gradients in our method are estimated in a subspace spanned by historical trajectories of solutions, aiming to encourage the exploration of promising regions and hence improve the convergence. The proposed method uses a covariance matrix for sampling which is a convex combination of two parts. The first part is a thin projection matrix containing the basis of the subspace which is designed to improve the exploitation ability. The second part is the historical trajectories. We implement this method in zeroth-order federated settings, and show that the convergence rate aligns with existing ones while introducing no significant overheads in communication or local computation. The effectiveness of our proposal is verified on several numerical experiments in comparison to several commonly-used zeroth-order federated optimization algorithms.</p></details> |  |
| **[VECTOR: Velocity-Enhanced GRU Neural Network for Real-Time 3D UAV Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23305v1)** | 2024-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper tackles the challenge of real-time 3D trajectory prediction for UAVs, which is critical for applications such as aerial surveillance and defense. Existing prediction models that rely primarily on position data struggle with accuracy, especially when UAV movements fall outside the position domain used in training. Our research identifies a gap in utilizing velocity estimates, first-order dynamics, to better capture the dynamics and enhance prediction accuracy and generalizability in any position domain. To bridge this gap, we propose a new trajectory prediction method using Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) within sequence-based neural networks. Unlike traditional methods that rely on RNNs or transformers, this approach forecasts future velocities and positions based on historical velocity data instead of positions. This is designed to enhance prediction accuracy and scalability, overcoming challenges faced by conventional models in handling complex UAV dynamics. The methodology employs both synthetic and real-world 3D UAV trajectory data, capturing a wide range of flight patterns, speeds, and agility. Synthetic data is generated using the Gazebo simulator and PX4 Autopilot, while real-world data comes from the UZH-FPV and Mid-Air drone racing datasets. The GRU-based models significantly outperform state-of-the-art RNN approaches, with a mean square error (MSE) as low as 2 x 10^-8. Overall, our findings confirm the effectiveness of incorporating velocity data in improving the accuracy of UAV trajectory predictions across both synthetic and real-world scenarios, in and out of position data distributions. Finally, we open-source our 5000 trajectories dataset and a ROS 2 package to facilitate the integration with existing ROS-based UAV systems.</p></details> |  |

Advances in machine learning have made traditional image and text-based CAPTCHAs vulnerable to attacks, leading modern CAPTCHAs, such as GeeTest and Akamai, to incorporate behavioral analysis like mouse trajectory detection. Existing bypass techniques struggle to fully mimic human behavior, making it difficult to evaluate the effectiveness of anti-bot measures. To address this, we propose a diffusion model-based mouse trajectory generation framework (DMTG), which controls trajectory complexity and produces realistic human-like mouse movements. DMTG also provides white-box and black-box testing methods to assess its ability to bypass CAPTCHA systems. In experiments, DMTG reduces bot detection accuracy by 4.75%-9.73% compared to other models. Additionally, it mimics physical human behaviors, such as slow initiation and directional force differences, demonstrating improved performance in both simulation and real-world CAPTCHA scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory Optimization for Spatial Microstructure Control in Electron Beam Metal Additive Manufacturing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18207v1)** | 2024-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Metal additive manufacturing (AM) opens the possibility for spatial control of as-fabricated microstructure and properties. However, since the solid state diffusional transformations that drive microstructure outcomes are governed by nonlinear ODEs in terms of temperature, which is itself governed by PDEs over the entire part domain, solving for the system inputs needed to achieve desired microstructure distributions has proven difficult. In this work, we present a trajectory optimization approach for spatial control of microstructure in metal AM, which we demonstrate by controlling the hardness of a low-alloy steel in electron beam powder bed fusion (EB-PBF). To this end, we present models for thermal and microstructural dynamics. Next, we use experimental data to identify the parameters of the microstructure transformation dynamics. We then pose spatial microstructure control as a finite-horizon optimal control problem. The optimal power field trajectory is computed using an augmented Lagrangian differential dynamic programming (AL-DDP) method with GPU acceleration. The resulting time-varying power fields are then realized on an EB-PBF machine through an approximation scheme. Measurements of the resultant hardness shows that the optimized power field trajectory is able to closely produce the desired hardness distribution.</p></details> | 6 pages, 6 figures |

The ability to retrieve vectors that satisfy both similarity and diversity criteria substantially enhances the performance of LLMs. Although Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR) is widely employed in retrieval scenarios requiring relevance and diversity, variations in the parameter $\lambda$ lead to fluctuations that complicate the optimization trajectory in vector spaces. This obscures the direction of improvement and highlights the lack of a robust theoretical analysis regarding similarity and diversity constraints in retrieval processes. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a novel approach that characterizes both constraints through the relationship between the sum vector and the query vector. The proximity of these vectors ensures the similarity constraint, while requiring individual vectors within the sum vector to diverge in their alignment with the query vector satisfies the diversity constraint. We first formulate a new combinatorial optimization problem, selecting k vectors from a candidate set such that their sum vector maximally aligns with the query vector, and demonstrate that this problem is NP-complete. This result underscores the inherent difficulty of simultaneously achieving similarity and diversity in vector retrieval, thereby providing a theoretical foundation for future research. Subsequently, we present the heuristic algorithm Vectors Retrieval with Similarity and Diversity, VRSD, which features a clear optimization objective and eliminates the need for preset parameters. VRSD also achieves a modest reduction in time complexity compared to MMR. Empirical validation confirms that VRSD significantly outperforms MMR across various datasets.</p></details> |  |

Creating this demo involved porting the Anticipatory Music Transformer, a large language model (LLM) pre-trained on the Lakh MIDI dataset, to the Machine Learning Compilation (MLC) framework. Once the model is ported, MLC facilitates inference on a variety of runtimes including C++, mobile, and the browser. We envision that MLC has the potential to bridge the gap between the landscape of increasingly capable music AI models and technology more familiar to music software developers. As a proof of concept, we build a web application that allows users to generate endless streams of multi-instrumental MIDI in the browser, either from scratch or conditioned on a prompt. On commodity hardware (an M3 Macbook Pro), our demo can generate 51 notes per second, which is faster than real-time playback for 72.9% of generations, and increases to 86.3% with 2 seconds of upfront buffering.</p></details> | 2 pages |
| **[PTR: Precision-Driven Tool Recommendation for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09613v1)** | 2024-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>By augmenting Large Language Models (LLMs) with external tools, their capacity to solve complex problems has been significantly enhanced. However, despite ongoing advancements in the parsing capabilities of LLMs, incorporating all available tools simultaneously in the prompt remains impractical due to the vast number of external tools. Consequently, it is essential to provide LLMs with a precise set of tools tailored to the specific task, considering both quantity and quality. Current tool retrieval methods primarily focus on refining the ranking list of tools and directly packaging a fixed number of top-ranked tools as the tool set. However, these approaches often fail to equip LLMs with the optimal set of tools prior to execution, since the optimal number of tools for different tasks could be different, resulting in inefficiencies such as redundant or unsuitable tools, which impede immediate access to the most relevant tools. This paper addresses the challenge of recommending precise toolsets for LLMs. We introduce the problem of tool recommendation, define its scope, and propose a novel Precision-driven Tool Recommendation (PTR) approach. PTR captures an initial, concise set of tools by leveraging historical tool bundle usage and dynamically adjusts the tool set by performing tool matching, culminating in a multi-view-based tool addition. Additionally, we present a new dataset, RecTools, and a metric, TRACC, designed to evaluate the effectiveness of tool recommendation for LLMs. We further validate our design choices through comprehensive experiments, demonstrating promising accuracy across two open benchmarks and our RecTools dataset.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces small-gain like sufficient conditions for 2-contraction of large-scale interconnected systems on the basis of a family of upper-bounds to the $L_2$ gains that arise from the gains computed on individual channels of the second additive variational equation. Such a condition guarantee the 2-additive compound of the system's Jacobian to be exponentially contractive, thus implying convergence towards equilibria of the system's solutions. The gains are obtained by solving suitable Linear Matrix Inequalities. Three interconnected Thomas' systems are considered in order to illustrate the application of the theory and the degree of conservatism.</p></details> |  |

During pre-training via massive datasets, such a model implicitly memorizes the factual knowledge of trained datasets in its hidden parameters. However, knowledge held implicitly in parameters often makes its use by downstream applications ineffective due to the lack of common-sense reasoning. In this article, we introduce a general framework that permits to build knowledge bases with an aid of LLMs, tailored for processing Web news. The framework applies a rule-based News Information Extractor (NewsIE) to news items for extracting their relational tuples, referred to as knowledge bases, which are then graph-convoluted with the implicit knowledge facts of news items obtained by LLMs, for their classification. It involves two lightweight components: 1) NewsIE: for extracting the structural information of every news item, in the form of relational tuples; 2) BERTGraph: for graph convoluting the implicit knowledge facts with relational tuples extracted by NewsIE. We have evaluated our framework under different news-related datasets for news category classification, with promising experimental results.</p></details> | 10 pages, 5 figures |

With the rapid development of code LLMs, many popular evaluation benchmarks, such as HumanEval, DS-1000, and MBPP, have emerged to measure the performance of code LLMs with a particular focus on code generation tasks. However, they are insufficient to cover the full range of expected capabilities of code LLMs, which span beyond code generation to answering diverse coding-related questions. To fill this gap, we propose InfiBench, the first large-scale freeform question-answering (QA) benchmark for code to our knowledge, comprising 234 carefully selected high-quality Stack Overflow questions that span across 15 programming languages. InfiBench uses four types of model-free automatic metrics to evaluate response correctness where domain experts carefully concretize the criterion for each question. We conduct a systematic evaluation for over 100 latest code LLMs on InfiBench, leading to a series of novel and insightful findings.

Despite its rapid progress, it heavily depends on sophisticatedly designed models given specific paralinguistic tasks. Thus, the heterogeneity and diversity of ComParal models largely prevent the realistic implementation of ComParal models. Recently, with the advent of acoustic foundation models because of self-supervised learning, developing more generic models that can efficiently perceive a plethora of paralinguistic information has become an active topic in speech processing. However, it lacks a unified evaluation framework for a fair and consistent performance comparison. To bridge this gap, we conduct a large-scale benchmark, namely ParaLBench, which concentrates on standardizing the evaluation process of diverse paralinguistic tasks, including critical aspects of affective computing such as emotion recognition and emotion dimensions prediction, over different acoustic foundation models. This benchmark contains ten datasets with thirteen distinct paralinguistic tasks, covering short-, medium- and long-term characteristics. Each task is carried out on 14 acoustic foundation models under a unified evaluation framework, which allows for an unbiased methodological comparison and offers a grounded reference for the ComParal community. Based on the insights gained from ParaLBench, we also point out potential research directions, i.e., the cross-corpus generalizability, to propel ComParal research in the future. The code associated with this study will be available to foster the transparency and replicability of this work for succeeding researchers.</p></details> |  |
| **[Approximated Variational Bayesian Inverse Reinforcement Learning for Large Language Model Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09341v1)** | 2024-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The alignment of large language models (LLMs) is crucial for generating helpful and harmless content. Existing approaches leverage preference-based human feedback data to learn the reward function and align the LLM with the feedback data. However, these approaches focus on modeling the reward difference between the chosen and rejected demonstrations, rather than directly modeling the true reward from each demonstration. Moreover, these approaches assume that the reward is only obtained at the end of the sentence, which overlooks the modeling of intermediate rewards. These issues lead to insufficient use of training signals in the feedback data, limiting the representation and generalization ability of the reward and potentially resulting in reward hacking. In this paper, we formulate LLM alignment as a Bayesian Inverse Reinforcement Learning (BIRL) problem and propose a novel training objective, Approximated Variational Alignment (AVA), to perform LLM alignment through Approximated Variational Reward Imitation Learning (AVRIL). The BIRL formulation facilitates intermediate reward modeling and direct reward modeling on each single demonstration, which enhances the utilization of training signals in the feedback data. Experiments show that AVA outperforms existing LLM alignment approaches in reward modeling, RL fine-tuning, and direct optimization.</p></details> |  |

This underscores the need for a unified system with comprehensive capabilities in analyzing Earth's surface to address a wide range of human needs. The emergence of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has great potential in boosting the efficiency and convenience of intelligent Earth observation. These models can engage in human-like conversations, serve as unified platforms for understanding images, follow diverse instructions, and provide insightful feedbacks. In this study, we introduce LHRS-Bot-Nova, an MLLM specialized in understanding remote sensing (RS) images, designed to expertly perform a wide range of RS understanding tasks aligned with human instructions. LHRS-Bot-Nova features an enhanced vision encoder and a novel bridge layer, enabling efficient visual compression and better language-vision alignment. To further enhance RS-oriented vision-language alignment, we propose a large-scale RS image-caption dataset, generated through feature-guided image recaptioning. Additionally, we introduce an instruction dataset specifically designed to improve spatial recognition abilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate superior performance of LHRS-Bot-Nova across various RS image understanding tasks. We also evaluate different MLLM performances in complex RS perception and instruction following using a complicated multi-choice question evaluation benchmark, providing a reliable guide for future model selection and improvement.

| **[Do Large Language Models Truly Grasp Mathematics? An Empirical Exploration From Cognitive Psychology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14979v4)** | 2024-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The cognitive mechanism by which Large Language Models (LLMs) solve mathematical problems remains a widely debated and unresolved issue. Currently, there is little interpretable experimental evidence that connects LLMs' problem-solving with human cognitive psychology.To determine if LLMs possess human-like mathematical reasoning, we modified the problems used in the human Cognitive Reflection Test (CRT). Our results show that, even with the use of Chains of Thought (CoT) prompts, mainstream LLMs, including the latest o1 model (noted for its reasoning capabilities), have a high error rate when solving these modified CRT problems. Specifically, the average accuracy rate dropped by up to 50% compared to the original questions.Further analysis of LLMs' incorrect answers suggests that they primarily rely on pattern matching from their training data, which aligns more with human intuition (System 1 thinking) rather than with human-like reasoning (System 2 thinking). This finding challenges the belief that LLMs have genuine mathematical reasoning abilities comparable to humans. As a result, this work may adjust overly optimistic views on LLMs' progress towards artificial general intelligence.</p></details> |  |

Consequently, these methods struggle to produce a unified and meaningful representation from the input face. We suppose that introducing the language-vision pluralistic representation into unexplored potential embedding space could enhance FSR by encoding and exploiting the complementarity across language-vision prior. This motivates us to propose a new framework called LLV-FSR, which marries the power of large vision-language model and higher-order visual prior with the challenging task of FSR. Specifically, besides directly absorbing knowledge from original input, we introduce the pre-trained vision-language model to generate pluralistic priors, involving the image caption, descriptions, face semantic mask and depths. These priors are then employed to guide the more critical feature representation, facilitating realistic and high-quality face super-resolution. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed framework significantly improves both the reconstruction quality and perceptual quality, surpassing the SOTA by 0.43dB in terms of PSNR on the MMCelebA-HQ dataset.</p></details> |  |
| **[Cross-Modal Consistency in Multimodal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09273v1)** | 2024-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent developments in multimodal methodologies have marked the beginning of an exciting era for models adept at processing diverse data types, encompassing text, audio, and visual content. Models like GPT-4V, which merge computer vision with advanced language processing, exhibit extraordinary proficiency in handling intricate tasks that require a simultaneous understanding of both textual and visual information. Prior research efforts have meticulously evaluated the efficacy of these Vision Large Language Models (VLLMs) in various domains, including object detection, image captioning, and other related fields. However, existing analyses have often suffered from limitations, primarily centering on the isolated evaluation of each modality's performance while neglecting to explore their intricate cross-modal interactions. Specifically, the question of whether these models achieve the same level of accuracy when confronted with identical task instances across different modalities remains unanswered. In this study, we take the initiative to delve into the interaction and comparison among these modalities of interest by introducing a novel concept termed cross-modal consistency. Furthermore, we propose a quantitative evaluation framework founded on this concept. Our experimental findings, drawn from a curated collection of parallel vision-language datasets developed by us, unveil a pronounced inconsistency between the vision and language modalities within GPT-4V, despite its portrayal as a unified multimodal model. Our research yields insights into the appropriate utilization of such models and hints at potential avenues for enhancing their design.</p></details> |  |

The effort needed to define test suites may deter some instructors from creating additional problems or lead to inadequate test coverage, potentially resulting in misleading feedback on student solutions. Such limitations may reduce student access to the well-documented benefits of timely feedback when learning programming. In this work, we evaluate the effectiveness of using Large Language Models (LLMs), as part of a larger workflow, to automatically generate test suites for CS1-level programming problems. Each problem's statement and reference solution are provided to GPT-4 to produce a test suite that can be used by an autograder. We evaluate our proposed approach using a sample of 26 problems, and more than 25,000 attempted solutions to those problems, submitted by students in an introductory programming course. We compare the performance of the LLM-generated test suites against the instructor-created test suites for each problem. Our findings reveal that LLM-generated test suites can correctly identify most valid solutions, and for most problems are at least as comprehensive as the instructor test suites. Additionally, the LLM-generated test suites exposed ambiguities in some problem statements, underscoring their potential to improve both autograding and instructional design.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Journal of Computer Assisted Learning</p></details> |
| **[On Context Utilization in Summarization with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10570v6)** | 2024-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) excel in abstractive summarization tasks, delivering fluent and pertinent summaries. Recent advancements have extended their capabilities to handle long-input contexts, exceeding 100k tokens. However, in question answering, language models exhibit uneven utilization of their input context. They tend to favor the initial and final segments, resulting in a U-shaped performance pattern concerning where the answer is located within the input. This bias raises concerns, particularly in summarization where crucial content may be dispersed throughout the source document(s). Besides, in summarization, mapping facts from the source to the summary is not trivial as salient content is usually re-phrased. In this paper, we conduct the first comprehensive study on context utilization and position bias in summarization. Our analysis encompasses 6 LLMs, 10 datasets, and 5 evaluation metrics. We introduce a new evaluation benchmark called MiddleSum on the which we benchmark two alternative inference methods to alleviate position bias: hierarchical summarization and incremental summarization. Our code and data can be found here: https://github.com/ntunlp/MiddleSum.</p></details> | <details><summary>ACL 2...</summary><p>ACL 2024. 9 pages, 7 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[Large Language Models for Power Scheduling: A User-Centric Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00476v3)** | 2024-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While traditional optimization and scheduling schemes are designed to meet fixed, predefined system requirements, future systems are moving toward user-driven approaches and personalized services, aiming to achieve high quality-of-experience (QoE) and flexibility. This challenge is particularly pronounced in wireless and digitalized energy networks, where users' requirements have largely not been taken into consideration due to the lack of a common language between users and machines. The emergence of powerful large language models (LLMs) marks a radical departure from traditional system-centric methods into more advanced user-centric approaches by providing a natural communication interface between users and devices. In this paper, for the first time, we introduce a novel architecture for resource scheduling problems by constructing three LLM agents to convert an arbitrary user's voice request (VRQ) into a resource allocation vector. Specifically, we design an LLM intent recognition agent to translate the request into an optimization problem (OP), an LLM OP parameter identification agent, and an LLM OP solving agent. To evaluate system performance, we construct a database of typical VRQs in the context of electric vehicle (EV) charging. As a proof of concept, we primarily use Llama 3 8B. Through testing with different prompt engineering scenarios, the obtained results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed architecture. The conducted performance analysis allows key insights to be extracted. For instance, having a larger set of candidate OPs to model the real-world problem might degrade the final performance because of a higher recognition/OP classification noise level. All results and codes are open source.</p></details> |  |
| **[Problematic Tokens: Tokenizer Bias in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11214v3)** | 2024-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in large language models(LLMs), such as GPT-4 and GPT-4o, have shown exceptional performance, especially in languages with abundant resources like English, thanks to extensive datasets that ensure robust training. Conversely, these models exhibit limitations when processing under-resourced languages such as Chinese and Korean, where issues including hallucinatory responses remain prevalent. This paper traces the roots of these disparities to the tokenization process inherent to these models. Specifically, it explores how the tokenizers vocabulary, often used to speed up the tokenization process and reduce tokens but constructed independently of the actual model training data, inadequately represents non-English languages. This misrepresentation results in the propagation of under-trained or untrained tokens, which perpetuate biases and pose serious concerns related to data security and ethical standards. We aim to dissect the tokenization mechanics of GPT-4o, illustrating how its simplified token-handling methods amplify these risks and offer strategic solutions to mitigate associated security and ethical issues. Through this study, we emphasize the critical need to rethink tokenization frameworks to foster more equitable and secure AI technologies.

Due to their training on internet-sourced datasets, LLMs can sometimes generate objectionable content, necessitating extensive alignment with human feedback to avoid such outputs. Despite massive alignment efforts, LLMs remain susceptible to adversarial jailbreak attacks, which usually are manipulated prompts designed to circumvent safety mechanisms and elicit harmful responses. Here, we introduce a novel approach, Directed Rrepresentation Optimization Jailbreak (DROJ), which optimizes jailbreak prompts at the embedding level to shift the hidden representations of harmful queries towards directions that are more likely to elicit affirmative responses from the model. Our evaluations on LLaMA-2-7b-chat model show that DROJ achieves a 100\% keyword-based Attack Success Rate (ASR), effectively preventing direct refusals. However, the model occasionally produces repetitive and non-informative responses. To mitigate this, we introduce a helpfulness system prompt that enhances the utility of the model's responses. Our code is available at https://github.com/Leon-Leyang/LLM-Safeguard.</p></details> |  |

Code-mixing introduces unique challenges in daily life, such as syntactic mismatches and semantic blending, that are rarely encountered in monolingual settings. Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized the field of natural language processing (NLP) by offering unprecedented capabilities in understanding human languages. However, the effectiveness of current state-of-the-art multilingual LLMs has not yet been fully explored in the CM scenario. To fill this gap, we first benchmark the performance of multilingual LLMs on various code-mixing NLP tasks. Then we propose to improve the multilingual LLMs' ability to understand code-mixing through reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) and code-mixed machine translation tasks. Given the high-cost and time-consuming preference labeling procedure, we improve this by utilizing LLMs as annotators to perform the reinforcement learning from AI feedback (RLAIF). The experiments show the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p></details> | <details><summary>initi...</summary><p>initial version: 5 pages, 2 figures</p></details> |

However, the complexity of such systems and the nature of LLMs challenge such a vision. It is unlikely that the solution to such challenges will come from the Artificial Intelligence (AI) community itself. Instead, the Systems Engineering approach is better equipped to facilitate the adoption of LLMs by prioritising the problems and their context before any other aspects. This paper introduces the challenges LLMs generate and surveys systems research efforts for engineering AI-based systems. We reveal how the systems engineering principles have supported addressing similar issues to the ones LLMs pose and discuss our findings to provide future directions for adopting LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted for the upcoming 58th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences (HICSS-58)</p></details> |

However, there is a shortage of large-scale, real-world datasets available for benchmarking anomaly detection methods. To address this gap, we introduce a new high-dimensional dataset from IBM Cloud, collected over 4.5 months from the IBM Cloud Console. This dataset comprises 39,365 rows and 117,448 columns of telemetry data. Additionally, we demonstrate the application of machine learning models for anomaly detection and discuss the key challenges faced in this process. This study and the accompanying dataset provide a resource for researchers and practitioners in cloud system monitoring. It facilitates more efficient testing of anomaly detection methods in real-world data, helping to advance the development of robust solutions to maintain the health and performance of large-scale cloud infrastructures.</p></details> |  |

However, their deployment in multi-robot systems remains fragmented and struggles to handle complex task dependencies and parallel execution. This study introduces the DART-LLM (Dependency-Aware Multi-Robot Task Decomposition and Execution using Large Language Models) system, designed to address these challenges. DART-LLM utilizes LLMs to parse natural language instructions, decomposing them into multiple subtasks with dependencies to establish complex task sequences, thereby enhancing efficient coordination and parallel execution in multi-robot systems. The system includes the QA LLM module, Breakdown Function modules, Actuation module, and a Vision-Language Model (VLM)-based object detection module, enabling task decomposition and execution from natural language instructions to robotic actions. Experimental results demonstrate that DART-LLM excels in handling long-horizon tasks and collaborative tasks with complex dependencies. Even when using smaller models like Llama 3.1 8B, the system achieves good performance, highlighting DART-LLM's robustness in terms of model size.

| **[Defending Large Language Models Against Attacks With Residual Stream Activation Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03230v4)** | 2024-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs), exemplified by OpenAI's ChatGPT, brings to the forefront the imperative to defend against adversarial threats on these models. These attacks, which manipulate an LLM's output by introducing malicious inputs, undermine the model's integrity and the trust users place in its outputs. In response to this challenge, our paper presents an innovative defensive strategy, given white box access to an LLM, that harnesses residual activation analysis between transformer layers of the LLM. We apply a novel methodology for analyzing distinctive activation patterns in the residual streams for attack prompt classification. We curate multiple datasets to demonstrate how this method of classification has high accuracy across multiple types of attack scenarios, including our newly-created attack dataset. Furthermore, we enhance the model's resilience by integrating safety fine-tuning techniques for LLMs in order to measure its effect on our capability to detect attacks. The results underscore the effectiveness of our approach in enhancing the detection and mitigation of adversarial inputs, advancing the security framework within which LLMs operate.</p></details> |  |

Designed as a task-agnostic model, LWM generates universal, rich, contextualized channel embeddings (features) that potentially enhance performance across a wide range of downstream tasks in wireless communication and sensing systems. Towards this objective, LWM, which has a transformer-based architecture, was pre-trained in a self-supervised manner on large-scale wireless channel datasets. Our results show consistent improvements in classification and regression tasks when using the LWM embeddings compared to raw channel representations, especially in scenarios with high-complexity machine learning tasks and limited training datasets.

These works typically claim that such domain-adaptive pretraining (DAPT) improves performance on downstream medical tasks, such as answering medical licensing exam questions. In this paper, we compare ten public "medical" LLMs and two VLMs against their corresponding base models, arriving at a different conclusion: all medical VLMs and nearly all medical LLMs fail to consistently improve over their base models in the zero-/few-shot prompting and supervised fine-tuning regimes for medical question-answering (QA). For instance, across all tasks and model pairs we consider in the 3-shot setting, medical LLMs only outperform their base models in 22.7% of cases, reach a (statistical) tie in 36.8% of cases, and are significantly worse than their base models in the remaining 40.5% of cases. Our conclusions are based on (i) comparing each medical model head-to-head, directly against the corresponding base model; (ii) optimizing the prompts for each model separately in zero-/few-shot prompting; and (iii) accounting for statistical uncertainty in comparisons. While these basic practices are not consistently adopted in the literature, our ablations show that they substantially impact conclusions. Meanwhile, we find that after fine-tuning on specific QA tasks, medical LLMs can show performance improvements, but the benefits do not carry over to tasks based on clinical notes. Our findings suggest that state-of-the-art general-domain models may already exhibit strong medical knowledge and reasoning capabilities, and offer recommendations to strengthen the conclusions of future studies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exten...</summary><p>Extended version of EMNLP 2024 paper arXiv:2411.04118.

| **[Quantifying and Mitigating Unimodal Biases in Multimodal Large Language Models: A Causal Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18346v4)** | 2024-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have facilitated the development of Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs). Despite their impressive capabilities, MLLMs often suffer from over-reliance on unimodal biases (e.g., language bias and vision bias), leading to incorrect answers or hallucinations in complex multimodal tasks. To investigate this issue, we propose a causal framework to interpret the biases in Visual Question Answering (VQA) problems. Within this framework, we conduct an in-depth causal analysis to assess the causal effect of these biases on MLLM predictions. Based on the analysis, we introduce 1) a novel MORE dataset with 12,000 challenging VQA instances requiring multi-hop reasoning and overcoming unimodal biases. 2) a causality-enhanced agent framework CAVE that guides models to comprehensively integrate information from different modalities and mitigate biases. Our experiments show that MLLMs perform poorly on MORE, indicating strong unimodal biases and limited semantic understanding. However, when integrated with our CAVE, promising improvements in reasoning and bias mitigation can be seen. These findings provide important insights for the development of more robust MLLMs and contribute to the broader goal of advancing multimodal AI systems capable of deeper understanding and reasoning.

In many practical applications, such as medical diagnosis and troubleshooting, the information needed to solve the task is not initially given and has to be actively sought by asking follow-up questions (for example, a doctor asking a patient for more details about their symptoms). In this work, we introduce Uncertainty of Thoughts (UoT), an algorithm to augment large language models with the ability to actively seek information by asking effective questions. UoT combines 1) an *uncertainty-aware simulation approach* which enables the model to simulate possible future scenarios and how likely they are to occur, 2) *uncertainty-based rewards* motivated by information gain which incentivizes the model to seek information, and 3) a *reward propagation scheme* to select the optimal question to ask in a way that maximizes the expected reward. In experiments on medical diagnosis, troubleshooting, and the `20 Questions` game, UoT achieves an average performance improvement of 38.1% in the rate of successful task completion across multiple LLMs compared with direct prompting and also improves efficiency (i.e., the number of questions needed to complete the task).

In this work, we present Chinese SimpleQA, the first comprehensive Chinese benchmark to evaluate the factuality ability of language models to answer short questions, and Chinese SimpleQA mainly has five properties (i.e., Chinese, Diverse, High-quality, Static, Easy-to-evaluate). Specifically, first, we focus on the Chinese language over 6 major topics with 99 diverse subtopics. Second, we conduct a comprehensive quality control process to achieve high-quality questions and answers, where the reference answers are static and cannot be changed over time. Third, following SimpleQA, the questions and answers are very short, and the grading process is easy-to-evaluate based on OpenAI API. Based on Chinese SimpleQA, we perform a comprehensive evaluation on the factuality abilities of existing LLMs. Finally, we hope that Chinese SimpleQA could guide the developers to better understand the Chinese factuality abilities of their models and facilitate the growth of foundation models.</p></details> |  |

Compared to most studies that focus on continuous speech features, although discrete-token based LLMs have shown promising results on certain tasks, the performance gap between these two paradigms is rarely explored. In this paper, we present a fair and thorough comparison between discrete and continuous features across a variety of semantic-related tasks using a light-weight LLM (Qwen1.5-0.5B). Our findings reveal that continuous features generally outperform discrete tokens, particularly in tasks requiring fine-grained semantic understanding. Moreover, this study goes beyond surface-level comparison by identifying key factors behind the under-performance of discrete tokens, such as limited token granularity and inefficient information retention. To enhance the performance of discrete tokens, we explore potential aspects based on our analysis. We hope our results can offer new insights into the opportunities for advancing discrete speech tokens in Speech LLMs.</p></details> | 5 tables, 4 figures |

The traditional way of relying on manual search for materials science-related information is now using artificial intelligence technology as an auxiliary tool to improve the efficiency of materials science research. To accelerate researchers' knowledge acquisition and intelligent decision-making support in materials science research, this paper proposes a large language model Polymetis model for a variety of materials fields, aiming to provide highly professional knowledge answers in the field of materials, covering energy materials, functional materials, alloy materials, physical chemistry, biology, and other material directions. The model uses a dataset of about 2 million material knowledge instructions, and in the process of building the dataset, we developed the Intelligent Extraction Large Model (IELM), which is specially used to extract and form structured knowledge from scientific texts, avoiding a large number of costs that need to be manually annotated, and improving efficiency. We inject this data into the GLM4-9B model for learning to enhance its inference capabilities in a variety of material domains. In addition, we have introduced enhanced prompt strategies to ensure that the answers to the model are more organized and comprehensive, providing efficient and comprehensive intelligent support for the diverse needs of materials science exploration, and promoting the development of material science.</p></details> |  |

We propose a link prediction framework for KGs named Enrichment-Driven GrAph Reasoner (EDGAR), which infers new edges by mining entity-local rules. This approach leverages enrichment analysis, a well-established statistical method used to identify mechanisms common to sets of differentially expressed genes. EDGAR's inference results are inherently explainable and rankable, with p-values indicating the statistical significance of each enrichment-based rule. We demonstrate the framework's effectiveness on a large-scale biomedical KG, ROBOKOP, focusing on drug repurposing for Alzheimer disease (AD) as a case study. Initially, we extracted 14 known drugs from the KG and identified 20 contextual biomarkers through enrichment analysis, revealing functional pathways relevant to shared drug efficacy for AD. Subsequently, using the top 1000 enrichment results, our system identified 1246 additional drug candidates for AD treatment. The top 10 candidates were validated using evidence from medical literature. EDGAR is deployed within ROBOKOP, complete with a web user interface.

In particular, we mainly offer two multiple testing procedures designed to control the false discovery rate (FDR). The first procedure is based on the limiting normal distribution of the $t$-statistics with the debiased lasso estimator. The second procedure is its bootstrap version. We also provide a robustification of the first procedure against any cross-sectional dependence using asymptotic e-variables. Their theoretical properties, including FDR control and power guarantee, are investigated. The finite sample evidence suggests that both procedures can successfully control the FDR while maintaining high power. Finally, the proposed methods are applied to discovering the network Granger causality in a large number of macroeconomic variables and regional house prices in the UK.</p></details> |  |

Modern CDCL solvers, such as MiniSat and Kissat, commonly incorporate several heuristics and select one to use according to simple rules, requiring significant time and expert effort to fine-tune in practice. The pervasion of Large Language Models (LLMs) provides a potential solution to address this issue. However, generating a CDCL solver from scratch is not effective due to the complexity and context volume of SAT solvers. Instead, we propose AutoSAT, a framework that automatically optimizes heuristics in a pre-defined modular search space based on existing CDCL solvers. Unlike existing automated algorithm design approaches focusing on hyperparameter tuning and operator selection, AutoSAT can generate new efficient heuristics. In this first attempt at optimizing SAT solvers using LLMs, several strategies including the greedy hill climber and (1+1) Evolutionary Algorithm are employed to guide LLMs to search for better heuristics. Experimental results demonstrate that LLMs can generally enhance the performance of CDCL solvers. A realization of AutoSAT outperforms MiniSat on 9 out of 12 datasets and even surpasses the state-of-the-art hybrid solver Kissat on 4 datasets.</p></details> |  |

They are also typically lighter and cheaper to manufacture. However, their use in real-world applications is limited due to modeling challenges and difficulties in integrating effective proprioceptive sensors. Large-scale soft robots ($\approx$ two meters in length) have greater modeling complexity due to increased inertia and related effects of gravity. Common efforts to ease these modeling difficulties such as assuming simple kinematic and dynamics models also limit the general capabilities of soft robots and are not applicable in tasks requiring fast, dynamic motion like throwing and hammering. To overcome these challenges, we propose a data-efficient Bayesian optimization-based approach for learning control policies for dynamic tasks on a large-scale soft robot. Our approach optimizes the task objective function directly from commanded pressures, without requiring approximate kinematics or dynamics as an intermediate step. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through both simulated and real-world experiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 5 figures, Proceedings of the International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)</p></details> |

Unlike prior methods, this subset is not fixed in location but rather which parameters are modified evolves over the course of training. This dynamic parameter selection can yield good performance with many fewer parameters than extant methods. Our method enables a seamless scaling of the subset size across an arbitrary proportion of the total model size, while popular PET approaches like prompt tuning and LoRA cover only a small part of this spectrum. We match or outperform prompt tuning and LoRA in most cases on a variety of NLP tasks (MT, QA, GSM8K, SuperGLUE) for a given parameter budget across different model families and sizes.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2024 Workshop on Adaptive Foundation Models</p></details> |

A Mechanistic Analysis to Self-correction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20513v2)** | 2024-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Though intensive attentions to the self-correction capability of Large Language Models (LLMs), the underlying mechanism of this capability is still under-explored. In this paper, we aim to answer two fundamental questions for moral self-correction: (1) how different components in self-correction, such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, external feedback, and instructional prompts, interact to enable moral self-correction; and (2) is the self-correction one of LLMs' innate capabilities? To answer the first question, we examine how different self-correction components interact to intervene the embedded morality within hidden states, therefore contributing to different performance. For the second question, we (i) evaluate the robustness of moral self-correction by introducing natural language interventions of weak evidence into prompts; (ii) propose a validation framework, self-distinguish, that requires effective self-correction to enable LLMs to distinguish between desirable and undesirable outputs. Our experimental results indicate that there is no universally optimal self-correction method for the tasks considered, although external feedback and CoT can contribute to additional performance gains. However, our mechanistic analysis reveals negative interactions among instructional prompts, CoT, and external feedback, suggesting a conflict between internal knowledge and external feedback. The self-distinguish experiments demonstrate that while LLMs can self-correct their responses, they are unable to reliably distinguish between desired and undesired outputs. With our empirical evidence, we can conclude that moral self-correction is not an innate capability of LLMs acquired during pretraining.</p></details> |  |

Recently, the appearance of Large Language Models (LLMs) has gained lots of attraction in research fields. They have shown powerful zero-shot and in-context learning abilities on several NLP tasks, but their potential on TFV is still unknown. In this work, we implement a preliminary study about whether LLMs are table-based fact-checkers. In detail, we design diverse prompts to explore how the in-context learning can help LLMs in TFV, i.e., zero-shot and few-shot TFV capability. Besides, we carefully design and construct TFV instructions to study the performance gain brought by the instruction tuning of LLMs. Experimental results demonstrate that LLMs can achieve acceptable results on zero-shot and few-shot TFV with prompt engineering, while instruction-tuning can stimulate the TFV capability significantly. We also make some valuable findings about the format of zero-shot prompts and the number of in-context examples. Finally, we analyze some possible directions to promote the accuracy of TFV via LLMs, which is beneficial to further research of table reasoning.</p></details> | CSCWD 2024 |
| **[LogLLM: Log-based Anomaly Detection Using Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08561v1)** | 2024-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Software systems often record important runtime information in logs to help with troubleshooting. Log-based anomaly detection has become a key research area that aims to identify system issues through log data, ultimately enhancing the reliability of software systems. Traditional deep learning methods often struggle to capture the semantic information embedded in log data, which is typically organized in natural language. In this paper, we propose LogLLM, a log-based anomaly detection framework that leverages large language models (LLMs). LogLLM employs BERT for extracting semantic vectors from log messages, while utilizing Llama, a transformer decoder-based model, for classifying log sequences. Additionally, we introduce a projector to align the vector representation spaces of BERT and Llama, ensuring a cohesive understanding of log semantics. Unlike conventional methods that require log parsers to extract templates, LogLLM preprocesses log messages with regular expressions, streamlining the entire process. Our framework is trained through a novel three-stage procedure designed to enhance performance and adaptability. Experimental results across four public datasets demonstrate that LogLLM outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Even when handling unstable logs, it effectively captures the semantic meaning of log messages and detects anomalies accurately.</p></details> |  |
| **[Neural Topic Modeling with Large Language Models in the Loop](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08534v1)** | 2024-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Topic modeling is a fundamental task in natural language processing, allowing the discovery of latent thematic structures in text corpora. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated promising capabilities in topic discovery, their direct application to topic modeling suffers from issues such as incomplete topic coverage, misalignment of topics, and inefficiency. To address these limitations, we propose LLM-ITL, a novel LLM-in-the-loop framework that integrates LLMs with many existing Neural Topic Models (NTMs). In LLM-ITL, global topics and document representations are learned through the NTM, while an LLM refines the topics via a confidence-weighted Optimal Transport (OT)-based alignment objective. This process enhances the interpretability and coherence of the learned topics, while maintaining the efficiency of NTMs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LLM-ITL can help NTMs significantly improve their topic interpretability while maintaining the quality of document representation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Target-driven Attack for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07268v2)** | 2024-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current large language models (LLM) provide a strong foundation for large-scale user-oriented natural language tasks. Many users can easily inject adversarial text or instructions through the user interface, thus causing LLM model security challenges like the language model not giving the correct answer. Although there is currently a large amount of research on black-box attacks, most of these black-box attacks use random and heuristic strategies. It is unclear how these strategies relate to the success rate of attacks and thus effectively improve model robustness. To solve this problem, we propose our target-driven black-box attack method to maximize the KL divergence between the conditional probabilities of the clean text and the attack text to redefine the attack's goal. We transform the distance maximization problem into two convex optimization problems based on the attack goal to solve the attack text and estimate the covariance. Furthermore, the projected gradient descent algorithm solves the vector corresponding to the attack text. Our target-driven black-box attack approach includes two attack strategies: token manipulation and misinformation attack. Experimental results on multiple Large Language Models and datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our attack method.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 7 figures.

Despite the impressive capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in advancing the natural language understanding frontier, their application to large-scale tabular data presents significant challenges, specifically regarding table size and complex intricate relationships. Existing works have shown promise with small-scale tables but often flounder when tasked with the complex reasoning required by larger, interconnected tables found in real-world scenarios. To address this gap, we introduce "Tree-of-Table", a novel approach designed to enhance LLMs' reasoning capabilities over large and complex tables. Our method employs Table Condensation and Decomposition to distill and reorganize relevant data into a manageable format, followed by the construction of a hierarchical Table-Tree that facilitates tree-structured reasoning. Through a meticulous Table-Tree Execution process, we systematically unravel the tree-structured reasoning chain to derive the solutions. Experiments across diverse datasets, including WikiTQ, TableFact, FeTaQA, and BIRD, demonstrate that Tree-of-Table sets a new benchmark with superior performance, showcasing remarkable efficiency and generalization capabilities in large-scale table reasoning.</p></details> |  |

However, text generation for languages other than English often faces significant challenges, including poor generation quality and reduced computational performance due to the disproportionate representation of tokens in the model's vocabulary. In this work, we address these issues by developing a pipeline for adapting English-oriented pre-trained models to other languages and constructing efficient bilingual LLMs. Using this pipeline, we construct Vikhr, a state-of-the-art bilingual open-source instruction-following LLM designed specifically for the Russian language. "Vikhr" refers to the name of the Mistral LLM series and means a "strong gust of wind." Unlike previous Russian-language models that typically rely on LoRA adapters on top of English-oriented models, sacrificing performance for lower training costs, Vikhr features an adapted tokenizer vocabulary and undergoes continued pre-training and instruction tuning of all weights. This not only enhances the model's performance but also significantly improves its computational and contextual efficiency. The remarkable performance of Vikhr across various Russian-language benchmarks can also be attributed to our efforts in expanding instruction datasets and corpora for continued pre-training. Vikhr not only sets a new state of the art among open-source LLMs for Russian but even outperforms some proprietary closed-source models on certain benchmarks. The model weights, instruction sets, and code are publicly available.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at WMRL @ EMNLP-2024</p></details> |

While Large Language Models (LLMs) perform exceptionally well in generating accurate outputs, their "black box" nature poses significant challenges to transparency and trust. To address this, the paper proposes the TranspNet pipeline, which integrates symbolic AI with LLMs. By leveraging domain expert knowledge, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and formal reasoning frameworks like Answer Set Programming (ASP), TranspNet enhances LLM outputs with structured reasoning and verification. This approach ensures that AI systems deliver not only accurate but also explainable and trustworthy results, meeting regulatory demands for transparency and accountability. TranspNet provides a comprehensive solution for developing AI systems that are reliable and interpretable, making it suitable for real-world applications where trust is critical.</p></details> |  |

However, when applied to database technologies, specifically query generation for graph databases and Knowledge Graphs (KGs), LLMs still face significant challenges. While research on LLM-driven query generation for Structured Query Language (SQL) exists, similar systems for graph databases remain underdeveloped. This paper presents a comparative study addressing the challenge of generating Cypher queries a powerful language for interacting with graph databases using open-access LLMs. We rigorously evaluate several LLM agents (OpenAI ChatGPT 4o, Claude Sonnet 3.5, Google Gemini Pro 1.5, and a locally deployed Llama 3.1 8B) using a designed few-shot learning prompt and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) backed by Chain-of-Thoughts (CoT) reasoning. Our empirical analysis of query generation accuracy reveals that Claude Sonnet 3.5 outperforms its counterparts in this specific domain. Further, we highlight promising future research directions to address the identified limitations and advance LLM-driven query generation for graph databases.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper accepted and will be presented at CSCI2024 in December 2024, Later will be published at Springer LNCS</p></details> |

We incorporate four optimizations; Multi-Query, Child-Parent-Retriever, Ensemble Retriever, and In-Context-Learning, to enhance the functionality and performance in the academic domain. We focus on data retrieval, specifically targeting various study programs at a large technical university. We additionally introduce a novel evaluation approach, the RAG Confusion Matrix designed to assess the effectiveness of various configurations within the RAG framework. By exploring the integration of both open-source (e.g., Llama2, Mistral) and closed-source (GPT-3.5 and GPT-4) Large Language Models, we offer valuable insights into the application and optimization of RAG frameworks in domain-specific contexts. Our experiments show a significant performance increase when including multi-query in the retrieval phase.</p></details> |  |
| **[DAGER: Exact Gradient Inversion for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15586v2)** | 2024-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated learning works by aggregating locally computed gradients from multiple clients, thus enabling collaborative training without sharing private client data. However, prior work has shown that the data can actually be recovered by the server using so-called gradient inversion attacks. While these attacks perform well when applied on images, they are limited in the text domain and only permit approximate reconstruction of small batches and short input sequences. In this work, we propose DAGER, the first algorithm to recover whole batches of input text exactly. DAGER leverages the low-rank structure of self-attention layer gradients and the discrete nature of token embeddings to efficiently check if a given token sequence is part of the client data. We use this check to exactly recover full batches in the honest-but-curious setting without any prior on the data for both encoder- and decoder-based architectures using exhaustive heuristic search and a greedy approach, respectively. We provide an efficient GPU implementation of DAGER and show experimentally that it recovers full batches of size up to 128 on large language models (LLMs), beating prior attacks in speed (20x at same batch size), scalability (10x larger batches), and reconstruction quality (ROUGE-1/2 > 0.99).</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhanced Classroom Dialogue Sequences Analysis with a Hybrid AI Agent: Merging Expert Rule-Base with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08418v1)** | 2024-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Classroom dialogue plays a crucial role in fostering student engagement and deeper learning. However, analysing dialogue sequences has traditionally relied on either theoretical frameworks or empirical descriptions of practice, with limited integration between the two. This study addresses this gap by developing a comprehensive rule base of dialogue sequences and an Artificial Intelligence (AI) agent that combines expert-informed rule-based systems with a large language model (LLM). The agent applies expert knowledge while adapting to the complexities of natural language, enabling accurate and flexible categorisation of classroom dialogue sequences. By synthesising findings from over 30 studies, we established a comprehensive framework for dialogue analysis. The agent was validated against human expert coding, achieving high levels of precision and reliability. The results demonstrate that the agent provides theory-grounded and adaptive functions, tremendously enhancing the efficiency and scalability of classroom dialogue analysis, offering significant potential in improving classroom teaching practices and supporting teacher professional development.</p></details> |  |

Unlike conventional query optimization techniques used in RAG, the ERRR framework begins by extracting parametric knowledge from LLMs, followed by using a specialized query optimizer for refining these queries. This process ensures the retrieval of only the most pertinent information essential for generating accurate responses. Moreover, to enhance flexibility and reduce computational costs, we propose a trainable scheme for our pipeline that utilizes a smaller, tunable model as the query optimizer, which is refined through knowledge distillation from a larger teacher model. Our evaluations on various question-answering (QA) datasets and with different retrieval systems show that ERRR consistently outperforms existing baselines, proving to be a versatile and cost-effective module for improving the utility and accuracy of RAG systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Responsible AI in Construction Safety: Systematic Evaluation of Large Language Models and Prompt Engineering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08320v1)** | 2024-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Construction remains one of the most hazardous sectors. Recent advancements in AI, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), offer promising opportunities for enhancing workplace safety. However, responsible integration of LLMs requires systematic evaluation, as deploying them without understanding their capabilities and limitations risks generating inaccurate information, fostering misplaced confidence, and compromising worker safety. This study evaluates the performance of two widely used LLMs, GPT-3.5 and GPT-4o, across three standardized exams administered by the Board of Certified Safety Professionals (BCSP). Using 385 questions spanning seven safety knowledge areas, the study analyzes the models' accuracy, consistency, and reliability. Results show that both models consistently exceed the BCSP benchmark, with GPT-4o achieving an accuracy rate of 84.6% and GPT-3.5 reaching 73.8%. Both models demonstrate strengths in safety management systems and hazard identification and control, but exhibit weaknesses in science, mathematics, emergency response, and fire prevention. An error analysis identifies four primary limitations affecting LLM performance: lack of knowledge, reasoning flaws, memory issues, and calculation errors. Our study also highlights the impact of prompt engineering strategies, with variations in accuracy reaching 13.5% for GPT-3.5 and 7.9% for GPT-4o. However, no single prompt configuration proves universally effective. This research advances knowledge in three ways: by identifying areas where LLMs can support safety practices and where human oversight remains essential, by offering practical insights into improving LLM implementation through prompt engineering, and by providing evidence-based direction for future research and development. These contributions support the responsible integration of AI in construction safety management toward achieving zero injuries.</p></details> | 29 pages, 5 figures |

This paper reports on the results of a large-scale evaluation (the TREC 2024 RAG Track) where four different relevance assessment approaches were deployed in situ: the "standard" fully manual process that NIST has implemented for decades and three different alternatives that take advantage of LLMs to different extents using the open-source UMBRELA tool. This setup allows us to correlate system rankings induced by the different approaches to characterize tradeoffs between cost and quality. We find that in terms of nDCG@20, nDCG@100, and Recall@100, system rankings induced by automatically generated relevance assessments from UMBRELA correlate highly with those induced by fully manual assessments across a diverse set of 77 runs from 19 teams. Our results suggest that automatically generated UMBRELA judgments can replace fully manual judgments to accurately capture run-level effectiveness. Surprisingly, we find that LLM assistance does not appear to increase correlation with fully manual assessments, suggesting that costs associated with human-in-the-loop processes do not bring obvious tangible benefits. Overall, human assessors appear to be stricter than UMBRELA in applying relevance criteria. Our work validates the use of LLMs in academic TREC-style evaluations and provides the foundation for future studies.</p></details> |  |

However, when applied to scientific research, these powerful models exhibit critical failure modes related to scientific integrity and trustworthiness. Existing general-purpose LLM guardrails are insufficient to address these unique challenges in the scientific domain. We provide comprehensive guidelines for deploying LLM guardrails in the scientific domain. We identify specific challenges -- including time sensitivity, knowledge contextualization, conflict resolution, and intellectual property concerns -- and propose a guideline framework for the guardrails that can align with scientific needs. These guardrail dimensions include trustworthiness, ethics & bias, safety, and legal aspects. We also outline in detail the implementation strategies that employ white-box, black-box, and gray-box methodologies that can be enforced within scientific contexts.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches typically involve fine-tuning LLMs with synthetic data, which depends on annotations from human experts or advanced models like GPT-4, thus restricting further advancements. To address this issue, we investigate the potential for LLMs to self-improve in long-context reasoning and propose \ours, an approach specifically designed for this purpose. This approach is straightforward: we sample multiple outputs for each question, score them with Minimum Bayes Risk, and then apply supervised fine-tuning or preference optimization based on these outputs. Extensive experiments on several leading LLMs demonstrate the effectiveness of \ours, with an absolute improvement of $4.2$ points for Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct. Furthermore, \ours achieves superior performance compared to prior approaches that depend on data produced by human experts or advanced models. We anticipate that this work will open new avenues for self-improvement techniques in long-context scenarios, which are essential for the continual advancement of LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://github.com/SihengLi99/SEALONG</p></details> |

With additional execution-based feedback, these models can act as agents with capabilities to self-refine and improve generated code autonomously. However, on challenging coding tasks with extremely large search space, current agentic approaches still struggle with multi-stage planning, generating, and debugging. To address this problem, we propose CodeTree, a framework for LLM agents to efficiently explore the search space in different stages of the code generation process. Specifically, we adopted a unified tree structure to explicitly explore different coding strategies, generate corresponding coding solutions, and subsequently refine the solutions. In each stage, critical decision-making (ranking, termination, expanding) of the exploration process is guided by both the environmental execution-based feedback and LLM-agent-generated feedback. We comprehensively evaluated CodeTree on 7 code generation benchmarks and demonstrated the significant performance gains of CodeTree against strong baselines. Using GPT-4o as the base model, we consistently achieved top results of 95.1 on HumanEval, 98.7 on MBPP, and 43.0 on CodeContests. On the challenging SWEBench benchmark, our approach led to significant performance gains.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning with Less: Knowledge Distillation from Large Language Models via Unlabeled Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08028v1)** | 2024-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In real-world NLP applications, Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promising solutions due to their extensive training on vast datasets. However, the large size and high computation demands of LLMs limit their practicality in many applications, especially when further fine-tuning is required. To address these limitations, smaller models are typically preferred for deployment. However, their training is hindered by the scarcity of labeled data. In contrast, unlabeled data is often readily which can be leveraged by using LLMs to generate pseudo-labels for training smaller models. This enables the smaller models (student) to acquire knowledge from LLMs(teacher) while reducing computational costs. This process introduces challenges, such as potential noisy pseudo-labels. Selecting high-quality and informative data is therefore critical to enhance model performance while improving the efficiency of data utilization. To address this, we propose LLKD that enables Learning with Less computational resources and less data for Knowledge Distillation from LLMs. LLKD is an adaptive sample selection method that incorporates signals from both the teacher and student. Specifically, it prioritizes samples where the teacher demonstrates high confidence in its labeling, indicating reliable labels, and where the student exhibits a high information need, identifying challenging samples that require further learning. Our comprehensive experiments show that LLKD achieves superior performance across various datasets with higher data efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLMPhy: Complex Physical Reasoning Using Large Language Models and World Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08027v1)** | 2024-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Physical reasoning is an important skill needed for robotic agents when operating in the real world. However, solving such reasoning problems often involves hypothesizing and reflecting over complex multi-body interactions under the effect of a multitude of physical forces and thus learning all such interactions poses a significant hurdle for state-of-the-art machine learning frameworks, including large language models (LLMs). To study this problem, we propose a new physical reasoning task and a dataset, dubbed TraySim. Our task involves predicting the dynamics of several objects on a tray that is given an external impact -- the domino effect of the ensued object interactions and their dynamics thus offering a challenging yet controlled setup, with the goal of reasoning being to infer the stability of the objects after the impact. To solve this complex physical reasoning task, we present LLMPhy, a zero-shot black-box optimization framework that leverages the physics knowledge and program synthesis abilities of LLMs, and synergizes these abilities with the world models built into modern physics engines. Specifically, LLMPhy uses an LLM to generate code to iteratively estimate the physical hyperparameters of the system (friction, damping, layout, etc.) via an implicit analysis-by-synthesis approach using a (non-differentiable) simulator in the loop and uses the inferred parameters to imagine the dynamics of the scene towards solving the reasoning task. To show the effectiveness of LLMPhy, we present experiments on our TraySim dataset to predict the steady-state poses of the objects. Our results show that the combination of the LLM and the physics engine leads to state-of-the-art zero-shot physical reasoning performance, while demonstrating superior convergence against standard black-box optimization methods and better estimation of the physical parameters.</p></details> |  |

We investigate this attribution problem using formal language theory, specifically language identification in the limit as introduced by Gold and extended by Angluin. By modeling LLM outputs as formal languages, we analyze whether finite text samples can uniquely pinpoint the originating model. Our results show that due to the non-identifiability of certain language classes, under some mild assumptions about overlapping outputs from fine-tuned models it is theoretically impossible to attribute outputs to specific LLMs with certainty. This holds also when accounting for expressivity limitations of Transformer architectures. Even with direct model access or comprehensive monitoring, significant computational hurdles impede attribution efforts. These findings highlight an urgent need for proactive measures to mitigate risks posed by adversarial LLM use as their influence continues to expand.</p></details> | 7 pages, 1 figure |
| **[Derivational Morphology Reveals Analogical Generalization in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07990v1)** | 2024-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>What mechanisms underlie linguistic generalization in large language models (LLMs)? This question has attracted considerable attention, with most studies analyzing the extent to which the language skills of LLMs resemble rules. As of yet, it is not known whether linguistic generalization in LLMs could equally well be explained as the result of analogical processes, which can be formalized as similarity operations on stored exemplars. A key shortcoming of prior research is its focus on linguistic phenomena with a high degree of regularity, for which rule-based and analogical approaches make the same predictions. Here, we instead examine derivational morphology, specifically English adjective nominalization, which displays notable variability. We introduce a new method for investigating linguistic generalization in LLMs: focusing on GPT-J, we fit cognitive models that instantiate rule-based and analogical learning to the LLM training data and compare their predictions on a set of nonce adjectives with those of the LLM, allowing us to draw direct conclusions regarding underlying mechanisms. As expected, rule-based and analogical models explain the predictions of GPT-J equally well for adjectives with regular nominalization patterns. However, for adjectives with variable nominalization patterns, the analogical model provides a much better match. Furthermore, GPT-J's behavior is sensitive to the individual word frequencies, even for regular forms, a behavior that is consistent with an analogical account of regular forms but not a rule-based one. These findings refute the hypothesis that GPT-J's linguistic generalization on adjective nominalization involves rules, suggesting similarity operations on stored exemplars as the underlying mechanism. Overall, our study suggests that analogical processes play a bigger role in the linguistic generalization of LLMs than previously thought.</p></details> |  |

This paper explores a self-training paradigm, where the LLM autonomously curates its own labels and selectively trains on unknown data samples identified through a reference-free consistency method. Empirical evaluations demonstrate significant improvements in reducing hallucination in generation across multiple subjects. Furthermore, the selective training framework mitigates catastrophic forgetting in out-of-distribution benchmarks, addressing a critical limitation in training LLMs. Our findings suggest that such an approach can substantially reduce the dependency on large labeled datasets, paving the way for more scalable and cost-effective language model training.</p></details> | EMNLP Findings 2024 |

This work addresses this gap by studying how LLMs acquire factual knowledge during pretraining. The findings reveal several important insights into the dynamics of factual knowledge acquisition during pretraining. First, counterintuitively, we observe that pretraining on more data shows no significant improvement in the model's capability to acquire and maintain factual knowledge. Next, there is a power-law relationship between training steps and forgetting of memorization and generalization of factual knowledge, and LLMs trained with duplicated training data exhibit faster forgetting. Third, training LLMs with larger batch sizes can enhance the models' robustness to forgetting. Overall, our observations suggest that factual knowledge acquisition in LLM pretraining occurs by progressively increasing the probability of factual knowledge presented in the pretraining data at each step. However, this increase is diluted by subsequent forgetting. Based on this interpretation, we demonstrate that we can provide plausible explanations for recently observed behaviors of LLMs, such as the poor performance of LLMs on long-tail knowledge and the benefits of deduplicating the pretraining corpus.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |

As with other software engineering artifacts, software models are subject to evolution. Supporting modelers in evolving software models with recommendations for model completions is still an open problem, though. In this paper, we explore the potential of large language models for this task. In particular, we propose an approach, RAMC, leveraging large language models, model histories, and retrieval-augmented generation for model completion. Through experiments on three datasets, including an industrial application, one public open-source community dataset, and one controlled collection of simulated model repositories, we evaluate the potential of large language models for model completion with RAMC. We found that large language models are indeed a promising technology for supporting software model evolution (62.30% semantically correct completions on real-world industrial data and up to 86.19% type-correct completions). The general inference capabilities of large language models are particularly useful when dealing with concepts for which there are few, noisy, or no examples at all.</p></details> |  |

We observe a similar behavior in large language models (LLMs), which we term "Verbosity Compensation" (VC). VC is harmful because it confuses the user understanding, leading to low efficiency, and influences the LLM services by increasing the latency and cost of generating useless tokens. In this paper, we present the first work that defines and analyzes Verbosity Compensation, explores its causes, and proposes a simple mitigating approach. We define Verbosity Compensation as the behavior of generating responses that can be compressed without information loss when prompted to write concisely. Our experiments, conducted on five datasets of knowledge and reasoning-based QA tasks with 14 newly developed LLMs, reveal three conclusions. 1) We reveal a pervasive presence of verbosity compensation across all models and all datasets. Notably, GPT-4 exhibits a VC frequency of 50.40%. 2) We reveal the large performance gap between verbose and concise responses, with a notable difference of 27.61% on the Qasper dataset. We also demonstrate that this difference does not naturally diminish as LLM capability increases. Both 1) and 2) highlight the urgent need to mitigate the frequency of VC behavior and disentangle verbosity with veracity. We propose a simple yet effective cascade algorithm that replaces the verbose responses with the other model-generated responses. The results show that our approach effectively alleviates the VC of the Mistral model from 63.81% to 16.16% on the Qasper dataset. 3) We also find that verbose responses exhibit higher uncertainty across all five datasets, suggesting a strong connection between verbosity and model uncertainty.

However, traditional models often struggle to scale effectively in the presence of large and heterogeneous populations. In this work, we introduce a discrete optimal transport framework designed to handle large-scale, heterogeneous target populations, characterized by type distributions. We address two scenarios: one where the type distribution of targets is known, and one where it is unknown. For the known distribution, we propose a fully distributed algorithm to achieve optimal resource allocation. In the case of unknown distribution, we develop a federated learning-based approach that enables efficient computation of the optimal transport scheme while preserving privacy. Case studies are provided to evaluate the performance of our learning algorithm.</p></details> |  |

While research showed that LLMs personalize outputs, a gap remains in understanding the linguistic features of their persuasive capabilities. We identified 13 linguistic features crucial for influencing personalities across different levels of the Big Five model of personality. We analyzed how prompts with personality trait information influenced the output of 19 LLMs across five model families. The findings show that models use more anxiety-related words for neuroticism, increase achievement-related words for conscientiousness, and employ fewer cognitive processes words for openness to experience. Some model families excel at adapting language for openness to experience, others for conscientiousness, while only one model adapts language for neuroticism. Our findings show how LLMs tailor responses based on personality cues in prompts, indicating their potential to create persuasive content affecting the mind and well-being of the recipients.</p></details> | 31 pages |

The limited numerical mapping makes the quantized model produce a non-trivial error, bringing out intolerable performance degration. This paper is anchored in the basic idea of model compression objectives, and delves into the layer-wise error distribution of LLMs during post-training quantization. Subsequently, we introduce ASER, an algorithm consisting of (1) Error Reconstruction: low-rank compensation for quantization error with LoRA-style matrices constructed by whitening SVD; (2) Activation Smoothing: outlier extraction to gain smooth activation and better error compensation. ASER is capable of quantizing typical LLMs to low-bit ones, particularly preserving accuracy even in W4A8 per-channel setup. Experimental results show that ASER is competitive among the state-of-the-art quantization algorithms, showing potential to activation quantization, with minor overhead.</p></details> |  |

This paper addresses the specific problem of biased pronoun usage in LLM outputs, particularly the inappropriate use of traditionally gendered pronouns ("he," "she") when inclusive language is needed to accurately represent all identities. We introduce a collaborative agent pipeline designed to mitigate these biases by analyzing and optimizing pronoun usage for inclusivity. Our multi-agent framework includes specialized agents for both bias detection and correction. Experimental evaluations using the Tango dataset-a benchmark focused on gender pronoun usage-demonstrate that our approach significantly improves inclusive pronoun classification, achieving a 32.6 percentage point increase over GPT-4o in correctly disagreeing with inappropriate traditionally gendered pronouns $(\chi^2 = 38.57, p < 0.0001)$. These results accentuate the potential of agent-driven frameworks in enhancing fairness and inclusivity in AI-generated content, demonstrating their efficacy in reducing biases and promoting socially responsible AI.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2024 Queer in AI Workshop</p></details> |

However, most LLMs only focus on general science, while they lack domain-specific knowledge, such as chemical molecules and amino acid sequences. To bridge these gaps, we introduce SciDFM, a mixture-of-experts LLM, which is trained from scratch and is able to conduct college-level scientific reasoning and understand molecules and amino acid sequences. We collect a large-scale training corpus containing numerous scientific papers and books from different disciplines as well as data from domain-specific databases. We further fine-tune the pre-trained model on lots of instruction data to improve performances on downstream benchmarks. From experiment results, we show that SciDFM achieves strong performance on general scientific benchmarks such as SciEval and SciQ, and it reaches a SOTA performance on domain-specific benchmarks among models of similar size. We further analyze the expert layers and show that the results of expert selection vary with data from different disciplines. To benefit the broader research community, we open-source SciDFM at https://huggingface.co/OpenDFM/SciDFM-MoE-A5.6B-v1.0.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 1 figure, 9 tables.

However, the key-value (KV) cache required for LLMs consumes substantial memory as context length increasing, becoming the bottleneck for deployment. In this paper, we present a strategy called SKVQ, which stands for sliding-window KV cache quantization, to address the issue of extremely low bitwidth KV cache quantization. To achieve this, SKVQ rearranges the channels of the KV cache in order to improve the similarity of channels in quantization groups, and applies clipped dynamic quantization at the group level. Additionally, SKVQ ensures that the most recent window tokens in the KV cache are preserved with high precision. This helps maintain the accuracy of a small but important portion of the KV cache.SKVQ achieves high compression ratios while maintaining accuracy. Our evaluation on LLMs demonstrates that SKVQ surpasses previous quantization approaches, allowing for quantization of the KV cache to 2-bit keys and 1.5-bit values with minimal loss of accuracy. With SKVQ, it is possible to process context lengths of up to 1M on an 80GB memory GPU for a 7b model and up to 7 times faster decoding.</p></details> |  |

However, it faces ambiguities problems where the same grapheme can represent multiple phonemes depending on contexts, posing a challenge for G2P conversion. Inspired by the remarkable success of Large Language Models (LLMs) in handling context-aware scenarios, contextual G2P conversion systems with LLMs' in-context knowledge retrieval (ICKR) capabilities are proposed to promote disambiguation capability. The efficacy of incorporating ICKR into G2P conversion systems is demonstrated thoroughly on the Librig2p dataset. In particular, the best contextual G2P conversion system using ICKR outperforms the baseline with weighted average phoneme error rate (PER) reductions of 2.0% absolute (28.9% relative).

Large language models (LLMs) have become a popular paradigm for sentiment analysis, leveraging multi-task learning to address specific tasks concurrently. However, LLMs with fine-tuning for sentiment analysis often underperforms due to the inherent challenges in managing diverse task complexities. Moreover, constant-weight approaches in multi-task learning struggle to adapt to variations in data characteristics, further complicating model effectiveness. To address these issues, we propose a novel multi-task learning framework with a dynamic adaptive optimization (DAO) module. This module is designed as a plug-and-play component that can be seamlessly integrated into existing models, providing an effective and flexible solution for multi-task learning. The key component of the DAO module is dynamic adaptive loss, which dynamically adjusts the weights assigned to different tasks based on their relative importance and data characteristics during training. Sentiment analyses on a standard and customized financial text dataset demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves superior performance. Specifically, this work improves the Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Accuracy (ACC) by 15.58% and 1.24% respectively, compared with previous work.</p></details> |  |

Intuitive solutions include improving the size and quality of data or using larger foundation models. They show effectiveness in mitigating these issues, but at an expensive cost of collecting a vast amount of new data and introducing a significantly larger model. Standing at the intersection of these approaches, we examine the three object-oriented problems from the perspective of the image-to-text mapping process by the multimodal connector. In this paper, we first identify the limitations of multimodal connectors stemming from insufficient training data. Driven by this, we propose to enhance the mapping with retrieval-augmented tag tokens, which contain rich object-aware information such as object names and attributes. With our Tag-grounded visual instruction tuning with retrieval Augmentation (TUNA), we outperform baselines that share the same language model and training data on 12 benchmarks. Furthermore, we show the zero-shot capability of TUNA when provided with specific datastores.</p></details> | <details><summary>Main ...</summary><p>Main Conference at EMNLP 2024</p></details> |

Among these methods, gradient-based approaches, which use gradients to generate malicious prompts, have been widely studied due to their high success rates in white-box settings, where full access to the model is available. However, these methods have notable limitations: they require white-box access, which is not always feasible, and involve high memory usage. To address scenarios where white-box access is unavailable, attackers often resort to transfer attacks. In transfer attacks, malicious inputs generated using white-box models are applied to black-box models, but this typically results in reduced attack performance. To overcome these challenges, we propose Zer0-Jack, a method that bypasses the need for white-box access by leveraging zeroth-order optimization. We propose patch coordinate descent to efficiently generate malicious image inputs to directly attack black-box MLLMs, which significantly reduces memory usage further. Through extensive experiments, Zer0-Jack achieves a high attack success rate across various models, surpassing previous transfer-based methods and performing comparably with existing white-box jailbreak techniques. Notably, Zer0-Jack achieves a 95\% attack success rate on MiniGPT-4 with the Harmful Behaviors Multi-modal Dataset on a black-box setting, demonstrating its effectiveness. Additionally, we show that Zer0-Jack can directly attack commercial MLLMs such as GPT-4o.

Traditionally anchored to static datasets, these models often struggle to keep up with the rapid linguistic evolution characteristic of online communities. This research aims to bridge this gap by enhancing LLMs' comprehension of the evolving new concepts on the Internet, without the high cost of continual retraining. In pursuit of this goal, we introduce $\textbf{SLANG}$, a benchmark designed to autonomously integrate novel data and assess LLMs' ability to comprehend emerging concepts, alongside $\textbf{FOCUS}$, an approach uses causal inference to enhance LLMs to understand new phrases and their colloquial context. Our benchmark and approach involves understanding real-world instances of linguistic shifts, serving as contextual beacons, to form more precise and contextually relevant connections between newly emerging expressions and their meanings. The empirical analysis shows that our causal inference-based approach outperforms the baseline methods in terms of precision and relevance in the comprehension of Internet slang and memes.</p></details> | EMNLP 2024 Main |

To effectively measure moral sentiments in natural language processing texts, it is crucial to utilize large, annotated datasets that provide nuanced understanding for accurate analysis and modeltraining. However, existing corpora, while valuable, often face linguistic limitations. To address this gap in the Chinese language domain,we introduce the Moral Foundation Weibo Corpus. This corpus consists of 25,671 Chinese comments on Weibo, encompassing six diverse topic areas. Each comment is manually annotated by at least three systematically trained annotators based on ten moral categories derived from a grounded theory of morality. To assess annotator reliability, we present the kappa testresults, a gold standard for measuring consistency. Additionally, we apply several the latest large language models to supplement the manual annotations, conducting analytical experiments to compare their performance and report baseline results for moral sentiment classification.</p></details> |  |

Despite its rapid progress, it heavily depends on sophisticatedly designed models given specific paralinguistic tasks. Thus, the heterogeneity and diversity of ComParal models largely prevent the realistic implementation of ComParal models. Recently, with the advent of acoustic foundation models because of self-supervised learning, developing more generic models that can efficiently perceive a plethora of paralinguistic information has become an active topic in speech processing. However, it lacks a unified evaluation framework for a fair and consistent performance comparison. To bridge this gap, we conduct a large-scale benchmark, namely ParaLBench, which concentrates on standardizing the evaluation process of diverse paralinguistic tasks, including critical aspects of affective computing such as emotion recognition and emotion dimensions prediction, over different acoustic foundation models. This benchmark contains ten datasets with thirteen distinct paralinguistic tasks, covering short-, medium- and long-term characteristics. Each task is carried out on 14 acoustic foundation models under a unified evaluation framework, which allows for an unbiased methodological comparison and offers a grounded reference for the ComParal community. Based on the insights gained from ParaLBench, we also point out potential research directions, i.e., the cross-corpus generalizability, to propel ComParal research in the future. The code associated with this study will be available to foster the transparency and replicability of this work for succeeding researchers.</p></details> |  |

Unlike traditional methods that rely on bulky data formats like voxel grids or point clouds, EPG is lightweight and scalable. It facilitates a range of robotic tasks, including open-vocabulary querying, disambiguation, image-based querying, language-directed navigation, and re-localization in 3D environments. We showcase the effectiveness of EPG in handling these tasks, demonstrating its capacity to improve how robots interact with and navigate through complex spaces. Through both qualitative and quantitative assessments, we illustrate EPG's strong performance and its ability to outperform existing methods in re-localization.

In this paper, we envision how recently introduced grid foundation models could improve the economic viability of neural power flow solvers. Conceptually, these models amortize training costs by serving as a foundation for a range of grid operation and planning tasks beyond power flow solving, with only minimal fine-tuning required.

Traditional approaches to these classes of problems often entail developing manually curated, task-specific features and models to represent human behavior and the natural and built environment, which can be challenging to adapt to new, or even, related tasks. To address this, we introduce a Population Dynamics Foundation Model (PDFM) that aims to capture the relationships between diverse data modalities and is applicable to a broad range of geospatial tasks. We first construct a geo-indexed dataset for postal codes and counties across the United States, capturing rich aggregated information on human behavior from maps, busyness, and aggregated search trends, and environmental factors such as weather and air quality. We then model this data and the complex relationships between locations using a graph neural network, producing embeddings that can be adapted to a wide range of downstream tasks using relatively simple models. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach by benchmarking it on 27 downstream tasks spanning three distinct domains: health indicators, socioeconomic factors, and environmental measurements. The approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on all 27 geospatial interpolation tasks, and on 25 out of the 27 extrapolation and super-resolution tasks. We combined the PDFM with a state-of-the-art forecasting foundation model, TimesFM, to predict unemployment and poverty, achieving performance that surpasses fully supervised forecasting. The full set of embeddings and sample code are publicly available for researchers.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, 16 figures, preprint; v2: updated github url</p></details> |

Geoscience foundation models (GFMs) emerge as a paradigm-shifting solution, integrating extensive cross-disciplinary data to enhance the simulation and understanding of Earth system dynamics. These data-centric AI models extract insights from petabytes of structured and unstructured data, effectively addressing the complexities of Earth systems that traditional models struggle to capture. The unique strengths of GFMs include flexible task specification, diverse input-output capabilities, and multi-modal knowledge representation, enabling analyses that surpass those of individual data sources or traditional AI methods. This review not only highlights the key advantages of GFMs, but also presents essential techniques for their construction, with a focus on transformers, pre-training, and adaptation strategies. Subsequently, we examine recent advancements in GFMs, including large language models, vision models, and vision-language models, particularly emphasizing the potential applications in remote sensing.

| **[TransAgent: Transfer Vision-Language Foundation Models with Heterogeneous Agent Collaboration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12183v2)** | 2024-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language foundation models (such as CLIP) have recently shown their power in transfer learning, owing to large-scale image-text pre-training. However, target domain data in the downstream tasks can be highly different from the pre-training phase, which makes it hard for such a single model to generalize well. Alternatively, there exists a wide range of expert models that contain diversified vision and/or language knowledge pre-trained on different modalities, tasks, networks, and datasets. Unfortunately, these models are "isolated agents" with heterogeneous structures, and how to integrate their knowledge for generalizing CLIP-like models has not been fully explored. To bridge this gap, we propose a general and concise TransAgent framework, which transports the knowledge of the isolated agents in a unified manner, and effectively guides CLIP to generalize with multi-source knowledge distillation. With such a distinct framework, we flexibly collaborate with 11 heterogeneous agents to empower vision-language foundation models, without further cost in the inference phase. Finally, our TransAgent achieves state-of-the-art performance on 11 visual recognition datasets. Under the same low-shot setting, it outperforms the popular CoOp with around 10% on average, and 20% on EuroSAT which contains large domain shifts.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2024 |
| **[City Foundation Models for Learning General Purpose Representations from OpenStreetMap](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00583v3)** | 2024-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pre-trained Foundation Models (PFMs) have ushered in a paradigm-shift in Artificial Intelligence, due to their ability to learn general-purpose representations that can be readily employed in a wide range of downstream tasks. While PFMs have been successfully adopted in various fields such as Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision, their capacity in handling geospatial data and answering urban questions remains limited. This can be attributed to the intrinsic heterogeneity of geospatial data, which encompasses different data types, including points, segments and regions, as well as multiple information modalities, such as a spatial position, visual characteristics and textual annotations. The proliferation of Volunteered Geographic Information initiatives, and the ever-increasing availability of open geospatial data sources, like OpenStreetMap, which is freely accessible globally, unveil a promising opportunity to bridge this gap. In this paper, we present CityFM, a self-supervised framework to train a foundation model within a selected geographical area of interest, such as a city. CityFM relies solely on open data from OSM, and produces multimodal representations of entities of different types, incorporating spatial, visual, and textual information. We analyse the entity representations generated using our foundation models from a qualitative perspective, and conduct quantitative experiments on road, building, and region-level downstream tasks. We compare its results to algorithms tailored specifically for the respective applications. In all the experiments, CityFM achieves performance superior to, or on par with, the baselines.</p></details> | CIKM 2024 |
| **[MicroScopiQ: Accelerating Foundational Models through Outlier-Aware Microscaling Quantization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05282v2)** | 2024-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantization of foundational models (FMs) is significantly more challenging than traditional DNNs due to the emergence of large magnitude features called outliers. Existing outlier-aware algorithm/architecture co-design techniques either use mixed-precision, retaining outliers at high precision but compromise hardware efficiency, or quantize inliers and outliers at the same precision, improving hardware efficiency at the cost of accuracy. To address this mutual exclusivity, in this paper, we propose MicroScopiQ, a novel co-design technique that leverages pruning to complement outlier-aware quantization. MicroScopiQ retains outliers at higher precision while pruning a certain fraction of least important weights to distribute the additional outlier bits; ensuring high accuracy, aligned memory and hardware efficiency. We design a high-throughput, low overhead accelerator architecture composed of simple multi-precision INT processing elements and a novel network-on-chip called ReCoN that efficiently abstracts the complexity of supporting high-precision outliers. Additionally, unlike existing alternatives, MicroScopiQ does not assume any locality of outlier weights, enabling applicability to a broad range of FMs. Extensive experiments across various quantization settings show that MicroScopiQ achieves SoTA quantization performance while simultaneously improving inference performance by 3x and reducing energy by 2x over existing alternatives.</p></details> | Under review |

To address these challenges, we introduce AuscultaBase, a foundational framework aimed at advancing body sound diagnostics through innovative data integration and contrastive learning techniques. Our contributions include the following: First, we compile AuscultaBase-Corpus, a large-scale, multi-source body sound database encompassing 11 datasets with 40,317 audio recordings and totaling 322.4 hours of heart, lung, and bowel sounds. Second, we develop AuscultaBase-Model, a foundational diagnostic model for body sounds, utilizing contrastive learning on the compiled corpus. Third, we establish AuscultaBase-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark containing 16 sub-tasks, assessing the performance of various open-source acoustic pre-trained models. Evaluation results indicate that our model outperforms all other open-source models in 12 out of 16 tasks, demonstrating the efficacy of our approach in advancing diagnostic capabilities for body sound analysis.</p></details> | 26 pages |

However, these capabilities have yet to be fully demonstrated in bioacoustics tasks, such as detecting animal vocalizations in large recordings, classifying rare and endangered species, and labeling context and behavior - tasks that are crucial for conservation, biodiversity monitoring, and the study of animal behavior. In this work, we present NatureLM-audio, the first audio-language foundation model specifically designed for bioacoustics. Our carefully curated training dataset comprises text-audio pairs spanning a diverse range of bioacoustics, speech, and music data, designed to address the challenges posed by limited annotated datasets in the field. We demonstrate successful transfer of learned representations from music and speech to bioacoustics, and our model shows promising generalization to unseen taxa and tasks. Importantly, we test NatureLM-audio on a novel benchmark (BEANS-Zero) and it sets the new state of the art (SotA) on several bioacoustics tasks, including zero-shot classification of unseen species.

However, generating multiple high-quality and diverse responses without sacrificing accuracy remains a challenge, especially when using greedy sampling. In this work, we propose a novel framework, Synthesize-Partition-Adapt (SPA), that leverages the abundant synthetic data available in many domains to elicit diverse responses from foundation models. By leveraging signal provided by data attribution methods such as influence functions, SPA partitions data into subsets, each targeting unique aspects of the data, and trains multiple model adaptations optimized for these subsets. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in diversifying foundation model responses while maintaining high quality, showcased through the HumanEval and MBPP tasks in the code generation domain and several tasks in the natural language understanding domain, highlighting its potential to enrich user experience across various applications.</p></details> |  |

Several Multiple Instance Learning frameworks proposed for this task utilize a ResNet50 backbone pre-trained on natural images. By leveraging recenetly released histopathological foundation models such as UNI and Hibou, the predictive prowess of existing MIL networks can be enhanced. Furthermore, deploying an ensemble of digital pathology foundation models yields higher baseline accuracy, although the benefits appear to diminish with more complex MIL architectures. Our code will be made publicly available upon acceptance.</p></details> |  |

However, a significant challenge lies in the scarcity and high cost of obtaining high-quality materials datasets. In other fields, such as natural language processing, foundation models pre-trained on large datasets have achieved exceptional success in transfer learning, effectively leveraging latent features to achieve high performance on tasks with limited data. Despite this progress, the concept of foundation models remains underexplored in materials science. Here, we present a foundation model specifically designed for composite materials. Our model is pre-trained on a dataset of short-fiber composites to learn robust latent features. During transfer learning, the MMAE accurately predicts homogenized stiffness, with an R2 score reaching as high as 0.959 and consistently exceeding 0.91, even when trained on limited data. These findings validate the feasibility and effectiveness of foundation models in composite materials. We anticipate extending this approach to more complex three-dimensional composite materials, polycrystalline materials, and beyond. Moreover, this framework enables high-accuracy predictions even when experimental data are scarce, paving the way for more efficient and cost-effective materials design and analysis.</p></details> |  |

Despite the significant progress of pre-trained graph neural networks, there haven't been GFMs that can achieve desired performance on various graph-learning-related tasks. Building GFMs may rely on a vocabulary that encodes transferable patterns shared among different tasks and domains. Unlike image and text, defining such transferable patterns for graphs remains an open question. In this paper, we aim to bridge this gap by rethinking the transferable patterns on graphs as computation trees -- i.e., tree structures derived from the message-passing process. Based on this insight, we propose a cross-task, cross-domain graph foundation model named GFT, short for Graph Foundation model with transferable Tree vocabulary. By treating computation trees as tokens within the transferable vocabulary, GFT improves model generalization and reduces the risk of negative transfer. The theoretical analyses and extensive experimental studies have demonstrated the transferability of computation trees and shown the effectiveness of GFT across diverse tasks and domains in graph learning.

Accurate segmentation of the left atrium (LA) in 3D late gadolinium-enhanced (LGE) MRI is helpful for evaluating AF, as fibrotic remodeling in the LA myocardium contributes to arrhythmia and serves as a key determinant of therapeutic strategies. However, manual LA segmentation is labor-intensive and challenging. Recent foundational deep learning models, such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM), pre-trained on diverse datasets, have demonstrated promise in generic segmentation tasks. MedSAM, a fine-tuned version of SAM for medical applications, enables efficient, zero-shot segmentation without domain-specific training. Despite the potential of MedSAM model, it has not yet been evaluated for the complex task of LA segmentation in 3D LGE-MRI. This study aims to (1) evaluate the performance of MedSAM in automating LA segmentation, (2) compare the performance of the MedSAM2 model, which uses a single prompt with automated tracking, with the MedSAM1 model, which requires separate prompt for each slice, and (3) analyze the performance of MedSAM1 in terms of Dice score(i.e., segmentation accuracy) by varying the size and location of the box prompt.</p></details> |  |

What Matters and What Does Not](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17044v2)** | 2024-11-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The remarkable performance achieved by Large Language Models (LLM) has driven research efforts to leverage them for a wide range of tasks and input modalities. In speech-to-text (S2T) tasks, the emerging solution consists of projecting the output of the encoder of a Speech Foundational Model (SFM) into the LLM embedding space through an adapter module. However, no work has yet investigated how much the downstream-task performance depends on each component (SFM, adapter, LLM) nor whether the best design of the adapter depends on the chosen SFM and LLM. To fill this gap, we evaluate the combination of 5 adapter modules, 2 LLMs (Mistral and Llama), and 2 SFMs (Whisper and SeamlessM4T) on two widespread S2T tasks, namely Automatic Speech Recognition and Speech Translation. Our results demonstrate that the SFM plays a pivotal role in downstream performance, while the adapter choice has moderate impact and depends on the SFM and LLM.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we investigate the potential of domain-specific foundation models for dermatology in addressing this challenge. We utilize self-supervised learning (SSL) techniques to pre-train models on a dataset of over 240,000 dermatological images from public and private collections. Our study considers several SSL methods and compares the resulting foundation models against domain-agnostic models like those pre-trained on ImageNet and state-of-the-art models such as MONET across 12 downstream tasks. Unlike previous research, we emphasize the development of smaller models that are more suitable for resource-limited clinical settings, facilitating easier adaptation to a broad range of use cases. Results show that models pre-trained in this work not only outperform general-purpose models but also approach the performance of models 50 times larger on clinically relevant diagnostic tasks. To promote further research in this direction, we publicly release both the training code and the foundation models, which can benefit clinicians in dermatological applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Findi...</summary><p>Findings paper presented at Machine Learning for Health (ML4H) symposium 2024, December 15-16, 2024, Vancouver, Canada, 11 pages</p></details> |

A Comparative Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05489v1)** | 2024-11-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning has led to remarkable advancements in computational histopathology, e.g., in diagnostics, biomarker prediction, and outcome prognosis. Yet, the lack of annotated data and the impact of batch effects, e.g., systematic technical data differences across hospitals, hamper model robustness and generalization. Recent histopathological foundation models -- pretrained on millions to billions of images -- have been reported to improve generalization performances on various downstream tasks. However, it has not been systematically assessed whether they fully eliminate batch effects. In this study, we empirically show that the feature embeddings of the foundation models still contain distinct hospital signatures that can lead to biased predictions and misclassifications. We further find that the signatures are not removed by stain normalization methods, dominate distances in feature space, and are evident across various principal components. Our work provides a novel perspective on the evaluation of medical foundation models, paving the way for more robust pretraining strategies and downstream predictors.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AIM-FM Workshop @ NeurIPS'24</p></details> |

Existing data-driven models focus on single weather understanding tasks (e.g., weather forecasting). Although these models have achieved promising results, they fail to tackle various complex tasks within a single and unified model. Moreover, the paradigm that relies on limited real observations for a single scenario hinders the model's performance upper bound. In response to these limitations, we draw inspiration from the in-context learning paradigm employed in state-of-the-art visual foundation models and large language models. In this paper, we introduce the first generalist weather foundation model (WeatherGFM), designed to address a wide spectrum of weather understanding tasks in a unified manner. More specifically, we initially unify the representation and definition of the diverse weather understanding tasks. Subsequently, we devised weather prompt formats to manage different weather data modalities, namely single, multiple, and temporal modalities. Finally, we adopt a visual prompting question-answering paradigm for the training of unified weather understanding tasks. Extensive experiments indicate that our WeatherGFM can effectively handle up to ten weather understanding tasks, including weather forecasting, super-resolution, weather image translation, and post-processing. Our method also showcases generalization ability on unseen tasks.</p></details> |  |

As AI agent systems tackle more complex tasks and evolve, they involve a wider range of stakeholders, including agent users, agentic system developers and deployers, and AI model developers. These systems also integrate multiple components such as AI agent workflows, RAG pipelines, prompt management, agent capabilities, and observability features. In this case, obtaining reliable outputs and answers from these agents remains challenging, necessitating a dependable execution process and end-to-end observability solutions. To build reliable AI agents and LLM applications, it is essential to shift towards designing AgentOps platforms that ensure observability and traceability across the entire development-to-production life-cycle. To this end, we conducted a rapid review and identified relevant AgentOps tools from the agentic ecosystem. Based on this review, we provide an overview of the essential features of AgentOps and propose a comprehensive overview of observability data/traceable artifacts across the agent production life-cycle. Our findings provide a systematic overview of the current AgentOps landscape, emphasizing the critical role of observability/traceability in enhancing the reliability of autonomous agent systems.</p></details> | 19 pages, 9 figures |

However, it remains unclear why this model -- originally developed for multi-player stochastic game matching -- can be adopted to convert pairwise response comparisons to reward values and make predictions. Especially given the fact that only a limited number of prompt-response pairs are sparsely compared with others. In this paper, we first revisit the foundations of using BT models in reward modeling, and establish the convergence rate of BT reward models based on deep neural networks using embeddings, providing a theoretical foundation for their use. Despite theoretically sound, we argue that the BT model is not a necessary choice from the perspective of downstream optimization. This is because a reward model only needs to preserve the correct ranking predictions through a monotonic transformation of the true reward. We highlight the critical concept of order consistency in reward modeling and demonstrate that the BT model possesses this property. Consequently, we propose a simple and straightforward upper-bound algorithm, compatible with off-the-shelf binary classifiers, as an alternative order-consistent reward modeling objective. To offer practical insights, we empirically evaluate the performance of these different reward modeling approaches across more than 12,000 experimental setups, using $6$ base LLMs, $2$ datasets, and diverse annotation designs that vary in quantity, quality, and pairing choices in preference annotations.</p></details> |  |

Next, we summarize a unified framework that captures the essential components used in prior research, accompanied by a taxonomy. Additionally, we explore commercial applications of (M)LLM-based GUI agents. Drawing from existing work, we identify several key challenges and propose future research directions.

This study introduces a novel approach towards the creation of medical foundation models by integrating a large-scale multi-modal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) dataset derived from 41,400 participants in its own. Our method involves a novel two-stage pretraining approach using vision transformers. The first stage is dedicated to encoding anatomical structures in generally healthy brains, identifying key features such as shapes and sizes of different brain regions. The second stage concentrates on spatial information, encompassing aspects like location and the relative positioning of brain structures. We rigorously evaluate our model, BrainFounder, using the Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS) challenge and Anatomical Tracings of Lesions After Stroke v2.0 (ATLAS v2.0) datasets. BrainFounder demonstrates a significant performance gain, surpassing the achievements of the previous winning solutions using fully supervised learning. Our findings underscore the impact of scaling up both the complexity of the model and the volume of unlabeled training data derived from generally healthy brains, which enhances the accuracy and predictive capabilities of the model in complex neuroimaging tasks with MRI. The implications of this research provide transformative insights and practical applications in healthcare and make substantial steps towards the creation of foundation models for Medical AI.

The main problem for those applications arises from the difficulty in collecting large labeled task-specific data for model development. Generalizable respiratory acoustic foundation models pretrained with unlabeled data would offer appealing advantages and possibly unlock this impasse. However, given the safety-critical nature of healthcare applications, it is pivotal to also ensure openness and replicability for any proposed foundation model solution. To this end, we introduce OPERA, an OPEn Respiratory Acoustic foundation model pretraining and benchmarking system, as the first approach answering this need. We curate large-scale respiratory audio datasets (~136K samples, over 400 hours), pretrain three pioneering foundation models, and build a benchmark consisting of 19 downstream respiratory health tasks for evaluation. Our pretrained models demonstrate superior performance (against existing acoustic models pretrained with general audio on 16 out of 19 tasks) and generalizability (to unseen datasets and new respiratory audio modalities). This highlights the great promise of respiratory acoustic foundation models and encourages more studies using OPERA as an open resource to accelerate research on respiratory audio for health.

However, their rapidly growing capabilities and autonomy have raised significant concerns about AI safety. Designing effective guardrails for these agents is challenging due to their autonomous and non-deterministic behavior, and the involvement of multiple artifacts -- such as goals, prompts, plans, tools, knowledge bases, and intermediate and final results. Addressing these unique challenges runtime requires multi-layered guardrails that operate effectively at various levels of the agent architecture, similar to the Swiss Cheese Model. In this paper, we present a taxonomy of multi-layered runtime guardrails to classify and compare their characteristics and design options, grounded on a systematic literature review and guided by the Swiss Cheese Model. This taxonomy is organized into external and internal quality attributes and design options categories. We also highlight the relationships between guardrails, the associated risks they mitigate, and the quality attributes they impact in agent architectures. Thus, the proposed taxonomy provides structured and concrete guidance for making architectural design decisions when implementing multi-layered guardrails while emphasizing the trade-offs inherent in these decisions.</p></details> | 15 Pages |

However, they often fail to fully capture the complexity of research workflows, which typically involve interpreting non-textual data and gathering information across multiple documents. To address this gap, we introduce M3SciQA, a multi-modal, multi-document scientific question answering benchmark designed for a more comprehensive evaluation of foundation models. M3SciQA consists of 1,452 expert-annotated questions spanning 70 natural language processing paper clusters, where each cluster represents a primary paper along with all its cited documents, mirroring the workflow of comprehending a single paper by requiring multi-modal and multi-document data. With M3SciQA, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 18 foundation models. Our results indicate that current foundation models still significantly underperform compared to human experts in multi-modal information retrieval and in reasoning across multiple scientific documents. Additionally, we explore the implications of these findings for the future advancement of applying foundation models in multi-modal scientific literature analysis.</p></details> |  |

Face reconstruction attack (also known as template inversion) refers to reconstructing face images from face embeddings and using the reconstructed face image to enter a face recognition system. In this paper, we propose to use a face foundation model to reconstruct face images from the embeddings of a blackbox face recognition model. The foundation model is trained with 42M images to generate face images from the facial embeddings of a fixed face recognition model. We propose to use an adapter to translate target embeddings into the embedding space of the foundation model. The generated images are evaluated on different face recognition models and different datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method to translate embeddings of different face recognition models. We also evaluate the transferability of reconstructed face images when attacking different face recognition models. Our experimental results show that our reconstructed face images outperform previous reconstruction attacks against face recognition models.</p></details> |  |

Nevertheless, there is a lack of systematic knowledge to guide practitioners in designing the agents considering challenges of goal-seeking (including generating instrumental goals and plans), such as hallucinations inherent in foundation models, explainability of reasoning process, complex accountability, etc. To address this issue, we have performed a systematic literature review to understand the state-of-the-art foundation model-based agents and the broader ecosystem. In this paper, we present a pattern catalogue consisting of 18 architectural patterns with analyses of the context, forces, and trade-offs as the outcomes from the previous literature review. We propose a decision model for selecting the patterns. The proposed catalogue can provide holistic guidance for the effective use of patterns, and support the architecture design of foundation model-based agents by facilitating goal-seeking and plan generation.</p></details> |  |

The Segmentation Anything Model (SAM) serves as a powerful foundation model for visual segmentation and can be adapted for medical image segmentation. However, medical imaging data typically contain privacy-sensitive information, making it challenging to train foundation models with centralized storage and sharing. To date, there are few foundation models tailored for medical image deployment within the federated learning framework, and the segmentation performance, as well as the efficiency of communication and training, remain unexplored. In response to these issues, we developed Federated Foundation models for Medical image Segmentation (FedFMS), which includes the Federated SAM (FedSAM) and a communication and training-efficient Federated SAM with Medical SAM Adapter (FedMSA). Comprehensive experiments on diverse datasets are conducted to investigate the performance disparities between centralized training and federated learning across various configurations of FedFMS. The experiments revealed that FedFMS could achieve performance comparable to models trained via centralized training methods while maintaining privacy. Furthermore, FedMSA demonstrated the potential to enhance communication and training efficiency.

However, these large-scale datasets are often collected without explicit consent, raising ethical and privacy concerns. To address this, there have been proposals to use synthetic datasets for training face recognition models. Yet, such models still rely on real data to train the generative models and generally exhibit inferior performance compared to those trained on real datasets. One of these datasets, DigiFace, uses a graphics pipeline to generate different identities and different intra-class variations without using real data in training the models. However, the performance of this approach is poor on face recognition benchmarks, possibly due to the lack of realism in the images generated from the graphics pipeline. In this work, we introduce a novel framework for realism transfer aimed at enhancing the realism of synthetically generated face images. Our method leverages the large-scale face foundation model, and we adapt the pipeline for realism enhancement. By integrating the controllable aspects of the graphics pipeline with our realism enhancement technique, we generate a large amount of realistic variations-combining the advantages of both approaches. Our empirical evaluations demonstrate that models trained using our enhanced dataset significantly improve the performance of face recognition systems over the baseline.

One of the most predominant biomarkers in neuroimaging is represented by brain age, which has been shown to be a good indicator for different conditions, such as Alzheimer's Disease. Using brain age for pretraining DL models in transfer learning settings has also recently shown promising results, especially when dealing with data scarcity of different conditions. On the other hand, anatomical information of brain MRIs (e.g. cortical thickness) can provide important information for learning good representations that can be transferred to many downstream tasks. In this work, we propose AnatCL, an anatomical foundation model for brain MRIs that i.) leverages anatomical information with a weakly contrastive learning approach and ii.) achieves state-of-the-art performances in many different downstream tasks. To validate our approach we consider 12 different downstream tasks for diagnosis classification, and prediction of 10 different clinical assessment scores.

| **[Watson: A Cognitive Observability Framework for the Reasoning of Foundation Model-Powered Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03455v1)** | 2024-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As foundation models (FMs) play an increasingly prominent role in complex software systems, such as FM-powered agentic software (i.e., Agentware), they introduce significant challenges for developers regarding observability. Unlike traditional software, agents operate autonomously, using extensive data and opaque implicit reasoning, making it difficult to observe and understand their behavior during runtime, especially when they take unexpected actions or encounter errors. In this paper, we highlight the limitations of traditional operational observability in the context of FM-powered software, and introduce cognitive observability as a new type of required observability that has emerged for such innovative systems. We then propose a novel framework that provides cognitive observability into the implicit reasoning processes of agents (a.k.a. reasoning observability), and demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in boosting the debuggability of Agentware and, in turn, the abilities of an Agentware through a case study on AutoCodeRover, a cuttingedge Agentware for autonomous program improvement.</p></details> |  |

It is based on a multiscale operator transformer, with time-conditioned layer norms that enable continuous-in-time evaluations. A novel training strategy leveraging the semi-group property of time-dependent PDEs to allow for significant scaling-up of the training data is also proposed. Poseidon is pretrained on a diverse, large scale dataset for the governing equations of fluid dynamics. It is then evaluated on a suite of 15 challenging downstream tasks that include a wide variety of PDE types and operators. We show that Poseidon exhibits excellent performance across the board by outperforming baselines significantly, both in terms of sample efficiency and accuracy. Poseidon also generalizes very well to new physics that is not seen during pretraining. Moreover, Poseidon scales with respect to model and data size, both for pretraining and for downstream tasks. Taken together, our results showcase the surprising ability of Poseidon to learn effective representations from a very small set of PDEs during pretraining in order to generalize well to unseen and unrelated PDEs downstream, demonstrating its potential as an effective, general purpose PDE foundation model. Finally, the Poseidon model as well as underlying pretraining and downstream datasets are open sourced, with code being available at https://github.com/camlab-ethz/poseidon and pretrained models and datasets at https://huggingface.co/camlab-ethz.</p></details> |  |

Emerging research indicates that large vision-language models (VLMs) can enhance performance across various downstream vision-language understanding tasks. However, general-domain models often underperform in specialized fields. This study introduces a domain-specific Large Vision-Language Model, Human-Scene Vision-Language Model (HumanVLM), designed to provide a foundation for human-scene Vision-Language tasks. Specifically, (1) we create a large-scale human-scene multimodal image-text dataset (HumanCaption-10M) sourced from the Internet to facilitate domain-specific alignment; (2) develop a captioning approach for human-centered images, capturing human faces, bodies, and backgrounds, and construct a high-quality Human-Scene image-text dataset (HumanCaptionHQ, about 311k pairs) that contain as much detailed information as possible about human; (3) Using HumanCaption-10M and HumanCaptionHQ, we train a HumanVLM. In the experiments, we then evaluate our HumanVLM across varous downstream tasks, where it demonstrates superior overall performance among multimodal models of comparable scale, particularly excelling in human-related tasks and significantly outperforming similar models, including Qwen2VL and ChatGPT-4o. HumanVLM, alongside the data introduced, will stimulate the research in human-around fields.</p></details> | 34 pages,11 figures |

While Parameter-efficient Fine-tuning (PEFT) is commonly used to adapt these models, studies often prioritize parameter efficiency, neglecting GPU memory and training speed. To address this, we introduced the IISAN framework, significantly enhancing efficiency. However, IISAN was limited to symmetrical MFMs and identical text and image encoders, preventing the use of state-of-the-art Large Language Models. To overcome this, we developed IISAN-Versa, a versatile plug-and-play architecture compatible with both symmetrical and asymmetrical MFMs. IISAN-Versa employs a Decoupled PEFT structure and utilizes both intra- and inter-modal adaptation. It effectively handles asymmetry through a simple yet effective combination of group layer-dropping and dimension transformation alignment. Our research demonstrates that IISAN-Versa effectively adapts large text encoders, and we further identify a scaling effect where larger encoders generally perform better. IISAN-Versa also demonstrates strong versatility in our defined multimodal scenarios, which include raw titles and captions generated from images and videos. Additionally, IISAN-Versa achieved state-of-the-art performance on the Microlens public benchmark. We will release our code and datasets to support future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>The e...</summary><p>The extension of IISAN in SIGIR2024</p></details> |

However, most of these models rely on the Transformer architecture, which incurs quadratic complexity as input length increases. To address this, we introduce TSMamba, a linear-complexity foundation model for time series forecasting built on the Mamba architecture. The model captures temporal dependencies through both forward and backward Mamba encoders, achieving high prediction accuracy. To reduce reliance on large datasets and lower training costs, TSMamba employs a two-stage transfer learning process that leverages pretrained Mamba LLMs, allowing effective time series modeling with a moderate training set. In the first stage, the forward and backward backbones are optimized via patch-wise autoregressive prediction; in the second stage, the model trains a prediction head and refines other components for long-term forecasting. While the backbone assumes channel independence to manage varying channel numbers across datasets, a channel-wise compressed attention module is introduced to capture cross-channel dependencies during fine-tuning on specific multivariate datasets. Experiments show that TSMamba's zero-shot performance is comparable to state-of-the-art time series foundation models, despite using significantly less training data. It also achieves competitive or superior full-shot performance compared to task-specific prediction models. The code will be made publicly available.</p></details> |  |

We introduce SoniDo, a music foundation model (MFM) designed to extract hierarchical features from target music samples. By leveraging hierarchical intermediate features, SoniDo constrains the information granularity, leading to improved performance across various downstream tasks including both understanding and generative tasks. We specifically evaluated this approach on representative tasks such as music tagging, music transcription, music source separation, and music mixing. Our results reveal that the features extracted from foundation models provide valuable enhancements in training downstream task models. This highlights the capability of using features extracted from music foundation models as a booster for downstream tasks. Our approach not only benefits existing task-specific models but also supports music downstream tasks constrained by data scarcity.

Has this achieved what the original FMs accomplished, i.e. the supplanting of traditional supervised learning in their domains? To answer we look at three modalities -- genomics, satellite imaging, and time series -- with multiple recent FMs and compare them to a standard supervised learning workflow: model development, hyperparameter tuning, and training, all using only data from the target task. Across these three specialized domains, we find that it is consistently possible to train simple supervised models -- no more complicated than a lightly modified wide ResNet or UNet -- that match or even outperform the latest foundation models. Our work demonstrates that the benefits of large-scale pretraining have yet to be realized in many specialized areas, reinforces the need to compare new FMs to strong, well-tuned baselines, and introduces two new, easy-to-use, open-source, and automated workflows for doing so.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The first two authors contributed equally.

| **[Foundation AI Model for Medical Image Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02745v1)** | 2024-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models refer to artificial intelligence (AI) models that are trained on massive amounts of data and demonstrate broad generalizability across various tasks with high accuracy. These models offer versatile, one-for-many or one-for-all solutions, eliminating the need for developing task-specific AI models. Examples of such foundation models include the Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer (ChatGPT) and the Segment Anything Model (SAM). These models have been trained on millions to billions of samples and have shown wide-ranging and accurate applications in numerous tasks such as text processing (using ChatGPT) and natural image segmentation (using SAM). In medical image segmentation - finding target regions in medical images - there is a growing need for these one-for-many or one-for-all foundation models. Such models could obviate the need to develop thousands of task-specific AI models, which is currently standard practice in the field. They can also be adapted to tasks with datasets too small for effective training. We discuss two paths to achieve foundation models for medical image segmentation and comment on progress, challenges, and opportunities. One path is to adapt or fine-tune existing models, originally developed for natural images, for use with medical images. The second path entails building models from scratch, exclusively training on medical images.</p></details> |  |
| **[Conformal Alignment: Knowing When to Trust Foundation Models with Guarantees](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10301v3)** | 2024-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Before deploying outputs from foundation models in high-stakes tasks, it is imperative to ensure that they align with human values. For instance, in radiology report generation, reports generated by a vision-language model must align with human evaluations before their use in medical decision-making. This paper presents Conformal Alignment, a general framework for identifying units whose outputs meet a user-specified alignment criterion. It is guaranteed that on average, a prescribed fraction of selected units indeed meet the alignment criterion, regardless of the foundation model or the data distribution. Given any pre-trained model and new units with model-generated outputs, Conformal Alignment leverages a set of reference data with ground-truth alignment status to train an alignment predictor. It then selects new units whose predicted alignment scores surpass a data-dependent threshold, certifying their corresponding outputs as trustworthy. Through applications to question answering and radiology report generation, we demonstrate that our method is able to accurately identify units with trustworthy outputs via lightweight training over a moderate amount of reference data. En route, we investigate the informativeness of various features in alignment prediction and combine them with standard models to construct the alignment predictor.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Foundations of Tokenization: Statistical and Computational Concerns](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11606v3)** | 2024-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tokenization - the practice of converting strings of characters from an alphabet into sequences of tokens over a vocabulary - is a critical step in the NLP pipeline. The use of token representations is widely credited with increased model performance but is also the source of many undesirable behaviors, such as spurious ambiguity or inconsistency. Despite its recognized importance as a standard representation method in NLP, the theoretical underpinnings of tokenization are not yet fully understood. In particular, the impact of tokenization on statistical estimation has been investigated mostly through empirical means. The present paper contributes to addressing this theoretical gap by proposing a unified formal framework for representing and analyzing tokenizer models. Based on the category of stochastic maps, this framework enables us to establish general conditions for a principled use of tokenizers, and most importantly, the necessary and sufficient conditions for a tokenizer model to preserve the consistency of statistical estimators. Additionally, we discuss statistical and computational concerns crucial for designing and implementing tokenizer models, such as inconsistency, ambiguity, tractability, and boundedness. The framework and results advanced in this paper contribute to building robust theoretical foundations for representations in neural language modeling that can inform future empirical research.</p></details> |  |

Deep learning has shown promise in exploring these relationships using various data types. However, transcriptomics, which provides detailed insights into cellular states, is still underused due to its high noise levels and limited data availability. Recent advancements in transcriptomics sequencing provide new opportunities to uncover valuable insights, especially with the rise of many new foundation models for transcriptomics, yet no benchmark has been made to robustly evaluate the effectiveness of these rising models for perturbation analysis. This article presents a novel biologically motivated evaluation framework and a hierarchy of perturbation analysis tasks for comparing the performance of pretrained foundation models to each other and to more classical techniques of learning from transcriptomics data. We compile diverse public datasets from different sequencing techniques and cell lines to assess models performance. Our approach identifies scVI and PCA to be far better suited models for understanding biological perturbations in comparison to existing foundation models, especially in their application in real-world scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Neuri...</summary><p>Neurips 2024 AIDrugX Workshop</p></details> |

As foundation models evolve, the demands for agents that can adapt in real-time and process multimodal data have grown. This survey provides a comprehensive review of mobile agent technologies, focusing on recent advancements that enhance real-time adaptability and multimodal interaction. Recent evaluation benchmarks have been developed better to capture the static and interactive environments of mobile tasks, offering more accurate assessments of agents' performance. We then categorize these advancements into two main approaches: prompt-based methods, which utilize large language models (LLMs) for instruction-based task execution, and training-based methods, which fine-tune multimodal models for mobile-specific applications. Additionally, we explore complementary technologies that augment agent performance. By discussing key challenges and outlining future research directions, this survey offers valuable insights for advancing mobile agent technologies.

This exploration is beneficial for finding good loss basins when training from scratch. It is not necessarily ideal when resuming from a powerful foundation model because it can lead to large deviations from the pre-trained initialization and, consequently, worse robustness and generalization. At the same time, strong regularization on all parameters can lead to under-fitting. We hypothesize that selectively regularizing the parameter space is the key to fitting and retraining the pre-trained knowledge. This paper proposes a new weight decay technique, Selective Projection Decay (SPD), that selectively imposes a strong penalty on certain layers while allowing others to change freely. Intuitively, SPD expands and contracts the parameter search space for layers with consistent and inconsistent loss reduction, respectively. Experimentally, when equipped with SPD, Adam consistently provides better in-distribution generalization and out-of-distribution robustness performance on multiple popular vision and language benchmarks.

However, addressing uncertainty in both perception (sensory interpretation) and decision-making (plan generation) remains a critical challenge for ensuring task reliability. We present a comprehensive framework to disentangle, quantify, and mitigate these two forms of uncertainty. We first introduce a framework for uncertainty disentanglement, isolating perception uncertainty arising from limitations in visual understanding and decision uncertainty relating to the robustness of generated plans. To quantify each type of uncertainty, we propose methods tailored to the unique properties of perception and decision-making: we use conformal prediction to calibrate perception uncertainty and introduce Formal-Methods-Driven Prediction (FMDP) to quantify decision uncertainty, leveraging formal verification techniques for theoretical guarantees. Building on this quantification, we implement two targeted intervention mechanisms: an active sensing process that dynamically re-observes high-uncertainty scenes to enhance visual input quality and an automated refinement procedure that fine-tunes the model on high-certainty data, improving its capability to meet task specifications. Empirical validation in real-world and simulated robotic tasks demonstrates that our uncertainty disentanglement framework reduces variability by up to 40% and enhances task success rates by 5% compared to baselines. These improvements are attributed to the combined effect of both interventions and highlight the importance of uncertainty disentanglement which facilitates targeted interventions that enhance the robustness and reliability of autonomous systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Fine-...</summary><p>Fine-tuned models, code, and datasets are available at https://tinyurl.com/uncertainty-disentanglement</p></details> |

Investigating molecular data through multi-omics approaches is crucial for unraveling the complex biological mechanisms underlying cancer, thereby enabling more effective diagnosis, treatment, and prevention strategies. However, predicting patient outcomes through the integration of all available multi-omics data is still an under-study research direction. Here, we present SeNMo, a foundation model that has been trained on multi-omics data across 33 cancer types. SeNMo is particularly efficient in handling multi-omics data characterized by high-width and low-length attributes. We trained SeNMo for the task of overall survival of patients using pan-cancer multi-omics data involving 33 cancer sites from the GDC. The training multi-omics data includes gene expression, DNA methylation, miRNA expression, DNA mutations, protein expression modalities, and clinical data. SeNMo was validated on two independent cohorts: Moffitt Cancer Center and CPTAC lung squamous cell carcinoma. We evaluated the model's performance in predicting patient's overall survival using the C-Index. SeNMo performed consistently well in the training regime, reflected by the validation C-Index of 0.76 on GDC's public data. In the testing regime, SeNMo performed with a C-Index of 0.758 on a held-out test set. The model showed an average accuracy of 99.8% on the task of classifying the primary cancer type on the pan-cancer test cohort. SeNMo demonstrated robust performance on the classification task of predicting the primary cancer type of patients. SeNMo further demonstrated significant performance in predicting tertiary lymph structures from multi-omics data, showing generalizability across cancer types, molecular data types, and clinical endpoints.</p></details> |  |

Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a promising tool for disentangling FM representations, but they struggle to capture rare, yet crucial concepts in the data. We introduce Specialized Sparse Autoencoders (SSAEs), designed to illuminate these elusive dark matter features by focusing on specific subdomains. We present a practical recipe for training SSAEs, demonstrating the efficacy of dense retrieval for data selection and the benefits of Tilted Empirical Risk Minimization as a training objective to improve concept recall. Our evaluation of SSAEs on standard metrics, such as downstream perplexity and $L_0$ sparsity, show that they effectively capture subdomain tail concepts, exceeding the capabilities of general-purpose SAEs. We showcase the practical utility of SSAEs in a case study on the Bias in Bios dataset, where SSAEs achieve a 12.5\% increase in worst-group classification accuracy when applied to remove spurious gender information. SSAEs provide a powerful new lens for peering into the inner workings of FMs in subdomains.</p></details> |  |

Deep SSMs demonstrate outstanding performance across a diverse set of domains, at a reduced training and inference cost compared to attention-based transformers. Recent developments show that if the linear recurrence powering SSMs allows for multiplicative interactions between inputs and hidden states (e.g. GateLoop, Mamba, GLA), then the resulting architecture can surpass in both in accuracy and efficiency attention-powered foundation models trained on text, at scales of billion parameters. In this paper, we give theoretical grounding to this recent finding using tools from Rough Path Theory: we show that when random linear recurrences are equipped with simple input-controlled transitions (selectivity mechanism), then the hidden state is provably a low-dimensional projection of a powerful mathematical object called the signature of the input -- capturing non-linear interactions between tokens at distinct timescales. Our theory not only motivates the success of modern selective state-space models such as Mamba but also provides a solid framework to understand the expressive power of future SSM variants.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS Version w/ minor edits</p></details> |

In this work, we investigate for the first time whether such models are suitable for the specific domain of face recognition. We further propose and demonstrate the adaptation of these models for face recognition across different levels of data availability. Extensive experiments are conducted on multiple foundation models and datasets of varying scales for training and fine-tuning, with evaluation on a wide range of benchmarks. Our results indicate that, despite their versatility, pre-trained foundation models underperform in face recognition compared to similar architectures trained specifically for this task. However, fine-tuning foundation models yields promising results, often surpassing models trained from scratch when training data is limited. Even with access to large-scale face recognition training datasets, fine-tuned foundation models perform comparably to models trained from scratch, but with lower training computational costs and without relying on the assumption of extensive data availability. Our analysis also explores bias in face recognition, with slightly higher bias observed in some settings when using foundation models.</p></details> |  |

Most studies focus on enhancing these models by training on ever-larger datasets to build more powerful foundation models. While training stronger models is important, enabling models to evolve during inference is equally crucial, a process we refer to as AI self-evolution. Unlike large-scale training, self-evolution may rely on limited data or interactions. Inspired by the columnar organization of the human cerebral cortex, we hypothesize that AI models could develop cognitive abilities and build internal representations through iterative interactions with their environment. To achieve this, models need long-term memory (LTM) to store and manage processed interaction data. LTM supports self-evolution by representing diverse experiences across environments and agents. In this report, we explore AI self-evolution and its potential to enhance models during inference. We examine LTM's role in lifelong learning, allowing models to evolve based on accumulated interactions. We outline the structure of LTM and the systems needed for effective data retention and representation. We also classify approaches for building personalized models with LTM data and show how these models achieve self-evolution through interaction. Using LTM, our multi-agent framework OMNE achieved first place on the GAIA benchmark, demonstrating LTM's potential for AI self-evolution. Finally, we present a roadmap for future research, emphasizing the importance of LTM for advancing AI technology and its practical applications.</p></details> | 56 pages, 13 figures |

While TSF methods are emerging these days, many of them require domain-specific data collection and model training and struggle with poor generalization performance on new domains. Foundation models aim to overcome this limitation. Pre-trained on large-scale language or time series data, they exhibit promising inferencing capabilities in new or unseen data. This has spurred a surge in new TSF foundation models. We propose a new benchmark, FoundTS, to enable thorough and fair evaluation and comparison of such models. FoundTS covers a variety of TSF foundation models, including those based on large language models and those pretrained on time series. Next, FoundTS supports different forecasting strategies, including zero-shot, few-shot, and full-shot, thereby facilitating more thorough evaluations. Finally, FoundTS offers a pipeline that standardizes evaluation processes such as dataset splitting, loading, normalization, and few-shot sampling, thereby facilitating fair evaluations. Building on this, we report on an extensive evaluation of TSF foundation models on a broad range of datasets from diverse domains and with different statistical characteristics. Specifically, we identify pros and cons and inherent limitations of existing foundation models, and we identify directions for future model design. We make our code and datasets available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/FoundTS-C2B0.</p></details> |  |
| **[HSIGene: A Foundation Model For Hyperspectral Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12470v2)** | 2024-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hyperspectral image (HSI) plays a vital role in various fields such as agriculture and environmental monitoring. However, due to the expensive acquisition cost, the number of hyperspectral images is limited, degenerating the performance of downstream tasks. Although some recent studies have attempted to employ diffusion models to synthesize HSIs, they still struggle with the scarcity of HSIs, affecting the reliability and diversity of the generated images. Some studies propose to incorporate multi-modal data to enhance spatial diversity, but the spectral fidelity cannot be ensured. In addition, existing HSI synthesis models are typically uncontrollable or only support single-condition control, limiting their ability to generate accurate and reliable HSIs. To alleviate these issues, we propose HSIGene, a novel HSI generation foundation model which is based on latent diffusion and supports multi-condition control, allowing for more precise and reliable HSI generation. To enhance the spatial diversity of the training data while preserving spectral fidelity, we propose a new data augmentation method based on spatial super-resolution, in which HSIs are upscaled first, and thus abundant training patches could be obtained by cropping the high-resolution HSIs. In addition, to improve the perceptual quality of the augmented data, we introduce a novel two-stage HSI super-resolution framework, which first applies RGB bands super-resolution and then utilizes our proposed Rectangular Guided Attention Network (RGAN) for guided HSI super-resolution. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed model is capable of generating a vast quantity of realistic HSIs for downstream tasks such as denoising and super-resolution. The code and models are available at https://github.com/LiPang/HSIGene.</p></details> |  |

SpineFM leverages the regular geometry of the spine, employing a novel inductive process to sequentially infer the location of each vertebra along the spinal column. Vertebrae are segmented using Medical-SAM-Adaptor, a robust foundation model that diverges from commonly used CNN-based models. We achieved outstanding results on two publicly available spine X-Ray datasets, with successful identification of 97.8\% and 99.6\% of annotated vertebrae, respectively. Of which, our segmentation reached an average Dice of 0.942 and 0.921, surpassing previous state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 pag...</summary><p>4 pages, 3 figures, submitted to ISBI 2025</p></details> |
| **[Uni-Med: A Unified Medical Generalist Foundation Model For Multi-Task Learning Via Connector-MoE](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17508v2)** | 2024-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have shown impressive capabilities as a general-purpose interface for various visual and linguistic tasks. However, building a unified MLLM for multi-task learning in the medical field remains a thorny challenge. To mitigate the tug-of-war problem of multi-modal multi-task optimization in MLLMs, recent advances primarily focus on improving the LLM components, while neglecting the connector that bridges the gap between modalities. In this paper, we introduce Uni-Med, a novel medical generalist foundation model which consists of a universal visual feature extraction module, a connector mixture-of-experts (CMoE) module, and an LLM. Benefiting from the proposed CMoE that leverages a well-designed router with a mixture of projection experts at the connector, Uni-Med achieves efficient solution to the tug-of-war problem and can perform six different medical tasks including question answering, visual question answering, report generation, referring expression comprehension, referring expression generation and image classification. To the best of our knowledge, Uni-Med is the first effort to tackle multi-task interference at the connector in MLLMs. Extensive ablation experiments validate the effectiveness of introducing CMoE under any configuration, with up to an average 8% performance gains. We further provide interpretation analysis of the tug-of-war problem from the perspective of gradient optimization and parameter statistics. Compared to previous state-of-the-art medical MLLMs, Uni-Med achieves competitive or superior evaluation metrics on diverse tasks.

| **[Prompt Tuning Strikes Back: Customizing Foundation Models with Low-Rank Prompt Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15282v2)** | 2024-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) has become the standard for customising Foundation Models (FMs) to user-specific downstream tasks. However, typical PEFT methods require storing multiple task-specific adapters, creating scalability issues as these adapters must be housed and run at the FM server. Traditional prompt tuning offers a potential solution by customising them through task-specific input prefixes, but it under-performs compared to other PEFT methods like LoRA. To address this gap, we propose Low-Rank Prompt Adaptation (LoPA), a prompt-tuning-based approach that performs on par with state-of-the-art PEFT methods and full fine-tuning while being more parameter-efficient and not requiring a server-based adapter. LoPA generates soft prompts by balancing between sharing task-specific information across instances and customization for each instance. It uses a low-rank decomposition of the soft-prompt component encoded for each instance to achieve parameter efficiency. We provide a comprehensive evaluation on multiple natural language understanding and code generation and understanding tasks across a wide range of foundation models with varying sizes.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 8 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

However, its potential is limited by the sheer volume of images generated during the imaging procedure, which can take anywhere from 6-8 hours and often produce up to 1 million images, necessitating automated analysis. Additionally, the variability of these images, combined with the need for expert annotations and the scarcity of large, high-quality labeled datasets, constrains the effectiveness of current medical image analysis models. To address this, we introduce a novel large gastrointestinal endoscopy dataset, called EndoExtend24, created by merging and re-stratifying the train/test splits of ten existing public and private datasets, ensuring no overlap of patient data across splits. EndoExtend24 includes over 226,000 labeled images, as well as dynamic class mappings, which allow unified training across datasets with differing labeling granularity, supporting up to 123 distinct pathological findings. Further, we propose to leverage domain adaptive pre-training of foundation models in computer vision trained with self-supervision on generic image data, to adapt them to the task of GIE medical diagnosis. Specifically, the EVA-02 model, which is based on the vision transformer architecture and was trained on ImageNet-22k with masked image modeling (using EVA-CLIP as a MIM teacher), is pre-trained on the novel EndoExtend24 dataset to achieve domain adaptation, and finally trained on the Capsule Endoscopy 2024 Challenge dataset. Experimental results demonstrate strong performance with an F1 score of 0.88, an improvement of about 39% over the baseline model's F1 score of 0.49. Additionally, the model achieved a macro AUC score of 0.993 and a balanced accuracy of 89.3%.</p></details> |  |
| **[Probabilistic Conceptual Explainers: Trustworthy Conceptual Explanations for Vision Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12649v3)** | 2024-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision transformers (ViTs) have emerged as a significant area of focus, particularly for their capacity to be jointly trained with large language models and to serve as robust vision foundation models. Yet, the development of trustworthy explanation methods for ViTs has lagged, particularly in the context of post-hoc interpretations of ViT predictions. Existing sub-image selection approaches, such as feature-attribution and conceptual models, fall short in this regard. This paper proposes five desiderata for explaining ViTs -- faithfulness, stability, sparsity, multi-level structure, and parsimony -- and demonstrates the inadequacy of current methods in meeting these criteria comprehensively. We introduce a variational Bayesian explanation framework, dubbed ProbAbilistic Concept Explainers (PACE), which models the distributions of patch embeddings to provide trustworthy post-hoc conceptual explanations. Our qualitative analysis reveals the distributions of patch-level concepts, elucidating the effectiveness of ViTs by modeling the joint distribution of patch embeddings and ViT's predictions. Moreover, these patch-level explanations bridge the gap between image-level and dataset-level explanations, thus completing the multi-level structure of PACE. Through extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets, we demonstrate that PACE surpasses state-of-the-art methods in terms of the defined desiderata.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proce...</summary><p>Proceedings of the 41st International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2024)</p></details> |

Evaluating Cell AI Foundation Models in Kidney Pathology with Human-in-the-Loop Enrichment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00078v1)** | 2024-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training AI foundation models has emerged as a promising large-scale learning approach for addressing real-world healthcare challenges, including digital pathology. While many of these models have been developed for tasks like disease diagnosis and tissue quantification using extensive and diverse training datasets, their readiness for deployment on some arguably simplest tasks, such as nuclei segmentation within a single organ (e.g., the kidney), remains uncertain. This paper seeks to answer this key question, "How good are we?", by thoroughly evaluating the performance of recent cell foundation models on a curated multi-center, multi-disease, and multi-species external testing dataset. Additionally, we tackle a more challenging question, "How can we improve?", by developing and assessing human-in-the-loop data enrichment strategies aimed at enhancing model performance while minimizing the reliance on pixel-level human annotation. To address the first question, we curated a multicenter, multidisease, and multispecies dataset consisting of 2,542 kidney whole slide images (WSIs). Three state-of-the-art (SOTA) cell foundation models-Cellpose, StarDist, and CellViT-were selected for evaluation. To tackle the second question, we explored data enrichment algorithms by distilling predictions from the different foundation models with a human-in-the-loop framework, aiming to further enhance foundation model performance with minimal human efforts. Our experimental results showed that all three foundation models improved over their baselines with model fine-tuning with enriched data. Interestingly, the baseline model with the highest F1 score does not yield the best segmentation outcomes after fine-tuning. This study establishes a benchmark for the development and deployment of cell vision foundation models tailored for real-world data applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[In-Context Fine-Tuning for Time-Series Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24087v1)** | 2024-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motivated by the recent success of time-series foundation models for zero-shot forecasting, we present a methodology for $\textit{in-context fine-tuning}$ of a time-series foundation model. In particular, we design a pretrained foundation model that can be prompted (at inference time) with multiple time-series examples, in order to forecast a target time-series into the future. Our foundation model is specifically trained to utilize examples from multiple related time-series in its context window (in addition to the history of the target time-series) to help it adapt to the specific distribution of the target domain at inference time. We show that such a foundation model that uses in-context examples at inference time can obtain much better performance on popular forecasting benchmarks compared to supervised deep learning methods, statistical models, as well as other time-series foundation models. Interestingly, our in-context fine-tuning approach even rivals the performance of a foundation model that is explicitly fine-tuned on the target domain.</p></details> |  |

Despite the substantial domain gaps in RS images that are characterized by variabilities such as location, wavelength, and sensor type, research in this area remains underexplored: (1) Current cross-domain methods primarily focus on Domain Adaptation (DA), which adapts models to predefined domains rather than to unseen ones; (2) Few studies targeting the RSDG issue, especially for semantic segmentation tasks, where existing models are developed for specific unknown domains, struggling with issues of underfitting on other unknown scenarios; (3) Existing RS foundation models tend to prioritize in-domain performance over cross-domain generalization. To this end, we introduce the first vision foundation model for RSDG semantic segmentation, CrossEarth. CrossEarth demonstrates strong cross-domain generalization through a specially designed data-level Earth-Style Injection pipeline and a model-level Multi-Task Training pipeline. In addition, for the semantic segmentation task, we have curated an RSDG benchmark comprising 28 cross-domain settings across various regions, spectral bands, platforms, and climates, providing a comprehensive framework for testing the generalizability of future RSDG models. Extensive experiments on this benchmark demonstrate the superiority of CrossEarth over existing state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>The c...</summary><p>The codes and models will be available at https://github.com/Cuzyoung/CrossEarth</p></details> |

While the emergence of large language models (LLMs) and multimodal large language models (MM-LLMs) propels advancements in artificial general intelligence through their versatile capabilities, they still lack true any-to-any understanding and generation. Recently, the release of GPT-4o has showcased the remarkable potential of any-to-any LLMs for complex real-world tasks, enabling omnidirectional input and output across images, speech, and text. However, it is closed-source and does not support the generation of multimodal interleaved sequences. To address this gap, we present MIO, which is trained on a mixture of discrete tokens across four modalities using causal multimodal modeling. MIO undergoes a four-stage training process: (1) alignment pre-training, (2) interleaved pre-training, (3) speech-enhanced pre-training, and (4) comprehensive supervised fine-tuning on diverse textual, visual, and speech tasks. Our experimental results indicate that MIO exhibits competitive, and in some cases superior, performance compared to previous dual-modal baselines, any-to-any model baselines, and even modality-specific baselines. Moreover, MIO demonstrates advanced capabilities inherent to its any-to-any feature, such as interleaved video-text generation, chain-of-visual-thought reasoning, visual guideline generation, instructional image editing, etc.</p></details> | <details><summary>Techn...</summary><p>Technical Report.

In real-world environments, the object detection and segmentation performance can lead to a major drop, preventing the use of semantic mapping in a wider domain. On the other hand, the development of vision-language foundation models demonstrates a strong zero-shot transferability across data distribution. It provides an opportunity to construct generalizable instance-aware semantic maps. Hence, this work explores how to boost instance-aware semantic mapping from object detection generated from foundation models. We propose a probabilistic label fusion method to predict close-set semantic classes from open-set label measurements. An instance refinement module merges the over-segmented instances caused by inconsistent segmentation. We integrate all the modules into a unified semantic mapping system. Reading a sequence of RGB-D input, our work incrementally reconstructs an instance-aware semantic map. We evaluate the zero-shot performance of our method in ScanNet and SceneNN datasets. Our method achieves 40.3 mean average precision (mAP) on the ScanNet semantic instance segmentation task. It outperforms the traditional semantic mapping method significantly.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in IEEE RAL</p></details> |

Our method is a generalizable feedforward model that predicts a rich neural scene representation from sparse, single-frame multi-view camera inputs with limited view overlap, and is trained self-supervised with differentiable rendering to reconstruct RGB, depth, or feature images. Our first insight is to exploit per-scene optimized Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) by generating dense depth and virtual camera targets from them, which helps our model to learn enhanced 3D geometry from sparse non-overlapping image inputs. Second, to learn a semantically rich 3D representation, we propose distilling features from pre-trained 2D foundation models, such as CLIP or DINOv2, thereby enabling various downstream tasks without the need for costly 3D human annotations. To leverage these two insights, we introduce a novel model architecture with a two-stage lift-splat-shoot encoder and a parameterized sparse hierarchical voxel representation. Experimental results on the NuScenes and Waymo NOTR datasets demonstrate that DistillNeRF significantly outperforms existing comparable state-of-the-art self-supervised methods for scene reconstruction, novel view synthesis, and depth estimation; and it allows for competitive zero-shot 3D semantic occupancy prediction, as well as open-world scene understanding through distilled foundation model features.

Reinforcement learning (RL) is hard to scale up as it requires a complex reward design for each task. In contrast, language can specify tasks in a more natural way. Current foundation vision-language models (VLMs) generally require fine-tuning or other adaptations to be adopted in embodied contexts, due to the significant domain gap. However, the lack of multimodal data in such domains represents an obstacle to developing foundation models for embodied applications. In this work, we overcome these problems by presenting multimodal-foundation world models, able to connect and align the representation of foundation VLMs with the latent space of generative world models for RL, without any language annotations. The resulting agent learning framework, GenRL, allows one to specify tasks through vision and/or language prompts, ground them in the embodied domain's dynamics, and learn the corresponding behaviors in imagination. As assessed through large-scale multi-task benchmarking in locomotion and manipulation domains, GenRL enables multi-task generalization from language and visual prompts. Furthermore, by introducing a data-free policy learning strategy, our approach lays the groundwork for foundational policy learning using generative world models.

Although medical foundation models have emerged, solutions for cardiac imaging, especially echocardiography videos, are still unexplored. In this paper, we introduce EchoFM, a foundation model specifically designed to represent and analyze echocardiography videos. In EchoFM, we propose a self-supervised learning framework that captures both spatial and temporal variability patterns through a spatio-temporal consistent masking strategy and periodic-driven contrastive learning. This framework can effectively capture the spatio-temporal dynamics of echocardiography and learn the representative video features without any labels. We pre-train our model on an extensive dataset comprising over 290,000 echocardiography videos covering 26 scan views across different imaging modes, with up to 20 million frames of images. The pre-trained EchoFM can then be easily adapted and fine-tuned for a variety of downstream tasks, serving as a robust backbone model. Our evaluation was systemically designed for four downstream tasks after the echocardiography examination routine. Experiment results show that EchoFM surpasses state-of-the-art methods, including specialized echocardiography methods, self-supervised pre-training models, and general-purposed pre-trained foundation models, across all downstream tasks.</p></details> |  |

In this survey, we review the recent advances and discuss future directions for autoregressive vision foundation models. First, we present the trend for next generation of vision foundation models, i.e., unifying both understanding and generation in vision tasks. We then analyze the limitations of existing vision foundation models, and present a formal definition of autoregression with its advantages. Later, we categorize autoregressive vision foundation models from their vision tokenizers and autoregression backbones. Finally, we discuss several promising research challenges and directions.

However, how well do the models truly perform visual temporal reasoning? Our study of existing benchmarks shows that this capability of MFMs is likely overestimated as many questions can be solved by using a single, few, or out-of-order frames. To systematically examine current visual temporal reasoning tasks, we propose three principles with corresponding metrics: (1) Multi-Frame Gain, (2) Frame Order Sensitivity, and (3) Frame Information Disparity. Following these principles, we introduce TOMATO, Temporal Reasoning Multimodal Evaluation, a novel benchmark crafted to rigorously assess MFMs' temporal reasoning capabilities in video understanding. TOMATO comprises 1,484 carefully curated, human-annotated questions spanning six tasks (i.e., action count, direction, rotation, shape & trend, velocity & frequency, and visual cues), applied to 1,417 videos, including 805 self-recorded and -generated videos, that encompass human-centric, real-world, and simulated scenarios. Our comprehensive evaluation reveals a human-model performance gap of 57.3% with the best-performing model. Moreover, our in-depth analysis uncovers more fundamental limitations beyond this gap in current MFMs. While they can accurately recognize events in isolated frames, they fail to interpret these frames as a continuous sequence. We believe TOMATO will serve as a crucial testbed for evaluating the next-generation MFMs and as a call to the community to develop AI systems capable of comprehending human world dynamics through the video modality.</p></details> |  |
| **[Partial Channel Dependence with Channel Masks for Time Series Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23222v1)** | 2024-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in foundation models have been successfully extended to the time series (TS) domain, facilitated by the emergence of large-scale TS datasets. However, previous efforts have primarily focused on designing model architectures to address explicit heterogeneity among datasets such as various numbers of channels, while often overlooking implicit heterogeneity such as varying dependencies between channels. In this work, we introduce the concept of partial channel dependence (PCD), which enables a more sophisticated adjustment of channel dependencies based on dataset-specific information. To achieve PCD, we propose a channel mask that captures the relationships between channels within a dataset using two key components: 1) a correlation matrix that encodes relative dependencies between channels, and 2) domain parameters that learn the absolute dependencies specific to each dataset, refining the correlation matrix. We validate the effectiveness of PCD across four tasks in TS including forecasting, classification, imputation, and anomaly detection, under diverse settings, including few-shot and zero-shot scenarios with both TS foundation models and single-task models.

Practitioners are often reluctant to use open-source VLMs due to their significant performance lag compared to their closed-source counterparts, particularly in GUI grounding and Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) scenarios. To facilitate future research in this area, we developed OS-Atlas - a foundational GUI action model that excels at GUI grounding and OOD agentic tasks through innovations in both data and modeling. We have invested significant engineering effort in developing an open-source toolkit for synthesizing GUI grounding data across multiple platforms, including Windows, Linux, MacOS, Android, and the web. Leveraging this toolkit, we are releasing the largest open-source cross-platform GUI grounding corpus to date, which contains over 13 million GUI elements. This dataset, combined with innovations in model training, provides a solid foundation for OS-Atlas to understand GUI screenshots and generalize to unseen interfaces. Through extensive evaluation across six benchmarks spanning three different platforms (mobile, desktop, and web), OS-Atlas demonstrates significant performance improvements over previous state-of-the-art models. Our evaluation also uncovers valuable insights into continuously improving and scaling the agentic capabilities of open-source VLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Source Code Foundation Models are Transferable Binary Analysis Knowledge Bases](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19581v2)** | 2024-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human-Oriented Binary Reverse Engineering (HOBRE) lies at the intersection of binary and source code, aiming to lift binary code to human-readable content relevant to source code, thereby bridging the binary-source semantic gap. Recent advancements in uni-modal code model pre-training, particularly in generative Source Code Foundation Models (SCFMs) and binary understanding models, have laid the groundwork for transfer learning applicable to HOBRE. However, existing approaches for HOBRE rely heavily on uni-modal models like SCFMs for supervised fine-tuning or general LLMs for prompting, resulting in sub-optimal performance. Inspired by recent progress in large multi-modal models, we propose that it is possible to harness the strengths of uni-modal code models from both sides to bridge the semantic gap effectively. In this paper, we introduce a novel probe-and-recover framework that incorporates a binary-source encoder-decoder model and black-box LLMs for binary analysis. Our approach leverages the pre-trained knowledge within SCFMs to synthesize relevant, symbol-rich code fragments as context. This additional context enables black-box LLMs to enhance recovery accuracy. We demonstrate significant improvements in zero-shot binary summarization and binary function name recovery, with a 10.3% relative gain in CHRF and a 16.7% relative gain in a GPT4-based metric for summarization, as well as a 6.7% and 7.4% absolute increase in token-level precision and recall for name recovery, respectively. These results highlight the effectiveness of our approach in automating and improving binary code analysis.</p></details> |  |

Temporal search trends have been successfully used in time series modeling across a variety of domains such as infectious diseases, unemployment rates, and retail sales. However, most existing applications require curating specialized datasets of individual keywords, queries, or query clusters, and the search data need to be temporally aligned with the outcome variable of interest. We propose a novel approach for generating an aggregated and anonymized representation of search interest as foundation features at the community level for geospatial modeling. We benchmark these features using spatial datasets across multiple domains. In zip codes with a population greater than 3000 that cover over 95% of the contiguous US population, our models for predicting missing values in a 20% set of holdout counties achieve an average $R^2$ score of 0.74 across 21 health variables, and 0.80 across 6 demographic and environmental variables.

However, these pretrained models require multiple stages of fine-tuning to become effective for downstream applications. Conventionally, the model is first retrained on the aggregate of a diverse set of tasks of interest and then adapted to specific low-resource downstream tasks by utilizing a parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) scheme. While this two-phase procedure seems reasonable, the independence of the retraining and fine-tuning phases causes a major issue, as there is no guarantee the retrained model will achieve good performance post-fine-tuning. To explicitly address this issue, we introduce a meta-learning framework infused with PEFT in this intermediate retraining stage to learn a model that can be easily adapted to unseen tasks. For our theoretical results, we focus on linear models using low-rank adaptations. In this setting, we demonstrate the suboptimality of standard retraining for finding an adaptable set of parameters. Further, we prove that our method recovers the optimally adaptable parameters. We then apply these theoretical insights to retraining the RoBERTa model to predict the continuation of conversations between different personas within the ConvAI2 dataset. Empirically, we observe significant performance benefits using our proposed meta-learning scheme during retraining relative to the conventional approach.</p></details> | Preprint |

However, current TAG approaches face two primary challenges: (i) Heavy reliance on label information and (ii) Limited cross-domain zero/few-shot transferability. These issues constrain the scaling of both data and model size, owing to high labor costs and scaling laws, complicating the development of graph foundation models with strong transferability. In this work, we propose the GraphCLIP framework to address these challenges by learning graph foundation models with strong cross-domain zero/few-shot transferability through a self-supervised contrastive graph-summary pretraining method. Specifically, we generate and curate large-scale graph-summary pair data with the assistance of LLMs, and introduce a novel graph-summary pretraining method, combined with invariant learning, to enhance graph foundation models with strong cross-domain zero-shot transferability. For few-shot learning, we propose a novel graph prompt tuning technique aligned with our pretraining objective to mitigate catastrophic forgetting and minimize learning costs. Extensive experiments show the superiority of GraphCLIP in both zero-shot and few-shot settings, while evaluations across various downstream tasks confirm the versatility of GraphCLIP.

While depth and normal are geometrically related and highly complimentary, they present distinct challenges. SoTA monocular depth methods achieve zero-shot generalization by learning affine-invariant depths, which cannot recover real-world metrics. Meanwhile, SoTA normal estimation methods have limited zero-shot performance due to the lack of large-scale labeled data. To tackle these issues, we propose solutions for both metric depth estimation and surface normal estimation. For metric depth estimation, we show that the key to a zero-shot single-view model lies in resolving the metric ambiguity from various camera models and large-scale data training. We propose a canonical camera space transformation module, which explicitly addresses the ambiguity problem and can be effortlessly plugged into existing monocular models. For surface normal estimation, we propose a joint depth-normal optimization module to distill diverse data knowledge from metric depth, enabling normal estimators to learn beyond normal labels. Equipped with these modules, our depth-normal models can be stably trained with over 16 million of images from thousands of camera models with different-type annotations, resulting in zero-shot generalization to in-the-wild images with unseen camera settings. Our method enables the accurate recovery of metric 3D structures on randomly collected internet images, paving the way for plausible single-image metrology.

In the medical domain, however, the development of comprehensive foundation models is constrained by limited access to diverse modalities and stringent privacy regulations. To address these constraints, this study introduces a novel knowledge injection approach, FedKIM, designed to scale the medical foundation model within a federated learning framework. FedKIM leverages lightweight local models to extract healthcare knowledge from private data and integrates this knowledge into a centralized foundation model using a designed adaptive Multitask Multimodal Mixture Of Experts (M3OE) module. This method not only preserves privacy but also enhances the model's ability to handle complex medical tasks involving multiple modalities. Our extensive experiments across twelve tasks in seven modalities demonstrate the effectiveness of FedKIM in various settings, highlighting its potential to scale medical foundation models without direct access to sensitive data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by EMNLP'24 Main</p></details> |
| **[Image Segmentation in Foundation Model Era: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12957v2)** | 2024-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image segmentation is a long-standing challenge in computer vision, studied continuously over several decades, as evidenced by seminal algorithms such as N-Cut, FCN, and MaskFormer. With the advent of foundation models (FMs), contemporary segmentation methodologies have embarked on a new epoch by either adapting FMs (e.g., CLIP, Stable Diffusion, DINO) for image segmentation or developing dedicated segmentation foundation models (e.g., SAM). These approaches not only deliver superior segmentation performance, but also herald newfound segmentation capabilities previously unseen in deep learning context. However, current research in image segmentation lacks a detailed analysis of distinct characteristics, challenges, and solutions associated with these advancements. This survey seeks to fill this gap by providing a thorough review of cutting-edge research centered around FM-driven image segmentation. We investigate two basic lines of research -- generic image segmentation (i.e., semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, panoptic segmentation), and promptable image segmentation (i.e., interactive segmentation, referring segmentation, few-shot segmentation) -- by delineating their respective task settings, background concepts, and key challenges. Furthermore, we provide insights into the emergence of segmentation knowledge from FMs like CLIP, Stable Diffusion, and DINO. An exhaustive overview of over 300 segmentation approaches is provided to encapsulate the breadth of current research efforts. Subsequently, we engage in a discussion of open issues and potential avenues for future research. We envisage that this fresh, comprehensive, and systematic survey catalyzes the evolution of advanced image segmentation systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>A com...</summary><p>A comprehensive survey of image segmentation in foundation model era</p></details> |

We compare 13 feature extractor models, including ImageNet-pretrained networks, and histopathology foundation models trained on both public and proprietary data, on Rheumatoid Arthritis subtyping and Sjogren's Disease detection tasks. Using a simple Attention-Based Multiple Instance Learning classifier, we assess the transferability of learned representations from cancer H&E images to autoimmune IHC images. Contrary to expectations, histopathology-pretrained models did not significantly outperform ImageNet-pretrained models. Furthermore, there was evidence of both autoimmune feature misinterpretation and biased feature importance. Our findings highlight the challenges in transferring knowledge from cancer to autoimmune histopathology and emphasise the need for careful evaluation of AI models across diverse histopathological tasks.

| **[Variational Language Concepts for Interpreting Foundation Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03964v2)** | 2024-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation Language Models (FLMs) such as BERT and its variants have achieved remarkable success in natural language processing. To date, the interpretability of FLMs has primarily relied on the attention weights in their self-attention layers. However, these attention weights only provide word-level interpretations, failing to capture higher-level structures, and are therefore lacking in readability and intuitiveness. To address this challenge, we first provide a formal definition of conceptual interpretation and then propose a variational Bayesian framework, dubbed VAriational Language Concept (VALC), to go beyond word-level interpretations and provide concept-level interpretations. Our theoretical analysis shows that our VALC finds the optimal language concepts to interpret FLM predictions. Empirical results on several real-world datasets show that our method can successfully provide conceptual interpretation for FLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at EMNLP 2024 Findings</p></details> |
| **[Quantum Spread-Spectrum CDMA Communication Systems: Mathematical Foundations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21450v1)** | 2024-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper describes the fundamental principles and mathematical foundations of quantum spread spectrum code division multiple access (QCDMA) communication systems. The evolution of quantum signals through the direct-sequence spread spectrum multiple access communication system is carefully characterized by a novel approach called the decomposition of creation operators. In this methodology, the creation operator of the transmitted quantum signal is decomposed into the chip-time interval creation operators each of which is defined over the duration of a chip. These chip-time interval creation operators are the invariant building blocks of the spread spectrum quantum communication systems. With the aid of the proposed chip-time decomposition approach, we can find closed-form relations for quantum signals at the receiver of such a quantum communication system. Further, the paper details the principles of narrow-band filtering of quantum signals required at the receiver, a crucial step in designing and analyzing quantum communication systems. We show that by employing coherent states as the transmitted quantum signals, the inter-user interference appears as an additive term in the magnitude of the output coherent (Glauber) state, and the output of the quantum communication system is a pure quantum signal. On the other hand, if the transmitters utilize particle-like quantum signals (Fock states) such as single photon states, entanglement and a spread spectrum version of the Hong-Ou-Mandel effect can arise at the receivers. The important techniques developed in this paper are expected to have far-reaching implications for various applications in the exciting field of quantum communication and signal processing.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Foundation Model for Chemical Design and Property Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21422v1)** | 2024-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Artificial intelligence (AI) has significantly advanced computational chemistry research. However, traditional AI methods often rely on task-specific model designs and training, which constrain both the scalability of model size and generalization across different tasks. Here, we introduce ChemFM, a large-scale foundation model specifically developed for chemistry, comprising up to 3 billion parameters. ChemFM is pre-trained on 178 million molecules using self-supervised causal language modeling to extract generalizable molecular representations. This model can be adapted to diverse downstream chemical applications using both full-parameter and parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods. ChemFM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across multiple chemical tasks. Notably, it achieves up to 67.48% performance improvement across 34 property prediction benchmarks, up to 33.31% reduction in mean average deviation between conditioned and actual properties of generated molecules in conditional molecular generation tasks, and up to 3.7% top-1 accuracy improvement across 4 reaction prediction datasets. Moreover, ChemFM demonstrates superior performance in predicting antibiotic activity and cytotoxicity, highlighting its potential to advance the discovery of novel antibiotics. We anticipate that ChemFM will significantly advance chemistry research by providing a foundation model capable of effectively generalizing across a broad range of tasks with minimal additional training.</p></details> |  |
| **[AutoGLM: Autonomous Foundation Agents for GUIs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00820v1)** | 2024-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present AutoGLM, a new series in the ChatGLM family, designed to serve as foundation agents for autonomous control of digital devices through Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs). While foundation models excel at acquiring human knowledge, they often struggle with decision-making in dynamic real-world environments, limiting their progress toward artificial general intelligence. This limitation underscores the importance of developing foundation agents capable of learning through autonomous environmental interactions by reinforcing existing models. Focusing on Web Browser and Phone as representative GUI scenarios, we have developed AutoGLM as a practical foundation agent system for real-world GUI interactions. Our approach integrates a comprehensive suite of techniques and infrastructures to create deployable agent systems suitable for user delivery. Through this development, we have derived two key insights: First, the design of an appropriate "intermediate interface" for GUI control is crucial, enabling the separation of planning and grounding behaviors, which require distinct optimization for flexibility and accuracy respectively. Second, we have developed a novel progressive training framework that enables self-evolving online curriculum reinforcement learning for AutoGLM. Our evaluations demonstrate AutoGLM's effectiveness across multiple domains. For web browsing, AutoGLM achieves a 55.2% success rate on VAB-WebArena-Lite (improving to 59.1% with a second attempt) and 96.2% on OpenTable evaluation tasks. In Android device control, AutoGLM attains a 36.2% success rate on AndroidLab (VAB-Mobile) and 89.7% on common tasks in popular Chinese APPs.</p></details> |  |

Our approach introduces a multi-expert decision framework to address the nonsensical or irrelevant reasoning often seen in foundation model-based systems. The method comprises two key components: Diversified Expert Frontier Analysis (DEFA) and Consensus Decision Making (CDM). DEFA utilizes three expert models: furniture arrangement, room type analysis, and visual scene reasoning, while CDM aggregates their outputs, prioritizing unanimous or majority consensus for more reliable decisions. Demonstrating state-of-the-art performance on the RoboTHOR and HM3D datasets, our method excels at navigating towards untrained objects or goals and outperforms various baselines, showcasing its adaptability to dynamic real-world conditions and superior generalization capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 5 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

Foundation models, pre-trained on vast and varied datasets, can be used in a zero-shot setting with relatively minimal data or further improved through finetuning. We compare the performance of Google's model, called TimesFM, against conventional parametric and non-parametric models, including GARCH, Generalized Autoregressive Score (GAS), and empirical quantile estimates, using daily returns from the S\&P 100 index and its constituents over 19 years. Our backtesting results indicate that in terms of the actual-over-expected ratio the fine-tuned TimesFM model consistently outperforms traditional methods. Regarding the quantile score loss function, it achieves performance comparable to the best econometric approach, the GAS model. Overall, the foundation model is either the best or among the top performers in forecasting VaR across the 0.01, 0.025, 0.05, and 0.1 VaR levels. We also found that fine-tuning significantly improves the results, and the model should not be used in zero-shot settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Lotus: Diffusion-based Visual Foundation Model for High-quality Dense Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18124v4)** | 2024-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Leveraging the visual priors of pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models offers a promising solution to enhance zero-shot generalization in dense prediction tasks. However, existing methods often uncritically use the original diffusion formulation, which may not be optimal due to the fundamental differences between dense prediction and image generation. In this paper, we provide a systemic analysis of the diffusion formulation for the dense prediction, focusing on both quality and efficiency. And we find that the original parameterization type for image generation, which learns to predict noise, is harmful for dense prediction; the multi-step noising/denoising diffusion process is also unnecessary and challenging to optimize. Based on these insights, we introduce Lotus, a diffusion-based visual foundation model with a simple yet effective adaptation protocol for dense prediction. Specifically, Lotus is trained to directly predict annotations instead of noise, thereby avoiding harmful variance. We also reformulate the diffusion process into a single-step procedure, simplifying optimization and significantly boosting inference speed. Additionally, we introduce a novel tuning strategy called detail preserver, which achieves more accurate and fine-grained predictions. Without scaling up the training data or model capacity, Lotus achieves SoTA performance in zero-shot depth and normal estimation across various datasets. It also enhances efficiency, being significantly faster than most existing diffusion-based methods. Lotus' superior quality and efficiency also enable a wide range of practical applications, such as joint estimation, single/multi-view 3D reconstruction, etc. Project page: https://lotus3d.github.io/.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The first two authors contributed equally.
