| **[Unified Spatial-Temporal Edge-Enhanced Graph Networks for Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02504v1)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pedestrian trajectory prediction aims to forecast future movements based on historical paths. Spatial-temporal (ST) methods often separately model spatial interactions among pedestrians and temporal dependencies of individuals. They overlook the direct impacts of interactions among different pedestrians across various time steps (i.e., high-order cross-time interactions). This limits their ability to capture ST inter-dependencies and hinders prediction performance. To address these limitations, we propose UniEdge with three major designs. Firstly, we introduce a unified ST graph data structure that simplifies high-order cross-time interactions into first-order relationships, enabling the learning of ST inter-dependencies in a single step. This avoids the information loss caused by multi-step aggregation. Secondly, traditional GNNs focus on aggregating pedestrian node features, neglecting the propagation of implicit interaction patterns encoded in edge features. We propose the Edge-to-Edge-Node-to-Node Graph Convolution (E2E-N2N-GCN), a novel dual-graph network that jointly models explicit N2N social interactions among pedestrians and implicit E2E influence propagation across these interaction patterns. Finally, to overcome the limited receptive fields and challenges in capturing long-range dependencies of auto-regressive architectures, we introduce a transformer encoder-based predictor that enables global modeling of temporal correlation. UniEdge outperforms state-of-the-arts on multiple datasets, including ETH, UCY, and SDD.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion Transformer Captures Spatial-Temporal Dependencies: A Theory for Gaussian Process Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16134v2)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion Transformer, the backbone of Sora for video generation, successfully scales the capacity of diffusion models, pioneering new avenues for high-fidelity sequential data generation. Unlike static data such as images, sequential data consists of consecutive data frames indexed by time, exhibiting rich spatial and temporal dependencies. These dependencies represent the underlying dynamic model and are critical to validate the generated data. In this paper, we make the first theoretical step towards bridging diffusion transformers for capturing spatial-temporal dependencies. Specifically, we establish score approximation and distribution estimation guarantees of diffusion transformers for learning Gaussian process data with covariance functions of various decay patterns. We highlight how the spatial-temporal dependencies are captured and affect learning efficiency. Our study proposes a novel transformer approximation theory, where the transformer acts to unroll an algorithm. We support our theoretical results by numerical experiments, providing strong evidence that spatial-temporal dependencies are captured within attention layers, aligning with our approximation theory.</p></details> | 56 pages, 13 figures |
| **[DCT-Mamba3D: Spectral Decorrelation and Spatial-Spectral Feature Extraction for Hyperspectral Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01986v1)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hyperspectral image classification presents challenges due to spectral redundancy and complex spatial-spectral dependencies. This paper proposes a novel framework, DCT-Mamba3D, for hyperspectral image classification. DCT-Mamba3D incorporates: (1) a 3D spectral-spatial decorrelation module that applies 3D discrete cosine transform basis functions to reduce both spectral and spatial redundancy, enhancing feature clarity across dimensions; (2) a 3D-Mamba module that leverages a bidirectional state-space model to capture intricate spatial-spectral dependencies; and (3) a global residual enhancement module that stabilizes feature representation, improving robustness and convergence. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show that our DCT-Mamba3D outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in challenging scenarios such as the same object in different spectra and different objects in the same spectra.</p></details> |  |
| **[SPFFNet: Strip Perception and Feature Fusion Spatial Pyramid Pooling for Fabric Defect Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01445v2)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Defect detection in fabrics is critical for quality control, yet existing methods often struggle with complex backgrounds and shape-specific defects. In this paper, we propose an improved fabric defect detection model based on YOLOv11. To enhance the detection of strip defects, we introduce a Strip Perception Module (SPM) that improves feature capture through multi-scale convolution. We further enhance the spatial pyramid pooling fast (SPPF) by integrating a squeeze-and-excitation mechanism, resulting in the SE-SPPF module, which better integrates spatial and channel information for more effective defect feature extraction. Additionally, we propose a novel focal enhanced complete intersection over union (FECIoU) metric with adaptive weights, addressing scale differences and class imbalance by adjusting the weights of hard-to-detect instances through focal loss. Experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves a 0.8-8.1% improvement in mean average precision (mAP) on the Tianchi dataset and a 1.6-13.2% improvement on our custom dataset, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 4 figures, conference</p></details> |
| **[Texture Image Synthesis Using Spatial GAN Based on Vision Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01842v1)** | 2025-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Texture synthesis is a fundamental task in computer vision, whose goal is to generate visually realistic and structurally coherent textures for a wide range of applications, from graphics to scientific simulations. While traditional methods like tiling and patch-based techniques often struggle with complex textures, recent advancements in deep learning have transformed this field. In this paper, we propose ViT-SGAN, a new hybrid model that fuses Vision Transformers (ViTs) with a Spatial Generative Adversarial Network (SGAN) to address the limitations of previous methods. By incorporating specialized texture descriptors such as mean-variance (mu, sigma) and textons into the self-attention mechanism of ViTs, our model achieves superior texture synthesis. This approach enhances the model's capacity to capture complex spatial dependencies, leading to improved texture quality that is superior to state-of-the-art models, especially for regular and irregular textures. Comparison experiments with metrics such as FID, IS, SSIM, and LPIPS demonstrate the substantial improvement of ViT-SGAN, which underlines its efficiency in generating diverse realistic textures.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at the 2nd International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Software Engineering (AI-SOFT), Shiraz University, Shiraz, Iran, 2024</p></details> |
| **[TESS: A Scalable Temporally and Spatially Local Learning Rule for Spiking Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01837v1)** | 2025-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The demand for low-power inference and training of deep neural networks (DNNs) on edge devices has intensified the need for algorithms that are both scalable and energy-efficient. While spiking neural networks (SNNs) allow for efficient inference by processing complex spatio-temporal dynamics in an event-driven fashion, training them on resource-constrained devices remains challenging due to the high computational and memory demands of conventional error backpropagation (BP)-based approaches. In this work, we draw inspiration from biological mechanisms such as eligibility traces, spike-timing-dependent plasticity, and neural activity synchronization to introduce TESS, a temporally and spatially local learning rule for training SNNs. Our approach addresses both temporal and spatial credit assignments by relying solely on locally available signals within each neuron, thereby allowing computational and memory overheads to scale linearly with the number of neurons, independently of the number of time steps. Despite relying on local mechanisms, we demonstrate performance comparable to the backpropagation through time (BPTT) algorithm, within $\sim1.4$ accuracy points on challenging computer vision scenarios relevant at the edge, such as the IBM DVS Gesture dataset, CIFAR10-DVS, and temporal versions of CIFAR10, and CIFAR100. Being able to produce comparable performance to BPTT while keeping low time and memory complexity, TESS enables efficient and scalable on-device learning at the edge.</p></details> | 9 pages, 2 figures |
| **[Scalable 3D Gaussian Splatting-Based RF Signal Spatial Propagation Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01826v1)** | 2025-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Effective network planning and sensing in wireless networks require resource-intensive site surveys for data collection. An alternative is Radio-Frequency (RF) signal spatial propagation modeling, which computes received signals given transceiver positions in a scene (e.g.s a conference room). We identify a fundamental trade-off between scalability and fidelity in the state-of-the-art method. To address this issue, we explore leveraging 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), an advanced technique for the image synthesis of 3D scenes in real-time from arbitrary camera poses. By integrating domain-specific insights, we design three components for adapting 3DGS to the RF domain, including Gaussian-based RF scene representation, gradient-guided RF attribute learning, and RF-customized CUDA for ray tracing. Building on them, we develop RFSPM, an end-to-end framework for scalable RF signal Spatial Propagation Modeling. We evaluate RFSPM in four field studies and two applications across RFID, BLE, LoRa, and 5G, covering diverse frequencies, antennas, signals, and scenes. The results show that RFSPM matches the fidelity of the state-of-the-art method while reducing data requirements, training GPU-hours, and inference latency by up to 9.8\,$\times$, 18.6\,$\times$, and 84.4\,$\times$, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[Modeling Home Range and Intra-Specific Spatial Interaction in Wild Animal Populations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01694v2)** | 2025-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Interactions among individuals from the same-species of wild animals are an important component of population dynamics. An interaction can be either static (based on overlap of space use) or dynamic (based on movement). The goal of this work is to determine the level of static interactions between individuals from the same-species of wild animals using 95\% and 50\% home ranges, as well as to model their movement interactions, which could include attraction, avoidance (or repulsion), or lack of interaction, in order to gain new insights and improve our understanding of ecological processes. Home range estimation methods (minimum convex polygon, kernel density estimator, and autocorrelated kernel density estimator), inhomogeneous multitype (or cross-type) summary statistics, and envelope testing methods (pointwise and global envelope tests) were proposed to study the nature of the same-species wild-animal spatial interactions. This study provides comprehensive, self-contained methodological details for investigating spatial interactions between individuals of the same species in wildlife populations. Using GPS collar data, we applied the methods to quantify both static and dynamic interactions between black bears in southern Alabama, USA. In general, our findings suggest that the black bears in our dataset showed no significant preference to live together or apart, i.e., there was no significant deviation from independence toward association or avoidance (i.e., segregation) between the bears. This can be loosely interpreted to mean that a black bear is generally indifferent to the presence of other black bears living or wandering nearby.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sparse VideoGen: Accelerating Video Diffusion Transformers with Spatial-Temporal Sparsity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01776v1)** | 2025-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) dominate video generation but their high computational cost severely limits real-world applicability, usually requiring tens of minutes to generate a few seconds of video even on high-performance GPUs. This inefficiency primarily arises from the quadratic computational complexity of 3D Full Attention with respect to the context length. In this paper, we propose a training-free framework termed Sparse VideoGen (SVG) that leverages the inherent sparsity in 3D Full Attention to boost inference efficiency. We reveal that the attention heads can be dynamically classified into two groups depending on distinct sparse patterns: (1) Spatial Head, where only spatially-related tokens within each frame dominate the attention output, and (2) Temporal Head, where only temporally-related tokens across different frames dominate. Based on this insight, SVG proposes an online profiling strategy to capture the dynamic sparse patterns and predicts the type of attention head. Combined with a novel hardware-efficient tensor layout transformation and customized kernel implementations, SVG achieves up to 2.28x and 2.33x end-to-end speedup on CogVideoX-v1.5 and HunyuanVideo, respectively, while preserving generation quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 8 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[CATSplat: Context-Aware Transformer with Spatial Guidance for Generalizable 3D Gaussian Splatting from A Single-View Image](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12906v2)** | 2025-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, generalizable feed-forward methods based on 3D Gaussian Splatting have gained significant attention for their potential to reconstruct 3D scenes using finite resources. These approaches create a 3D radiance field, parameterized by per-pixel 3D Gaussian primitives, from just a few images in a single forward pass. However, unlike multi-view methods that benefit from cross-view correspondences, 3D scene reconstruction with a single-view image remains an underexplored area. In this work, we introduce CATSplat, a novel generalizable transformer-based framework designed to break through the inherent constraints in monocular settings. First, we propose leveraging textual guidance from a visual-language model to complement insufficient information from a single image. By incorporating scene-specific contextual details from text embeddings through cross-attention, we pave the way for context-aware 3D scene reconstruction beyond relying solely on visual cues. Moreover, we advocate utilizing spatial guidance from 3D point features toward comprehensive geometric understanding under single-view settings. With 3D priors, image features can capture rich structural insights for predicting 3D Gaussians without multi-view techniques. Extensive experiments on large-scale datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of CATSplat in single-view 3D scene reconstruction with high-quality novel view synthesis.</p></details> |  |
| **[Vulnerable Connectivity Caused by Local Communities in Spatial Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14513v3)** | 2025-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Local communities are widely observed in spatial networks. However, how such structure affects the vulnerability against malicious attacks remains unclear. This study investigates the impact of local communities on the robustness of connectivity by modeling planar infrastructure networks based on statistical population data. Our research reveals that the emergence of local communities is caused by spatial concentrations of nodes connected by short links, which significantly reduce the robustness. These results suggest that strategically establishing long distance links provides a feasible solution to balance reliability and construction costs in infrastructure network design.</p></details> | <details><summary>Modif...</summary><p>Modified from the first version</p></details> |
| **[VL-Nav: Real-time Vision-Language Navigation with Spatial Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00931v1)** | 2025-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language navigation in unknown environments is crucial for mobile robots. In scenarios such as household assistance and rescue, mobile robots need to understand a human command, such as "find a person wearing black". We present a novel vision-language navigation (VL-Nav) system that integrates efficient spatial reasoning on low-power robots. Unlike prior methods that rely on a single image-level feature similarity to guide a robot, we introduce the heuristic-vision-language (HVL) spatial reasoning for goal point selection. It combines pixel-wise vision-language features and heuristic exploration to enable efficient navigation to human-instructed instances in various environments robustly. We deploy VL-Nav on a four-wheel mobile robot and conduct comprehensive navigation tasks in various environments of different scales and semantic complexities, indoors and outdoors. Remarkably, VL-Nav operates at a real-time frequency of 30 Hz with a Jetson Orin NX, highlighting its ability to conduct efficient vision-language navigation. Experimental results show that VL-Nav achieves an overall success rate of 86.3%, outperforming previous methods by 44.15%.</p></details> |  |
| **[V2I-Calib++: A Multi-terminal Spatial Calibration Approach in Urban Intersections for Collaborative Perception](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11008v2)** | 2025-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Urban intersections, dense with pedestrian and vehicular traffic and compounded by GPS signal obstructions from high-rise buildings, are among the most challenging areas in urban traffic systems. Traditional single-vehicle intelligence systems often perform poorly in such environments due to a lack of global traffic flow information and the ability to respond to unexpected events. Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) technology, through real-time communication between vehicles (V2V) and vehicles to infrastructure (V2I), offers a robust solution. However, practical applications still face numerous challenges. Calibration among heterogeneous vehicle and infrastructure endpoints in multi-end LiDAR systems is crucial for ensuring the accuracy and consistency of perception system data. Most existing multi-end calibration methods rely on initial calibration values provided by positioning systems, but the instability of GPS signals due to high buildings in urban canyons poses severe challenges to these methods. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel multi-end LiDAR system calibration method that does not require positioning priors to determine initial external parameters and meets real-time requirements. Our method introduces an innovative multi-end perception object association technique, utilizing a new Overall Distance metric (oDist) to measure the spatial association between perception objects, and effectively combines global consistency search algorithms with optimal transport theory. By this means, we can extract co-observed targets from object association results for further external parameter computation and optimization. Extensive comparative and ablation experiments conducted on the simulated dataset V2X-Sim and the real dataset DAIR-V2X confirm the effectiveness and efficiency of our method. The code for this method can be accessed at: https://github.com/MassimoQu/v2i-calib.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploring Spatial Hybrid User Interface for Visual Sensemaking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00853v1)** | 2025-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We built a spatial hybrid system that combines a personal computer (PC) and virtual reality (VR) for visual sensemaking, addressing limitations in both environments. Although VR offers immense potential for interactive data visualization (e.g., large display space and spatial navigation), it can also present challenges such as imprecise interactions and user fatigue. At the same time, a PC offers precise and familiar interactions but has limited display space and interaction modality. Therefore, we iteratively designed a spatial hybrid system (PC+VR) to complement these two environments by enabling seamless switching between PC and VR environments. To evaluate the system's effectiveness and user experience, we compared it to using a single computing environment (i.e., PC-only and VR-only). Our study results (N=18) showed that spatial PC+VR could combine the benefits of both devices to outperform user preference for VR-only without a negative impact on performance from device switching overhead. Finally, we discussed future design implications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE TVCG</p></details> |
| **[S2CFormer: Reorienting Learned Image Compression from Spatial Interaction to Channel Aggregation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00700v1)** | 2025-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformers have achieved significant success in learned image compression (LIC), with Swin Transformers emerging as the mainstream choice for nonlinear transforms. A common belief is that their sophisticated spatial operations contribute most to their efficacy. However, the crucial role of the feed-forward network (FFN) based Channel Aggregation module within the transformer architecture has been largely overlooked, and the over-design of spatial operations leads to a suboptimal trade-off between decoding latency and R-D performance. In this paper, we reevaluate the key factors behind the competence of transformers in LIC. By replacing spatial operations with identity mapping, we are surprised to find that channel operations alone can approach the R-D performance of the leading methods. This solid lower bound of performance emphasizes that the presence of channel aggregation is more essential for the LIC model to achieve competitive performance, while the previously complex spatial interactions are partly redundant. Based on this insight, we initiate the "S2CFormer" paradigm, a general architecture that reorients the focus of LIC from Spatial Interaction to Channel Aggregation. We present two instantiations of the S2CFormer: S2C-Conv, and S2C-Attention. Each one incorporates a simple operator for spatial interaction and serves as nonlinear transform blocks for our LIC models. Both models demonstrate state-of-the-art (SOTA) R-D performance and significantly faster decoding speed. These results also motivate further exploration of advanced FFN structures to enhance the R-D performance while maintaining model efficiency. With these foundations, we introduce S2C-Hybrid, an enhanced LIC model that combines the strengths of different S2CFormer instantiations. This model outperforms all the existing methods on several datasets, setting a new benchmark for efficient and high-performance LIC.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning non-Gaussian spatial distributions via Bayesian transport maps with parametric shrinkage](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19208v2)** | 2025-02-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many applications, including climate-model analysis and stochastic weather generators, require learning or emulating the distribution of a high-dimensional and non-Gaussian spatial field based on relatively few training samples. To address this challenge, a recently proposed Bayesian transport map (BTM) approach consists of a triangular transport map with nonparametric Gaussian-process (GP) components, which is trained to transform the distribution of interest distribution to a Gaussian reference distribution. To improve the performance of this existing BTM, we propose to shrink the map components toward a ``base'' parametric Gaussian family combined with a Vecchia approximation for scalability. The resulting ShrinkTM approach is more accurate than the existing BTM, especially for small numbers of training samples. It can even outperform the ``base'' family when trained on a single sample of the spatial field. We demonstrate the advantage of ShrinkTM though numerical experiments on simulated data and on climate-model output.</p></details> |  |

GWR and MGWR provide simple implementation yet powerful frameworks that could be extended to various disciplines that handle spatial data. This bibliography aims to serve as a comprehensive compilation of peer-reviewed papers that have utilized GWR or MGWR as a primary analytical method to conduct spatial analyses and acts as a useful guide to anyone searching the literature for previous examples of local statistical modeling in a wide variety of application fields.</p></details> | 446 pages |
| **[Generic Multimodal Spatially Graph Network for Spatially Embedded Network Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00530v1)** | 2025-02-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatially embedded networks (SENs) represent a special type of complex graph, whose topologies are constrained by the networks' embedded spatial environments. The graph representation of such networks is thereby influenced by the embedded spatial features of both nodes and edges. Accurate network representation of the graph structure and graph features is a fundamental task for various graph-related tasks. In this study, a Generic Multimodal Spatially Graph Convolutional Network (GMu-SGCN) is developed for efficient representation of spatially embedded networks. The developed GMu-SGCN model has the ability to learn the node connection pattern via multimodal node and edge features. In order to evaluate the developed model, a river network dataset and a power network dataset have been used as test beds. The river network represents the naturally developed SENs, whereas the power network represents a man-made network. Both types of networks are heavily constrained by the spatial environments and uncertainties from nature. Comprehensive evaluation analysis shows the developed GMu-SGCN can improve accuracy of the edge existence prediction task by 37.1\% compared to a GraphSAGE model which only considers the node's position feature in a power network test bed. Our model demonstrates the importance of considering the multidimensional spatial feature for spatially embedded network representation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Oryx MLLM: On-Demand Spatial-Temporal Understanding at Arbitrary Resolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12961v3)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual data comes in various forms, ranging from small icons of just a few pixels to long videos spanning hours. Existing multi-modal LLMs usually standardize these diverse visual inputs to a fixed resolution for visual encoders and yield similar numbers of tokens for LLMs. This approach is non-optimal for multimodal understanding and inefficient for processing inputs with long and short visual contents. To solve the problem, we propose Oryx, a unified multimodal architecture for the spatial-temporal understanding of images, videos, and multi-view 3D scenes. Oryx offers an on-demand solution to seamlessly and efficiently process visual inputs with arbitrary spatial sizes and temporal lengths through two core innovations: 1) a pre-trained OryxViT model that can encode images at any resolution into LLM-friendly visual representations; 2) a dynamic compressor module that supports 1x to 16x compression on visual tokens by request. These design features enable Oryx to accommodate extremely long visual contexts, such as videos, with lower resolution and high compression while maintaining high recognition precision for tasks like document understanding with native resolution and no compression. Beyond the architectural improvements, enhanced data curation and specialized training on long-context retrieval and spatial-aware data help Oryx achieve strong capabilities in image, video, and 3D multimodal understanding simultaneously. Our work is open-sourced at https://github.com/Oryx-mllm/Oryx.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2025</p></details> |
| **[GestureLSM: Latent Shortcut based Co-Speech Gesture Generation with Spatial-Temporal Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18898v1)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Controlling human gestures based on speech signals presents a significant challenge in computer vision. While existing works did preliminary studies of generating holistic co-speech gesture from speech, the spatial interaction of each body region during the speech remains barely explored. This leads to wield body part interactions given the speech signal. Furthermore, the slow generation speed limits the construction of real-world digital avatars. To resolve these problems, we propose \textbf{GestureLSM}, a Latent Shortcut based approach for Co-Speech Gesture Generation with spatial-temporal modeling. We tokenize various body regions and explicitly model their interactions with spatial and temporal attention. To achieve real-time gesture generations, we exam the denoising patterns and design an effective time distribution to speed up sampling while improve the generation quality for shortcut model. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of GestureLSM, showcasing its potential for various applications in the development of digital humans and embodied agents.

| **[RLS3: RL-Based Synthetic Sample Selection to Enhance Spatial Reasoning in Vision-Language Models for Indoor Autonomous Perception](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18880v1)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language model (VLM) fine-tuning for application-specific visual grounding based on natural language instructions has become one of the most popular approaches for learning-enabled autonomous systems. However, such fine-tuning relies heavily on high-quality datasets to achieve successful performance in various downstream tasks. Additionally, VLMs often encounter limitations due to insufficient and imbalanced fine-tuning data. To address these issues, we propose a new generalizable framework to improve VLM fine-tuning by integrating it with a reinforcement learning (RL) agent. Our method utilizes the RL agent to manipulate objects within an indoor setting to create synthetic data for fine-tuning to address certain vulnerabilities of the VLM. Specifically, we use the performance of the VLM to provide feedback to the RL agent to generate informative data that efficiently fine-tune the VLM over the targeted task (e.g. spatial reasoning). The key contribution of this work is developing a framework where the RL agent serves as an informative data sampling tool and assists the VLM in order to enhance performance and address task-specific vulnerabilities. By targeting the data sampling process to address the weaknesses of the VLM, we can effectively train a more context-aware model. In addition, generating synthetic data allows us to have precise control over each scene and generate granular ground truth captions. Our results show that the proposed data generation approach improves the spatial reasoning performance of VLMs, which demonstrates the benefits of using RL-guided data generation in vision-language tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCPS...</summary><p>ICCPS 2025 accepted paper, 10 pages, 9 figures</p></details> |
| **[SpatialVLA: Exploring Spatial Representations for Visual-Language-Action Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15830v3)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we claim that spatial understanding is the keypoint in robot manipulation, and propose SpatialVLA to explore effective spatial representations for the robot foundation model. Specifically, we introduce Ego3D Position Encoding to inject 3D information into the input observations of the visual-language-action model, and propose Adaptive Action Grids to represent spatial robot movement actions with adaptive discretized action grids, facilitating learning generalizable and transferrable spatial action knowledge for cross-robot control. SpatialVLA is first pre-trained on top of a vision-language model with 1.1 Million real-world robot episodes, to learn a generalist manipulation policy across multiple robot environments and tasks. After pre-training, SpatialVLA is directly applied to perform numerous tasks in a zero-shot manner. The superior results in both simulation and real-world robots demonstrate its advantage of inferring complex robot motion trajectories and its strong in-domain multi-task generalization ability. We further show the proposed Adaptive Action Grids offer a new and effective way to fine-tune the pre-trained SpatialVLA model for new simulation and real-world setups, where the pre-learned action grids are re-discretized to capture robot-specific spatial action movements of new setups. The superior results from extensive evaluations demonstrate the exceptional in-distribution generalization and out-of-distribution adaptation capability, highlighting the crucial benefit of the proposed spatial-aware representations for generalist robot policy learning. All the details and codes will be open-sourced.</p></details> |  |
| **[Integrating Spatial and Frequency Information for Under-Display Camera Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18517v1)** | 2025-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Under-Display Camera (UDC) houses a digital camera lens under a display panel. However, UDC introduces complex degradations such as noise, blur, decrease in transmittance, and flare. Despite the remarkable progress, previous research on UDC mainly focuses on eliminating diffraction in the spatial domain and rarely explores its potential in the frequency domain. It is essential to consider both the spatial and frequency domains effectively. For example, degradations, such as noise and blur, can be addressed by local information (e.g., CNN kernels in the spatial domain). At the same time, tackling flares may require leveraging global information (e.g., the frequency domain). In this paper, we revisit the UDC degradations in the Fourier space and figure out intrinsic frequency priors that imply the presence of the flares. Based on this observation, we propose a novel multi-level DNN architecture called SFIM. It efficiently restores UDC-distorted images by integrating local and global (the collective contribution of all points in the image) information. The architecture exploits CNNs to capture local information and FFT-based models to capture global information. SFIM comprises a spatial domain block (SDB), a Frequency Domain Block (FDB), and an Attention-based Multi-level Integration Block (AMIB). Specifically, SDB focuses more on detailed textures such as noise and blur, FDB emphasizes irregular texture loss in extensive areas such as flare, and AMIB enables effective cross-domain interaction.

However, in HSISR, Mamba faces challenges as transforming images into 1D sequences neglects the spatial-spectral structural relationships between locally adjacent pixels, and its performance is highly sensitive to input order, which affects the restoration of both spatial and spectral details. In this paper, we propose HSRMamba, a contextual spatial-spectral modeling state space model for HSISR, to address these issues both locally and globally. Specifically, a local spatial-spectral partitioning mechanism is designed to establish patch-wise causal relationships among adjacent pixels in 3D features, mitigating the local forgetting issue. Furthermore, a global spectral reordering strategy based on spectral similarity is employed to enhance the causal representation of similar pixels across both spatial and spectral dimensions. Finally, experimental results demonstrate our HSRMamba outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in quantitative quality and visual results. Code will be available soon.</p></details> |  |

While extensive research has focused on specific spatial scales -- such as intracity or intercity -- universal mobility characteristics across various scales remain largely unexplored. Here, by partitioning trajectories into modules through network community detection, we find that the geospatial extent of modules increases sublinearly with distance from home, indicating a universal inflation law that holds across three orders of magnitude and is independent of demographic factors. Our further investigation highlights a potential connection between this inflation law and hierarchical urban structure. These findings deepen our understanding of human mobility dynamics, with implications for urban planning, tourism management, and epidemic intervention.</p></details> | 42 pages, 18 figures |
| **[Uncertainty quantification in automated valuation models with spatially weighted conformal prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06531v2)** | 2025-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Non-parametric machine learning models, such as random forests and gradient boosted trees, are frequently used to estimate house prices due to their predictive accuracy, but a main drawback of such methods is their limited ability to quantify prediction uncertainty. Conformal prediction (CP) is a model-agnostic framework for constructing confidence sets around predictions of machine learning models with minimal assumptions. However, due to the spatial dependencies observed in house prices, direct application of CP leads to confidence sets that are not calibrated everywhere, i.e., the confidence sets will be too large in certain geographical regions and too small in others. We survey various approaches to adjust the CP confidence set to account for this and demonstrate their performance on a data set from the housing market in Oslo, Norway. Our findings indicate that calibrating the confidence sets on a spatially weighted version of the non-conformity scores makes the coverage more consistently calibrated across geographical regions. We also perform a simulation study on synthetically generated sale prices to empirically explore the performance of CP on housing market data under idealized conditions with known data-generating mechanisms.</p></details> |  |
| **[Neural Operator based Reinforcement Learning for Control of first-order PDEs with Spatially-Varying State Delay](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18201v1)** | 2025-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Control of distributed parameter systems affected by delays is a challenging task, particularly when the delays depend on spatial variables. The idea of integrating analytical control theory with learning-based control within a unified control scheme is becoming increasingly promising and advantageous. In this paper, we address the problem of controlling an unstable first-order hyperbolic PDE with spatially-varying delays by combining PDE backstepping control strategies and deep reinforcement learning (RL). To eliminate the assumption on the delay function required for the backstepping design, we propose a soft actor-critic (SAC) architecture incorporating a DeepONet to approximate the backstepping controller. The DeepONet extracts features from the backstepping controller and feeds them into the policy network. In simulations, our algorithm outperforms the baseline SAC without prior backstepping knowledge and the analytical controller.</p></details> | 6 Pages, 7 Figures |
| **[Learning Metal Microstructural Heterogeneity through Spatial Mapping of Diffraction Latent Space Features](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18064v1)** | 2025-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To leverage advancements in machine learning for metallic materials design and property prediction, it is crucial to develop a data-reduced representation of metal microstructures that surpasses the limitations of current physics-based discrete microstructure descriptors. This need is particularly relevant for metallic materials processed through additive manufacturing, which exhibit complex hierarchical microstructures that cannot be adequately described using the conventional metrics typically applied to wrought materials. Furthermore, capturing the spatial heterogeneity of microstructures at the different scales is necessary within such framework to accurately predict their properties. To address these challenges, we propose the physical spatial mapping of metal diffraction latent space features. This approach integrates (i) point diffraction data encoding via variational autoencoders or contrastive learning and (ii) the physical mapping of the encoded values. Together these steps offer a method offers a novel means to comprehensively describe metal microstructures. We demonstrate this approach on a wrought and additively manufactured alloy, showing that it effectively encodes microstructural information and enables direct identification of microstructural heterogeneity not directly possible by physics-based models. This data-reduced microstructure representation opens the application of machine learning models in accelerating metallic material design and accurately predicting their properties.</p></details> |  |
| **[Uniform Inference on High-dimensional Spatial Panel Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.07424v4)** | 2025-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose employing a debiased-regularized, high-dimensional generalized method of moments (GMM) framework to perform inference on large-scale spatial panel networks. In particular, network structure with a flexible sparse deviation, which can be regarded either as latent or as misspecified from a predetermined adjacency matrix, is estimated using debiased machine learning approach. The theoretical analysis establishes the consistency and asymptotic normality of our proposed estimator, taking into account general temporal and spatial dependency inherent in the data-generating processes. A primary contribution of our study is the development of uniform inference theory that enables hypothesis testing on the parameters of interest, including zero or non-zero elements in the network structure. Additionally, the asymptotic properties for the estimator are derived for both linear and nonlinear moments. Simulations demonstrate superior performance of our proposed approach. Lastly, we apply our methodology to investigate the spatial network effect of stock returns.</p></details> |  |

However, in these applications, despite high within-session performance, intersession performance is hindered by electrode shift, a known issue across modalities. Existing solutions often require large and expensive datasets and/or lack robustness and interpretability. Thus, we propose the Spatial Adaptation Layer (SAL), which can be applied to any biosignal array model and learns a parametrized affine transformation at the input between two recording sessions. We also introduce learnable baseline normalization (LBN) to reduce baseline fluctuations. Tested on two HD-sEMG gesture recognition datasets, SAL and LBN outperformed standard fine-tuning on regular arrays, achieving competitive performance even with a logistic regressor, with orders of magnitude less, physically interpretable parameters. Our ablation study showed that forearm circumferential translations account for the majority of performance improvements.</p></details> | <details><summary>IJCNN...</summary><p>IJCNN(submitted), 6 pages</p></details> |

Despite their prevalence in geospatial tasks, neural network models usually assume spatial stationarity, which could limit their performance in the presence of spatial process heterogeneity. By allowing model parameters to vary over space, several approaches have been proposed to incorporate spatial heterogeneity into neural networks. However, current geographically weighting approaches are ineffective on graph neural networks, yielding no significant improvement in prediction accuracy. We assume the crux lies in the over-fitting risk brought by a large number of local parameters. Accordingly, we propose to model spatial process heterogeneity at the regional level rather than at the individual level, which largely reduces the number of spatially varying parameters. We further develop a heuristic optimization procedure to learn the region partition adaptively in the process of model training. Our proposed spatial-heterogeneity-aware graph convolutional network, named RegionGCN, is applied to the spatial prediction of county-level vote share in the 2016 US presidential election based on socioeconomic attributes. Results show that RegionGCN achieves significant improvement over the basic and geographically weighted GCNs. We also offer an exploratory analysis tool for the spatial variation of non-linear relationships through ensemble learning of regional partitions from RegionGCN. Our work contributes to the practice of Geospatial Artificial Intelligence (GeoAI) in tackling spatial heterogeneity.</p></details> | 28 pages, 6 figures |

Realistic synthetic populations with numerous attributes strengthen these simulations. The Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network, trained on census data like EU-SILC, can create robust synthetic populations. These methods, aided by external statistics or EU-SILC weights, generate spatial synthetic populations for agent-based models. The increased access to high-quality micro-data has sparked interest in synthetic populations, which preserve demographic profiles and analytical strength while ensuring privacy and preventing discrimination. This study uses national data from Finland and Greece for Helsinki and Thessaloniki to explore balanced spatial synthetic population generation. Results show challenges related to balancing data with or without aggregated statistics for the target population and the general under-representation of fringe profiles by deep generative methods. The latter can lead to discrimination in agent-based simulations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted and presented at European Social Simulation Conference in Krakow 2024</p></details> |

However, the motifs previously considered are either limited to a handful of nodes and edges, or do not include triangles, which are thought to be of critical relevance to understand the dynamics of social systems. Thus, we introduce a new class of motifs, that include these triangles, are not limited in their number of nodes or edges, and yet can be mined efficiently in any temporal network. Referring to these motifs as the edge-centered motifs, we show analytically how they subsume the Egocentric Temporal Neighborhoods motifs of [A. Longa, G. Cencetti, B. Lepri, and A. Passerini, An efficient procedure for mining egocentric temporal motifs, Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery 36, 355 (2022)]. We also confirm in empirical data that the edge-centered motifs bring relevant information with respect to the Egocentric motifs by using a principle of maximum entropy. Then, we show how mining for the edge-centered motifs in a network can be used to probe for spatial correlations in the underlying dynamics that have produced that network. We deduce an approximate formula for the distribution of the edge-centered motifs in empirical networks of social face-to-face interactions. In the last section of this paper, we explore how the statistics of the edge-centered motifs can be used to infer the complete topology of the network they were sampled from. This leads to the needs of mathematical development, that we inaugurate here under the name of graph tiling theory.</p></details> |  |

While the impressive progress in data collection and storage capacities has yielded an immense increase in spatial point process data with highly challenging non-scalar marks, methods for their analysis are not equally well developed. In particular, there are no methods for composition-valued marks, i.e. vector-valued marks with a sum-to-constant constrain (typically 1 or 100). Prompted by the need for a suitable methodological framework, we extend existing methods to spatial point processes with composition-valued marks and adapt common mark characteristics to this context. The proposed methods are applied to analyse spatial correlations in data on tree crown-to-base and business sector compositions.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted for publication</p></details> |

ST is a time-consuming, expensive yet powerful experimental technique that provides new opportunities to understand cancer mechanisms at a fine-grained molecular level, which is critical for uncovering new approaches for disease diagnosis and treatments. Here, we present $\textbf{Stem}$ ($\textbf{S}$pa$\textbf{T}$ially resolved gene $\textbf{E}$xpression inference with diffusion $\textbf{M}$odel), a novel computational tool that leverages a conditional diffusion generative model to enable in silico gene expression inference from H&E stained images. Through better capturing the inherent stochasticity and heterogeneity in ST data, $\textbf{Stem}$ achieves state-of-the-art performance on spatial gene expression prediction and generates biologically meaningful gene profiles for new H&E stained images at test time. We evaluate the proposed algorithm on datasets with various tissue sources and sequencing platforms, where it demonstrates clear improvement over existing approaches. $\textbf{Stem}$ generates high-fidelity gene expression predictions that share similar gene variation levels as ground truth data, suggesting that our method preserves the underlying biological heterogeneity. Our proposed pipeline opens up the possibility of analyzing existing, easily accessible H&E stained histology images from a genomics point of view without physically performing gene expression profiling and empowers potential biological discovery from H&E stained histology images.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2025</p></details> |
| **[Bayesian Spatial Predictive Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.05197v4)** | 2025-01-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to spatial dependence -- often characterized as complex and non-linear -- model misspecification is a prevalent and critical issue in spatial data analysis and prediction. As the data, and thus model performance, is heterogeneous, typical model selection and ensemble methods that assume homogeneity are not suitable. We address the issue of model uncertainty for spatial data by proposing a novel Bayesian ensemble methodology that captures spatially-varying model uncertainty and performance heterogeneity of multiple spatial predictions, and synthesizes them for improved predictions, which we call Bayesian spatial predictive synthesis. Our proposal is defined by specifying a latent factor spatially-varying coefficient model as the synthesis function, which enables spatial characteristics of each model to be learned and ensemble coefficients to vary over regions to achieve flexible predictions. We derive our method from the theoretically best approximation of the data generating process, and show that it provides a finite sample theoretical guarantee for its predictive performance, specifically that the predictions are exact minimax. Two MCMC strategies are implemented for full uncertainty quantification, as well as a variational inference strategy for fast point inference. We also extend the estimation strategy for general responses. Through simulation examples and two real data applications in real estate and ecology, our proposed Bayesian spatial predictive synthesis outperforms standard spatial models and ensemble methods, and advanced machine learning methods, in terms of predictive accuracy and uncertainty quantification, while maintaining interpretability of the prediction mechanism.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages (main) + 15 pages (supplementary material)</p></details> |

However, real-world spatial and reverberant acoustic environments remain challenging, limiting the effectiveness of these approaches for assistive hearing devices like cochlear implants (CIs). To address this, we quantify the impact of real-world acoustic scenes on speech separation and explore how spatial cues can enhance separation quality efficiently. We analyze performance based on implicit spatial cues (inherent in the acoustic input and learned by the model) and explicit spatial cues (manually calculated spatial features added as auxiliary inputs). Our findings show that spatial cues (both implicit and explicit) improve separation for mixtures with spatially separated and nearby talkers. Furthermore, spatial cues enhance separation when spectral cues are ambiguous, such as when voices are similar. Explicit spatial cues are particularly beneficial when implicit spatial cues are weak. For instance, single CI microphone recordings provide weaker implicit spatial cues than bilateral CIs, but even single CIs benefit from explicit cues. These results emphasize the importance of training models on real-world data to improve generalizability in everyday listening scenarios. Additionally, our statistical analyses offer insights into how data properties influence model performance, supporting the development of efficient speech separation approaches for CIs and other assistive devices in real-world settings.</p></details> | 10 pages, 5 figures |

Traditional methods often suffer from slow inference speeds, limited accuracy, and inadequate recognition rates, particularly in scenarios involving intricate or subtle defects. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Fab-ASLKS, an advanced fabric defect detection framework built upon the YOLOv8s architecture. Fab-ASLKS incorporates two key modules: (1) the Adaptive Shape Convolution Module (ASCM), which leverages adaptive shape convolution within the Neck to enhance feature fusion and improve efficiency by extending the capabilities of the standard C2f structure, and (2) the Large Kernel Shift Convolution Module (LKSCM), designed to emulate large kernel effects within the Backbone, enabling superior spatial information extraction. These modules collaboratively optimize feature extraction and information integration across the network. Extensive experiments conducted on the Tianchi fabric defect detection dataset demonstrate that Fab-ASLKS achieves a 5% improvement in mAP@50 over the baseline, showcasing its capability to deliver high precision and efficiency.</p></details> | 8 pages, 9 figures |

Bayesian spatial generalized linear mixed models (SGLMMs) are a flexible class of models for analyzing such data, but they struggle to scale to large datasets. Many scalable Bayesian methods, built upon basis representations or sparse covariance matrices, still rely on posterior sampling via Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). Variational Bayes (VB) methods have been applied to SGLMMs, but only for small areal datasets. We propose two computationally efficient VB approaches for analyzing moderately sized and massive (millions of locations) Gaussian and discrete non-Gaussian spatial data in the continuous spatial domain. Our methods leverage semi-parametric approximations of latent spatial processes and parallel computing to ensure computational efficiency. The proposed methods deliver inferential and predictive performance comparable to gold-standard MCMC methods while achieving computational speedups of up to 3600 times. In most cases, our VB approaches outperform state-of-the-art alternatives such as INLA and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo. We validate our methods through a comparative numerical study and applications to real-world datasets. These VB approaches can enable practitioners to model millions of discrete non-Gaussian spatial observations on standard laptops, significantly expanding access to advanced spatial modeling tools.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 Pa...</summary><p>26 Pages for the main paper, 60 pages for the supplemental information, 5 tables, 4 figures</p></details> |

The main element here is on utilizing the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) of the point pattern and its tapered counterpart. Under second-order stationarity, we show that both the DFTs and the tapered DFTs are asymptotically jointly independent Gaussian even when the DFTs share the same limiting frequencies. Based on these results, we establish an $\alpha$-mixing central limit theorem for a statistic formulated as a quadratic form of the tapered DFT. As applications, we derive the asymptotic distribution of the kernel spectral density estimator and establish a frequency domain inferential method for parametric stationary point processes. For the latter, the resulting model parameter estimator is computationally tractable and yields meaningful interpretations even in the case of model misspecification. We investigate the finite sample performance of our estimator through simulations, considering scenarios of both correctly specified and misspecified models.</p></details> |  |

Despite advancements in artificial intelligence enabling automated sleep staging, significant challenges remain: (1) Simultaneously extracting prominent temporal and spatial sleep features from multi-channel raw signals, including characteristic sleep waveforms and salient spatial brain networks. (2) Capturing the spatial-temporal coupling patterns essential for accurate sleep staging. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework named ST-USleepNet, comprising a spatial-temporal graph construction module (ST) and a U-shaped sleep network (USleepNet). The ST module converts raw signals into a spatial-temporal graph based on signal similarity, temporal, and spatial relationships to model spatial-temporal coupling patterns. The USleepNet employs a U-shaped structure for both the temporal and spatial streams, mirroring its original use in image segmentation to isolate significant targets. Applied to raw sleep signals and graph data from the ST module, USleepNet effectively segments these inputs, simultaneously extracting prominent temporal and spatial sleep features. Testing on three datasets demonstrates that ST-USleepNet outperforms existing baselines, and model visualizations confirm its efficacy in extracting prominent sleep features and temporal-spatial coupling patterns across various sleep stages.

| **[Graph Optimality-Aware Stochastic LiDAR Bundle Adjustment with Progressive Spatial Smoothing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14565v2)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-scale LiDAR Bundle Adjustment (LBA) to refine sensor orientation and point cloud accuracy simultaneously to build the navigation map is a fundamental task in logistics and robotics. Unlike pose-graph-based methods that rely solely on pairwise relationships between LiDAR frames, LBA leverages raw LiDAR correspondences to achieve more precise results, especially when initial pose estimates are unreliable for low-cost sensors. However, existing LBA methods face challenges such as simplistic planar correspondences, extensive observations, and dense normal matrices in the least-squares problem, which limit robustness, efficiency, and scalability. To address these issues, we propose a Graph Optimality-aware Stochastic Optimization scheme with Progressive Spatial Smoothing, namely PSS-GOSO, to achieve \textit{robust}, \textit{efficient}, and \textit{scalable} LBA. The Progressive Spatial Smoothing (PSS) module extracts \textit{robust} LiDAR feature association exploiting the prior structure information obtained by the polynomial smooth kernel. The Graph Optimality-aware Stochastic Optimization (GOSO) module first sparsifies the graph according to optimality for an \textit{efficient} optimization. GOSO then utilizes stochastic clustering and graph marginalization to solve the large-scale state estimation problem for a \textit{scalable} LBA. We validate PSS-GOSO across diverse scenes captured by various platforms, demonstrating its superior performance compared to existing methods. Moreover, the resulting point cloud maps are used for automatic last-mile delivery in large-scale complex scenes.

Efforts to enhance spatial reasoning abilities through supplementary spatial data and fine-tuning have proven limited and ineffective when addressing complex embodied tasks, largely due to their dependence on language-based outputs. While some approaches have introduced a point-based action space to mitigate this issue, they fall short in managing more intricate tasks within complex environments. This deficiency arises from their failure to fully exploit the inherent thinking and reasoning capabilities that are fundamental strengths of Vision-Language Models (VLMs). To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach named SpatialCoT, specifically designed to bolster the spatial reasoning capabilities of VLMs. Our approach comprises two stages: spatial coordinate bi-directional alignment, which aligns vision-language inputs with spatial coordinates, and chain-of-thought spatial grounding, which harnesses the reasoning capabilities of language models for advanced spatial reasoning. We evaluate SpatialCoT on challenging navigation and manipulation tasks, both in simulation and real-world settings. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art approaches in both tasks.</p></details> | Under Review |

Gaining insight into the spatial variation and interactions between these extremes is critical for effective risk management, early warning systems, and informed policy-making. However, challenges such as the rarity of extreme events, spatial dependencies, and complex cross-variable interactions hinder accurate modeling. We introduce a novel framework for modeling spatial extremes, building upon spatial generalized extreme value (GEV) models. Our approach incorporates a dimension-reduced latent spatial process to improve scalability and flexibility, particularly in capturing asymmetry in cross-covariance structures. This Joint Latent Spatial GEV model (JLS-GEV) overcomes key limitations of existing methods by providing a more flexible framework for inter-variable dependencies. In addition to addressing event rarity, spatial dependence and cross-variable interactions, JLS-GEV supports nonstationary spatial behaviors and independently collected data sources, while maintaining practical fitting times through dimension reduction. We validate JLS-GEV through extensive simulation studies, demonstrating its superior performance in capturing spatial extremes compared to baseline modeling approaches. Application to real-world data on extreme precipitation and temperature in the southeastern United States highlights its practical utility. While primarily motivated by environmental challenges, this framework is broadly applicable to interdisciplinary studies of spatial extremes in interdependent natural processes.</p></details> |  |

However, existing models focus primarily on improving the overall accuracy of the prediction, often neglecting the goal of achieving uniformity in the predictions. This task becomes particularly challenging due to the inherent spatial-temporal heterogeneity of the nodes. To address this issue, we propose a novel Heterogeneity-informed Mixture-of-Experts (HiMoE) for fair spatial-temporal forecasting. In particular, we design the Heterogeneity-Informed Graph Convolutional Network (HiGCN), which leverages the fusion of multi-graph and edge masking to flexibly model spatial dependencies. Moreover, we introduce the Node-wise Mixture-of-Experts (NMoE), which allocates prediction tasks of different nodes to suitable experts through graph decoupling routing. To further improve the model, fairness-aware loss and evaluation functions are proposed, optimizing the model with fairness and accuracy as objectives. Experiments on four datasets from different real-world scenarios demonstrate that HiMoE achieves the state-of-the-art performance, outperforming the best baseline with at lease 9.22% in all metrics.</p></details> |  |

We derive non-asymptotic bounds that lead to convergence rates, addressing both temporal and spatial dependence in the observed measurements. By accounting for dependencies across time and space, our models better reflect the complexities of real-world data, enhancing both predictive performance and theoretical robustness. We also tackle the curse of dimensionality by modeling the data on a manifold, exploring the intrinsic dimensionality of high-dimensional data. We broaden existing theoretical findings of temporal-spatial analysis by applying them to neural networks in more general contexts and demonstrate that our proof techniques are effective for models with short-range dependence. Our empirical simulations across various synthetic response functions underscore the superior performance of our method, outperforming established approaches in the existing literature. These findings provide valuable insights into the strong capabilities of dense neural networks (Dense NN) for temporal-spatial modeling across a broad range of function classes.</p></details> |  |

Here, we proposed a general and analytical ultralow-dimensionality reduction method for dynamical systems named spatial-temporal principal component analysis (stPCA) to fully represent the dynamics of a high-dimensional time-series by only a single latent variable without distortion, which transforms high-dimensional spatial information into one-dimensional temporal information based on nonlinear delay-embedding theory. The dynamics of this single variable is analytically solved and theoretically preserves the temporal property of original high-dimensional time-series, thereby accurately and reliably identifying the tipping point before an upcoming critical transition. Its applications to real-world datasets such as individual-specific heterogeneous ICU records demonstrated the effectiveness of stPCA, which quantitatively and robustly provides the early-warning signals of the critical/tipping state on each patient.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we aim to mimic this spatial cognition ability. We thus formulate the task of Out of Sight, Not Out of Mind - 3D tracking active objects using observations captured through an egocentric camera. We introduce a simple but effective approach to address this challenging problem, called Lift, Match, and Keep (LMK). LMK lifts partial 2D observations to 3D world coordinates, matches them over time using visual appearance, 3D location and interactions to form object tracks, and keeps these object tracks even when they go out-of-view of the camera. We benchmark LMK on 100 long videos from EPIC-KITCHENS. Our results demonstrate that spatial cognition is critical for correctly locating objects over short and long time scales. E.g., for one long egocentric video, we estimate the 3D location of 50 active objects. After 120 seconds, 57% of the objects are correctly localised by LMK, compared to just 33% by a recent 3D method for egocentric videos and 17% by a general 2D tracking method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at 3DV 2025. 14 pages including references and appendix.

| **[Parallel Sequence Modeling via Generalized Spatial Propagation Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12381v1)** | 2025-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present the Generalized Spatial Propagation Network (GSPN), a new attention mechanism optimized for vision tasks that inherently captures 2D spatial structures. Existing attention models, including transformers, linear attention, and state-space models like Mamba, process multi-dimensional data as 1D sequences, compromising spatial coherence and efficiency. GSPN overcomes these limitations by directly operating on spatially coherent image data and forming dense pairwise connections through a line-scan approach. Central to GSPN is the Stability-Context Condition, which ensures stable, context-aware propagation across 2D sequences and reduces the effective sequence length to $\sqrt{N}$ for a square map with N elements, significantly enhancing computational efficiency. With learnable, input-dependent weights and no reliance on positional embeddings, GSPN achieves superior spatial fidelity and state-of-the-art performance in vision tasks, including ImageNet classification, class-guided image generation, and text-to-image generation. Notably, GSPN accelerates SD-XL with softmax-attention by over $84\times$ when generating 16K images.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: http://whj363636.github.io/GSPN/</p></details> |

We prove that if the involved operators are domain-uniformly stabilizable and detectable, then these localized perturbations only have a local effect on the optimal solution. We characterize this domain-uniform stabilizability and detectability for the transport equation with constant transport velocity, showing that even for unitary semigroups, optimality implies exponential damping. Finally, we extend our result to the case of a space-dependent transport velocity. Numerical examples in one space dimension complement the theoretical results.</p></details> | 46 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Optimal Spatial-Temporal Triangulation for Bearing-Only Cooperative Motion Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15846v4)** | 2025-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-based cooperative motion estimation is an important problem for many multi-robot systems such as cooperative aerial target pursuit. This problem can be formulated as bearing-only cooperative motion estimation, where the visual measurement is modeled as a bearing vector pointing from the camera to the target. The conventional approaches for bearing-only cooperative estimation are mainly based on the framework distributed Kalman filtering (DKF). In this paper, we propose a new optimal bearing-only cooperative estimation algorithm, named spatial-temporal triangulation, based on the method of distributed recursive least squares, which provides a more flexible framework for designing distributed estimators than DKF. The design of the algorithm fully incorporates all the available information and the specific triangulation geometric constraint. As a result, the algorithm has superior estimation performance than the state-of-the-art DKF algorithms in terms of both accuracy and convergence speed as verified by numerical simulation. We rigorously prove the exponential convergence of the proposed algorithm. Moreover, to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm under practical challenging conditions, we develop a vision-based cooperative aerial target pursuit system, which is the first of such fully autonomous systems so far to the best of our knowledge.</p></details> |  |

To efficiently handle the irregular and sparse nature of point cloud, we propose migrating the voxels into distinct specialized ordered fields with the general spatial expansion strategies, and employ group attention mechanisms to extract the exclusive feature maps within each field. Subsequently, we integrate the feature representations across different ordered fields by alternately applying diverse expansion strategies, thereby enhancing the model's ability to capture comprehensive spatial information. The method was evaluated on the nuScenes lidar-based object detection test dataset, achieving an NDS score of 73.9 without Test-Time Augmentation (TTA) and 74.5 with TTA, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method. Notably, our method ranks the 1st place in the nuScenes lidar-based object detection task.</p></details> |  |
| **[WaveNet-SF: A Hybrid Network for Retinal Disease Detection Based on Wavelet Transform in the Spatial-Frequency Domain](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11854v1)** | 2025-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retinal diseases are a leading cause of vision impairment and blindness, with timely diagnosis being critical for effective treatment. Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) has become a standard imaging modality for retinal disease diagnosis, but OCT images often suffer from issues such as speckle noise, complex lesion shapes, and varying lesion sizes, making interpretation challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, WaveNet-SF, to enhance retinal disease detection by integrating spatial-domain and frequency-domain learning. The framework utilizes wavelet transforms to decompose OCT images into low- and high-frequency components, enabling the model to extract both global structural features and fine-grained details. To improve lesion detection, we introduce a multi-scale wavelet spatial attention (MSW-SA) module, which enhances the model's focus on regions of interest at multiple scales. Additionally, a high-frequency feature compensation block (HFFC) is incorporated to recover edge information lost during wavelet decomposition, suppress noise, and preserve fine details crucial for lesion detection. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) classification accuracies of 97.82% and 99. 58% on the OCT-C8 and OCT2017 datasets, respectively, surpassing existing methods. These results demonstrate the efficacy of WaveNet-SF in addressing the challenges of OCT image analysis and its potential as a powerful tool for retinal disease diagnosis.</p></details> |  |

This paper explores how to enhance window-switching strategies for virtual displays by leveraging eye tracking provided by HWDs and underutilized spaces around the main display area. We investigate the efficiency and usability of different cursor behaviors and selection modes in a Spatial Bar interface for window-switching tasks in augmented reality environments. Results show gaze coupled with teleport led to the quickest window-switching times, particularly in tasks where the original cursor position or the target window was far from the Spatial Bar.</p></details> |  |

This problem is societally important for many applications, such as generating clinical hypotheses for designing new immunotherapies for cancer treatment. The challenge lies in the spatial variability, the inherent heterogeneity and variation observed in spatial properties or arrangements across different locations (i.e., place-types). Previous techniques focus on self-supervised tasks to learn domain-invariant features and mitigate domain differences; however, they often neglect the underlying spatial arrangements among data points, leading to significant discrepancies across different place-types. We explore a novel multi-task self-learning framework that targets spatial arrangements, such as spatial mix-up masking and spatial contrastive predictive coding, for spatially-delineated domain-adapted AI classification. Experimental results on real-world datasets (e.g., oncology data) show that the proposed framework provides higher prediction accuracy than baseline methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Hands-free Spatial Selection and Interaction Technique using Gaze and Blink Input with Blink Prediction for Extended Reality](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11540v1)** | 2025-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Gaze-based interaction techniques have created significant interest in the field of spatial interaction. Many of these methods require additional input modalities, such as hand gestures (e.g., gaze coupled with pinch). Those can be uncomfortable and difficult to perform in public or limited spaces, and pose challenges for users who are unable to execute pinch gestures. To address these aspects, we propose a novel, hands-free Gaze+Blink interaction technique that leverages the user's gaze and intentional eye blinks. This technique enables users to perform selections by executing intentional blinks. It facilitates continuous interactions, such as scrolling or drag-and-drop, through eye blinks coupled with head movements. So far, this concept has not been explored for hands-free spatial interaction techniques. We evaluated the performance and user experience (UX) of our Gaze+Blink method with two user studies and compared it with Gaze+Pinch in a realistic user interface setup featuring common menu interaction tasks. Study 1 demonstrated that while Gaze+Blink achieved comparable selection speeds, it was prone to accidental selections resulting from unintentional blinks. In Study 2 we explored an enhanced technique employing a deep learning algorithms for filtering out unintentional blinks.</p></details> |  |

This task is however challenging due to multiple sign variations, complexity in language and inherent richness of expressions. Computational approaches have evidenced capabilities to support SLT. Nonetheless, these approaches remain limited to cover gestures variability and support long sequence translations. This paper introduces a Transformer-based architecture that encodes spatio-temporal motion gestures, preserving both local and long-range spatial information through the use of multiple convolutional and attention mechanisms. The proposed approach was validated on the Colombian Sign Language Translation Dataset (CoL-SLTD) outperforming baseline approaches, and achieving a BLEU4 of 46.84%. Additionally, the proposed approach was validated on the RWTH-PHOENIX-Weather-2014T (PHOENIX14T), achieving a BLEU4 score of 30.77%, demonstrating its robustness and effectiveness in handling real-world variations</p></details> |  |

It is a multimodal task aimed at localizing specific subjects spatio-temporally based on textual queries without bounding box supervision. Motivated by recent advancements in multi-modal foundation models for grounding tasks, we first explore the potential of state-of-the-art object detection models for WSTVG. Despite their robust zero-shot capabilities, our adaptation reveals significant limitations, including inconsistent temporal predictions, inadequate understanding of complex queries, and challenges in adapting to difficult scenarios. We propose CoSPaL (Contextual Self-Paced Learning), a novel approach which is designed to overcome these limitations. CoSPaL integrates three core components: (1) Tubelet Phrase Grounding (TPG), which introduces spatio-temporal prediction by linking textual queries to tubelets; (2) Contextual Referral Grounding (CRG), which improves comprehension of complex queries by extracting contextual information to refine object identification over time; and (3) Self-Paced Scene Understanding (SPS), a training paradigm that progressively increases task difficulty, enabling the model to adapt to complex scenarios by transitioning from coarse to fine-grained understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR'...</summary><p>ICLR'25 Main Conference.

In this paper, we adapt and specialise the robust and conjugate GP (RCGP) framework of Altamirano et al. (2024) to the spatio-temporal setting. In doing so, we obtain an outlier-robust spatio-temporal GP with a computational cost comparable to classical spatio-temporal GPs. We also overcome the three main drawbacks of RCGPs: their unreliable performance when the prior mean is chosen poorly, their lack of reliable uncertainty quantification, and the need to carefully select a hyperparameter by hand. We study our method extensively in finance and weather forecasting applications, demonstrating that it provides a reliable approach to spatio-temporal modelling in the presence of outliers.</p></details> |  |

The dataset comprises 1,000 videos, featuring 85,000 multiple-choice QA pairs, 2,300 object captioning, and 5,700 object grounding annotations, encompassing diverse real-world conditions such as adverse weather and traffic anomalies. By incorporating tuple-based spatio-temporal object expressions, TUMTraffic-VideoQA unifies three essential tasks-multiple-choice video question answering, referred object captioning, and spatio-temporal object grounding-within a cohesive evaluation framework. We further introduce the TUMTraffic-Qwen baseline model, enhanced with visual token sampling strategies, providing valuable insights into the challenges of fine-grained spatio-temporal reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate the dataset's complexity, highlight the limitations of existing models, and position TUMTraffic-VideoQA as a robust foundation for advancing research in intelligent transportation systems.

| **[Automated Extraction of Spatio-Semantic Graphs for Identifying Cognitive Impairment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01685v1)** | 2025-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing methods for analyzing linguistic content from picture descriptions for assessment of cognitive-linguistic impairment often overlook the participant's visual narrative path, which typically requires eye tracking to assess. Spatio-semantic graphs are a useful tool for analyzing this narrative path from transcripts alone, however they are limited by the need for manual tagging of content information units (CIUs). In this paper, we propose an automated approach for estimation of spatio-semantic graphs (via automated extraction of CIUs) from the Cookie Theft picture commonly used in cognitive-linguistic analyses. The method enables the automatic characterization of the visual semantic path during picture description. Experiments demonstrate that the automatic spatio-semantic graphs effectively differentiate between cognitively impaired and unimpaired speakers. Statistical analyses reveal that the features derived by the automated method produce comparable results to the manual method, with even greater group differences between clinical groups of interest. These results highlight the potential of the automated approach for extracting spatio-semantic features in developing clinical speech models for cognitive impairment assessment.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in ICASSP 2025</p></details> |
| **[Intrinsic Random Functions and Parametric Covariance Models of Spatio-Temporal Random Processes on the Sphere](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00579v1)** | 2025-02-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Identifying an appropriate covariance function is one of the primary interests in spatial and spatio-temporal statistics because it allows researchers to analyze the dependence structure of the random process. For this purpose, spatial homogeneity and temporal stationarity are widely used assumptions, and many parametric covariance models have been developed under these assumptions. However, these are strong and unrealistic conditions in many cases. In addition, on the sphere, although different statistical approaches from those on Euclidean space should be applied to build a proper covariance model considering its unique characteristics, relevant studies are rare. In this research, we introduce novel parameterized models of the covariance function for spatially non-homogeneous and temporally non-stationary random processes on the sphere. To alleviate the spatial homogeneity assumption and temporal stationarity, and to consider the spherical domain and time domain together, this research will apply the theories of Intrinsic Random Functions (IRF). We also provide a methodology to estimate the associated parameters for the model. Finally, through a simulation study and analysis of a real-world data set about global temperature anomaly, we demonstrate validity of the suggested covariance model with its advantage of interpretability.</p></details> |  |

Existing state-of-the-art methods, like Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs), achieve high imputation accuracy; however, they suffer from significant computational costs and are notably time-consuming due to their iterative nature. In this work, we propose CoSTI, an innovative adaptation of Consistency Models (CMs) for the MTSI domain. CoSTI employs Consistency Training to achieve comparable imputation quality to DDPMs while drastically reducing inference times, making it more suitable for real-time applications. We evaluate CoSTI across multiple datasets and missing data scenarios, demonstrating up to a 98% reduction in imputation time with performance on par with diffusion-based models. This work bridges the gap between efficiency and accuracy in generative imputation tasks, providing a scalable solution for handling missing data in critical spatio-temporal systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 5 figures, 13 tables</p></details> |
| **[A Deep Spatio-Temporal Architecture for Dynamic Effective Connectivity Network Analysis Based on Dynamic Causal Discovery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18859v1)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dynamic effective connectivity networks (dECNs) reveal the changing directed brain activity and the dynamic causal influences among brain regions, which facilitate the identification of individual differences and enhance the understanding of human brain. Although the existing causal discovery methods have shown promising results in effective connectivity network analysis, they often overlook the dynamics of causality, in addition to the incorporation of spatio-temporal information in brain activity data. To address these issues, we propose a deep spatio-temporal fusion architecture, which employs a dynamic causal deep encoder to incorporate spatio-temporal information into dynamic causality modeling, and a dynamic causal deep decoder to verify the discovered causality. The effectiveness of the proposed method is first illustrated with simulated data. Then, experimental results from Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC) demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method in inferring dECNs, which reveal the dynamic evolution of directed flow between brain regions. The analysis shows the difference of dECNs between young adults and children. Specifically, the directed brain functional networks transit from fluctuating undifferentiated systems to more stable specialized networks as one grows. This observation provides further evidence on the modularization and adaptation of brain networks during development, leading to higher cognitive abilities observed in young adults.</p></details> |  |
| **[Classification of Mild Cognitive Impairment Based on Dynamic Functional Connectivity Using Spatio-Temporal Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16409v1)** | 2025-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dynamic functional connectivity (dFC) using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) is an advanced technique for capturing the dynamic changes of neural activities, and can be very useful in the studies of brain diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Yet, existing studies have not fully leveraged the sequential information embedded within dFC that can potentially provide valuable information when identifying brain conditions. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that jointly learns the embedding of both spatial and temporal information within dFC based on the transformer architecture. Specifically, we first construct dFC networks from rs-fMRI data through a sliding window strategy. Then, we simultaneously employ a temporal block and a spatial block to capture higher-order representations of dynamic spatio-temporal dependencies, via mapping them into an efficient fused feature representation. To further enhance the robustness of these feature representations by reducing the dependency on labeled data, we also introduce a contrastive learning strategy to manipulate different brain states. Experimental results on 345 subjects with 570 scans from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method for MCI (Mild Cognitive Impairment, the prodromal stage of AD) prediction, highlighting its potential for early identification of AD.</p></details> |  |

Rabies is a prominent example with various instances globally, facilitated by a surplus of meso-predators (commonly, facultative synanthropic species e.g., golden jackals [Canis aureus, hereafter jackals]) thanks to the abundance of anthropogenic resources leading to dense populations close to human establishments. To mitigate rabies outbreaks and prevent human infections, authorities target the jackal which is the main rabies vector in many regions, through the dissemination of oral vaccines in known jackals' activity centers, as well as opportunistic culling to reduce population density. Because dilution (i.e., culling) is not selective towards sick or un-vaccinated individuals, these two complementary epizootic intervention policies (EIPs) can interfere with each other. Nonetheless, there is only limited examination of the interactive effectiveness of these EIPs and their potential influence on rabies epizootic spread dynamics, highlighting the need to understand these measures and the spread of rabies in wild jackals. In this study, we introduce a novel spatio-temporal extended-SIR (susceptible-infected-recovered) model with a graph-based spatial framework for evaluating mitigation efficiency. We implement the model in a case study using a jackal population in northern Israel, and using spatial and movement data collected by Advanced Tracking and Localization of Animals in real-life Systems (ATLAS) telemetry. An agent-based simulation approach allows us to explore various biologically-realistic scenarios, and assess the impact of different EIPs configurations. Our model suggests that under biologically-realistic underlying assumptions and scenarios, the effectiveness of both EIPs is not influenced much by the jackal population size but is sensitive to their dispersal between activity centers.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Spatio-temporal Graph Network Allowing Incomplete Trajectory Input for Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13973v1)** | 2025-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pedestrian trajectory prediction is important in the research of mobile robot navigation in environments with pedestrians. Most pedestrian trajectory prediction algorithms require the input historical trajectories to be complete. If a pedestrian is unobservable in any frame in the past, then its historical trajectory become incomplete, the algorithm will not predict its future trajectory. To address this limitation, we propose the STGN-IT, a spatio-temporal graph network allowing incomplete trajectory input, which can predict the future trajectories of pedestrians with incomplete historical trajectories. STGN-IT uses the spatio-temporal graph with an additional encoding method to represent the historical trajectories and observation states of pedestrians. Moreover, STGN-IT introduces static obstacles in the environment that may affect the future trajectories as nodes to further improve the prediction accuracy. A clustering algorithm is also applied in the construction of spatio-temporal graphs. Experiments on public datasets show that STGN-IT outperforms state of the art algorithms on these metrics.</p></details> |  |

However, existing GCN-based methods face critical limitations: (1) they lack effective spatio-temporal topology modeling that captures dynamic variations in skeletal motion, and (2) they struggle to model multiscale structural relationships beyond local joint connectivity. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework called Dynamic Spatial-Temporal Semantic Awareness Graph Convolutional Network (DSTSA-GCN). DSTSA-GCN introduces three key modules: Group Channel-wise Graph Convolution (GC-GC), Group Temporal-wise Graph Convolution (GT-GC), and Multi-Scale Temporal Convolution (MS-TCN). GC-GC and GT-GC operate in parallel to independently model channel-specific and frame-specific correlations, enabling robust topology learning that accounts for temporal variations. Additionally, both modules employ a grouping strategy to adaptively capture multiscale structural relationships. Complementing this, MS-TCN enhances temporal modeling through group-wise temporal convolutions with diverse receptive fields. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DSTSA-GCN significantly improves the topology modeling capabilities of GCNs, achieving state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets for gesture and action recognition, including SHREC17 Track, DHG-14\/28, NTU-RGB+D, and NTU-RGB+D-120.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submit to Neurocomputing</p></details> |

In this regard, covariance properties with respect to geometric image transformations in the earliest layers of the visual hierarchy are essential for expressing robust image operations, and for formulating invariant visual operations at higher levels. This paper defines and proves a set of joint covariance properties for spatio-temporal receptive fields in terms of spatio-temporal derivative operators applied to spatio-temporally smoothed image data under compositions of spatial scaling transformations, spatial affine transformations, Galilean transformations and temporal scaling transformations. Specifically, the derived relations show how the parameters of the receptive fields need to be transformed, in order to match the output from spatio-temporal receptive fields under composed spatio-temporal image transformations. For this purpose, we also fundamentally extend the notion of scale-normalized derivatives to affine-normalized derivatives, that are computed based on spatial smoothing with affine Gaussian kernels, and analyze the covariance properties of the resulting affine-normalized derivatives for the affine group as well as for important subgroups thereof. We conclude with a geometric analysis, showing how the derived joint covariance properties make it possible to relate or match spatio-temporal receptive field responses, when observing, possibly moving, local surface patches from different views, under locally linearized perspective or projective transformations, as well as when observing different instances of spatio-temporal events, that may occur either faster or slower between different views of similar spatio-temporal events.</p></details> | <details><summary>46 pa...</summary><p>46 pages, 19 figures.

The sound generated by vessels can have various adverse effects on fish and aquatic ecosystems in general. In this setting, the estimation and analysis of the underwater noise produced by vessels is an important challenge for the preservation of the marine environment. In this paper we propose a model for the spatio-temporal characterisation of the underwater noise generated by vessels. The approach is based on the reconstruction of the vessels' trajectories from Automatic Identification System (AIS) data and on their deployment in a spatio-temporal database. Trajectories are enriched with semantic information like the acoustic characteristics of the vessels' engines or the activity performed by the vessels. We define a model for underwater noise propagation and use the trajectories' information to infer how noise propagates in the area of interest. We develop our approach for the case study of the fishery activities in the Northern Adriatic sea, an area of the Mediterranean sea which is well known to be highly exploited. We implement our approach using MobilityDB, an open source geospatial trajectory data management and analysis platform, which offers spatio-temporal operators and indexes improving the efficiency of our system. We use this platform to conduct various analyses of the underwater noise generated in the Northern Adriatic Sea, aiming at estimating the impact of fishing activities on underwater noise pollution and at demonstrating the flexibility and expressiveness of our approach.</p></details> |  |

Different regions in the area exhibit different characteristics while having latent correlations. This spatial heterogeneity and correlations greatly affect the spatio-temporal distributions of event occurrences, which has not been addressed by state-of-the-art models. Learning spatial dependencies of events in a continuous space is challenging due to its fine granularity and a lack of prior knowledge. In this work, we propose a novel Graph Spatio-Temporal Point Process (GSTPP) model for fine-grained event prediction. It adopts an encoder-decoder architecture that jointly models the state dynamics of spatially localized regions using neural Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs). The state evolution is built on the foundation of a novel Self-Adaptive Anchor Graph (SAAG) that captures spatial dependencies. By adaptively localizing the anchor nodes in the space and jointly constructing the correlation edges between them, the SAAG enhances the model's ability of learning complex spatial event patterns. The proposed GSTPP model greatly improves the accuracy of fine-grained event prediction. Extensive experimental results show that our method greatly improves the prediction accuracy over existing spatio-temporal event prediction approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to SIAM International Conference on Data Mining 2025 (SDM'25)</p></details> |

Multi-sensor synchronous measurement has proven to be more effective for WHAR than using a single sensor. However, existing WHAR methods use shared convolutional kernels for indiscriminate temporal feature extraction across each sensor variable, which fails to effectively capture spatio-temporal relationships of intra-sensor and inter-sensor variables. We propose the DecomposeWHAR model consisting of a decomposition phase and a fusion phase to better model the relationships between modality variables. The decomposition creates high-dimensional representations of each intra-sensor variable through the improved Depth Separable Convolution to capture local temporal features while preserving their unique characteristics. The fusion phase begins by capturing relationships between intra-sensor variables and fusing their features at both the channel and variable levels. Long-range temporal dependencies are modeled using the State Space Model (SSM), and later cross-sensor interactions are dynamically captured through a self-attention mechanism, highlighting inter-sensor spatial correlations. Our model demonstrates superior performance on three widely used WHAR datasets, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art models while maintaining acceptable computational efficiency.

| **[Leveraging Consistent Spatio-Temporal Correspondence for Robust Visual Odometry](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16923v3)** | 2025-01-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent approaches to VO have significantly improved performance by using deep networks to predict optical flow between video frames. However, existing methods still suffer from noisy and inconsistent flow matching, making it difficult to handle challenging scenarios and long-sequence estimation. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Spatio-Temporal Visual Odometry (STVO), a novel deep network architecture that effectively leverages inherent spatio-temporal cues to enhance the accuracy and consistency of multi-frame flow matching. With more accurate and consistent flow matching, STVO can achieve better pose estimation through the bundle adjustment (BA). Specifically, STVO introduces two innovative components: 1) the Temporal Propagation Module that utilizes multi-frame information to extract and propagate temporal cues across adjacent frames, maintaining temporal consistency; 2) the Spatial Activation Module that utilizes geometric priors from the depth maps to enhance spatial consistency while filtering out excessive noise and incorrect matches. Our STVO achieves state-of-the-art performance on TUM-RGBD, EuRoc MAV, ETH3D and KITTI Odometry benchmarks. Notably, it improves accuracy by 77.8% on ETH3D benchmark and 38.9% on KITTI Odometry benchmark over the previous best methods.</p></details> |  |

Most recent approaches rely on binary classifiers trained on both real and fake data. However, such methods may struggle to focus on important artifacts, which can hinder their generalization capability. Additionally, these models often lack interpretability, making it difficult to understand how predictions are made. To address these issues, we propose FakeSTormer, offering two key contributions. First, we introduce a multi-task learning framework with additional spatial and temporal branches that enable the model to focus on subtle spatio-temporal artifacts. These branches also provide interpretability by highlighting video regions that may contain artifacts. Second, we propose a video-level data synthesis algorithm that generates pseudo-fake videos with subtle artifacts, providing the model with high-quality samples and ground truth data for our spatial and temporal branches. Extensive experiments on several challenging benchmarks demonstrate the competitiveness of our approach compared to recent state-of-the-art methods.

Concretely, earth science systems rely heavily on the extensive deployment of sensors, however, the data collection from sensors is constrained by complex geographical and social factors, making it challenging to achieve comprehensive coverage and uniform deployment. To alleviate the obstacle, traditional approaches to sensor deployment utilize specific algorithms to design and deploy sensors. These methods \textit{dynamically adjust the activation times of sensors to optimize the detection process across each sub-region}. Regrettably, formulating an activation strategy generally based on historical observations and geographic characteristics, which make the methods and resultant models were neither simple nor practical. Worse still, the complex technical design may ultimately lead to a model with weak generalizability. In this paper, we introduce for the first time the concept of spatio-temporal data dynamic sparse training and are committed to adaptively, dynamically filtering important sensor distributions. To our knowledge, this is the \textbf{first} proposal (\textit{termed DynST}) of an \textbf{industry-level} deployment optimization concept at the data level. However, due to the existence of the temporal dimension, pruning of spatio-temporal data may lead to conflicts at different timestamps. To achieve this goal, we employ dynamic merge technology, along with ingenious dimensional mapping to mitigate potential impacts caused by the temporal aspect. During the training process, DynST utilize iterative pruning and sparse training, repeatedly identifying and dynamically removing sensor perception areas that contribute the least to future predictions.</p></details> |  |

To address this limitation, we explore automated pain detection using facial expressions. Our study leverages deep learning techniques to improve pain assessment by analyzing facial images from the Pain Emotion Faces Database (PEMF). We propose two novel approaches1: (1) a hybrid ConvNeXt model combined with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) blocks to analyze video frames and predict pain presence, and (2) a Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolution Network (STGCN) integrated with LSTM to process landmarks from facial images for pain detection. Our work represents the first use of the PEMF dataset for binary pain classification and demonstrates the effectiveness of these models through extensive experimentation. The results highlight the potential of combining spatial and temporal features for enhanced pain detection, offering a promising advancement in objective pain assessment methodologies.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures, 3 tables.

| **[Get Rid of Isolation: A Continuous Multi-task Spatio-Temporal Learning Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10524v2)** | 2025-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatiotemporal learning has become a pivotal technique to enable urban intelligence. Traditional spatiotemporal models mostly focus on a specific task by assuming a same distribution between training and testing sets. However, given that urban systems are usually dynamic, multi-sourced with imbalanced data distributions, current specific task-specific models fail to generalize to new urban conditions and adapt to new domains without explicitly modeling interdependencies across various dimensions and types of urban data. To this end, we argue that there is an essential to propose a Continuous Multi-task Spatio-Temporal learning framework (CMuST) to empower collective urban intelligence, which reforms the urban spatiotemporal learning from single-domain to cooperatively multi-dimensional and multi-task learning. Specifically, CMuST proposes a new multi-dimensional spatiotemporal interaction network (MSTI) to allow cross-interactions between context and main observations as well as self-interactions within spatial and temporal aspects to be exposed, which is also the core for capturing task-level commonality and personalization. To ensure continuous task learning, a novel Rolling Adaptation training scheme (RoAda) is devised, which not only preserves task uniqueness by constructing data summarization-driven task prompts, but also harnesses correlated patterns among tasks by iterative model behavior modeling. We further establish a benchmark of three cities for multi-task spatiotemporal learning, and empirically demonstrate the superiority of CMuST via extensive evaluations on these datasets. The impressive improvements on both few-shot streaming data and new domain tasks against existing SOAT methods are achieved.

Point processes specified on linear networks can provide a more accurate description of crime incidents by considering the geometry of the city. We propose a spatio-temporal Dirichlet process mixture model on a linear network to analyze crime events in Valencia, Spain. We propose a Bayesian hierarchical model with a Dirichlet process prior to automatically detect space-time clusters of the events and adopt a convolution kernel estimator to account for the network structure in the city. From the fitted model, we provide crime hotspot visualizations that can inform social interventions to prevent crime incidents. Furthermore, we study the relationships between the detected cluster centers and the city's amenities, which provides an intuitive explanation of criminal contagion.</p></details> |  |

However, despite the prevalence of spatio-temporal data in critical domains such as transportation, public health, and environmental monitoring, spatio-temporal foundation models (STFMs) have not yet achieved comparable success. In this paper, we articulate a vision for the future of STFMs, outlining their essential characteristics and the generalization capabilities necessary for broad applicability. We critically assess the current state of research, identifying gaps relative to these ideal traits, and highlight key challenges that impede their progress. Finally, we explore potential opportunities and directions to advance research towards the aim of effective and broadly applicable STFMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[STORM: A Spatio-Temporal Factor Model Based on Dual Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoders for Financial Trading](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09468v2)** | 2025-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In financial trading, factor models are widely used to price assets and capture excess returns from mispricing. Recently, we have witnessed the rise of variational autoencoder-based latent factor models, which learn latent factors self-adaptively. While these models focus on modeling overall market conditions, they often fail to effectively capture the temporal patterns of individual stocks. Additionally, representing multiple factors as single values simplifies the model but limits its ability to capture complex relationships and dependencies. As a result, the learned factors are of low quality and lack diversity, reducing their effectiveness and robustness across different trading periods. To address these issues, we propose a Spatio-Temporal factOR Model based on dual vector quantized variational autoencoders, named STORM, which extracts features of stocks from temporal and spatial perspectives, then fuses and aligns these features at the fine-grained and semantic level, and represents the factors as multi-dimensional embeddings. The discrete codebooks cluster similar factor embeddings, ensuring orthogonality and diversity, which helps distinguish between different factors and enables factor selection in financial trading. To show the performance of the proposed factor model, we apply it to two downstream experiments: portfolio management on two stock datasets and individual trading tasks on six specific stocks. The extensive experiments demonstrate STORM's flexibility in adapting to downstream tasks and superior performance over baseline models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Traffic Prediction Through Spatio-Temporal Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10459v1)** | 2025-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) have gained considerable attention in recent years for traffic flow prediction due to their ability to learn spatio-temporal pattern representations through a graph-based message-passing framework. Although GNNs have shown great promise in handling traffic datasets, their deployment in real-life applications has been hindered by scalability constraints arising from high-order message passing. Additionally, the over-smoothing problem of GNNs may lead to indistinguishable region representations as the number of layers increases, resulting in performance degradation. To address these challenges, we propose a new knowledge distillation paradigm termed LightST that transfers spatial and temporal knowledge from a high-capacity teacher to a lightweight student. Specifically, we introduce a spatio-temporal knowledge distillation framework that helps student MLPs capture graph-structured global spatio-temporal patterns while alleviating the over-smoothing effect with adaptive knowledge distillation. Extensive experiments verify that LightST significantly speeds up traffic flow predictions by 5X to 40X compared to state-of-the-art spatio-temporal GNNs, all while maintaining superior accuracy.</p></details> | 9 pages |

ANN-to-SNN knowledge distillation can improve SNN performance, but previous methods either focus solely on label information, missing valuable intermediate layer features, or use a layer-wise approach that neglects spatial and temporal semantic inconsistencies, leading to performance degradation.To address these limitations, we propose a novel method called self-attentive spatio-temporal calibration (SASTC). SASTC uses self-attention to identify semantically aligned layer pairs between ANN and SNN, both spatially and temporally. This enables the autonomous transfer of relevant semantic information. Extensive experiments show that SASTC outperforms existing methods, effectively solving the mismatching problem. Superior accuracy results include 95.12% on CIFAR-10, 79.40% on CIFAR-100 with 2 time steps, and 68.69% on ImageNet with 4 time steps for static datasets, and 97.92% on DVS-Gesture and 83.60% on DVS-CIFAR10 for neuromorphic datasets. This marks the first time SNNs have outperformed ANNs on both CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, shedding the new light on the potential applications of SNNs.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches typically utilize external information such as semantic maps to improve video prediction accuracy, which often neglect the inherent physical knowledge embedded within videos. Worse still, their high computational costs could impede their applications for high-resolution videos. To address these constraints, we introduce a novel framework called \underline{P}hysics-\underline{a}ssisted \underline{S}patio-\underline{t}emporal \underline{Net}work (PastNet) for high-quality video prediction. The core of PastNet lies in incorporating a spectral convolution operator in the Fourier domain, which efficiently introduces inductive biases from the underlying physical laws. Additionally, we employ a memory bank with the estimated intrinsic dimensionality to discretize local features during the processing of complex spatio-temporal signals, thereby reducing computational costs and facilitating efficient high-resolution video prediction. Extensive experiments on various widely-used spatio-temporal video benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed PastNet compared with a range of state-of-the-art methods, particularly in high-resolution scenarios.</p></details> | 11 |

However, existing approaches that separate anomaly preprocessing from model training for multivariate time series prediction encounter significant limitations. Specifically, these methods fail to utilize auxiliary information crucial for identifying latent anomalies associated with spatiotemporal factors during the preprocessing stage. Instead, they rely solely on data distribution for anomaly detection, which can result in the incorrect processing of numerous samples that could otherwise contribute positively to model training. To address this, we propose STTS-EAD, an end-to-end method that seamlessly integrates anomaly detection into the training process of multivariate time series forecasting and aims to improve Spatio-Temporal learning based Time Series prediction via Embedded Anomaly Detection. Our proposed STTS-EAD leverages spatio-temporal information for forecasting and anomaly detection, with the two parts alternately executed and optimized for each other. To the best of our knowledge, STTS-EAD is the first to integrate anomaly detection and forecasting tasks in the training phase for improving the accuracy of multivariate time series forecasting. Extensive experiments on a public stock dataset and two real-world sales datasets from a renowned coffee chain enterprise show that our proposed method can effectively process detected anomalies in the training stage to improve forecasting performance in the inference stage and significantly outperform baselines.</p></details> | 11 pages |

Small perturbations in conditions can often lead to significant changes in fire spread (such as speed and direction), necessitating a computationally expensive large set of simulations to quantify uncertainty. Model emulation seeks alternative representations of physical models using machine learning, aiming to provide more efficient and/or simplified surrogate models. We propose a dedicated spatio-temporal neural network based framework for model emulation, able to capture the complex behaviour of fire spread models. The proposed approach can approximate forecasts at fine spatial and temporal resolutions that are often challenging for neural network based approaches. Furthermore, the proposed approach is robust even with small training sets, due to novel data augmentation methods. Empirical experiments show good agreement between simulated and emulated firefronts, with an average Jaccard score of 0.76.</p></details> |  |
| **[KITS: Inductive Spatio-Temporal Kriging with Increment Training Strategy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02565v2)** | 2025-01-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sensors are commonly deployed to perceive the environment. However, due to the high cost, sensors are usually sparsely deployed. Kriging is the tailored task to infer the unobserved nodes (without sensors) using the observed source nodes (with sensors). The essence of kriging task is transferability. Recently, several inductive spatio-temporal kriging methods have been proposed based on graph neural networks, being trained based on a graph built on top of observed nodes via pretext tasks such as masking nodes out and reconstructing them. However, the graph in training is inevitably much sparser than the graph in inference that includes all the observed and unobserved nodes. The learned pattern cannot be well generalized for inference, denoted as graph gap. To address this issue, we first present a novel Increment training strategy: instead of masking nodes (and reconstructing them), we add virtual nodes into the training graph so as to mitigate the graph gap issue naturally. Nevertheless, the empty-shell virtual nodes without labels could have bad-learned features and lack supervision signals. To solve these issues, we pair each virtual node with its most similar observed node and fuse their features together; to enhance the supervision signal, we construct reliable pseudo labels for virtual nodes. As a result, the learned pattern of virtual nodes could be safely transferred to real unobserved nodes for reliable kriging. We name our new Kriging model with Increment Training Strategy as KITS. Extensive experiments demonstrate that KITS consistently outperforms existing kriging methods by large margins, e.g., the improvement over MAE score could be as high as 18.33%.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted by AAAI'25</p></details> |

Recently, several automated spatio-temporal forecasting methods have been proposed to automatically search the optimal neural network architecture for capturing complex spatio-temporal dependencies. However, the existing automated approaches suffer from expensive neural architecture search overhead, which hinders their practical use and the further exploration of diverse spatio-temporal operators in a finer granularity. In this paper, we propose AutoSTF, a decoupled automatic neural architecture search framework for cost-effective automated spatio-temporal forecasting. From the efficiency perspective, we first decouple the mixed search space into temporal space and spatial space and respectively devise representation compression and parameter-sharing schemes to mitigate the parameter explosion. The decoupled spatio-temporal search not only expedites the model optimization process but also leaves new room for more effective spatio-temporal dependency modeling. From the effectiveness perspective, we propose a multi-patch transfer module to jointly capture multi-granularity temporal dependencies and extend the spatial search space to enable finer-grained layer-wise spatial dependency search. Extensive experiments on eight datasets demonstrate the superiority of AutoSTF in terms of both accuracy and efficiency. Specifically, our proposed method achieves up to 13.48x speed-up compared to state-of-the-art automatic spatio-temporal forecasting methods while maintaining the best forecasting accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by KDD 2025 Research Track</p></details> |

However, due to the high heterogeneity in structure and semantics among various spatio-temporal modalities, the joint interpretation of multimodal spatio-temporal data has long been an extremely challenging problem. The primary challenge resides in striking a trade-off between the cohesion and autonomy of diverse modalities. This trade-off becomes progressively nonlinear as the number of modalities expands. Inspired by the human cognitive system and linguistic philosophy, where perceptual signals from the five senses converge into language, we introduce the Language as Reference Framework (LaRF), a fundamental principle for constructing a multimodal unified model. Building upon this, we propose AllSpark, a multimodal spatio-temporal general artificial intelligence model. Our model integrates ten different modalities into a unified framework. To achieve modal cohesion, AllSpark introduces a modal bridge and multimodal large language model (LLM) to map diverse modal features into the language feature space. To maintain modality autonomy, AllSpark uses modality-specific encoders to extract the tokens of various spatio-temporal modalities. Finally, observing a gap between the model's interpretability and downstream tasks, we designed modality-specific prompts and task heads, enhancing the model's generalization capability across specific tasks. Experiments indicate that the incorporation of language enables AllSpark to excel in few-shot classification tasks for RGB and point cloud modalities without additional training, surpassing baseline performance by up to 41.82\%.

For each pattern, we construct an independent adaptive spatio-temporal fusion graph based on a cross-attention mechanism, employing residual graph convolution modules and time series modules to better capture dynamic spatio-temporal relationships under different fine-grained traffic patterns.

However, the best practice for incorporating contextual features remains unclear due to inconsistent usage of contextual features in different papers. Developing a multifaceted dataset with rich types of contextual features and STCFP scenarios is crucial for establishing a principled context modeling paradigm. Existing open crowd flow datasets lack an adequate range of contextual features, which poses an urgent requirement to build a multifaceted dataset to fill these research gaps. To this end, we create STContext, a multifaceted dataset for developing context-aware STCFP models. Specifically, STContext provides nine spatio-temporal datasets across five STCFP scenarios and includes ten contextual features, including weather, air quality index, holidays, points of interest, road networks, etc. Besides, we propose a unified workflow for incorporating contextual features into deep STCFP methods, with steps including feature transformation, dependency modeling, representation fusion, and training strategies. Through extensive experiments, we have obtained several useful guidelines for effective context modeling and insights for future research.

Most approaches explore spatio-temporal information of multi-scan to identify the semantic classes and motion states for each point. However, these methods often overlook the segmentation consistency in space and time, which may result in point clouds within the same object being predicted as different categories. To handle this issue, our core idea is to generate cluster labels across multiple frames that can reflect the complete spatial structure and temporal information of objects. These labels serve as explicit guidance for our dual-branch network, 4D-CS, which integrates point-based and cluster-based branches to enable more consistent segmentation. Specifically, in the point-based branch, we leverage historical knowledge to enrich the current feature through temporal fusion on multiple views. In the cluster-based branch, we propose a new strategy to produce cluster labels of foreground objects and apply them to gather point-wise information to derive cluster features. We then merge neighboring clusters across multiple scans to restore missing features due to occlusion. Finally, in the point-cluster fusion stage, we adaptively fuse the information from the two branches to optimize segmentation results. Extensive experiments confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method, and we achieve state-of-the-art results on the multi-scan semantic and moving object segmentation on SemanticKITTI and nuScenes datasets.

However, the high costs of building sensor networks limit their scale and coverage, making fine-grained deployment challenging. Inductive Spatio-Temporal Kriging (ISK) addresses this issue by introducing virtual sensors. Based on graph neural networks (GNNs) extracting the relationships between physical and virtual sensors, ISK can infer the measurements of virtual sensors from physical sensors. However, current ISK methods rely on conventional message-passing mechanisms and network architectures, without effectively extracting spatio-temporal features of physical sensors and focusing on representing virtual sensors. Additionally, existing graph construction methods face issues of sparse and noisy connections, destroying ISK performance. To address these issues, we propose DarkFarseer, a novel ISK framework with three key components. First, we propose the Neighbor Hidden Style Enhancement module with a style transfer strategy to enhance the representation of virtual nodes in a temporal-then-spatial manner to better extract the spatial relationships between physical and virtual nodes. Second, we propose Virtual-Component Contrastive Learning, which aims to enrich the node representation by establishing the association between the patterns of virtual nodes and the regional patterns within graph components. Lastly, we design a Similarity-Based Graph Denoising Strategy, which reduces the connectivity strength of noisy connections around virtual nodes and their neighbors based on their temporal information and regional spatial patterns. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DarkFarseer significantly outperforms existing ISK methods.</p></details> | TKDE (Under Review) |

However, these models often struggle with balancing computational efficiency and model flexibility. To address this challenge, this study develops a fast and flexible method for STVC modeling. For enhanced flexibility in modeling, we assume multiple processes in each varying coefficient, including purely spatial, purely temporal, and spatio-temporal interaction processes with or without time cyclicity. While considering multiple processes can be time consuming, we combine a pre-conditioning method with a model selection procedure, inspired by reluctant interaction modeling. This approach allows us to computationally efficiently select and specify the latent space-time structure. Monte Carlo experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms alternatives in terms of coefficient estimation accuracy and computational efficiency. Finally, we apply the proposed method to crime analysis using a sample size of 279,360, confirming that the proposed method provides reasonable estimates of varying coefficients. The STVC model is implemented in an R package spmoran.</p></details> |  |

In particular, our proposed framework is able to construct and leverage a higher-order graph (hypergraph) to model the complex multi-interactions between sensor nodes in the absence of prior structural knowledge. To capture rich spatio-temporal relationships underlying sensor data, our proposed ST-HCSS incorporates stacked gated temporal and hypergraph convolution layers to effectively aggregate and update hypergraph information across time and nodes.

This is achieved by learning low-dimensional representations from high-dimensional and raw trajectory data. However, existing methods for trajectory representation learning either rely on grid-based or road-based representations, which are inherently different and thus, could lose information contained in the other modality. Moreover, these methods overlook the dynamic nature of urban traffic, relying on static road network features rather than time varying traffic patterns. In this paper, we propose TIGR, a novel model designed to integrate grid and road network modalities while incorporating spatio-temporal dynamics to learn rich, general-purpose representations of trajectories. We evaluate TIGR on two realworld datasets and demonstrate the effectiveness of combining both modalities by substantially outperforming state-of-the-art methods, i.e., up to 43.22% for trajectory similarity, up to 16.65% for travel time estimation, and up to 10.16% for destination prediction.</p></details> |  |

| **[STORM: Spatio-Temporal Reconstruction Model for Large-Scale Outdoor Scenes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00602v1)** | 2024-12-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present STORM, a spatio-temporal reconstruction model designed for reconstructing dynamic outdoor scenes from sparse observations. Existing dynamic reconstruction methods often rely on per-scene optimization, dense observations across space and time, and strong motion supervision, resulting in lengthy optimization times, limited generalization to novel views or scenes, and degenerated quality caused by noisy pseudo-labels for dynamics. To address these challenges, STORM leverages a data-driven Transformer architecture that directly infers dynamic 3D scene representations--parameterized by 3D Gaussians and their velocities--in a single forward pass. Our key design is to aggregate 3D Gaussians from all frames using self-supervised scene flows, transforming them to the target timestep to enable complete (i.e., "amodal") reconstructions from arbitrary viewpoints at any moment in time. As an emergent property, STORM automatically captures dynamic instances and generates high-quality masks using only reconstruction losses. Extensive experiments on public datasets show that STORM achieves precise dynamic scene reconstruction, surpassing state-of-the-art per-scene optimization methods (+4.3 to 6.6 PSNR) and existing feed-forward approaches (+2.1 to 4.7 PSNR) in dynamic regions. STORM reconstructs large-scale outdoor scenes in 200ms, supports real-time rendering, and outperforms competitors in scene flow estimation, improving 3D EPE by 0.422m and Acc5 by 28.02%. Beyond reconstruction, we showcase four additional applications of our model, illustrating the potential of self-supervised learning for broader dynamic scene understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page at: https://jiawei-yang.github.io/STORM/</p></details> |
| **[STARFormer: A Novel Spatio-Temporal Aggregation Reorganization Transformer of FMRI for Brain Disorder Diagnosis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00378v1)** | 2024-12-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many existing methods that use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) classify brain disorders, such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), often overlook the integration of spatial and temporal dependencies of the blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signals, which may lead to inaccurate or imprecise classification results. To solve this problem, we propose a Spatio-Temporal Aggregation eorganization ransformer (STARFormer) that effectively captures both spatial and temporal features of BOLD signals by incorporating three key modules. The region of interest (ROI) spatial structure analysis module uses eigenvector centrality (EC) to reorganize brain regions based on effective connectivity, highlighting critical spatial relationships relevant to the brain disorder. The temporal feature reorganization module systematically segments the time series into equal-dimensional window tokens and captures multiscale features through variable window and cross-window attention. The spatio-temporal feature fusion module employs a parallel transformer architecture with dedicated temporal and spatial branches to extract integrated features. The proposed STARFormer has been rigorously evaluated on two publicly available datasets for the classification of ASD and ADHD. The experimental results confirm that the STARFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple evaluation metrics, providing a more accurate and reliable tool for the diagnosis of brain disorders and biomedical research. The codes will be available at: https://github.com/NZWANG/STARFormer.</p></details> |  |

Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have garnered widespread attention in this field for their proficiency in capturing relationships among joints in human motion. However, existing GCN-based methods tend to focus on either temporal-domain or spatial-domain features, or they combine spatio-temporal features without fully leveraging the complementarity and cross-dependency of these two features. In this paper, we propose the Spatial-Temporal Multi-Subgraph Graph Convolutional Network (STMS-GCN) to capture complex spatio-temporal dependencies in human motion. Specifically, we decouple the modeling of temporal and spatial dependencies, enabling cross-domain knowledge transfer at multiple scales through a spatio-temporal information consistency constraint mechanism. Besides, we utilize multiple subgraphs to extract richer motion information and enhance the learning associations of diverse subgraphs through a homogeneous information constraint mechanism. Extensive experiments on the standard HMP benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our method.</p></details> |  |

However, the lack of justified graph kernels for spatio-temporal modelling has held back their use in graph problems. We leverage an explicit link between stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) and GPs on graphs, introduce a framework for deriving graph kernels via SPDEs, and derive non-separable spatio-temporal graph kernels that capture interaction across space and time. We formulate the graph kernels for the stochastic heat equation and wave equation. We show that by providing novel tools for spatio-temporal GP modelling on graphs, we outperform pre-existing graph kernels in real-world applications that feature diffusion, oscillation, and other complicated interactions.</p></details> |  |

However, existing whole-body-object interaction video benchmarks overlook the truth that open-world objects are diverse, that is, they usually provide limited and predefined object classes. Therefore, we introduce a new open-world benchmark: Grounding Interacted Objects (GIO) including 1,098 interacted objects class and 290K interacted object boxes annotation. Accordingly, an object grounding task is proposed expecting vision systems to discover interacted objects. Even though today's detectors and grounding methods have succeeded greatly, they perform unsatisfactorily in localizing diverse and rare objects in GIO. This profoundly reveals the limitations of current vision systems and poses a great challenge. Thus, we explore leveraging spatio-temporal cues to address object grounding and propose a 4D question-answering framework (4D-QA) to discover interacted objects from diverse videos. Our method demonstrates significant superiority in extensive experiments compared to current baselines.

By analyzing data over a 30-day period with comparable climate and average temperatures, we explored differences in BSS usage between weekdays and weekends in those cities using Jensen-Shannon divergence (JSD) and rank distribution analysis. Our findings reveal significant temporal differences in BSS usage that were commonly observed in all cities, with weekday patterns dominated by commute peaks and weekend patterns reflecting recreational activities. Friday emerges as a transitional day, sharing the characteristics of both weekdays and weekends. Meanwhile, docking station usage rank distributions show remarkable consistency between weekdays and weekends for most cities, with London being a unique anomaly. This study highlights the potential of BSS data to uncover urban mobility patterns and the underlying structures of cities. The results suggest that BSS usage reflects both intrinsic user behavior and external influences such as urban planning.</p></details> | 16pages, 5figures |

However, existing FER methods face three key challenges in real-world applications: (i) they rely on large amounts of continuously annotated data to ensure accuracy since emotions are complex and ambiguous in reality, which is costly and time-consuming; (ii) they cannot capture the temporal heterogeneity caused by changing emotion patterns, because they usually assume that the temporal correlation within sampling periods is the same; (iii) they do not consider the spatial heterogeneity of different FER scenarios, that is, the distribution of emotion information in different data may have bias or interference. To address these challenges, we propose a Spatio-Temporal Fuzzy-oriented Multi-modal Meta-learning framework (ST-F2M). Specifically, ST-F2M first divides the multi-modal videos into multiple views, and each view corresponds to one modality of one emotion. Multiple randomly selected views for the same emotion form a meta-training task. Next, ST-F2M uses an integrated module with spatial and temporal convolutions to encode the data of each task, reflecting the spatial and temporal heterogeneity. Then it adds fuzzy semantic information to each task based on generalized fuzzy rules, which helps handle the complexity and ambiguity of emotions. Finally, ST-F2M learns emotion-related general meta-knowledge through meta-recurrent neural networks to achieve fast and robust fine-grained emotion recognition. Extensive experiments show that ST-F2M outperforms various state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and model efficiency. In addition, we construct ablation studies and further analysis to explore why ST-F2M performs well.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, Submitted to TMM in 30-May-2024</p></details> |
| **[Spatio-Temporal Electromagnetic Kernel Learning for Channel Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17414v1)** | 2024-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate channel prediction is essential for addressing channel aging caused by user mobility. However, the actual channel variations over time are highly complex in high-mobility scenarios, which makes it difficult for existing predictors to obtain future channels accurately. The low accuracy of channel predictors leads to difficulties in supporting reliable communication. To overcome this challenge, we propose a channel predictor based on spatio-temporal electromagnetic (EM) kernel learning (STEM-KL). Specifically, inspired by recent advancements in EM information theory (EIT), the STEM kernel function is derived. The velocity and the concentration kernel parameters are designed to reflect the time-varying propagation of the wireless signal. We obtain the parameters through kernel learning. Then, the future channels are predicted by computing their Bayesian posterior, with the STEM kernel acting as the prior. To further improve the stability and model expressibility, we propose a grid-based EM mixed kernel learning (GEM-KL) scheme. We design the mixed kernel to be a convex combination of multiple sub-kernels, where each of the sub-kernel corresponds to a grid point in the set of pre-selected parameters. This approach transforms non-convex STEM kernel learning problem into a convex grid-based problem that can be easily solved by weight optimization. Finally, simulation results verify that the proposed STEM-KL and GEM-KL schemes can achieve more accurate channel prediction. This indicates that EIT can improve the performance of wireless system efficiently.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper proposes an EIT-inspired Gaussian process regression (GPR)-based channel predictor with improved performance.

Among the many variables captured through satellite sensors, Land Surface Temperature (LST) plays a critical role in understanding key environmental processes. However, obtaining high-resolution LST data remains a challenge, as satellite sensors often face a trade-off between spatial and temporal resolutions. In response, Spatio-Temporal Fusion (STF) has emerged as a powerful method to integrate two satellite data sources, one providing high spatial but low temporal resolution, and the other offering high temporal but low spatial resolution. Although a range of STF techniques have been proposed, from traditional methods to cutting-edge deep learning (DL) models, most have focused on surface reflectance, with limited application to LST estimation. DL approaches, in particular, show promise in improving the spatial and temporal resolutions of LST by capturing complex, non-linear relationships between input and output LST data. This paper offers a comprehensive review of the latest advancements in DL-based STF techniques for LST estimation. We analyze key research developments, mathematically formulate the STF problem, and introduce a novel taxonomy for DL-based STF methods. Furthermore, we discuss the challenges faced by current methods and highlight future research directions. In addition, we present the first open-source benchmark STF dataset for LST estimation, consisting of 51 pairs of MODIS-Landsat images spanning from 2013 to 2024. To support our findings, we conduct extensive experiments on state-of-the-art methods and present both quantitative and qualitative assessments. This is the first survey paper focused on DL-based STF for LST estimation. We hope it serves as a valuable reference for researchers and paves the way for future research in this field.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to the Proceedings of IEEE</p></details> |

Developing techniques to identify and analyze communities in these time-varying graph structures is an important challenge. In this work, we generalize existing spectral clustering algorithms from static to dynamic graphs using canonical correlation analysis (CCA) to capture the temporal evolution of clusters. Based on this extended canonical correlation framework, we define the spatio-temporal graph Laplacian and investigate its spectral properties. We connect these concepts to dynamical systems theory via transfer operators, and illustrate the advantages of our method on benchmark graphs by comparison with existing methods. We show that the spatio-temporal graph Laplacian allows for a clear interpretation of cluster structure evolution over time for directed and undirected graphs.</p></details> |  |

Determining the optimal provisioning of edge resources to meet the varying and uncertain demand cost-effectively is a critical task for SPs. This paper introduces a novel two-stage multi-period robust model for edge service placement and workload allocation, aiming to minimize the SP's operating costs while ensuring service quality. The salient feature of this model lies in its ability to enable SPs to utilize dynamic service placement and leverage spatio-temporal correlation in demand uncertainties to mitigate the inherent conservatism of robust solutions. In our model, resource reservation is optimized in the initial stage, preemptively, before the actual demand is disclosed, whereas dynamic service placement and workload allocation are determined in the subsequent stage, following the revelation of uncertainties. To address the challenges posed by integer recourse variables in the second stage of the resulting tri-level adjustable robust optimization problem, we propose a novel iterative, decomposition-based approach, ensuring finite convergence to an exact optimal solution. Extensive numerical results are provided to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed model and approach.</p></details> | 15 pages |

Yet, causal inference with these data remains challenging due to the twin threats of spatial spillover and temporal carryover effects. We develop methods to estimate heterogeneous treatment effects by allowing for arbitrary spatial and temporal causal dependencies. We focus on common settings where the treatment and outcomes are time-varying spatial point patterns and where moderators are either spatial or spatio-temporal in nature. We define causal estimands based on stochastic interventions where researchers specify counterfactual distributions of treatment events. We propose the Hajek-type estimator of the conditional average treatment effect (CATE) as a function of spatio-temporal moderator variables, and establish its asymptotic normality as the number of time periods increases. We then introduce a statistical test of no heterogeneous treatment effects. Through simulations, we evaluate the finite-sample performance of the proposed CATE estimator and its inferential properties. Our motivating application examines the heterogeneous effects of US airstrikes on insurgent violence in Iraq. Drawing on declassified spatio-temporal data, we examine how prior aid distributions moderate airstrike effects. Contrary to expectations from counterinsurgency theories, we find that prior aid distribution, along with greater amounts of aid per capita, is associated with increased insurgent attacks following airstrikes.</p></details> |  |

In this study, we propose a novel fall detection system using FLAMe (Federated Learning with Attention Mechanism), a federated learning (FL) based algorithm. FLAMe trains around important keypoint information and only transmits the trained important weights to the server, reducing communication costs and preserving data privacy. Furthermore, the lightweight keypoint transformer model is integrated into the FL framework to effectively learn spatio-temporal features. We validated the experiment using 22,672 video samples from the "Fall Accident Risk Behavior Video-Sensor Pair data" dataset from AI-Hub. As a result of the experiment, the FLAMe-based system achieved an accuracy of 94.02% with about 190,000 transmission parameters, maintaining performance similar to that of existing centralized learning while maximizing efficiency by reducing communication costs by about 40% compared to the existing FL algorithm, FedAvg. Therefore, the FLAMe algorithm has demonstrated that it provides robust performance in the distributed environment of smart cities and is a practical and effective solution for public safety.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 7 figures, AAAI 2025 FLUID Workshop</p></details> |

Achieving accurate traffic prediction hinges on the ability to capture the potential spatio-temporal relationships among road sensors. However, the majority of existing works focus on local short-term spatio-temporal correlations, failing to fully consider the interactions of different sensors in the long-term state. In addition, these works do not analyze the influences of anomalous factors, or have insufficient ability to extract personalized features of anomalous factors, which make them ineffectively capture their spatio-temporal influences on traffic prediction. To address the aforementioned issues, We propose a global spatio-temporal fusion-based traffic prediction algorithm that incorporates anomaly awareness. Initially, based on the designed anomaly detection network, we construct an efficient anomalous factors impacting module (AFIM), to evaluate the spatio-temporal impact of unexpected external events on traffic prediction. Furthermore, we propose a multi-scale spatio-temporal feature fusion module (MTSFFL) based on the transformer architecture, to obtain all possible both long and short term correlations among different sensors in a wide-area traffic environment for accurate prediction of traffic flow. Finally, experiments are implemented based on real-scenario public transportation datasets (PEMS04 and PEMS08) to demonstrate that our approach can achieve state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  |

One such example is forecasting the concentration of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) in the atmosphere which is influenced by many complex factors, the most important ones being diffusion due to meteorological factors as well as transport across vast distances over a period of time. We present a novel Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Network architecture, that specifically captures these dependencies to forecast the PM2.5 concentration. Our model is based on an encoder-decoder architecture where the encoder and decoder parts leverage gated recurrent units (GRU) augmented with a graph neural network (TransformerConv) to account for spatial diffusion. Our model can also be seen as a generalization of various existing models for time-series or spatio-temporal forecasting. We demonstrate the model's effectiveness on two real-world PM2.5 datasets: (1) data collected by us using a recently deployed network of low-cost PM$_{2.5}$ sensors from 511 locations spanning the entirety of the Indian state of Bihar over a period of one year, and (2) another publicly available dataset that covers severely polluted regions from China for a period of 4 years.

This discrepancy arises primarily from the high costs associated with the input of existing representation models, which often require street views and mobility data. To address this, we develop a novel, training-free method that leverages large language models (LLMs) and auxiliary map data from OpenStreetMap to derive geolocation representations (LLMGeovec). LLMGeovec can represent the geographic semantics of city, country, and global scales, which acts as a generic enhancer for spatio-temporal learning. Specifically, by direct feature concatenation, we introduce a simple yet effective paradigm for enhancing multiple spatio-temporal tasks including geographic prediction (GP), long-term time series forecasting (LTSF), and graph-based spatio-temporal forecasting (GSTF). LLMGeovec can seamlessly integrate into a wide spectrum of spatio-temporal learning models, providing immediate enhancements. Experimental results demonstrate that LLMGeovec achieves global coverage and significantly boosts the performance of leading GP, LTSF, and GSTF models.

An established measure for quantifying data freshness is the Age-of-Information (AoI), which has been the subject of extensive research. Recently, there has been increased interest in multi-sensor systems: redundant sensors producing samples of the same physical process, sensors such as cameras producing overlapping views, or distributed sensors producing correlated samples. When the information from a particular sensor is outdated, fresh samples from other correlated sensors can be helpful. To quantify the utility of distant but correlated samples, we put forth a two-dimensional (2D) model of AoI that takes into account the sensor distance in an age-equivalent representation. Since we define 2D-AoI as equivalent to AoI, it can be readily linked to existing AoI research, especially on parallel systems. We consider physical phenomena modeled as spatio-temporal processes and derive the 2D-AoI for different Gaussian correlation kernels. For a basic exponential product kernel, we find that spatial distance causes an additive offset of the AoI, while for other kernels the effects of spatial distance are more complex and vary with time. Using our methodology, we evaluate the 2D-AoI of different spatial topologies and sensor densities.</p></details> |  |

Inspired by the development of TextVQA in image domain, existing Video TextVQA approaches leverage a language model (e.g. T5) to process text-rich multiple frames and generate answers auto-regressively. Nevertheless, the spatio-temporal relationships among visual entities (including scene text and objects) will be disrupted and models are susceptible to interference from unrelated information, resulting in irrational reasoning and inaccurate answering. To tackle these challenges, we propose the TEA (stands for ``\textbf{T}rack th\textbf{E} \textbf{A}nswer'') method that better extends the generative TextVQA framework from image to video. TEA recovers the spatio-temporal relationships in a complementary way and incorporates OCR-aware clues to enhance the quality of reasoning questions.

So is statistics, the queen of science. Big data are particularly relevant to spatio-temporal statistics, thanks to much-improved technology in satellite based remote sensing and Geographical Information Systems. However, none of the existing approaches seem to meet the simultaneous demand of reality emulation and cheap computation. In this article, with the Levy random fields as the starting point, e construct a new Bayesian nonparametric, nonstationary and nonseparable dynamic spatio-temporal model with the additional realistic property that the lagged spatio-temporal correlations converge to zero as the lag tends to infinity. Although our Bayesian model seems to be intricately structured and is variable-dimensional with respect to each time index, we are able to devise a fast and efficient parallel Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm for Bayesian inference. Our simulation experiment brings out quite encouraging performance from our Bayesian Levy-dynamic approach. We finally apply our Bayesian Levy-dynamic model and methods to a sea surface temperature dataset consisting of 139,300 data points in space and time. Although not big data in the true sense, this is a large and highly structured data by any standard. Even for this large and complex data, our parallel MCMC algorithm, implemented on 80 processors, generated 110,000 MCMC realizations from the Levy-dynamic posterior within a single day, and the resultant Bayesian posterior predictive analysis turned out to be encouraging. Thus, it is not unreasonable to expect that with significantly more computing resources, it is feasible to analyse terabytes of spatio-temporal data with our new model and methods.</p></details> | An updated version |

However, the complex and dynamic nature of these correlations presents significant modeling challenges. To address this, we propose a spatio-temporal dynamic hypergraph learning (STDHL) model. This model uses a hypergraph structure to represent spatial features among wind farms. Unlike traditional graph structures, which only capture pair-wise node features, hypergraphs create hyperedges connecting multiple nodes, enabling the representation and transmission of higher-order spatial features. The STDHL model incorporates a novel dynamic hypergraph convolutional layer to model dynamic spatial correlations and a grouped temporal convolutional layer for channel-independent temporal modeling. The model uses spatio-temporal encoders to extract features from multi-source covariates, which are mapped to quantile results through a forecast decoder. Experimental results using the GEFCom dataset show that the STDHL model outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, an in-depth analysis highlights the critical role of spatio-temporal covariates in improving ultra-short-term forecasting accuracy.</p></details> |  |

However, existing transformer-based methods primarily use self-attention mechanisms for spatio-temporal modeling, leading to a quadratic complexity, unidirectional modeling of spatio-temporal relationships, and insufficient learning of spatial-temporal correlations. Recently, the Mamba architecture, utilizing the state space model (SSM), has exhibited superior long-range modeling capabilities in a variety of vision tasks with linear complexity. In this paper, we propose PoseMamba, a novel purely SSM-based approach with linear complexity for 3D human pose estimation in monocular video. Specifically, we propose a bidirectional global-local spatio-temporal SSM block that comprehensively models human joint relations within individual frames as well as temporal correlations across frames. Within this bidirectional global-local spatio-temporal SSM block, we introduce a reordering strategy to enhance the local modeling capability of the SSM. This strategy provides a more logical geometric scanning order and integrates it with the global SSM, resulting in a combined global-local spatial scan. We have quantitatively and qualitatively evaluated our approach using two benchmark datasets: Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PoseMamba achieves state-of-the-art performance on both datasets while maintaining a smaller model size and reducing computational costs.

However, understanding videos, especially long videos, remain a challenge to VLLMs as the number of visual tokens grows rapidly when encoding videos, resulting in the risk of exceeding the context window of VLLMs and introducing heavy computation burden. To restrict the number of visual tokens, existing VLLMs either: (1) uniformly downsample videos into a fixed number of frames or (2) reducing the number of visual tokens encoded from each frame. We argue the former solution neglects the rich temporal cue in videos and the later overlooks the spatial details in each frame. In this work, we present Balanced-VLLM (B-VLLM): a novel VLLM framework that aims to effectively leverage task relevant spatio-temporal cues while restricting the number of visual tokens under the VLLM context window length. At the core of our method, we devise a text-conditioned adaptive frame selection module to identify frames relevant to the visual understanding task. The selected frames are then de-duplicated using a temporal frame token merging technique. The visual tokens of the selected frames are processed through a spatial token sampling module and an optional spatial token merging strategy to achieve precise control over the token count. Experimental results show that B-VLLM is effective in balancing the number of frames and visual tokens in video understanding, yielding superior performance on various video understanding benchmarks.

Schr\"odinger in 1931/32. It represents an early formulation of a maximum likelihood problem. This specific formulation can also be seen as the control problem to modify the law of a diffusion process so as to match specifications on marginal distributions at given times. Thereby, in recent years, this so-called Schr\"odinger's bridge problem has been at the center of the uncertainty control development. However, an understudied facet of this program has been to address uncertainty in space (state) and time, modeling the effect of tasks being completed contingent on meeting a certain condition at some random time instead of imposing specifications at fixed times. The present work is a study to extend Schr\"odinger's paradigm on such an issue, and herein, it is tackled in the context of random walks on directed graphs. Specifically, we study the case where one marginal is the initial probability distribution on a Markov chain, while others are marginals of stopping (first-arrival) times at absorbing states, signifying completion of tasks. We show when the prior law on paths is Markov, a Markov policy is once again optimal to satisfy those marginal constraints with respect to a likelihood cost following Schr\"odinger's dictum. Based on this, we present the mathematical formulation involving a Sinkhorn-type iteration to construct the optimal probability law on paths matching the spatio-temporal marginals.</p></details> | 11 pages, 3 figures |

In particular, Saudi Arabia is gradually shifting its energy portfolio from an exclusive use of oil to a reliance on renewable energy, and, in particular, wind. Modeling wind for assessing potential energy output in a country as large, geographically diverse and understudied as Saudi Arabia is a challenge which implies highly non-linear dynamic structures in both space and time. To address this, we propose a spatio-temporal model whose spatial information is first reduced via an energy distance-based approach and then its dynamical behavior is informed by a sparse and stochastic recurrent neural network (Echo State Network). Finally, the full spatial data is reconstructed by means of a non-stationary stochastic partial differential equation-based approach. Our model can capture the fine scale wind structure and produce more accurate forecasts of both wind speed and energy in lead times of interest for energy grid management and save annually as much as one million dollar against the closest competitive model.</p></details> |  |

In this article, we propose a novel spatio-temporal model using a strategic modification of the Hamiltonian equations, incorporating appropriate stochasticity via Gaussian processes. The resultant spatio-temporal process, continuously varying with time, turns out to be nonparametric, non-stationary, non-separable, and non-Gaussian. Additionally, the lagged correlations converge to zero as the spatio-temporal lag goes to infinity. We investigate the theoretical properties of the new spatio-temporal process, including its continuity and smoothness properties. We derive methods for complete Bayesian inference using MCMC techniques in the Bayesian paradigm. The performance of our method has been compared with that of a non-stationary Gaussian process (GP) using two simulation studies, where our method shows a significant improvement over the non-stationary GP. Further, applying our new model to two real data sets revealed encouraging performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Anoth...</summary><p>Another updated version, demonstrating superiority of our ideas over existing ones</p></details> |

We present a comprehensive analysis of time integration methods, highlighting the adaptation of the two-step Adams-Bashforth scheme to enhance long-term prediction robustness in auto-regressive models. Additionally, we improve temporal prediction accuracy through a multi-step rollout strategy that incorporates multiple future time steps during training, supported by three newly proposed approaches that dynamically adjust the importance of each future step. By integrating the Adams-Bashforth scheme with adaptive multi-step strategies, our graph neural network-based auto-regressive model accurately predicts 350 future time steps, even under practical constraints such as limited training data and minimal model capacity -- achieving an error of only 1.6% compared to the vanilla auto-regressive approach. Moreover, our framework demonstrates an 83% improvement in rollout performance over the standard noise injection method, a standard technique for enhancing long-term rollout performance. Its effectiveness is further validated in more challenging scenarios with truncated meshes, showcasing its adaptability and robustness in practical applications. This work introduces a versatile framework for robust long-term spatio-temporal auto-regressive predictions, effectively mitigating error accumulation across various model types and engineering discipline.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Topological Dependencies in Spatio-Temporal Graphs with Cycle Message Passing Blocks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15894v2)** | 2024-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Transformer-based models have been increasingly adopted to learn the complex vector representations of spatio-temporal graphs, capturing intricate spatio-temporal dependencies crucial for applications such as traffic datasets. Although many existing methods utilize multi-head attention mechanisms and message-passing neural networks (MPNNs) to capture both spatial and temporal relations, these approaches encode temporal and spatial relations independently, and reflect the graph's topological characteristics in a limited manner. In this work, we introduce the Cycle to Mixer (Cy2Mixer), a novel spatio-temporal GNN based on topological non-trivial invariants of spatio-temporal graphs with gated multi-layer perceptrons (gMLP). The Cy2Mixer is composed of three blocks based on MLPs: A temporal block for capturing temporal properties, a message-passing block for encapsulating spatial information, and a cycle message-passing block for enriching topological information through cyclic subgraphs. We bolster the effectiveness of Cy2Mixer with mathematical evidence emphasizing that our cycle message-passing block is capable of offering differentiated information to the deep learning model compared to the message-passing block. Furthermore, empirical evaluations substantiate the efficacy of the Cy2Mixer, demonstrating state-of-the-art performances across various spatio-temporal benchmark datasets.

| **[Spatio-Temporal Context Prompting for Zero-Shot Action Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15996v3)** | 2024-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal action detection encompasses the tasks of localizing and classifying individual actions within a video. Recent works aim to enhance this process by incorporating interaction modeling, which captures the relationship between people and their surrounding context. However, these approaches have primarily focused on fully-supervised learning, and the current limitation lies in the lack of generalization capability to recognize unseen action categories. In this paper, we aim to adapt the pretrained image-language models to detect unseen actions. To this end, we propose a method which can effectively leverage the rich knowledge of visual-language models to perform Person-Context Interaction. Meanwhile, our Context Prompting module will utilize contextual information to prompt labels, thereby enhancing the generation of more representative text features. Moreover, to address the challenge of recognizing distinct actions by multiple people at the same timestamp, we design the Interest Token Spotting mechanism which employs pretrained visual knowledge to find each person's interest context tokens, and then these tokens will be used for prompting to generate text features tailored to each individual. To evaluate the ability to detect unseen actions, we propose a comprehensive benchmark on J-HMDB, UCF101-24, and AVA datasets. The experiments show that our method achieves superior results compared to previous approaches and can be further extended to multi-action videos, bringing it closer to real-world applications.

| **[A Spatio-Temporal Representation Learning as an Alternative to Traditional Glosses in Sign Language Translation and Production](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02854v2)** | 2024-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work addresses the challenges associated with the use of glosses in both Sign Language Translation (SLT) and Sign Language Production (SLP). While glosses have long been used as a bridge between sign language and spoken language, they come with two major limitations that impede the advancement of sign language systems. First, annotating the glosses is a labor-intensive and time-consuming process, which limits the scalability of datasets. Second, the glosses oversimplify sign language by stripping away its spatio-temporal dynamics, reducing complex signs to basic labels and missing the subtle movements essential for precise interpretation. To address these limitations, we introduce Universal Gloss-level Representation (UniGloR), a framework designed to capture the spatio-temporal features inherent in sign language, providing a more dynamic and detailed alternative to the use of the glosses. The core idea of UniGloR is simple yet effective: We derive dense spatio-temporal representations from sign keypoint sequences using self-supervised learning and seamlessly integrate them into SLT and SLP tasks. Our experiments in a keypoint-based setting demonstrate that UniGloR either outperforms or matches the performance of previous SLT and SLP methods on two widely-used datasets: PHOENIX14T and How2Sign.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at WACV 2025</p></details> |
| **[Semi-decentralized Training of Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks for Traffic Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03188v1)** | 2024-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In smart mobility, large networks of geographically distributed sensors produce vast amounts of high-frequency spatio-temporal data that must be processed in real time to avoid major disruptions. Traditional centralized approaches are increasingly unsuitable to this task, as they struggle to scale with expanding sensor networks, and reliability issues in central components can easily affect the whole deployment. To address these challenges, we explore and adapt semi-decentralized training techniques for Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks (ST-GNNs) in smart mobility domain. We implement a simulation framework where sensors are grouped by proximity into multiple cloudlets, each handling a subgraph of the traffic graph, fetching node features from other cloudlets to train its own local ST-GNN model, and exchanging model updates with other cloudlets to ensure consistency, enhancing scalability and removing reliance on a centralized aggregator. We perform extensive comparative evaluation of four different ST-GNN training setups -- centralized, traditional FL, server-free FL, and Gossip Learning -- on large-scale traffic datasets, the METR-LA and PeMS-BAY datasets, for short-, mid-, and long-term vehicle speed predictions. Experimental results show that semi-decentralized setups are comparable to centralized approaches in performance metrics, while offering advantages in terms of scalability and fault tolerance. In addition, we highlight often overlooked issues in existing literature for distributed ST-GNNs, such as the variation in model performance across different geographical areas due to region-specific traffic patterns, and the significant communication overhead and computational costs that arise from the large receptive field of GNNs, leading to substantial data transfers and increased computation of partial embeddings.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 4 figures, 3 tables, conference</p></details> |
| **[Multi-resolution filters via linear projection for large spatio-temporal datasets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05315v2)** | 2024-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advances in compact sensing devices mounted on satellites have facilitated the collection of large spatio-temporal datasets with coordinates. Since such datasets are often incomplete and noisy, it is useful to create the prediction surface of a spatial field. To this end, we consider an online filtering inference by using the Kalman filter based on linear Gaussian state-space models. However, the Kalman filter is impractically time-consuming when the number of locations in spatio-temporal datasets is large. To address this problem, we propose a multi-resolution filter via linear projection (MRF-lp), a fast computation method for online filtering inference. In the MRF-lp, by carrying out a multi-resolution approximation via linear projection (MRA-lp), the forecast covariance matrix can be approximated while capturing both the large- and small-scale spatial variations. As a result of this approximation, our proposed MRF-lp preserves a block-sparse structure of some matrices appearing in the MRF-lp through time, which leads to the scalability of this algorithm. Additionally, we discuss extensions of the MRF-lp to a nonlinear and non-Gaussian case. Simulation studies and real data analysis for total precipitable water vapor demonstrate that our proposed approach performs well compared with the related methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>48 pa...</summary><p>48 pages, 10 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |

In this paper, we utilise statistical spatio-temporal methods to combine data from various sources and resolutions, aiming to accurately model krill abundance. Our focus lies in fitting the model to a dataset comprising acoustic measurements of krill biomass. To achieve this, we integrate climate covariates obtained from satellite imagery and from drifting surface buoys (also known as drifters). Additionally, we use sparsely collected krill biomass data obtained from net fishing efforts (KRILLBASE) for validation. However, integrating these multiple heterogeneous data sources presents significant modelling challenges, including spatio-temporal misalignment and inflated zeros in the observed data. To address these challenges, we fit a Hurdle-Gamma model to jointly describe the occurrence of zeros and the krill biomass for the non-zero observations, while also accounting for misaligned and heterogeneous data sources, including drifters. Therefore, our work presents a comprehensive framework for analysing and predicting krill abundance in the Southern Ocean, leveraging information from various sources and formats. This is crucial due to the impact of krill fishing, as understanding their distribution is essential for informed management decisions and fishing regulations aimed at protecting the species.</p></details> |  |
| **[STEP: Enhancing Video-LLMs' Compositional Reasoning by Spatio-Temporal Graph-guided Self-Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00161v1)** | 2024-11-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) have recently shown strong performance in basic video understanding tasks, such as captioning and coarse-grained question answering, but struggle with compositional reasoning that requires multi-step spatio-temporal inference across object relations, interactions, and events. The hurdles to enhancing this capability include extensive manual labor, the lack of spatio-temporal compositionality in existing data and the absence of explicit reasoning supervision. In this paper, we propose STEP, a novel graph-guided self-training method that enables Video-LLMs to generate reasoning-rich fine-tuning data from any raw videos to improve itself. Specifically, we first induce Spatio-Temporal Scene Graph (STSG) representation of diverse videos to capture fine-grained, multi-granular video semantics. Then, the STSGs guide the derivation of multi-step reasoning Question-Answer (QA) data with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) rationales. Both answers and rationales are integrated as training objective, aiming to enhance model's reasoning abilities by supervision over explicit reasoning steps. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of STEP across models of varying scales, with a significant 21.3\% improvement in tasks requiring three or more reasoning steps. Furthermore, it achieves superior performance with a minimal amount of self-generated rationale-enriched training samples in both compositional reasoning and comprehensive understanding benchmarks, highlighting the broad applicability and vast potential.</p></details> |  |
| **[STANet: A Novel Spatio-Temporal Aggregation Network for Depression Classification with Small and Unbalanced FMRI Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21323v2)** | 2024-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate diagnosis of depression is crucial for timely implementation of optimal treatments, preventing complications and reducing the risk of suicide. Traditional methods rely on self-report questionnaires and clinical assessment, lacking objective biomarkers. Combining fMRI with artificial intelligence can enhance depression diagnosis by integrating neuroimaging indicators. However, the specificity of fMRI acquisition for depression often results in unbalanced and small datasets, challenging the sensitivity and accuracy of classification models. In this study, we propose the Spatio-Temporal Aggregation Network (STANet) for diagnosing depression by integrating CNN and RNN to capture both temporal and spatial features of brain activity. STANet comprises the following steps:(1) Aggregate spatio-temporal information via ICA. (2) Utilize multi-scale deep convolution to capture detailed features. (3) Balance data using the SMOTE to generate new samples for minority classes. (4) Employ the AFGRU classifier, which combines Fourier transformation with GRU, to capture long-term dependencies, with an adaptive weight assignment mechanism to enhance model generalization. The experimental results demonstrate that STANet achieves superior depression diagnostic performance with 82.38% accuracy and a 90.72% AUC. The STFA module enhances classification by capturing deeper features at multiple scales. The AFGRU classifier, with adaptive weights and stacked GRU, attains higher accuracy and AUC. SMOTE outperforms other oversampling methods. Additionally, spatio-temporal aggregated features achieve better performance compared to using only temporal or spatial features. STANet outperforms traditional or deep learning classifiers, and functional connectivity-based classifiers, as demonstrated by ten-fold cross-validation.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is published on Tomography</p></details> |

We are the first to propose a new benchmark for multi-person spatio-temporal complex activity localization, where complex semantic and long duration bring new challenges to localization tasks. We observe that limited atomic actions can be combined into many complex activities. MM-SEAL provides both atomic action and complex activity annotations, producing 111.7k atomic actions spanning 172 action categories and 17.7k complex activities spanning 200 activity categories. We explore the relationship between atomic actions and complex activities, finding that atomic action features can improve the complex activity localization performance. Also, we propose a new network which generates temporal proposals and labels simultaneously, termed Faster-TAD. Finally, our evaluations show that visual features pretrained on MM-SEAL can improve the performance on other action localization benchmarks. We will release the dataset and the project code upon publication of the paper.</p></details> | 17 pages,6 figures |
| **[Temporal Reversed Training for Spiking Neural Networks with Generalized Spatio-Temporal Representation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09108v2)** | 2024-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have received widespread attention as an ultra-low power computing paradigm. Recent studies have focused on improving the feature extraction capability of SNNs, but they suffer from inefficient inference and suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective temporal reversed training (TRT) method to optimize the spatio-temporal performance of SNNs and circumvent these problems. We perturb the input temporal data by temporal reversal, prompting the SNN to produce original-reversed consistent outputs and to learn perturbation-invariant representations. For static data without temporal dimension, we generalize this strategy by exploiting the inherent temporal property of SNNs for spike feature temporal reversal. In addition, we utilize the lightweight ``star operation" (element-wise multiplication) to hybridize the original and temporally reversed spike firing rates and expand the implicit dimensions, which serves as spatio-temporal regularization to further enhance the generalization of the SNN. Our method involves only a temporal reversal operation and element-wise multiplication during training, thus incurring negligible training overhead and not affecting the inference efficiency at all. Extensive experiments on static/neuromorphic object/action recognition, and 3D point cloud classification tasks demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our method. In particular, with only two timesteps, our method achieves 74.77\% and 90.57\% accuracy on ImageNet and ModelNet40, respectively.</p></details> | 17 pages, 9 figures |

Traditional hydrologic modeling approaches simulate streamflow by establishing connections across multiple physical processes, such as rainfall and runoff. These data, inherently connected both spatially and temporally, possess intrinsic causal relations that can be leveraged for robust and accurate forecasting. Recently, spatio-temporal graph neural networks (STGNNs) have been adopted, excelling in various domains, such as urban traffic management, weather forecasting, and pandemic control, and they also promise advances in streamflow management. However, learning causal relationships directly from vast observational data is theoretically and computationally challenging. In this study, we employ a river flow graph as prior knowledge to facilitate the learning of the causal structure and then use the learned causal graph to predict streamflow at targeted sites. The proposed model, Causal Streamflow Forecasting (CSF) is tested in a real-world study in the Brazos River basin in Texas. Our results demonstrate that our method outperforms regular spatio-temporal graph neural networks and achieves higher computational efficiency compared to traditional simulation methods. By effectively integrating river flow graphs with STGNNs, this research offers a novel approach to streamflow prediction, showcasing the potential of combining advanced neural network techniques with domain-specific knowledge for enhanced performance in hydrologic modeling.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be published at IEEE Big Data 2024</p></details> |

However, existing methods, which rely on either spatial SMPL(-X) poses or temporal embeddings, respectively suffer from coarse rendering quality or limited animation flexibility. To address these challenges, we propose GAST, a framework that unifies 3D human modeling with 3DGS by hierarchically integrating both spatial and temporal information. Specifically, we design a sequential conditioning framework for the non-rigid warping of the human body, under whose guidance more accurate 3D Gaussians can be obtained in the observation space. Moreover, the explicit properties of Gaussians allow us to embed richer sequential information, encompassing both the coarse sequence of human poses and finer per-vertex motion details. These sequence conditions are further sampled across different temporal scales, in a coarse-to-fine manner, ensuring unbiased inputs for non-rigid warping. Experimental results demonstrate that our method combined with hierarchical spatio-temporal modeling surpasses concurrent baselines, delivering both high-quality rendering and flexible animating capabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Distribution-aware Online Continual Learning for Urban Spatio-Temporal Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15893v1)** | 2024-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Urban spatio-temporal (ST) forecasting is crucial for various urban applications such as intelligent scheduling and trip planning. Previous studies focus on modeling ST correlations among urban locations in offline settings, which often neglect the non-stationary nature of urban ST data, particularly, distribution shifts over time. This oversight can lead to degraded performance in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we first analyze the distribution shifts in urban ST data, and then introduce DOST, a novel online continual learning framework tailored for ST data characteristics. DOST employs an adaptive ST network equipped with a variable-independent adapter to address the unique distribution shifts at each urban location dynamically. Further, to accommodate the gradual nature of these shifts, we also develop an awake-hibernate learning strategy that intermittently fine-tunes the adapter during the online phase to reduce computational overhead. This strategy integrates a streaming memory update mechanism designed for urban ST sequential data, enabling effective network adaptation to new patterns while preventing catastrophic forgetting. Experimental results confirm DOST's superiority over state-of-the-art models on four real-world datasets, providing online forecasts within an average of 0.1 seconds and achieving a 12.89% reduction in forecast errors compared to baseline models.</p></details> |  |

However, these networks often face challenges in training due to the high annotation cost. To address this, unsupervised and weakly-supervised methods have been developed to reduce the dependency on annotations. This work introduces a novel weakly-supervised method called Eigen-Cluster VIS that, without requiring any mask annotations, achieves competitive accuracy compared to other VIS approaches. This method is based on two key innovations: a Temporal Eigenvalue Loss (TEL) and a clip-level Quality Cluster Coefficient (QCC). The TEL ensures temporal coherence by leveraging the eigenvalues of the Laplacian matrix derived from graph adjacency matrices. By minimizing the mean absolute error between the eigenvalues of adjacent frames, this loss function promotes smooth transitions and stable segmentation boundaries over time, reducing temporal discontinuities and improving overall segmentation quality. The QCC employs the K-means method to ensure the quality of spatio-temporal clusters without relying on ground truth masks. Using the Davies-Bouldin score, the QCC provides an unsupervised measure of feature discrimination, allowing the model to self-evaluate and adapt to varying object distributions, enhancing robustness during the testing phase. These enhancements are computationally efficient and straightforward, offering significant performance gains without additional annotated data. The proposed Eigen-Cluster VIS method is evaluated on the YouTube-Video Instance Segmentation (YouTube-VIS) 2019/2021 and Occluded Video Instance Segmentation (OVIS) datasets, demonstrating that it effectively narrows the performance gap between the fully-supervised and weakly-supervised VIS approaches.

While the ERA5 reanalysis dataset provides consistent long-term global precipitation information that allows investigations of these impacts, it lacks the resolution to capture the high spatio-temporal variability of precipitation. ERA5 misses intense local rainfall events that are crucial drivers of devastating flooding - a critical limitation since extreme weather events become increasingly frequent. Here, we introduce spateGAN-ERA5, the first deep learning based spatio-temporal downscaling of precipitation data on a global scale. SpateGAN-ERA5 uses a conditional generative adversarial neural network (cGAN) that enhances the resolution of ERA5 precipitation data from 24 km and 1 hour to 2 km and 10 minutes, delivering high-resolution rainfall fields with realistic spatio-temporal patterns and accurate rain rate distribution including extremes. Its computational efficiency enables the generation of a large ensemble of solutions, addressing uncertainties inherent to the challenges of downscaling. Trained solely on data from Germany and validated in the US and Australia considering diverse climate zones, spateGAN-ERA5 demonstrates strong generalization indicating a robust global applicability. SpateGAN-ERA5 fulfils a critical need for high-resolution precipitation data in hydrological and meteorological research, offering new capabilities for flood risk assessment, AI-enhanced weather forecasting, and impact modelling to address climate-driven challenges worldwide.</p></details> |  |

This study focuses on using spatio-temporal disease mapping models to explore the temporal trends of IHD at the county level from 1999 to 2021. To manage the computational burden arising from the high-dimensional data, we employ scalable Bayesian models using a "divide and conquer" strategy. This approach allows for fast model fitting and serves as an efficient procedure for screening spatio-temporal patterns. Additionally, we analyze trends in four regional subdivisions, West, Midwest, South and Northeast, and in urban and rural areas. The dataset on IHD contains missing data, and we propose a procedure to impute the omitted information. The results show a slowdown in the decrease of IHD mortality in the US after 2014 with a slight increase noted after 2019. However, differences exists among the counties, the four big geographical regions, and rural and urban areas.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Spatio-Temporal Signal Recognition on Edge Devices Using PointLCA-Net](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14585v1)** | 2024-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in machine learning, particularly through deep learning architectures like PointNet, have transformed the processing of three-dimensional (3D) point clouds, significantly improving 3D object classification and segmentation tasks. While 3D point clouds provide detailed spatial information, spatio-temporal signals introduce a dynamic element that accounts for changes over time. However, applying deep learning techniques to spatio-temporal signals and deploying them on edge devices presents challenges, including real-time processing, memory capacity, and power consumption. To address these issues, this paper presents a novel approach that combines PointNet's feature extraction with the in-memory computing capabilities and energy efficiency of neuromorphic systems for spatio-temporal signal recognition. The proposed method consists of a two-stage process: in the first stage, PointNet extracts features from the spatio-temporal signals, which are then stored in non-volatile memristor crossbar arrays. In the second stage, these features are processed by a single-layer spiking neural encoder-decoder that employs the Locally Competitive Algorithm (LCA) for efficient encoding and classification. This work integrates the strengths of both PointNet and LCA, enhancing computational efficiency and energy performance on edge devices. PointLCA-Net achieves high recognition accuracy for spatio-temporal data with substantially lower energy burden during both inference and training than comparable approaches, thus advancing the deployment of advanced neural architectures in energy-constrained environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2411.00140</p></details> |
| **[Towards Unbiased and Robust Spatio-Temporal Scene Graph Generation and Anticipation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13059v1)** | 2024-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-Temporal Scene Graphs (STSGs) provide a concise and expressive representation of dynamic scenes by modelling objects and their evolving relationships over time. However, real-world visual relationships often exhibit a long-tailed distribution, causing existing methods for tasks like Video Scene Graph Generation (VidSGG) and Scene Graph Anticipation (SGA) to produce biased scene graphs. To this end, we propose ImparTail, a novel training framework that leverages curriculum learning and loss masking to mitigate bias in the generation and anticipation of spatio-temporal scene graphs. Our approach gradually decreases the dominance of the head relationship classes during training and focuses more on tail classes, leading to more balanced training. Furthermore, we introduce two new tasks, Robust Spatio-Temporal Scene Graph Generation and Robust Scene Graph Anticipation, designed to evaluate the robustness of STSG models against distribution shifts. Extensive experiments on the Action Genome dataset demonstrate that our framework significantly enhances the unbiased performance and robustness of STSG models compared to existing methods.</p></details> | Under review |
| **[A Foundation Model for Unified Urban Spatio-Temporal Flow Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12972v1)** | 2024-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Urban spatio-temporal flow prediction, encompassing traffic flows and crowd flows, is crucial for optimizing city infrastructure and managing traffic and emergency responses. Traditional approaches have relied on separate models tailored to either grid-based data, representing cities as uniform cells, or graph-based data, modeling cities as networks of nodes and edges. In this paper, we build UniFlow, a foundational model for general urban flow prediction that unifies both grid-based and graphbased data. We first design a multi-view spatio-temporal patching mechanism to standardize different data into a consistent sequential format and then introduce a spatio-temporal transformer architecture to capture complex correlations and dynamics. To leverage shared spatio-temporal patterns across different data types and facilitate effective cross-learning, we propose SpatioTemporal Memory Retrieval Augmentation (ST-MRA). By creating structured memory modules to store shared spatio-temporal patterns, ST-MRA enhances predictions through adaptive memory retrieval. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniFlow outperforms existing models in both grid-based and graph-based flow prediction, excelling particularly in scenarios with limited data availability, showcasing its superior performance and broad applicability. The datasets and code implementation have been released on https://github.com/YuanYuan98/UniFlow.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hierarchical Spatio-Temporal Uncertainty Quantification for Distributed Energy Adoption](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12193v1)** | 2024-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid deployment of distributed energy resources (DER) has introduced significant spatio-temporal uncertainties in power grid management, necessitating accurate multilevel forecasting methods. However, existing approaches often produce overly conservative uncertainty intervals at individual spatial units and fail to properly capture uncertainties when aggregating predictions across different spatial scales. This paper presents a novel hierarchical spatio-temporal model based on the conformal prediction framework to address these challenges. Our approach generates circuit-level DER growth predictions and efficiently aggregates them to the substation level while maintaining statistical validity through a tailored non-conformity score. Applied to a decade of DER installation data from a local utility network, our method demonstrates superior performance over existing approaches, particularly in reducing prediction interval widths while maintaining coverage.</p></details> |  |

Effectively modeling these dynamics is essential for understanding and optimizing urban systems In this work, we introduce UrbanDiT, a foundation model for open-world urban spatio-temporal learning that successfully scale up diffusion transformers in this field. UrbanDiT pioneers a unified model that integrates diverse spatio-temporal data sources and types while learning universal spatio-temporal patterns across different cities and scenarios. This allows the model to unify both multi-data and multi-task learning, and effectively support a wide range of spatio-temporal applications. Its key innovation lies in the elaborated prompt learning framework, which adaptively generates both data-driven and task-specific prompts, guiding the model to deliver superior performance across various urban applications. UrbanDiT offers three primary advantages: 1) It unifies diverse data types, such as grid-based and graph-based data, into a sequential format, allowing to capture spatio-temporal dynamics across diverse scenarios of different cities; 2) With masking strategies and task-specific prompts, it supports a wide range of tasks, including bi-directional spatio-temporal prediction, temporal interpolation, spatial extrapolation, and spatio-temporal imputation; and 3) It generalizes effectively to open-world scenarios, with its powerful zero-shot capabilities outperforming nearly all baselines with training data. These features allow UrbanDiT to achieves state-of-the-art performance in different domains such as transportation traffic, crowd flows, taxi demand, bike usage, and cellular traffic, across multiple cities and tasks. UrbanDiT sets up a new benchmark for foundation models in the urban spatio-temporal domain.</p></details> |  |

This paper advances the analysis of such spatio-spherical data by developing convolutional network layers that are equivariant to the $\mathbf{E(3) \times SO(3)}$ group and account for the physical symmetries of dMRI including rotations, translations, and reflections of space alongside voxel-wise rotations. Further, neuronal fibers are typically antipodally symmetric, a fact we leverage to construct highly efficient spatio-hemispherical graph convolutions to accelerate the analysis of high-dimensional dMRI data. In the context of sparse spherical fiber deconvolution to recover white matter microstructure, our proposed equivariant network layers yield substantial performance and efficiency gains, leading to better and more practical resolution of crossing neuronal fibers and fiber tractography. These gains are experimentally consistent across both simulation and in vivo human datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2024. 24 pages with 13 figures.

Existing thermal comfort models usually overlook temporal dynamics alongside spatial dependencies. We address this problem by introducing a spatio-temporal jump model that clusters data with persistence across both spatial and temporal dimensions. This framework enhances interpretability, minimizes abrupt state changes, and easily handles missing data. We validate our approach through extensive simulations, demonstrating its accuracy in recovering the true underlying partition. When applied to hourly environmental data gathered from a set of weather stations located across the city of Singapore, our proposal identifies meaningful thermal comfort regimes, demonstrating its effectiveness in dynamic urban settings and suitability for real-world monitoring. The comparison of these regimes with feedback on thermal preference indicates the potential of an unsupervised approach to avoid extensive surveys.</p></details> |  |

These patterns vary in color, shape, and location across video frames, posing challenges in extracting information from adjacent frames and preserving temporal consistency throughout the restoration process. Existing deep learning methods often depend on well-designed alignment modules, such as optical flow estimation, deformable convolution, and cross-frame self-attention layers, incurring high computational costs. Recent studies indicate that utilizing raw data as input can significantly improve the effectiveness of video demoireing by providing the pristine degradation information and more detailed content. However, previous works fail to design both efficient and effective raw video demoireing methods that can maintain temporal consistency and prevent degradation of color and spatial details. This paper introduces a novel alignment-free raw video demoireing network with frequency-assisted spatio-temporal Mamba (DemMamba). It features sequentially arranged Spatial Mamba Blocks (SMB) and Temporal Mamba Blocks (TMB) to effectively model the inter- and intra-relationships in raw videos affected by moire patterns. An Adaptive Frequency Block (AFB) within the SMB facilitates demoireing in the frequency domain, while a Channel Attention Block (CAB) in the TMB enhances the temporal information interactions by leveraging inter-channel relationships among features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed DemMamba surpasses state-of-the-art methods by 1.3 dB in PSNR, and also provides a satisfactory visual experience.</p></details> |  |

| **[Trajectory Flow Matching with Applications to Clinical Time Series Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21154v2)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modeling stochastic and irregularly sampled time series is a challenging problem found in a wide range of applications, especially in medicine. Neural stochastic differential equations (Neural SDEs) are an attractive modeling technique for this problem, which parameterize the drift and diffusion terms of an SDE with neural networks. However, current algorithms for training Neural SDEs require backpropagation through the SDE dynamics, greatly limiting their scalability and stability. To address this, we propose Trajectory Flow Matching (TFM), which trains a Neural SDE in a simulation-free manner, bypassing backpropagation through the dynamics. TFM leverages the flow matching technique from generative modeling to model time series. In this work we first establish necessary conditions for TFM to learn time series data. Next, we present a reparameterization trick which improves training stability. Finally, we adapt TFM to the clinical time series setting, demonstrating improved performance on three clinical time series datasets both in terms of absolute performance and uncertainty prediction.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2024 Spotlight</p></details> |
| **[A Probabilistic Inference Approach to Inference-Time Scaling of LLMs using Particle-Based Monte Carlo Methods](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01618v2)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have achieved significant performance gains via scaling up model sizes and/or data. However, recent evidence suggests diminishing returns from such approaches, motivating scaling the computation spent at inference time. Existing inference-time scaling methods, usually with reward models, cast the task as a search problem, which tends to be vulnerable to reward hacking as a consequence of approximation errors in reward models. In this paper, we instead cast inference-time scaling as a probabilistic inference task and leverage sampling-based techniques to explore the typical set of the state distribution of a state-space model with an approximate likelihood, rather than optimize for its mode directly. We propose a novel inference-time scaling approach by adapting particle-based Monte Carlo methods to this task. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that our methods have a 4-16x better scaling rate over our deterministic search counterparts on various challenging mathematical reasoning tasks. Using our approach, we show that Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B-Instruct can surpass GPT-4o accuracy in only 4 rollouts, while Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Instruct scales to o1 level accuracy in only 32 rollouts. Our work not only presents an effective method to inference-time scaling, but also connects the rich literature in probabilistic inference with inference-time scaling of LLMs to develop more robust algorithms in future work.

While existing approaches such as ReAct maintain reasoning chains within the language model's context window, we observe that this often leads to plan fragmentation and execution failures. Our key insight is that by isolating the reasoning plan as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) outside the LM's working memory, we can enable (1) systematic exploration of reasoning paths, (2) atomic subqueries enabling precise retrievals and grounding, and (3) efficiency through parallel execution and bounded context window utilization. Moreover, Plan*RAG's modular design allows it to be integrated with existing RAG methods, thus providing a practical solution to improve current RAG systems. On standard multi-hop reasoning benchmarks, Plan*RAG consistently achieves improvements over recently proposed methods such as RQ-RAG and Self-RAG, while maintaining comparable computational costs.</p></details> | 19 pages, preprint |
| **[Privacy Amplification by Structured Subsampling for Deep Differentially Private Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02410v1)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many forms of sensitive data, such as web traffic, mobility data, or hospital occupancy, are inherently sequential. The standard method for training machine learning models while ensuring privacy for units of sensitive information, such as individual hospital visits, is differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD). However, we observe in this work that the formal guarantees of DP-SGD are incompatible with timeseries-specific tasks like forecasting, since they rely on the privacy amplification attained by training on small, unstructured batches sampled from an unstructured dataset. In contrast, batches for forecasting are generated by (1) sampling sequentially structured time series from a dataset, (2) sampling contiguous subsequences from these series, and (3) partitioning them into context and ground-truth forecast windows. We theoretically analyze the privacy amplification attained by this structured subsampling to enable the training of forecasting models with sound and tight event- and user-level privacy guarantees. Towards more private models, we additionally prove how data augmentation amplifies privacy in self-supervised training of sequence models. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that amplification by structured subsampling enables the training of forecasting models with strong formal privacy guarantees.</p></details> |  |

Typically, synthetic data are based on historical data obtained from the observed system. The data needs to represent a specific behavior of the system, yet be new and diverse enough so that the system is challenged with a broad range of inputs. This paper presents a method, based on discrete Fourier transform, for generating synthetic time series with similar statistical moments for any given signal. The suggested method makes it possible to control the level of similarity between the given signal and the generated synthetic signals. Proof shows analytically that this method preserves the first two statistical moments of the input signal, and its autocorrelation function. The method is compared to known methods, ARMA, GAN, and CoSMoS. A large variety of environmental datasets with different temporal resolutions, and from different domains are used, testing the generality and flexibility of the method. A Python library implementing this method is made available as open-source software.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication 27 November 2024.

| **[Test Time Training for 4D Medical Image Interpolation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02341v1)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>4D medical image interpolation is essential for improving temporal resolution and diagnostic precision in clinical applications. Previous works ignore the problem of distribution shifts, resulting in poor generalization under different distribution. A natural solution would be to adapt the model to a new test distribution, but this cannot be done if the test input comes without a ground truth label. In this paper, we propose a novel test time training framework which uses self-supervision to adapt the model to a new distribution without requiring any labels. Indeed, before performing frame interpolation on each test video, the model is trained on the same instance using a self-supervised task, such as rotation prediction or image reconstruction. We conduct experiments on two publicly available 4D medical image interpolation datasets, Cardiac and 4D-Lung. The experimental results show that the proposed method achieves significant performance across various evaluation metrics on both datasets. It achieves higher peak signal-to-noise ratio values, 33.73dB on Cardiac and 34.02dB on 4D-Lung. Our method not only advances 4D medical image interpolation but also provides a template for domain adaptation in other fields such as image segmentation and image registration.</p></details> |  |
| **[Event-Triggered Time-Varying Bayesian Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.10790v6)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the problem of sequentially optimizing a time-varying objective function using time-varying Bayesian optimization (TVBO). Current approaches to TVBO require prior knowledge of a constant rate of change to cope with stale data arising from time variations. However, in practice, the rate of change is usually unknown. We propose an event-triggered algorithm, ET-GP-UCB, that treats the optimization problem as static until it detects changes in the objective function and then resets the dataset. This allows the algorithm to adapt online to realized temporal changes without the need for exact prior knowledge. The event trigger is based on probabilistic uniform error bounds used in Gaussian process regression. We derive regret bounds for adaptive resets without exact prior knowledge of the temporal changes and show in numerical experiments that ET-GP-UCB outperforms competing GP-UCB algorithms on both synthetic and real-world data. The results demonstrate that ET-GP-UCB is readily applicable without extensive hyperparameter tuning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in Transactions on Machine Learning Research (TMLR)</p></details> |

We presents new insights in using the Mahalonobis distance to automaicaly identify undesirable states. Once the operator has intervened and redirected the system, the control is seamlessly returned to the policy, which resumes generating actions until further intervention is required. We demonstrate that incorporating the targeted takeover demonstrations significantly improves policy performance compared to training solely with an equivalent number of, but longer, initial demonstrations. We provide an in-depth analysis of using the Mahalanobis distance to detect out-of-distribution states, illustrating its utility for identifying critical failure points during execution. Supporting materials, including videos of initial and takeover demonstrations and all rice-scooping experiments, are available on the project website: https://operator-takeover.github.io/</p></details> |  |

| **[LoRA-TTT: Low-Rank Test-Time Training for Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02069v1)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancements in vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have intensified the need to address distribution shifts between training and testing datasets. Although prior Test-Time Training (TTT) techniques for VLMs have demonstrated robust performance, they predominantly rely on tuning text prompts, a process that demands substantial computational resources and is heavily dependent on entropy-based loss. In this paper, we propose LoRA-TTT, a novel TTT method that leverages Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), applied exclusively to the image encoder of VLMs. By introducing LoRA and updating only its parameters during test time, our method offers a simple yet effective TTT approach, retaining the model's initial generalization capability while achieving substantial performance gains with minimal memory and runtime overhead. Additionally, we introduce a highly efficient reconstruction loss tailored for TTT. Our method can adapt to diverse domains by combining these two losses, without increasing memory consumption or runtime. Extensive experiments on two benchmarks, covering 15 datasets, demonstrate that our method improves the zero-shot top-1 accuracy of CLIP-ViT-B/16 by an average of 5.79% on the OOD benchmark and 1.36% on the fine-grained benchmark, efficiently surpassing test-time prompt tuning, without relying on any external models or cache.</p></details> |  |

Traditional machine learning algorithms rely on well-defined input and output variables; however, there are scenarios where the separation between the input and output variables and the underlying, associated input and output layers of the model are unknown. Feature Selection (FS) and Neural Architecture Search (NAS) have emerged as promising solutions in such scenarios. This paper proposes MICS-EFS, a Model Input-Output Configuration Search with Embedded Feature Selection. The methodology explores internal dependencies in the complete input parameter space for classification tasks involving both 1D sensor time-series and 2D image data. MICS-EFS employs a modified encoder-decoder model and the Sequential Forward Search (SFS) algorithm, combining input-output configuration search with embedded feature selection. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of MICS-EFS compared to other FS algorithms. Across all tested datasets, MICS-EFS delivered an average accuracy improvement of 1.5% over baseline models, with the accuracy gains ranging from 0.5% to 5.9%. Moreover, the algorithm reduced feature dimensionality to just 2-5% of the original data, significantly enhancing computational efficiency. These results highlight the potential of MICS-EFS to improve model accuracy and efficiency in various machine learning tasks. Furthermore, the proposed method has been validated in a real-world industrial application focused on machining processes, underscoring its effectiveness and practicality in addressing complex input-output challenges.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 19 figures + appendix, the related software code can be found under the link: https://github.com/viharoszsolt/IDENAS</p></details> |

While existing methods, such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Tree-of-Thought (ToT), enhance reasoning by decomposing problems or structuring prompts, they typically perform a single pass of reasoning and may fail to revisit flawed paths, compromising accuracy. To address this limitation, we propose a novel reasoning framework called Forest-of-Thought (FoT), which integrates multiple reasoning trees to leverage collective decision-making for solving complex logical problems. FoT employs sparse activation strategies to select the most relevant reasoning paths, improving both efficiency and accuracy. Additionally, we introduce a dynamic self-correction strategy that enables real-time error correction, along with consensus-guided decision-making strategies to optimize both correctness and computational resources. Experimental results demonstrate that the FoT framework, combined with these strategies, significantly enhances the reasoning capabilities of LLMs, enabling them to solve complex tasks with greater precision and efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[VisionTS: Visual Masked Autoencoders Are Free-Lunch Zero-Shot Time Series Forecasters](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17253v3)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models have emerged as a promising approach in time series forecasting (TSF). Existing approaches either repurpose large language models (LLMs) or build large-scale time series datasets to develop TSF foundation models for universal forecasting. However, these methods face challenges due to the severe cross-domain gap or in-domain heterogeneity. This paper explores a new road to building a TSF foundation model from rich, high-quality natural images. Our key insight is that a visual masked autoencoder, pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset, can naturally be a numeric series forecaster. By reformulating TSF as an image reconstruction task, we bridge the gap between image pre-training and TSF downstream tasks. Surprisingly, without further adaptation in the time series domain, the proposed VisionTS could achieve better zero-shot forecast performance than existing TSF foundation models. With fine-tuning for one epoch, VisionTS could further improve the forecasting and achieve state-of-the-art performance in most cases. Extensive experiments reveal intrinsic similarities between images and real-world time series, suggesting that visual models may offer a "free lunch" for TSF and highlight the potential for future cross-modality research.

The optimization problem is defined over a network that collectively minimizes a separable cost function with coupled linear constraints. An equivalent optimization problem with auxiliary decision variables and a decoupling structure is proposed. A sensitivity analysis demonstrates that the subgradient information can be computed using local information. This then leads to a subgradient algorithm for updating the auxiliary variables. A case with sparse coupling constraints is further considered, and it is shown to have better memory and communication efficiency. For the specific case of a CBF-induced time-varying quadratic program (QP), an update law is proposed that achieves finite-time convergence. Numerical results involving a static resource allocation problem and a safe coordination problem for a multi-agent system demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed algorithms.</p></details> | Accepted by IEEE TAC |

We first show that na\"ively scaling up inference budget for diffusion models yields marginal gain. To address this, the training of T-SCEND consists of a novel linear-regression negative contrastive learning objective to improve the performance-energy consistency of the energy landscape, and a KL regularization to reduce adversarial sampling. During inference, T-SCEND integrates the denoising process with a novel hybrid Monte Carlo Tree Search (hMCTS), which sequentially performs best-of-N random search and MCTS as denoising proceeds. On challenging reasoning tasks of Maze and Sudoku, we demonstrate the effectiveness of T-SCEND's training objective and scalable inference method. In particular, trained with Maze sizes of up to $6\times6$, our T-SCEND solves $88\%$ of Maze problems with much larger sizes of $15\times15$, while standard diffusion completely fails.Code to reproduce the experiments can be found at https://github.com/AI4Science-WestlakeU/t_scend.</p></details> | 20 pages, 12 figures |
| **[The Price of Linear Time: Error Analysis of Structured Kernel Interpolation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00298v2)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Structured Kernel Interpolation (SKI) (Wilson et al. 2015) helps scale Gaussian Processes (GPs) by approximating the kernel matrix via interpolation at inducing points, achieving linear computational complexity. However, it lacks rigorous theoretical error analysis. This paper bridges the gap: we prove error bounds for the SKI Gram matrix and examine the error's effect on hyperparameter estimation and posterior inference. We further provide a practical guide to selecting the number of inducing points under convolutional cubic interpolation: they should grow as $n^{d/3}$ for error control. Crucially, we identify two dimensionality regimes governing the trade-off between SKI Gram matrix spectral norm error and computational complexity. For $d \leq 3$, any error tolerance can achieve linear time for sufficiently large sample size. For $d > 3$, the error must increase with sample size to maintain linear time. Our analysis provides key insights into SKI's scalability-accuracy trade-offs, establishing precise conditions for achieving linear-time GP inference with controlled approximation error.</p></details> |  |
| **[FLOWTS: Time Series Generation via Rectified Flow](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07506v2)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion-based models have significant achievements in time series generation but suffer from inefficient computation: solving high-dimensional ODEs/SDEs via iterative numerical solvers demands hundreds to thousands of drift function evaluations per sample, incurring prohibitive costs. To resolve this, we propose FlowTS, an ODE-based model that leverages rectified flow with straight-line transport in probability space. By learning geodesic paths between distributions, FlowTS achieves computational efficiency through exact linear trajectory simulation, accelerating training and generation while improving performances. We further introduce an adaptive sampling strategy inspired by the exploration-exploitation trade-off, balancing noise adaptation and precision. Notably, FlowTS enables seamless adaptation from unconditional to conditional generation without retraining, ensuring efficient real-world deployment. Also, to enhance generation authenticity, FlowTS integrates trend and seasonality decomposition, attention registers (for global context aggregation), and Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) (for position information). For unconditional setting, extensive experiments demonstrate that FlowTS achieves state-of-the-art performance, with context FID scores of 0.019 and 0.011 on Stock and ETTh datasets (prev. best: 0.067, 0.061). For conditional setting, we have achieved superior performance in solar forecasting (MSE 213, prev. best: 375) and MuJoCo imputation tasks (MSE 7e-5, prev. best 2.7e-4).

Unlike regular time series, which assume values at evenly spaced time points, asynchronous time series consist of timestamped events occurring at irregular intervals, each described in natural language. Our approach effectively utilizes the rich natural language of event descriptions, allowing LLMs to benefit from their broad world knowledge for reasoning across different domains and tasks. This allows us to extend the scope of asynchronous time series analysis beyond forecasting to include tasks like anomaly detection and data imputation. We further introduce Stochastic Soft Prompting, a novel prompt-tuning mechanism that significantly improves model performance, outperforming existing fine-tuning methods such as QLoRA. Through extensive experiments on real world datasets, we demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance across different tasks and datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Applying non-negative matrix factorization with covariates to multivariate time series data as a vector autoregression model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17446v2)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) is a powerful technique for dimensionality reduction, but its application to time series data remains limited. This paper proposes a novel framework that integrates NMF with a vector autoregression (VAR) model to capture both latent structure and temporal dependencies in multivariate time series data. By representing the NMF coefficient matrix as a VAR model, the framework leverages the interpretability of NMF while incorporating the dynamic characteristics of time series data. This approach allows for the extraction of meaningful features and accurate predictions in time series data.</p></details> | 8 figures |

A Fresh Perspective on Deep Learning for Medical Time-Series Imputation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08442v2)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a comprehensive analysis of deep learning approaches for Electronic Health Record (EHR) time-series imputation, examining how architectural and framework biases combine to influence model performance. Our investigation reveals varying capabilities of deep imputers in capturing complex spatiotemporal dependencies within EHRs, and that model effectiveness depends on how its combined biases align with medical time-series characteristics. Our experimental evaluation challenges common assumptions about model complexity, demonstrating that larger models do not necessarily improve performance. Rather, carefully designed architectures can better capture the complex patterns inherent in clinical data. The study highlights the need for imputation approaches that prioritise clinically meaningful data reconstruction over statistical accuracy. Our experiments show imputation performance variations of up to 20\% based on preprocessing and implementation choices, emphasising the need for standardised benchmarking methodologies. Finally, we identify critical gaps between current deep imputation methods and medical requirements, highlighting the importance of integrating clinical insights to achieve more reliable imputation approaches for healthcare applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Random Missingness: Clinically Rethinking for Healthcare Time Series Imputation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17508v3)** | 2025-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study investigates the impact of masking strategies on time series imputation models in healthcare settings. While current approaches predominantly rely on random masking for model evaluation, this practice fails to capture the structured nature of missing patterns in clinical data. Using the PhysioNet Challenge 2012 dataset, we analyse how different masking implementations affect both imputation accuracy and downstream clinical predictions across eleven imputation methods. Our results demonstrate that masking choices significantly influence model performance, while recurrent architectures show more consistent performance across strategies. Analysis of downstream mortality prediction reveals that imputation accuracy doesn't necessarily translate to optimal clinical prediction capabilities. Our findings emphasise the need for clinically-informed masking strategies that better reflect real-world missing patterns in healthcare data, suggesting current evaluation frameworks may need reconsideration for reliable clinical deployment.</p></details> |  |

Whereas traditional Markowitz-based mean-variance portfolios are widespread, network-based optimisation techniques offer a more flexible tool to capture complex interdependencies between asset values. However, most of the existing studies do not contain firms at risk of default and remove any firms that drop off indices over a certain time. This is the first study to also incorporate such firms in portfolio optimisation on a large scale. We propose and empirically test a novel method that leverages Graph Attention networks (GATs), a subclass of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). GNNs, as deep learning-based models, can exploit network data to uncover nonlinear relationships. Their ability to handle high-dimensional data and accommodate customised layers for specific purposes makes them appealing for large-scale problems such as mid- and small-cap portfolio optimisation. This study utilises 30 years of data on mid-cap firms, creating graphs of firms using distance correlation and the Triangulated Maximally Filtered Graph approach. These graphs are the inputs to a GAT model incorporating weight and allocation constraints and a loss function derived from the Sharpe ratio, thus focusing on maximising portfolio risk-adjusted returns. This new model is benchmarked against a network characteristic-based portfolio, a mean variance-based portfolio, and an equal-weighted portfolio. The results show that the portfolio produced by the GAT-based model outperforms all benchmarks and is consistently superior to other strategies over a long period, while also being informative of market dynamics.</p></details> | <details><summary>39 pa...</summary><p>39 pages, 10 figures, v2</p></details> |

In this paper, we study the scaling trends governing sampling-based search. Among our findings is that simply scaling up a minimalist implementation that uses only random sampling and direct self-verification results in sustained performance improvements that, for example, elevate the Gemini v1.5 Pro model's reasoning capabilities past that of o1-Preview on popular benchmarks. We partially attribute the scalability of sampling-based search to a phenomenon of implicit scaling, where sampling a larger pool of responses in turn improves verification accuracy. We further identify two useful principles for improving self-verification capabilities with test-time compute: (1) comparing across responses provides helpful signals about the locations of errors and hallucinations, and (2) different model output styles are useful for different contexts -- chains of thought are useful for reasoning but harder to verify. We also find that, though accurate verification can be elicited, frontier models demonstrate remarkably weak out-of-box verification capabilities and introduce a benchmark to measure progress on these deficiencies.</p></details> |  |

Most works in this area use a discrete-time formulation, which is prone to induced errors, and often not applicable to models with higher-order/black-box solvers. The objective of this study is to develop a disciplined approach to fine-tune diffusion models using continuous-time RL, formulated as a stochastic control problem with a reward function that aligns the end result (terminal state) with input prompt. The key idea is to treat score matching as controls or actions, and thereby making connections to policy optimization and regularization in continuous-time RL. To carry out this idea, we lay out a new policy optimization framework for continuous-time RL, and illustrate its potential in enhancing the value networks design space via leveraging the structural property of diffusion models. We validate the advantages of our method by experiments in downstream tasks of fine-tuning large-scale Text2Image models of Stable Diffusion v1.5.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2409.08400</p></details> |
| **[Implicit Time-Marching for Lagrange Multiplier Formulation for Couple Stress Elastodynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08954v2)** | 2025-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The study of metamaterials and architected materials has intensified interest in continuum mechanics models that capture size-dependent microstructure interactions. Among these, Consistent Couple-Stress Theory (C-CST) incorporates microscale mechanical interactions by introducing higher-order derivatives in the strain energy. While previous studies have relied on convolutional principles or inverse Laplace transforms to obtain time-dependent solutions, this work demonstrates that implicit time integration applied to a mixed finite element method with a Lagrange multiplier provides stable, direct time-domain solutions for dynamic C-CST modeling. The proposed finite element scheme is tested through the Method of Manufactured Solutions (MMS) for static cases and dynamic simulations of simple mechanical scenarios. Our computational experiments revealed energy dissipation, emphasizing the importance of exploring symplectic integrators in future work to impose energy conservation. Additionally, further research is required to verify temporal stability through time-domain MMS and to investigate complex mechanical scenarios, including those previously restrictive, challenging to simulate, or unfeasible with existing dynamic methods. This work lays the groundwork for studying size-dependent material behavior and provides the foundation for advanced applications in material design and wave propagation.</p></details> | 28 pages, 13 figures |

The objective is to estimate the on- and off-time distributions while only observing the aggregate number of edges. This inverse problem is dealt with, in a parametric context, by setting up an estimator based on the method of moments. We provide conditions under which the estimator is asymptotically normal, and we point out how the corresponding covariance matrix can be identified. It is also demonstrated how to adapt the estimation procedure if alternative subgraph counts are observed, such as the number of wedges or triangles.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adversarial Reasoning at Jailbreaking Time](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01633v1)** | 2025-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As large language models (LLMs) are becoming more capable and widespread, the study of their failure cases is becoming increasingly important. Recent advances in standardizing, measuring, and scaling test-time compute suggest new methodologies for optimizing models to achieve high performance on hard tasks. In this paper, we apply these advances to the task of model jailbreaking: eliciting harmful responses from aligned LLMs. We develop an adversarial reasoning approach to automatic jailbreaking via test-time computation that achieves SOTA attack success rates (ASR) against many aligned LLMs, even the ones that aim to trade inference-time compute for adversarial robustness. Our approach introduces a new paradigm in understanding LLM vulnerabilities, laying the foundation for the development of more robust and trustworthy AI systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[CodeMonkeys: Scaling Test-Time Compute for Software Engineering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14723v2)** | 2025-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scaling test-time compute is a promising axis for improving LLM capabilities. However, test-time compute can be scaled in a variety of ways, and effectively combining different approaches remains an active area of research. Here, we explore this problem in the context of solving real-world GitHub issues from the SWE-bench dataset. Our system, named CodeMonkeys, allows models to iteratively edit a codebase by jointly generating and running a testing script alongside their draft edit. We sample many of these multi-turn trajectories for every issue to generate a collection of candidate edits. This approach lets us scale "serial" test-time compute by increasing the number of iterations per trajectory and "parallel" test-time compute by increasing the number of trajectories per problem. With parallel scaling, we can amortize up-front costs across multiple downstream samples, allowing us to identify relevant codebase context using the simple method of letting an LLM read every file. In order to select between candidate edits, we combine voting using model-generated tests with a final multi-turn trajectory dedicated to selection. Overall, CodeMonkeys resolves 57.4% of issues from SWE-bench Verified using a budget of approximately 2300 USD. Our selection method can also be used to combine candidates from different sources. Selecting over an ensemble of edits from existing top SWE-bench Verified submissions obtains a score of 66.2% and outperforms the best member of the ensemble on its own. We fully release our code and data at https://scalingintelligence.stanford.edu/pubs/codemonkeys.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the stability of gradient descent with second order dynamics for time-varying cost functions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13765v3)** | 2025-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Gradient based optimization algorithms deployed in Machine Learning (ML) applications are often analyzed and compared by their convergence rates or regret bounds. While these rates and bounds convey valuable information they don't always directly translate to stability guarantees. Stability and similar concepts, like robustness, will become ever more important as we move towards deploying models in real-time and safety critical systems. In this work we build upon the results in Gaudio et al. 2021 and Moreu & Annaswamy 2022 for gradient descent with second order dynamics when applied to explicitly time varying cost functions and provide more general stability guarantees. These more general results can aid in the design and certification of these optimization schemes so as to help ensure safe and reliable deployment for real-time learning applications. We also hope that the techniques provided here will stimulate and cross-fertilize the analysis that occurs on the same algorithms from the online learning and stochastic optimization communities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Final...</summary><p>Final accepted version of TMLR paper. https://openreview.net/forum?id=HlzjI2fn2T</p></details> |

To overcome these challenges, recent methods, such as BAdam, employ partial weight updates to enhance time and memory efficiency, though sometimes at the cost of performance. Others, like GaLore, focus on maintaining performance while optimizing memory usage through full parameter training, but may incur higher time complexity. By leveraging the low-rank structure of the gradient and the Grassmannian geometry, we propose SubTrack-Grad, a subspace tracking-based optimization method that efficiently tracks the evolving gradient subspace by incorporating estimation errors and previously identified subspaces. SubTrack-Grad delivers better or on-par results compared to GaLore, while significantly outperforming BAdam, which, despite being time-efficient, compromises performance. SubTrack-Grad reduces wall-time by up to 20.57% on GLUE tasks (15% average reduction) and up to 65% on SuperGLUE tasks (22% average reduction) compared to GaLore. Notably, for a 3B parameter model, GaLore incurred a substantial 157% increase in wall-time compared to full-rank training, whereas SubTrack-Grad exhibited a 31% increase, representing a 49% reduction in wall-time, while enjoying the same memory reductions as GaLore.</p></details> |  |
| **[Heterogeneous Treatment Effect in Time-to-Event Outcomes: Harnessing Censored Data with Recursively Imputed Trees](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01575v1)** | 2025-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tailoring treatments to individual needs is a central goal in fields such as medicine. A key step toward this goal is estimating Heterogeneous Treatment Effects (HTE) - the way treatments impact different subgroups. While crucial, HTE estimation is challenging with survival data, where time until an event (e.g., death) is key. Existing methods often assume complete observation, an assumption violated in survival data due to right-censoring, leading to bias and inefficiency. Cui et al. (2023) proposed a doubly-robust method for HTE estimation in survival data under no hidden confounders, combining a causal survival forest with an augmented inverse-censoring weighting estimator. However, we find it struggles under heavy censoring, which is common in rare-outcome problems such as Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Moreover, most current methods cannot handle instrumental variables, which are a crucial tool in the causal inference arsenal. We introduce Multiple Imputation for Survival Treatment Response (MISTR), a novel, general, and non-parametric method for estimating HTE in survival data. MISTR uses recursively imputed survival trees to handle censoring without directly modeling the censoring mechanism. Through extensive simulations and analysis of two real-world datasets-the AIDS Clinical Trials Group Protocol 175 and the Illinois unemployment dataset we show that MISTR outperforms prior methods under heavy censoring in the no-hidden-confounders setting, and extends to the instrumental variable setting. To our knowledge, MISTR is the first non-parametric approach for HTE estimation with unobserved confounders via instrumental variables.</p></details> |  |

However, ideas during a meeting do not emerge linearly. We leverage LLMs to create dialogue maps in real time to help people visually structure and connect ideas. Balancing the need to reduce the cognitive load on users during the conversation while giving them sufficient control when using AI, we explore two system variants that encompass different levels of AI assistance. In Human-Map, AI generates summaries of conversations as nodes, and users create dialogue maps with the nodes. In AI-Map, AI produces dialogue maps where users can make edits. We ran a within-subject experiment with ten pairs of users, comparing the two MeetMap variants and a baseline. Users preferred MeetMap over traditional methods for taking notes, which aligned better with their mental models of conversations. Users liked the ease of use for AI-Map due to the low effort demands and appreciated the hands-on opportunity in Human-Map for sense-making.</p></details> | CSCW2025 Accepted |

We present a novel framework using Markovian Gaussian Processes to learn brain communications with time-varying temporal delays from multi-region neural recordings, named Adaptive Delay Model (ADM). Our method combines Gaussian Processes with State Space Models and employs parallel scan inference algorithms, enabling efficient scaling to large datasets while identifying concurrent communication patterns that evolve over time. This time-varying approach captures how brain region interactions shift dynamically during cognitive processes. Validated on synthetic and multi-region neural recordings datasets, our approach discovers both the directionality and temporal dynamics of neural communication. This work advances our understanding of distributed neural computation and provides a scalable tool for analyzing dynamic brain networks.</p></details> |  |

Recently, OpenAI's o1 model showed this capability but did not publicly share its methodology, leading to many replication efforts. We seek the simplest approach to achieve test-time scaling and strong reasoning performance. First, we curate a small dataset s1K of 1,000 questions paired with reasoning traces relying on three criteria we validate through ablations: difficulty, diversity, and quality. Second, we develop budget forcing to control test-time compute by forcefully terminating the model's thinking process or lengthening it by appending "Wait" multiple times to the model's generation when it tries to end. This can lead the model to double-check its answer, often fixing incorrect reasoning steps. After supervised finetuning the Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct language model on s1K and equipping it with budget forcing, our model s1-32B exceeds o1-preview on competition math questions by up to 27% (MATH and AIME24). Further, scaling s1-32B with budget forcing allows extrapolating beyond its performance without test-time intervention: from 50% to 57% on AIME24.

While large language models (LLMs) show promise in time series tasks, current approaches often rely on numerical data alone, overlooking the multimodal nature of time-dependent information, such as textual descriptions, visual data, and audio signals. Moreover, these methods underutilize LLMs' reasoning capabilities, limiting the analysis to surface-level interpretations instead of deeper temporal and multimodal reasoning. In this position paper, we argue that multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) can enable more powerful and flexible reasoning for time series analysis, enhancing decision-making and real-world applications. We call on researchers and practitioners to leverage this potential by developing strategies that prioritize trust, interpretability, and robust reasoning in MLLMs. Lastly, we highlight key research directions, including novel reasoning paradigms, architectural innovations, and domain-specific applications, to advance time series reasoning with MLLMs.</p></details> |  |

We use the Spatiotemporal Generative Adversarial Network (STGAN) framework combining Graph Neural Networks and Long Short-Term Memory networks to capture complex spatial and temporal dependencies in traffic data. We apply STGAN to real-time, minute-by-minute observations from 42 traffic cameras across Gothenburg, Sweden, collected over several months in 2020. The images are processed to compute a flow metric representing vehicle density, which serves as input for the model. Training is conducted on data from April to November 2020, and validation is performed on a separate dataset from November 14 to 23, 2020. Our results demonstrate that the model effectively detects traffic anomalies with high precision and low false positive rates. The detected anomalies include camera signal interruptions, visual artifacts, and extreme weather conditions affecting traffic flow.</p></details> |  |
| **[Model-Based Perfusion Reconstruction with Time Separation Technique in Cone-Beam CT Dynamic Liver Perfusion Imaging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16450v2)** | 2025-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The success of embolisation, a minimally invasive treatment of liver cancer, could be evaluated in the operational room with cone-beam CT by acquiring a dynamic perfusion scan. The reconstruction algorithm must address the issues of low temporal sampling and higher noise levels inherent in cone-beam CT systems, compared to conventional CT. Therefore, a model-based perfusion reconstruction based on the time separation technique (TST) was applied. TST uses basis functions to model time attenuation curves. These functions are either analytical or based on prior knowledge, extracted using singular value decomposition from CT perfusion data. To explore how well the prior knowledge can model perfusion dynamics and what the potential limitations are, the dynamic CBCT perfusion scan was simulated under different noise levels. The TST method was compared to static reconstruction. It was demonstrated that a set consisting of only four basis functions results in perfusion maps that preserve relevant information, denoises the data, and outperforms static reconstruction under higher noise levels. TST with prior knowledge would not only outperform static reconstruction, but also the TST with analytical basis functions. Furthermore, it has been shown that only eight CBCT rotations, unlike previously assumed ten, are sufficient to obtain the perfusion maps comparable to the reference CT perfusion maps. This contributes to saving dose and reconstruction time. The real dynamic CBCT perfusion scan, reconstructed under the same conditions as the simulated scan, shows potential for maintaining the accuracy of the perfusion maps. By visual inspection, the embolised region was matching to that in corresponding CT perfusion maps. Further analysis of a larger cohort of patient data is needed to draw final conclusions regarding the expected advantages of the time separation technique.</p></details> | <details><summary>Medic...</summary><p>Medical Physics Received: 2 August 2024 Revised: 20 November 2024 Accepted: 27 December 2024</p></details> |

In particular, two problems emerge: (1) Encoding longer histories requires more computational resources, making it crucial for CTDG models to maintain low computational complexity to ensure efficiency; (2) Meanwhile, more powerful models are needed to identify and select the most critical temporal information within the extended context provided by longer histories. To address these problems, we propose a CTDG representation learning model named DyGMamba, originating from the popular Mamba state space model (SSM). DyGMamba first leverages a node-level SSM to encode the sequence of historical node interactions. Another time-level SSM is then employed to exploit the temporal patterns hidden in the historical graph, where its output is used to dynamically select the critical information from the interaction history. We validate DyGMamba experimentally on the dynamic link prediction task. The results show that our model achieves state-of-the-art in most cases. DyGMamba also maintains high efficiency in terms of computational resources, making it possible to capture long temporal dependencies with a limited computation budget.</p></details> | Preprint |

In these scenarios, spatial awareness of the surroundings and the ability to localize the robot within the environment represent key aspects. While state-of-the-art localization techniques are well-explored in autonomous vehicles and walking robots, they rely on data retrieved with lidar or depth sensors which are bulky and thus difficult to integrate into small soft robots. Recent developments in miniaturized Time of Flight (ToF) sensors show promise as a small and lightweight alternative to bulky sensors. These sensors can be potentially distributed on the soft robot body, providing multi-point depth data of the surroundings. However, the small spatial resolution and the noisy measurements pose a challenge to the success of state-of-the-art localization algorithms, which are generally applied to much denser and more reliable measurements. In this paper, we enforce distributed VL53L5CX ToF sensors, mount them on the tip of a soft robot, and investigate their usage for self-localization tasks. Experimental results show that the soft robot can effectively be localized with respect to a known map, with an error comparable to the uncertainty on the measures provided by the miniaturized ToF sensors.</p></details> | <details><summary>The m...</summary><p>The manuscript has been accepted as a contributed paper for the 8th IEEE-RAS International Conference on Soft Robotics (RoboSoft 2025)</p></details> |

By modeling these time-dependent probability measures as random objects in the Wasserstein space, we propose a new auto-regressive model for the statistical analysis of multivariate distributional time series. Using the theory of iterated random function systems, results on the existence, uniqueness and stationarity of the solution of such a model are provided. We also propose a consistent estimator for the auto-regressive coefficients of this model. Due to the simplex constraints that we impose on the model coefficients, the proposed estimator that is learned under these constraints, naturally has a sparse structure. The sparsity allows the application of the proposed model in learning a graph of temporal dependency from multivariate distributional time series. We explore the numerical performances of our estimation procedure using simulated data. To shed some light on the benefits of our approach for real data analysis, we also apply this methodology to two data sets, respectively made of observations from age distribution in different countries and those from the bike sharing network in Paris.</p></details> |  |
| **[Almost Surely Safe Alignment of Large Language Models at Inference-Time](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01208v1)** | 2025-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Even highly capable large language models (LLMs) can produce biased or unsafe responses, and alignment techniques, such as RLHF, aimed at mitigating this issue, are expensive and prone to overfitting as they retrain the LLM. This paper introduces a novel inference-time alignment approach that ensures LLMs generate safe responses almost surely, i.e., with a probability approaching one. We achieve this by framing the safe generation of inference-time responses as a constrained Markov decision process within the LLM's latent space. Crucially, we augment a safety state that tracks the evolution of safety constraints and enables us to demonstrate formal safety guarantees upon solving the MDP in the latent space. Building on this foundation, we propose InferenceGuard, a practical implementation that safely aligns LLMs without modifying the model weights.

| **[Radiant Foam: Real-Time Differentiable Ray Tracing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01157v1)** | 2025-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Research on differentiable scene representations is consistently moving towards more efficient, real-time models. Recently, this has led to the popularization of splatting methods, which eschew the traditional ray-based rendering of radiance fields in favor of rasterization. This has yielded a significant improvement in rendering speeds due to the efficiency of rasterization algorithms and hardware, but has come at a cost: the approximations that make rasterization efficient also make implementation of light transport phenomena like reflection and refraction much more difficult. We propose a novel scene representation which avoids these approximations, but keeps the efficiency and reconstruction quality of splatting by leveraging a decades-old efficient volumetric mesh ray tracing algorithm which has been largely overlooked in recent computer vision research. The resulting model, which we name Radiant Foam, achieves rendering speed and quality comparable to Gaussian Splatting, without the constraints of rasterization. Unlike ray traced Gaussian models that use hardware ray tracing acceleration, our method requires no special hardware or APIs beyond the standard features of a programmable GPU.</p></details> |  |

In many visual navigation systems, localization is achieved by detecting and tracking visual features or landmarks, which provide information about the sensor's relative pose. For reliable feature tracking and accurate pose estimation, it is crucial to maintain visibility of a sufficient number of features. This requirement can sometimes conflict with the robot's overall task objective. In this paper, we approach it as a constrained control problem. By leveraging the invariance properties of visibility constraints within the robot's kinematic model, we propose a real-time safety filter based on quadratic programming. This filter takes a reference velocity command as input and produces a modified velocity that minimally deviates from the reference while ensuring the information score from the currently visible features remains above a user-specified threshold. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed safety filter preserves the invariance condition and ensures the visibility of more features than the required minimum. We also validated its real-world performance by integrating it into a visual simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithm, where it maintained high estimation quality in challenging environments, outperforming a simple tracking controller.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 6 figures, Accepted to 2025 IEEE International Conference on Robotics & Automation (ICRA 2025)</p></details> |

However, conventional approaches such as repeated sampling with majority voting or reward model scoring, often face diminishing returns as test-time compute scales, in addition to requiring costly task-specific reward model training. In this paper, we present Self-Enhanced Test-Time Scaling (SETS), a novel method that leverages the self-verification and self-correction capabilities of recent advanced LLMs to overcome these limitations. SETS integrates sampling, self-verification, and self-correction into a unified framework, enabling efficient and scalable test-time computation for improved capabilities at complex tasks. Through extensive experiments on challenging planning and reasoning benchmarks, compared to the alternatives, we demonstrate that SETS achieves significant performance improvements and more favorable test-time scaling laws.</p></details> |  |
| **[VarDrop: Enhancing Training Efficiency by Reducing Variate Redundancy in Periodic Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14183v2)** | 2025-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Variate tokenization, which independently embeds each variate as separate tokens, has achieved remarkable improvements in multivariate time series forecasting. However, employing self-attention with variate tokens incurs a quadratic computational cost with respect to the number of variates, thus limiting its training efficiency for large-scale applications. To address this issue, we propose VarDrop, a simple yet efficient strategy that reduces the token usage by omitting redundant variate tokens during training. VarDrop adaptively excludes redundant tokens within a given batch, thereby reducing the number of tokens used for dot-product attention while preserving essential information. Specifically, we introduce k-dominant frequency hashing (k-DFH), which utilizes the ranked dominant frequencies in the frequency domain as a hash value to efficiently group variate tokens exhibiting similar periodic behaviors. Then, only representative tokens in each group are sampled through stratified sampling. By performing sparse attention with these selected tokens, the computational cost of scaled dot-product attention is significantly alleviated. Experiments conducted on public benchmark datasets demonstrate that VarDrop outperforms existing efficient baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[tidychangepoint: a unified framework for analyzing changepoint detection in univariate time series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14369v2)** | 2025-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present tidychangepoint, a new R package for changepoint detection analysis. Most R packages for segmenting univariate time series focus on providing one or two algorithms for changepoint detection that work with a small set of models and penalized objective functions, and all of them return a custom, nonstandard object type. This makes comparing results across various algorithms, models, and penalized objective functions unnecessarily difficult. tidychangepoint solves this problem by wrapping functions from a variety of existing packages and storing the results in a common S3 class called tidycpt. The package then provides functionality for easily extracting comparable numeric or graphical information from a tidycpt object, all in a tidyverse-compliant framework. tidychangepoint is versatile: it supports both deterministic algorithms like PELT (from changepoint), and also flexible, randomized, genetic algorithms (via GA) that -- via new functionality built into tidychangepoint -- can be used with any compliant model-fitting function and any penalized objective function. By bringing all of these disparate tools together in a cohesive fashion, tidychangepoint facilitates comparative analysis of changepoint detection algorithms and models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Time-Reversal Provides Unsupervised Feedback to LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02626v3)** | 2025-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are typically trained to predict in the forward direction of time. However, recent works have shown that prompting these models to look back and critique their own generations can produce useful feedback. Motivated by this, we explore the question of whether LLMs can be empowered to think (predict and score) backwards to provide unsupervised feedback that complements forward LLMs. Towards this, we introduce Time Reversed Language Models (TRLMs), which can score and generate queries when conditioned on responses, effectively functioning in the reverse direction of time. Further, to effectively infer in the response to query direction, we pre-train and fine-tune a language model (TRLM-Ba) in the reverse token order from scratch. We show empirically (and theoretically in a stylized setting) that time-reversed models can indeed complement forward model predictions when used to score the query given response for re-ranking multiple forward generations. We obtain up to 5\% improvement on the widely used AlpacaEval Leaderboard over the competent baseline of best-of-N re-ranking using self log-perplexity scores. We further show that TRLM scoring outperforms conventional forward scoring of response given query, resulting in significant gains in applications such as citation generation and passage retrieval. We next leverage the generative ability of TRLM to augment or provide unsupervised feedback to input safety filters of LLMs, demonstrating a drastic reduction in false negative rate with negligible impact on false positive rates against several attacks published on the popular JailbreakBench leaderboard.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a spotlight in NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |

In scenarios such as household assistance and rescue, mobile robots need to understand a human command, such as "find a person wearing black". We present a novel vision-language navigation (VL-Nav) system that integrates efficient spatial reasoning on low-power robots. Unlike prior methods that rely on a single image-level feature similarity to guide a robot, we introduce the heuristic-vision-language (HVL) spatial reasoning for goal point selection. It combines pixel-wise vision-language features and heuristic exploration to enable efficient navigation to human-instructed instances in various environments robustly. We deploy VL-Nav on a four-wheel mobile robot and conduct comprehensive navigation tasks in various environments of different scales and semantic complexities, indoors and outdoors. Remarkably, VL-Nav operates at a real-time frequency of 30 Hz with a Jetson Orin NX, highlighting its ability to conduct efficient vision-language navigation. Experimental results show that VL-Nav achieves an overall success rate of 86.3%, outperforming previous methods by 44.15%.</p></details> |  |

This work suggests an enhanced communication network to serve an optimum case for the smart factory includes heavy data applications and real-time applications in one hand using the concepts of time sensitive networks (TSN) to address the limitation of real-time applications and the edge computing to assimilate the heavy data applications. The current work submits an experimental scenario to exploit H.265 compression method based on edge computing concept to mitigate consuming the capacity on overall network performance for augmented reality application. The results of enhanced communication network indicated that the latency of real time applications was less than 1msec while the packet data delivery of rest applications was 99.999%.</p></details> |  |

The algorithm has access to predictions telling, given a pair $u,v$ of elements, whether $u$ is before $v$ or not in an optimal solution. Building on the work of Braverman and Mossel (SODA 2008), we show that for a class of optimization problems including scheduling, network design and other graph permutation problems, these predictions allow to solve them in polynomial time with high probability, provided that predictions are true with probability at least $1/2+\epsilon$. Moreover, this can be achieved with a parsimonious access to the predictions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Error-quantified Conformal Inference for Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00818v1)** | 2025-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Uncertainty quantification in time series prediction is challenging due to the temporal dependence and distribution shift on sequential data. Conformal inference provides a pivotal and flexible instrument for assessing the uncertainty of machine learning models through prediction sets. Recently, a series of online conformal inference methods updated thresholds of prediction sets by performing online gradient descent on a sequence of quantile loss functions. A drawback of such methods is that they only use the information of revealed non-conformity scores via miscoverage indicators but ignore error quantification, namely the distance between the non-conformity score and the current threshold. To accurately leverage the dynamic of miscoverage error, we propose \textit{Error-quantified Conformal Inference} (ECI) by smoothing the quantile loss function. ECI introduces a continuous and adaptive feedback scale with the miscoverage error, rather than simple binary feedback in existing methods. We establish a long-term coverage guarantee for ECI under arbitrary dependence and distribution shift. The extensive experimental results show that ECI can achieve valid miscoverage control and output tighter prediction sets than other baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2025 camera version</p></details> |

To predict the next-patch's distribution, we propose a TimeFlow Loss based on flow-matching, which facilitates native pre-training of Transformers on time series without discrete tokenization. Conditioned on arbitrary-length time series, our model is pre-trained without specifying any prior distribution and can generate multiple probable predictions, achieving flexibility in representation learning beyond using parametric densities. Towards time series foundation models, we leverage minimal but crucial adaptations of Transformers and curate TimeBench with 1 trillion time points, comprising mostly real-world datasets and synthetic data. By mitigating mode collapse through TimeFlow Loss, we pre-train a family of Sundial models on TimeBench, which exhibit unprecedented model capacity and generalization performance on zero-shot forecasting. In addition to presenting good scaling behavior, Sundial achieves new state-of-the-art on both point forecasting and probabilistic forecasting benchmarks. We believe that Sundial's pioneering generative paradigm will facilitate a wide variety of forecasting scenarios.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, a novel framework is proposed to perform real-time ego-motion tracking for endoscope. Firstly, a multi-modal visual feature learning network is proposed to perform relative pose prediction, in which the motion feature from the optical flow, the scene features and the joint feature from two adjacent observations are all extracted for prediction. Due to more correlation information in the channel dimension of the concatenated image, a novel feature extractor is designed based on an attention mechanism to integrate multi-dimensional information from the concatenation of two continuous frames. To extract more complete feature representation from the fused features, a novel pose decoder is proposed to predict the pose transformation from the concatenated feature map at the end of the framework. At last, the absolute pose of endoscope is calculated based on relative poses. The experiment is conducted on three datasets of various endoscopic scenes and the results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Besides, the inference speed of the proposed method is over 30 frames per second, which meets the real-time requirement.

Although RTB has widely benefited from the utilization of technologies such as deep learning and reinforcement learning, the reliability of related methods often encounters challenges due to the discrepancies between online and offline environments and the rapid fluctuations of online bidding. To handle these challenges, RTBAgent is proposed as the first RTB agent system based on large language models (LLMs), which synchronizes real competitive advertising bidding environments and obtains bidding prices through an integrated decision-making process. Specifically, obtaining reasoning ability through LLMs, RTBAgent is further tailored to be more professional for RTB via involved auxiliary modules, i.e., click-through rate estimation model, expert strategy knowledge, and daily reflection. In addition, we propose a two-step decision-making process and multi-memory retrieval mechanism, which enables RTBAgent to review historical decisions and transaction records and subsequently make decisions more adaptive to market changes in real-time bidding. Empirical testing with real advertising datasets demonstrates that RTBAgent significantly enhances profitability.

This motivates us to develop the online generalized method of moments (OGMM), an explicitly updated estimation and inference framework in the time series setting. The OGMM inherits many properties of offline GMM, such as its broad applicability to many problems in econometrics and statistics, natural accommodation for over-identification, and achievement of semiparametric efficiency under temporal dependence. As an online method, the key gain relative to offline GMM is the vast improvement in time complexity and memory requirement. Building on the OGMM framework, we propose improved versions of online Sargan--Hansen and structural stability tests following recent work in econometrics and statistics. Through Monte Carlo simulations, we observe encouraging finite-sample performance in online instrumental variables regression, online over-identifying restrictions test, online quantile regression, and online anomaly detection. Interesting applications of OGMM to stochastic volatility modelling and inertial sensor calibration are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of OGMM.</p></details> | <details><summary>44 pa...</summary><p>44 pages (26 main), 10 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

However, existing research fails to address realistic multi-lane highway scenarios without assuming connectivity, perception, and control capabilities that are typically unavailable in current vehicles. This paper proposes a novel AI system that is the first to improve highway traffic efficiency compared with human-like traffic in realistic, simulated multi-lane scenarios, while relying on existing connectivity, perception, and control capabilities. At the core of our approach is a reinforcement learning based controller that dynamically communicates time-headways to automated vehicles near bottlenecks based on real-time traffic conditions. These desired time-headways are then used by adaptive cruise control (ACC) systems to adjust their following distance. By (i) integrating existing traffic estimation technology and low-bandwidth vehicle-to-infrastructure connectivity, (ii) leveraging safety-certified ACC systems, and (iii) targeting localized bottleneck challenges that can be addressed independently in different locations, we propose a potentially practical, safe, and scalable system that can positively impact numerous road users.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods primarily focus on data poisoning during the training phase, designing sophisticated triggers to improve stealthiness and attack success rate (ASR). However, in practical scenarios, attackers often face restrictions in accessing training data. Moreover, it is a challenge for the model to maintain generalization ability on clean test data while remaining vulnerable to poisoned inputs when data is inaccessible. To address these challenges, we propose TrojanTime, a novel two-step training algorithm. In the first stage, we generate a pseudo-dataset using an external arbitrary dataset through target adversarial attacks. The clean model is then continually trained on this pseudo-dataset and its poisoned version. To ensure generalization ability, the second stage employs a carefully designed training strategy, combining logits alignment and batch norm freezing. We evaluate TrojanTime using five types of triggers across four TSC architectures in UCR benchmark datasets from diverse domains. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of TrojanTime in executing backdoor attacks while maintaining clean accuracy. Finally, to mitigate this threat, we propose a defensive unlearning strategy that effectively reduces the ASR while preserving clean accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 3 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

Web service traffic is characterized by frequent and drastic fluctuations over time and are influenced by heterogeneous web user behaviors, making accurate prediction a challenging task. Previous research has extensively explored statistical approaches, and neural networks to mine features from preceding service traffic time series for prediction. However, these methods have largely overlooked the causal relationships between services. Drawing inspiration from causality in ecological systems, we empirically recognize the causal relationships between web services. To leverage these relationships for improved web service traffic prediction, we propose an effective neural network module, CCMPlus, designed to extract causal relationship features across services. This module can be seamlessly integrated with existing time series models to consistently enhance the performance of web service traffic predictions. We theoretically justify that the causal correlation matrix generated by the CCMPlus module captures causal relationships among services. Empirical results on real-world datasets from Microsoft Azure, Alibaba Group, and Ant Group confirm that our method surpasses state-of-the-art approaches in Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) for predicting service traffic time series. These findings highlight the efficacy of leveraging causal relationships for improved predictions.</p></details> | <details><summary>time ...</summary><p>time series, web service, web traffic, causality</p></details> |

However, many real-world games involve continuous action and state spaces and occur in continuous time, making them differential in nature. This paper addresses the scalability challenges for a representative class of two-player zero-sum (2p0s) differential games where the informed player knows the game type (payoff) while the uninformed one only has a prior belief over the set of possible types. Such games encompass a wide range of attack-defense scenarios, where the defender adapts based on their belief about the attacker's target. We make the following contributions: (1) We show that under the Isaacs' condition, the complexity of computing the Nash equilibrium for these games is not related to the action space size; and (2) we propose a multigrid approach to effectively reduce the cost of these games when many time steps are involved.

The new adaptive state tracking scheme is based on a recently-developed new discrete-time error model which has been used for gradient algorithm based state tracking control schemes, and uses the least-squares algorithm for parameter adaptation. The new least-squares algorithm is derived to minimize an accumulative estimation error, to ensure certain optimality for parameter estimation. The system stability and output tracking properties are studied. Technical results are presented in terms of plant-model matching, error model, adaptive law, optimality formulation, and stability and tracking analysis. The developed adaptive control scheme is applied to a discrete-time multiple mobile robot system to meet an adaptive state tracking objective. In addition, a collision avoidance mechanism is proposed to prevent collisions in the whole tracking process. Simulation results are presented, which verify the desired system state tracking properties under the developed least-squares algorithm based adaptive control scheme.</p></details> |  |

Advances in deep learning, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), enable automatic feature extraction, raising the question: Can combining time- and frequency-domain attributes enhance classification accuracy? To explore this, we evaluated three ECG classification tasks: (1) arrhythmia detection, (2) identity recognition, and (3) apnea detection. We initially tested three methods: (i) 2-D spectrogram-based frequency-time classification (SPECT), (ii) time-domain classification using a 1-D CNN (CNN1D), and (iii) frequency-domain classification using a Fourier transform-based CNN (FFT1D). Performance was validated using K-fold cross-validation. Among these, CNN1D (time only) performed best, followed by SPECT (time-frequency) and FFT1D (frequency only). Surprisingly, SPECT, which integrates time- and frequency-domain features, performed worse than CNN1D, suggesting a need for a more effective time and frequency fusion approach. To address this, we tested the recently proposed Fourier Analysis Network (FAN), which combines time- and frequency-domain features. However, FAN performed comparably to CNN1D, excelling in some tasks while underperforming in others. To enhance this approach, we developed the Convolutional Fourier Analysis Network (CFAN), which integrates FAN with CNN. CFAN outperformed all previous methods across all classification tasks. These findings underscore the advantages of combining time- and frequency-domain features, demonstrating CFAN's potential as a powerful and versatile solution for ECG classification and broader biomedical signal analysis</p></details> |  |

This task is however challenging due to multiple sign variations, complexity in language and inherent richness of expressions. Computational approaches have evidenced capabilities to support SLT. Nonetheless, these approaches remain limited to cover gestures variability and support long sequence translations. This paper introduces a Transformer-based architecture that encodes spatio-temporal motion gestures, preserving both local and long-range spatial information through the use of multiple convolutional and attention mechanisms. The proposed approach was validated on the Colombian Sign Language Translation Dataset (CoL-SLTD) outperforming baseline approaches, and achieving a BLEU4 of 46.84%.

It is a multimodal task aimed at localizing specific subjects spatio-temporally based on textual queries without bounding box supervision. Motivated by recent advancements in multi-modal foundation models for grounding tasks, we first explore the potential of state-of-the-art object detection models for WSTVG. Despite their robust zero-shot capabilities, our adaptation reveals significant limitations, including inconsistent temporal predictions, inadequate understanding of complex queries, and challenges in adapting to difficult scenarios. We propose CoSPaL (Contextual Self-Paced Learning), a novel approach which is designed to overcome these limitations. CoSPaL integrates three core components: (1) Tubelet Phrase Grounding (TPG), which introduces spatio-temporal prediction by linking textual queries to tubelets; (2) Contextual Referral Grounding (CRG), which improves comprehension of complex queries by extracting contextual information to refine object identification over time; and (3) Self-Paced Scene Understanding (SPS), a training paradigm that progressively increases task difficulty, enabling the model to adapt to complex scenarios by transitioning from coarse to fine-grained understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR'...</summary><p>ICLR'25 Main Conference.

| **[Unified Spatial-Temporal Edge-Enhanced Graph Networks for Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02504v1)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pedestrian trajectory prediction aims to forecast future movements based on historical paths. Spatial-temporal (ST) methods often separately model spatial interactions among pedestrians and temporal dependencies of individuals. They overlook the direct impacts of interactions among different pedestrians across various time steps (i.e., high-order cross-time interactions). This limits their ability to capture ST inter-dependencies and hinders prediction performance. To address these limitations, we propose UniEdge with three major designs. Firstly, we introduce a unified ST graph data structure that simplifies high-order cross-time interactions into first-order relationships, enabling the learning of ST inter-dependencies in a single step. This avoids the information loss caused by multi-step aggregation. Secondly, traditional GNNs focus on aggregating pedestrian node features, neglecting the propagation of implicit interaction patterns encoded in edge features. We propose the Edge-to-Edge-Node-to-Node Graph Convolution (E2E-N2N-GCN), a novel dual-graph network that jointly models explicit N2N social interactions among pedestrians and implicit E2E influence propagation across these interaction patterns. Finally, to overcome the limited receptive fields and challenges in capturing long-range dependencies of auto-regressive architectures, we introduce a transformer encoder-based predictor that enables global modeling of temporal correlation.

In this paper, we adapt and specialise the robust and conjugate GP (RCGP) framework of Altamirano et al. (2024) to the spatio-temporal setting. In doing so, we obtain an outlier-robust spatio-temporal GP with a computational cost comparable to classical spatio-temporal GPs. We also overcome the three main drawbacks of RCGPs: their unreliable performance when the prior mean is chosen poorly, their lack of reliable uncertainty quantification, and the need to carefully select a hyperparameter by hand. We study our method extensively in finance and weather forecasting applications, demonstrating that it provides a reliable approach to spatio-temporal modelling in the presence of outliers.</p></details> |  |

The dataset comprises 1,000 videos, featuring 85,000 multiple-choice QA pairs, 2,300 object captioning, and 5,700 object grounding annotations, encompassing diverse real-world conditions such as adverse weather and traffic anomalies.

We further introduce the TUMTraffic-Qwen baseline model, enhanced with visual token sampling strategies, providing valuable insights into the challenges of fine-grained spatio-temporal reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate the dataset's complexity, highlight the limitations of existing models, and position TUMTraffic-VideoQA as a robust foundation for advancing research in intelligent transportation systems.

| **[Diffusion Transformer Captures Spatial-Temporal Dependencies: A Theory for Gaussian Process Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16134v2)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion Transformer, the backbone of Sora for video generation, successfully scales the capacity of diffusion models, pioneering new avenues for high-fidelity sequential data generation. Unlike static data such as images, sequential data consists of consecutive data frames indexed by time, exhibiting rich spatial and temporal dependencies. These dependencies represent the underlying dynamic model and are critical to validate the generated data. In this paper, we make the first theoretical step towards bridging diffusion transformers for capturing spatial-temporal dependencies. Specifically, we establish score approximation and distribution estimation guarantees of diffusion transformers for learning Gaussian process data with covariance functions of various decay patterns. We highlight how the spatial-temporal dependencies are captured and affect learning efficiency. Our study proposes a novel transformer approximation theory, where the transformer acts to unroll an algorithm. We support our theoretical results by numerical experiments, providing strong evidence that spatial-temporal dependencies are captured within attention layers, aligning with our approximation theory.</p></details> | 56 pages, 13 figures |
| **[Measuring social mobility in temporal networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02365v1)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In complex networks, the rich-get-richer effect (nodes with high degree at one point in time gain more degree in their future) is commonly observed. In practice this is often studied on a static network snapshot, for example, a preferential attachment model assumed to explain the more highly connected nodes or a rich-club}effect that analyses the most highly connected nodes. In this paper, we consider temporal measures of how success (measured here as node degree) propagates across time. By analogy with social mobility (a measure people moving within a social hierarchy through their life) we define hierarchical mobility to measure how a node's propensity to gain degree changes over time. We introduce an associated taxonomy of temporal correlation statistics including mobility, philanthropy and community. Mobility measures the extent to which a node's degree gain in one time period predicts its degree gain in the next. Philanthropy and community measure similar properties related to node neighbourhood. We apply these statistics both to artificial models and to 26 real temporal networks. We find that most of our networks show a tendency for individual nodes and their neighbourhoods to remain in similar hierarchical positions over time, while most networks show low correlative effects between individuals and their neighbourhoods. Moreover, we show that the mobility taxonomy can discriminate between networks from different fields. We also generate artificial network models to gain intuition about the behaviour and expected range of the statistics. The artificial models show that the opposite of the "rich-get-richer" effect requires the existence of inequality of degree in a network. Overall, we show that measuring the hierarchical mobility of a temporal network is an invaluable resource for discovering its underlying structural dynamics.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 figures, 3 pages supplemental material.

| **[TESS: A Scalable Temporally and Spatially Local Learning Rule for Spiking Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01837v1)** | 2025-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The demand for low-power inference and training of deep neural networks (DNNs) on edge devices has intensified the need for algorithms that are both scalable and energy-efficient. While spiking neural networks (SNNs) allow for efficient inference by processing complex spatio-temporal dynamics in an event-driven fashion, training them on resource-constrained devices remains challenging due to the high computational and memory demands of conventional error backpropagation (BP)-based approaches. In this work, we draw inspiration from biological mechanisms such as eligibility traces, spike-timing-dependent plasticity, and neural activity synchronization to introduce TESS, a temporally and spatially local learning rule for training SNNs. Our approach addresses both temporal and spatial credit assignments by relying solely on locally available signals within each neuron, thereby allowing computational and memory overheads to scale linearly with the number of neurons, independently of the number of time steps. Despite relying on local mechanisms, we demonstrate performance comparable to the backpropagation through time (BPTT) algorithm, within $\sim1.4$ accuracy points on challenging computer vision scenarios relevant at the edge, such as the IBM DVS Gesture dataset, CIFAR10-DVS, and temporal versions of CIFAR10, and CIFAR100. Being able to produce comparable performance to BPTT while keeping low time and memory complexity, TESS enables efficient and scalable on-device learning at the edge.</p></details> | 9 pages, 2 figures |

Although typically defined as utility-driven technologies designed for productive or social settings, the role of robots in creative settings remains underexplored. This paper examines how robots participate in artistic creation. Through semi-structured interviews with robotic artists, we analyze the impact of robots on artistic processes and outcomes. We identify the critical roles of social interaction, material properties, and temporal dynamics in facilitating creativity. Our findings reveal that creativity emerges from the co-constitution of artists, robots, and audiences within spatial-temporal dimensions. Based on these insights, we propose several implications for socially informed, material-attentive, and process-oriented approaches to creation with computing systems. These approaches can inform the domains of HCI, including media and art creation, craft, digital fabrication, and tangible computing.</p></details> | In press in CHI'25 |

The resulting interactions are recorded at heterogeneous temporal resolutions across these domains. This multi-channel data can be combined and encoded to create a comprehensive representation of the customer's journey for accurate intent prediction. This demands sequential learning solutions. NMT transformers achieve state-of-the-art sequential representation learning by encoding context and decoding for the next best action to represent long-range dependencies. However, three major challenges exist while combining multi-domain sequences within an encoder-decoder transformers architecture for intent prediction applications: a) aligning sequences with different sampling rates b) learning temporal dynamics across multi-variate, multi-domain sequences c) combining dynamic and static sequences. We propose an encoder-decoder transformer model to address these challenges for contextual and sequential intent prediction in financial servicing applications. Our experiments show significant improvement over the existing tabular method.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, Accepted at RecTemp @ RecSys 2024</p></details> |

This inefficiency primarily arises from the quadratic computational complexity of 3D Full Attention with respect to the context length. In this paper, we propose a training-free framework termed Sparse VideoGen (SVG) that leverages the inherent sparsity in 3D Full Attention to boost inference efficiency. We reveal that the attention heads can be dynamically classified into two groups depending on distinct sparse patterns: (1) Spatial Head, where only spatially-related tokens within each frame dominate the attention output, and (2) Temporal Head, where only temporally-related tokens across different frames dominate. Based on this insight, SVG proposes an online profiling strategy to capture the dynamic sparse patterns and predicts the type of attention head. Combined with a novel hardware-efficient tensor layout transformation and customized kernel implementations, SVG achieves up to 2.28x and 2.33x end-to-end speedup on CogVideoX-v1.5 and HunyuanVideo, respectively, while preserving generation quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 8 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

To bridge this gap, we propose a new evaluation task for temporal reasoning in multi-session dialogues and introduce an approach to construct a new benchmark by augmenting dialogues from LoCoMo and creating multi-choice QAs. Furthermore, we present TReMu, a new framework aimed at enhancing the temporal reasoning capabilities of LLM-agents in this context. Specifically, the framework employs \textit{time-aware memorization} through timeline summarization, generating retrievable memory by summarizing events in each dialogue session with their inferred dates. Additionally, we integrate \textit{neuro-symbolic temporal reasoning}, where LLMs generate Python code to perform temporal calculations and select answers. Experimental evaluations on popular LLMs demonstrate that our benchmark is challenging, and the proposed framework significantly improves temporal reasoning performance compared to baseline methods, raising from 29.83 on GPT-4o via standard prompting to 77.67 via our approach and highlighting its effectiveness in addressing temporal reasoning in multi-session dialogues.</p></details> |  |
| **[Temporal-consistent CAMs for Weakly Supervised Video Segmentation in Waste Sorting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01455v1)** | 2025-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In industrial settings, weakly supervised (WS) methods are usually preferred over their fully supervised (FS) counterparts as they do not require costly manual annotations. Unfortunately, the segmentation masks obtained in the WS regime are typically poor in terms of accuracy. In this work, we present a WS method capable of producing accurate masks for semantic segmentation in the case of video streams. More specifically, we build saliency maps that exploit the temporal coherence between consecutive frames in a video, promoting consistency when objects appear in different frames. We apply our method in a waste-sorting scenario, where we perform weakly supervised video segmentation (WSVS) by training an auxiliary classifier that distinguishes between videos recorded before and after a human operator, who manually removes specific wastes from a conveyor belt. The saliency maps of this classifier identify materials to be removed, and we modify the classifier training to minimize differences between the saliency map of a central frame and those in adjacent frames, after having compensated object displacement. Experiments on a real-world dataset demonstrate the benefits of integrating temporal coherence directly during the training phase of the classifier. Code and dataset are available upon request.</p></details> | 14 pages, 7 figures |

Trained on 4.2M global time series samples from NASA's Harmonized Landsat and Sentinel-2 data archive at 30m resolution, the new 300M and 600M parameter models incorporate temporal and location embeddings for enhanced performance across various geospatial tasks. Through extensive benchmarking with GEO-Bench, the 600M version outperforms the previous Prithvi-EO model by 8\% across a range of tasks. It also outperforms six other geospatial foundation models when benchmarked on remote sensing tasks from different domains and resolutions (i.e. from 0.1m to 15m). The results demonstrate the versatility of the model in both classical earth observation and high-resolution applications. Early involvement of end-users and subject matter experts (SMEs) are among the key factors that contributed to the project's success. In particular, SME involvement allowed for constant feedback on model and dataset design, as well as successful customization for diverse SME-led applications in disaster response, land use and crop mapping, and ecosystem dynamics monitoring. Prithvi-EO-2.0 is available on Hugging Face and IBM terratorch, with additional resources on GitHub.

| **[Dismountability in Temporal Cliques Revisited](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01321v1)** | 2025-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A temporal graph is a graph whose edges are available only at certain points in time. It is temporally connected if the nodes can reach each other by paths that traverse the edges chronologically (temporal paths). In general, temporal graphs do not always admit small subsets of edges that preserve connectivity (temporal spanners). In the case of temporal cliques, spanners of size $O(n\log n)$ are guaranteed. The original proof by Casteigts et al. [ICALP 2019] combines a number of techniques, one of which is dismountability. In a recent work, Angrick et al. [ESA 2024] simplified the proof and showed, among other things, that a one-sided version of dismountability can be used to replace the second part of the proof. In this paper, we revisit the dismountability principle. We characterizing the structure that a temporal clique has if it is not 1-hop dismountable, then not {1,2}-hop dismountable, and finally not {1,2,3}-hop dismountable. It turns out that if a clique is k-hop dismountable for any other k, then it must also be {1,2,3}-hop dismountable. Interestingly, excluding only 1-hop and 2-hop dismountability is already sufficient for reducing the spanner problem from cliques to bi-cliques. Put together with the strategy of Angrick et al., the entire $O(n \log n)$ result can now be recovered using only dismountability. An interesting by-product of our analysis is that any minimal counter-example to the existence of $4n$ spanners must satisfy the properties of non {1,2,3}-hop dismountable cliques. In the second part, we discuss connections between dismountability and pivotability. We show that recursively k-hop dismountable cliques are pivotable (and thus admits $2n$ spanners, whatever k). We define a family of labelings (called full-range) which force both dismountability and pivotability and that gives some evidence that large lifetimes could be exploited more generally.</p></details> |  |
| **[DyGMamba: Efficiently Modeling Long-Term Temporal Dependency on Continuous-Time Dynamic Graphs with State Space Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04713v3)** | 2025-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning useful representations for continuous-time dynamic graphs (CTDGs) is challenging, due to the concurrent need to span long node interaction histories and grasp nuanced temporal details. In particular, two problems emerge: (1) Encoding longer histories requires more computational resources, making it crucial for CTDG models to maintain low computational complexity to ensure efficiency; (2) Meanwhile, more powerful models are needed to identify and select the most critical temporal information within the extended context provided by longer histories. To address these problems, we propose a CTDG representation learning model named DyGMamba, originating from the popular Mamba state space model (SSM). DyGMamba first leverages a node-level SSM to encode the sequence of historical node interactions. Another time-level SSM is then employed to exploit the temporal patterns hidden in the historical graph, where its output is used to dynamically select the critical information from the interaction history. We validate DyGMamba experimentally on the dynamic link prediction task. The results show that our model achieves state-of-the-art in most cases. DyGMamba also maintains high efficiency in terms of computational resources, making it possible to capture long temporal dependencies with a limited computation budget.</p></details> | Preprint |

While LMs can often complete simple factual statements, their ability to manage temporal facts (those valid only within specific timeframes) remains uncertain. We design a controlled experiment to test the robustness of temporal factual knowledge inside LMs, which we use to evaluate several pretrained and instruction-tuned models using prompts on popular Wikidata facts, assessing their performance across different temporal granularities (Day, Month, and Year). Our findings indicate that even very large state-of-the-art models, such as Llama-3.1-70B, vastly lack robust knowledge of temporal facts. In addition, they are incapable of generalizing their knowledge from one granularity to another. These results highlight the inherent limitations of using LMs as temporal knowledge bases. The source code and data to reproduce our experiments will be released.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generalized Gaussian Temporal Difference Error for Uncertainty-aware Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02295v3)** | 2025-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conventional uncertainty-aware temporal difference (TD) learning often assumes a zero-mean Gaussian distribution for TD errors, leading to inaccurate error representations and compromised uncertainty estimation. We introduce a novel framework for generalized Gaussian error modeling in deep reinforcement learning to enhance the flexibility of error distribution modeling by incorporating additional higher-order moment, particularly kurtosis, thereby improving the estimation and mitigation of data-dependent aleatoric uncertainty. We examine the influence of the shape parameter of the generalized Gaussian distribution (GGD) on aleatoric uncertainty and provide a closed-form expression that demonstrates an inverse relationship between uncertainty and the shape parameter. Additionally, we propose a theoretically grounded weighting scheme to address epistemic uncertainty by fully leveraging the GGD. We refine batch inverse variance weighting with bias reduction and kurtosis considerations, enhancing robustness. Experiments with policy gradient algorithms demonstrate significant performance gains.</p></details> |  |

To advance this task, we introduce TESRBench, a comprehensive benchmark for temporal event sequence retrieval (TESR) from textual descriptions. TESRBench includes diverse real-world datasets with synthesized and reviewed textual descriptions, providing a strong foundation for evaluating retrieval performance and addressing challenges in this domain. Building on this benchmark, we propose TPP-Embedding, a novel model for embedding and retrieving event sequences. The model leverages the TPP-LLM framework, integrating large language models (LLMs) with temporal point processes (TPPs) to encode both event texts and times. By pooling representations and applying a contrastive loss, it unifies temporal dynamics and event semantics in a shared embedding space, aligning sequence-level embeddings of event sequences and their descriptions. TPP-Embedding demonstrates superior performance over baseline models across TESRBench datasets, establishing it as a powerful solution for the temporal event sequence retrieval task.</p></details> |  |

Thus, in this paper, we propose a novel spatial-temporal progressive attention model (STPAM) to improve EEG classification in rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) tasks. STPAM first adopts three distinct spatial experts to learn the spatial topological information of brain regions progressively, which is used to minimize the interference of irrelevant brain regions. Concretely, the former expert filters out EEG electrodes in the relative brain regions to be used as prior knowledge for the next expert, ensuring that the subsequent experts gradually focus their attention on information from significant EEG electrodes. This process strengthens the effect of the important brain regions. Then, based on the above-obtained feature sequence with spatial information, three temporal experts are adopted to capture the temporal dependence by progressively assigning attention to the crucial EEG slices. Except for the above EEG classification method, in this paper, we build a novel Infrared RSVP EEG Dataset (IRED) which is based on dim infrared images with small targets for the first time, and conduct extensive experiments on it. The results show that our STPAM can achieve better performance than all the compared methods.</p></details> |  |

Sensor delays often cause discrepancies between the actual time when the event was captured and the time of sensor measurement, leading to temporal misalignment (time offset) between sensor measurement streams. In this paper, we propose an extended Kalman filter (EKF)-based radar-inertial odometry (RIO) framework that estimates the time offset online. The radar ego-velocity measurement model, estimated from a single radar scan, is formulated to include the time offset for the update. By leveraging temporal calibration, the proposed RIO enables accurate propagation and measurement updates based on a common time stream. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrated the accurate time offset estimation of the proposed method and its impact on RIO performance, validating the importance of sensor time synchronization. Our implementation of the EKF-RIO with online temporal calibration is available at https://github.com/spearwin/EKF-RIO-TC.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 4 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

For this purpose, spatial homogeneity and temporal stationarity are widely used assumptions, and many parametric covariance models have been developed under these assumptions. However, these are strong and unrealistic conditions in many cases. In addition, on the sphere, although different statistical approaches from those on Euclidean space should be applied to build a proper covariance model considering its unique characteristics, relevant studies are rare. In this research, we introduce novel parameterized models of the covariance function for spatially non-homogeneous and temporally non-stationary random processes on the sphere. To alleviate the spatial homogeneity assumption and temporal stationarity, and to consider the spherical domain and time domain together, this research will apply the theories of Intrinsic Random Functions (IRF). We also provide a methodology to estimate the associated parameters for the model. Finally, through a simulation study and analysis of a real-world data set about global temperature anomaly, we demonstrate validity of the suggested covariance model with its advantage of interpretability.</p></details> |  |

Increased extreme weather events associated with climate change can result in alterations to river and stream connectivity. While traditional stream flow gauges are costly to deploy and limited to large river bodies, trail camera methods are a low-cost and easily deployed alternative to collect hourly data. Image capturing, however requires stream ecologists to manually curate (select and label) tens of thousands of images per year. To improve this workflow, we developed an automated instream trail camera image classification system consisting of three parts: (1) image processing, (2) image augmentation and (3) machine learning. The image preprocessing consists of seven image quality filters, foliage-based luma variance reduction, resizing and bottom-center cropping. Images are balanced using variable amount of generative augmentation using diffusion models and then passed to a machine learning classification model in labeled form. By using the vision transformer architecture and temporal image enhancement in our framework, we are able to increase the 75% base accuracy to 90% for a new unseen site image. We make use of a dataset captured and labeled by staff from the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection between 2018-2020. Our results indicate that a combination of temporal image processing and attention-based models are effective at classifying unseen river connectivity images.</p></details> | 15 pages, 8 figures |

Unlike traditional task-specific models, Video Large Language Models (video LLMs) can handle multiple tasks concurrently in a zero-shot manner. Consequently, exploring the application of video LLMs for VTG tasks has become a burgeoning research area. However, despite considerable advancements in video content understanding, video LLMs often struggle to accurately pinpoint timestamps within videos, limiting their effectiveness in VTG tasks. To address this, we introduce VTG-LLM, a model designed to enhance video LLMs' timestamp localization abilities. Our approach includes: (1) effectively integrating timestamp knowledge into visual tokens; (2) incorporating absolute-time tokens to manage timestamp knowledge without concept shifts; and (3) introducing a lightweight, high-performance, slot-based token compression technique designed to accommodate the demands of a large number of frames to be sampled for VTG tasks. Additionally, we present VTG-IT-120K, a collection of publicly available VTG datasets that we have re-annotated to improve upon low-quality annotations. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of VTG-LLM in comparison to other video LLM methods across a variety of VTG tasks.</p></details> | AAAI 2025 |

Existing state-of-the-art methods, like Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs), achieve high imputation accuracy; however, they suffer from significant computational costs and are notably time-consuming due to their iterative nature. In this work, we propose CoSTI, an innovative adaptation of Consistency Models (CMs) for the MTSI domain. CoSTI employs Consistency Training to achieve comparable imputation quality to DDPMs while drastically reducing inference times, making it more suitable for real-time applications. We evaluate CoSTI across multiple datasets and missing data scenarios, demonstrating up to a 98% reduction in imputation time with performance on par with diffusion-based models. This work bridges the gap between efficiency and accuracy in generative imputation tasks, providing a scalable solution for handling missing data in critical spatio-temporal systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 5 figures, 13 tables</p></details> |

Existing event-based lip-reading solutions integrate different frame rate branches to learn spatio-temporal features of varying granularities. However, aggregating events into event frames inevitably leads to the loss of fine-grained temporal information within frames. To remedy this drawback, we propose a novel framework termed Multi-view Temporal Granularity aligned Aggregation (MTGA). Specifically, we first present a novel event representation method, namely time-segmented voxel graph list, where the most significant local voxels are temporally connected into a graph list. Then we design a spatio-temporal fusion module based on temporal granularity alignment, where the global spatial features extracted from event frames, together with the local relative spatial and temporal features contained in voxel graph list are effectively aligned and integrated. Finally, we design a temporal aggregation module that incorporates positional encoding, which enables the capture of local absolute spatial and global temporal information. Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms both the event-based and video-based lip-reading counterparts.</p></details> |  |

Existing multi-modal LLMs usually standardize these diverse visual inputs to a fixed resolution for visual encoders and yield similar numbers of tokens for LLMs. This approach is non-optimal for multimodal understanding and inefficient for processing inputs with long and short visual contents. To solve the problem, we propose Oryx, a unified multimodal architecture for the spatial-temporal understanding of images, videos, and multi-view 3D scenes. Oryx offers an on-demand solution to seamlessly and efficiently process visual inputs with arbitrary spatial sizes and temporal lengths through two core innovations: 1) a pre-trained OryxViT model that can encode images at any resolution into LLM-friendly visual representations; 2) a dynamic compressor module that supports 1x to 16x compression on visual tokens by request. These design features enable Oryx to accommodate extremely long visual contexts, such as videos, with lower resolution and high compression while maintaining high recognition precision for tasks like document understanding with native resolution and no compression. Beyond the architectural improvements, enhanced data curation and specialized training on long-context retrieval and spatial-aware data help Oryx achieve strong capabilities in image, video, and 3D multimodal understanding simultaneously.

| **[Synthesis of Temporal Causality](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10912v3)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present an automata-based algorithm to synthesize omega-regular causes for omega-regular effects on executions of a reactive system, such as counterexamples uncovered by a model checker. Our theory is a generalization of temporal causality, which has recently been proposed as a framework for drawing causal relationships between trace properties on a given trace. So far, algorithms exist only for verifying a single causal relationship and, as an extension, cause synthesis through enumeration, which is complete only for a small fragment of effect properties. This work presents the first complete cause-synthesis algorithm for the class of omega-regular effects. We show that in this case, causes are guaranteed to be omega-regular themselves and can be computed as, e.g., nondeterministic B\"uchi automata. We demonstrate the practical feasibility of this algorithm with a prototype tool and evaluate its performance for cause synthesis and cause checking.</p></details> | <details><summary>Full ...</summary><p>Full version with appendix</p></details> |

In particular, recent advances incorporate the low-rankness of gradients, introducing low-rank ZO estimators to further reduce GPU memory consumption. However, most existing works focus solely on the low-rankness of each individual gradient, overlooking a broader property shared by all gradients throughout the training, i.e., all gradients approximately reside within a similar subspace. In this paper, we consider two factors together and propose a novel low-rank ZO estimator, TeZO, which captures the low-rankness across both the model and temporal dimension. Specifically, we represent ZO perturbations along the temporal dimension as a 3D tensor and employ Canonical Polyadic Decomposition (CPD) to extract each low-rank 2D matrix, significantly reducing the training cost. TeZO can also be easily extended to the Adam variant while consuming less memory than MeZO-SGD, and requiring about only 35% memory of MeZO-Adam. Both comprehensive theoretical analysis and extensive experimental research have validated its efficiency, achieving SOTA-comparable results with lower overhead of time and memory.</p></details> |  |

The hardness of choosing delays to meet passenger demands in temporal graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18987v1)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In train networks, carefully-chosen delays may be beneficial for certain passengers, who would otherwise miss some connection. Given a simple temporal graph and a set of passengers (each specifying a starting vertex, an ending vertex, and a desired arrival time), we ask whether it is possible to delay some of the edges of the temporal graph to realize all the passengers' demands. We call this problem DelayBetter (DB), and study it along with two variants: in $\delta$-DelayBetter, each delay must be of at most $\delta$; in Path DB, passengers fully specify the vertices they should visit on their journey. On the positive side, we give a polynomial-time algorithm for Path DB, and obtain as a corollary a polynomial-time algorithm for DB and $\delta$-DB on trees. We also provide an fpt algorithm for both problems parameterized by the size of the graph's Feedback Edge Set together with the number of passengers. On the negative side, we show NP-completeness of ($1$-)DB on bounded-degree temporal graphs even when the lifetime is $2$, and of ($10$-)DB on bounded-degree planar temporal graphs of lifetime $19$. Our results complement previous work studying reachability problems in temporal graphs with delaying operations. This is to our knowledge the first such problem in which the aim is to facilitate travel between specific points (as opposed to facilitating or impeding a broadcast from one or many sources).</p></details> | 20 pages, 7 figures |
| **[GestureLSM: Latent Shortcut based Co-Speech Gesture Generation with Spatial-Temporal Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18898v1)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Controlling human gestures based on speech signals presents a significant challenge in computer vision. While existing works did preliminary studies of generating holistic co-speech gesture from speech, the spatial interaction of each body region during the speech remains barely explored. This leads to wield body part interactions given the speech signal. Furthermore, the slow generation speed limits the construction of real-world digital avatars. To resolve these problems, we propose \textbf{GestureLSM}, a Latent Shortcut based approach for Co-Speech Gesture Generation with spatial-temporal modeling. We tokenize various body regions and explicitly model their interactions with spatial and temporal attention. To achieve real-time gesture generations, we exam the denoising patterns and design an effective time distribution to speed up sampling while improve the generation quality for shortcut model. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of GestureLSM, showcasing its potential for various applications in the development of digital humans and embodied agents.

| **[A Deep Spatio-Temporal Architecture for Dynamic Effective Connectivity Network Analysis Based on Dynamic Causal Discovery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18859v1)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dynamic effective connectivity networks (dECNs) reveal the changing directed brain activity and the dynamic causal influences among brain regions, which facilitate the identification of individual differences and enhance the understanding of human brain. Although the existing causal discovery methods have shown promising results in effective connectivity network analysis, they often overlook the dynamics of causality, in addition to the incorporation of spatio-temporal information in brain activity data. To address these issues, we propose a deep spatio-temporal fusion architecture, which employs a dynamic causal deep encoder to incorporate spatio-temporal information into dynamic causality modeling, and a dynamic causal deep decoder to verify the discovered causality. The effectiveness of the proposed method is first illustrated with simulated data. Then, experimental results from Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC) demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method in inferring dECNs, which reveal the dynamic evolution of directed flow between brain regions. The analysis shows the difference of dECNs between young adults and children. Specifically, the directed brain functional networks transit from fluctuating undifferentiated systems to more stable specialized networks as one grows. This observation provides further evidence on the modularization and adaptation of brain networks during development, leading to higher cognitive abilities observed in young adults.</p></details> |  |
| **[Zero-shot Large Language Models for Long Clinical Text Summarization with Temporal Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18724v1)** | 2025-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have shown potential for transforming data processing in healthcare, particularly in understanding complex clinical narratives. This study evaluates the efficacy of zero-shot LLMs in summarizing long clinical texts that require temporal reasoning, a critical aspect for comprehensively capturing patient histories and treatment trajectories. We applied a series of advanced zero-shot LLMs to extensive clinical documents, assessing their ability to integrate and accurately reflect temporal dynamics without prior task-specific training. While the models efficiently identified key temporal events, they struggled with chronological coherence over prolonged narratives. The evaluation, combining quantitative and qualitative methods, highlights the strengths and limitations of zero-shot LLMs in clinical text summarization. The results suggest that while promising, zero-shot LLMs require further refinement to effectively support clinical decision-making processes, underscoring the need for enhanced model training approaches that better capture the nuances of temporal information in long context medical documents.</p></details> |  |
| **[Temporal Preference Optimization for Long-Form Video Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13919v2)** | 2025-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite significant advancements in video large multimodal models (video-LMMs), achieving effective temporal grounding in long-form videos remains a challenge for existing models. To address this limitation, we propose Temporal Preference Optimization (TPO), a novel post-training framework designed to enhance the temporal grounding capabilities of video-LMMs through preference learning. TPO adopts a self-training approach that enables models to differentiate between well-grounded and less accurate temporal responses by leveraging curated preference datasets at two granularities: localized temporal grounding, which focuses on specific video segments, and comprehensive temporal grounding, which captures extended temporal dependencies across entire video sequences. By optimizing on these preference datasets, TPO significantly enhances temporal understanding while reducing reliance on manually annotated data. Extensive experiments on three long-form video understanding benchmarks--LongVideoBench, MLVU, and Video-MME--demonstrate the effectiveness of TPO across two state-of-the-art video-LMMs. Notably, LLaVA-Video-TPO establishes itself as the leading 7B model on the Video-MME benchmark, underscoring the potential of TPO as a scalable and efficient solution for advancing temporal reasoning in long-form video understanding.

| **[Quantifying community evolution in temporal networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10632v2)** | 2025-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When we detect communities in temporal networks it is important to ask questions about how they change in time. Normalised Mutual Information (NMI) has been used to measure the similarity of communities when the nodes on a network do not change. We propose two extensions namely Union-Normalised Mutual Information (UNMI) and Intersection-Normalised Mutual Information (INMI). UNMI and INMI evaluate the similarity of community structure under the condition of node variation. Experiments show that these methods are effective in dealing with temporal networks with the changes in the set of nodes, and can capture the dynamic evolution of community structure in both synthetic and real temporal networks. This study not only provides a new similarity measurement method for network analysis but also helps to deepen the understanding of community change in complex temporal networks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamic Coalitions in Games on Graphs with Preferences over Temporal Goals](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18022v1)** | 2025-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In multiplayer games with sequential decision-making, self-interested players form dynamic coalitions to achieve most-preferred temporal goals beyond their individual capabilities. We introduce a novel procedure to synthesize strategies that jointly determine which coalitions should form and the actions coalition members should choose to satisfy their preferences in a subclass of deterministic multiplayer games on graphs. In these games, a leader decides the coalition during each round and the players not in the coalition follow their admissible strategies. Our contributions are threefold. First, we extend the concept of admissibility to games on graphs with preferences and characterize it using maximal sure winning, a concept originally defined for adversarial two-player games with preferences. Second, we define a value function that assigns a vector to each state, identifying which player has a maximal sure winning strategy for certain subset of objectives. Finally, we present a polynomial-time algorithm to synthesize admissible strategies for all players based on this value function and prove their existence in all games within the chosen subclass. We illustrate the benefits of dynamic coalitions over fixed ones in a blocks-world domain. Interestingly, our experiment reveals that aligned preferences do not always encourage cooperation, while conflicting preferences do not always lead to adversarial behavior.</p></details> | 9 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Time Makes Space: Emergence of Place Fields in Networks Encoding Temporally Continuous Sensory Experiences](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05798v2)** | 2025-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The vertebrate hippocampus is believed to use recurrent connectivity in area CA3 to support episodic memory recall from partial cues. This brain area also contains place cells, whose location-selective firing fields implement maps supporting spatial memory. Here we show that place cells emerge in networks trained to remember temporally continuous sensory episodes. We model CA3 as a recurrent autoencoder that recalls and reconstructs sensory experiences from noisy and partially occluded observations by agents traversing simulated rooms. The agents move in realistic trajectories modeled from rodents and environments are modeled as high-dimensional sensory experience maps. Training our autoencoder to pattern-complete and reconstruct experiences with a constraint on total activity causes spatially localized firing fields, i.e., place cells, to emerge in the encoding layer. The emergent place fields reproduce key aspects of hippocampal phenomenology: a) remapping (maintenance of and reversion to distinct learned maps in different environments), implemented via repositioning of experience manifolds in the network's hidden layer, b) orthogonality of spatial representations in different arenas, c) robust place field emergence in differently shaped rooms, with single units showing multiple place fields in large or complex spaces, and d) slow representational drift of place fields. We argue that these results arise because continuous traversal of space makes sensory experience temporally continuous. We make testable predictions: a) rapidly changing sensory context will disrupt place fields, b) place fields will form even if recurrent connections are blocked, but reversion to previously learned representations upon remapping will be abolished, c) the dimension of temporally smooth experience sets the dimensionality of place fields, including during virtual navigation of abstract spaces.</p></details> |  |
| **[Parsimonious Hawkes Processes for temporal networks modelling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17720v1)** | 2025-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal networks are characterised by interdependent link events between nodes, forming ordered sequences of links that may represent specific information flows in the system. Nevertheless, representing temporal networks using discrete snapshots in time partially cancels the effect of time-ordered links on each other, while continuous time models, such as Poisson or Hawkes processes, can describe the full influence between all the potential pairs of links at all times. In this paper, we introduce a continuous Hawkes temporal network model which accounts both for a community structure of the aggregate network and a strong heterogeneity in the activity of individual nodes, thus accounting for the presence of highly heterogeneous clusters with isolated high-activity influencer nodes, communities and low-activity nodes. Our model improves the prediction performance of previously available continuous time network models, and obtains a systematic increase in log-likelihood. Characterising the direct interaction between influencer nodes and communities, we can provide a more detailed description of the system that can better outline the sequence of activations in the components of the systems represented by temporal networks.</p></details> | 19 pages |
| **[TUNeS: A Temporal U-Net with Self-Attention for Video-based Surgical Phase Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09997v6)** | 2025-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Objective: To enable context-aware computer assistance in the operating room of the future, cognitive systems need to understand automatically which surgical phase is being performed by the medical team. The primary source of information for surgical phase recognition is typically video, which presents two challenges: extracting meaningful features from the video stream and effectively modeling temporal information in the sequence of visual features. Methods: For temporal modeling, attention mechanisms have gained popularity due to their ability to capture long-range dependencies. In this paper, we explore design choices for attention in existing temporal models for surgical phase recognition and propose a novel approach that uses attention more effectively and does not require hand-crafted constraints: TUNeS, an efficient and simple temporal model that incorporates self-attention at the core of a convolutional U-Net structure. In addition, we propose to train the feature extractor, a standard CNN, together with an LSTM on preferably long video segments, i.e., with long temporal context. Results: In our experiments, almost all temporal models performed better on top of feature extractors that were trained with longer temporal context. On these contextualized features, TUNeS achieves state-of-the-art results on the Cholec80 dataset. Conclusion: This study offers new insights on how to use attention mechanisms to build accurate and efficient temporal models for surgical phase recognition. Significance: Implementing automatic surgical phase recognition is essential to automate the analysis and optimization of surgical workflows and to enable context-aware computer assistance during surgery, thus ultimately improving patient care.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering</p></details> |

| **[Temporal Brightness Management for Immersive Content](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14853v2)** | 2025-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern virtual reality headsets demand significant computational resources to render high-resolution content in real-time. Therefore, prioritizing power efficiency becomes crucial, particularly for portable versions reliant on batteries. A significant portion of the energy consumed by these systems is attributed to their displays. Dimming the screen can save a considerable amount of energy; however, it may also result in a loss of visible details and contrast in the displayed content. While contrast may be partially restored by applying post-processing contrast enhancement steps, our work is orthogonal to these approaches, and focuses on optimal temporal modulation of screen brightness. We propose a technique that modulates brightness over time while minimizing the potential loss of visible details and avoiding noticeable temporal instability. Given a predetermined power budget and a video sequence, we achieve this by measuring contrast loss through band decomposition of the luminance image and optimizing the brightness level of each frame offline to ensure uniform temporal contrast loss. We evaluate our method through a series of subjective experiments and an ablation study, on a variety of content. We showcase its power-saving capabilities in practice using a built-in hardware proxy. Finally, we present an online version of our approach which further emphasizes the potential for low level vision models to be leveraged in power saving settings to preserve content quality.</p></details> |  |

We introduce Multi-Agent Collaborative Intelligence (MACI), a framework comprising three key components: 1) a meta-planner (MP) that identifies, formulates, and refines all roles and constraints of a task (e.g., wedding planning) while generating a dependency graph, with common-sense augmentation to ensure realistic and practical constraints; 2) a collection of agents to facilitate planning and address task-specific requirements; and 3) a run-time monitor that manages plan adjustments as needed. By decoupling planning from validation, maintaining minimal agent context, and integrating common-sense reasoning, MACI overcomes the aforementioned limitations and demonstrates robust performance in two scheduling problems.</p></details> | 21 pages, 19 tables |

A novel framework was introduced, leveraging Temporal-Correlation Graphs to model the intricate relationships and temporal patterns inherent in malicious operations. The approach dynamically captured behavioral anomalies, offering a robust mechanism for distinguishing between benign and malicious activities in real-time scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrated the framework's effectiveness across diverse ransomware families, with consistently high precision, recall, and overall detection accuracy. Comparative evaluations highlighted its better performance over traditional signature-based and heuristic methods, particularly in handling polymorphic and previously unseen ransomware variants. The architecture was designed with scalability and modularity in mind, ensuring compatibility with enterprise-scale environments while maintaining resource efficiency. Analysis of encryption speeds, anomaly patterns, and temporal correlations provided deeper insights into the operational strategies of ransomware, validating the framework's adaptability to evolving threats. The research contributes to advancing cybersecurity technologies by integrating dynamic graph analytics and machine learning for future innovations in threat detection. Results from this study underline the potential for transforming the way organizations detect and mitigate complex cyberattacks.</p></details> |  |

We focus on agents that respond solely to odor stimuli, with no access to spatial perception nor prior information about the odor. We ask whether navigation to a target can be learned robustly within a sequential decision making framework. We develop a reinforcement learning algorithm using a small set of interpretable olfactory states and train it with realistic turbulent odor cues. By introducing a temporal memory, we demonstrate that two salient features of odor traces, discretized in few olfactory states, are sufficient to learn navigation in a realistic odor plume. Performance is dictated by the sparse nature of turbulent odors. An optimal memory exists which ignores blanks within the plume and activates a recovery strategy outside the plume. We obtain the best performance by letting agents learn their recovery strategy and show that it is mostly casting cross wind, similar to behavior observed in flying insects. The optimal strategy is robust to substantial changes in the odor plumes, suggesting minor parameter tuning may be sufficient to adapt to different environments.</p></details> | 26 pages, 10 figures |

Existing approaches adopt either implicit temporal modeling, relying solely on the LLM decoder, or explicit temporal modeling, employing auxiliary temporal encoders. To investigate this debate between the two paradigms, we propose the Stackable Temporal Encoder (STE). STE enables flexible explicit temporal modeling with adjustable temporal receptive fields and token compression ratios. Using STE, we systematically compare implicit and explicit temporal modeling across dimensions such as overall performance, token compression effectiveness, and temporal-specific understanding. We also explore STE's design considerations and broader impacts as a plug-in module and in image modalities. Our findings emphasize the critical role of explicit temporal modeling, providing actionable insights to advance video MLLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Complexity of Transitively Orienting Temporal Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.06783v3)** | 2025-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In a temporal network with discrete time-labels on its edges, entities and information can only ``flow'' along sequences of edges whose time-labels are non-decreasing (resp. increasing), i.e. along temporal (resp. strict temporal) paths. Nevertheless, in the model for temporal networks of [Kempe, Kleinberg, Kumar, JCSS, 2002], the individual time-labeled edges remain undirected: an edge $e=\{u,v\}$ with time-label $t$ specifies that ``$u$ communicates with $v$ at time $t$''. In this paper we make a first attempt to understand how the direction of information flow on one edge can impact the direction of information flow on other edges. More specifically, naturally extending the classical notion of a transitive orientation in static graphs, we introduce the fundamental notion of a temporal transitive orientation and we systematically investigate its algorithmic behavior. An orientation of a temporal graph is called temporally transitive if, whenever $u$ has a directed edge towards $v$ with time-label $t_1$ and $v$ has a directed edge towards $w$ with time-label $t_2\geq t_1$, then $u$ also has a directed edge towards $w$ with some time-label $t_3\geq t_2$. If we just demand that this implication holds whenever $t_2 > t_1$, we call the orientation strictly temporally transitive, as it is based on the strict directed temporal path from $u$ to $w$. Our main result is a conceptually simple, yet technically quite involved, polynomial-time algorithm for recognizing whether a given temporal graph $\mathcal{G}$ is transitively orientable. In wide contrast we prove that, surprisingly, it is NP-hard to recognize whether $\mathcal{G}$ is strictly transitively orientable. Additionally we introduce and investigate further related problems to temporal transitivity, notably among them the temporal transitive completion problem, for which we prove both algorithmic and hardness results.</p></details> |  |

However, applying these models to video relighting remains challenging due to the lack of paired video relighting datasets and the high demands for output fidelity and temporal consistency, further complicated by the inherent randomness of diffusion models. To address these challenges, we introduce RelightVid, a flexible framework for video relighting that can accept background video, text prompts, or environment maps as relighting conditions. Trained on in-the-wild videos with carefully designed illumination augmentations and rendered videos under extreme dynamic lighting, RelightVid achieves arbitrary video relighting with high temporal consistency without intrinsic decomposition while preserving the illumination priors of its image backbone.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sequential Decision Making in Stochastic Games with Incomplete Preferences over Temporal Objectives](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16291v1)** | 2025-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring that AI systems make strategic decisions aligned with the specified preferences in adversarial sequential interactions is a critical challenge for developing trustworthy AI systems, especially when the environment is stochastic and players' incomplete preferences leave some outcomes unranked. We study the problem of synthesizing preference-satisfying strategies in two-player stochastic games on graphs where players have opposite (possibly incomplete) preferences over a set of temporal goals. We represent these goals using linear temporal logic over finite traces (LTLf), which enables modeling the nuances of human preferences where temporal goals need not be mutually exclusive and comparison between some goals may be unspecified. We introduce a solution concept of non-dominated almost-sure winning, which guarantees to achieve a most preferred outcome aligned with specified preferences while maintaining robustness against the adversarial behaviors of the opponent. Our results show that strategy profiles based on this concept are Nash equilibria in the game where players are risk-averse, thus providing a practical framework for evaluating and ensuring stable, preference-aligned outcomes in the game. Using a drone delivery example, we demonstrate that our contributions offer valuable insights not only for synthesizing rational behavior under incomplete preferences but also for designing games that motivate the desired behavior from the players in adversarial conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 3 figures, accepted at AAAI 2025 (AI alignment track)</p></details> |
| **[Classification of Mild Cognitive Impairment Based on Dynamic Functional Connectivity Using Spatio-Temporal Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16409v1)** | 2025-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dynamic functional connectivity (dFC) using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) is an advanced technique for capturing the dynamic changes of neural activities, and can be very useful in the studies of brain diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Yet, existing studies have not fully leveraged the sequential information embedded within dFC that can potentially provide valuable information when identifying brain conditions. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that jointly learns the embedding of both spatial and temporal information within dFC based on the transformer architecture. Specifically, we first construct dFC networks from rs-fMRI data through a sliding window strategy. Then, we simultaneously employ a temporal block and a spatial block to capture higher-order representations of dynamic spatio-temporal dependencies, via mapping them into an efficient fused feature representation. To further enhance the robustness of these feature representations by reducing the dependency on labeled data, we also introduce a contrastive learning strategy to manipulate different brain states. Experimental results on 345 subjects with 570 scans from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method for MCI (Mild Cognitive Impairment, the prodromal stage of AD) prediction, highlighting its potential for early identification of AD.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generalizing Egocentric Temporal Neighborhoods to probe for spatial correlations in temporal networks and infer their topology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16070v1)** | 2025-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motifs are thought to be some fundamental components of social face-to-face interaction temporal networks. However, the motifs previously considered are either limited to a handful of nodes and edges, or do not include triangles, which are thought to be of critical relevance to understand the dynamics of social systems. Thus, we introduce a new class of motifs, that include these triangles, are not limited in their number of nodes or edges, and yet can be mined efficiently in any temporal network. Referring to these motifs as the edge-centered motifs, we show analytically how they subsume the Egocentric Temporal Neighborhoods motifs of [A. Longa, G. Cencetti, B. Lepri, and A. Passerini, An efficient procedure for mining egocentric temporal motifs, Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery 36, 355 (2022)]. We also confirm in empirical data that the edge-centered motifs bring relevant information with respect to the Egocentric motifs by using a principle of maximum entropy. Then, we show how mining for the edge-centered motifs in a network can be used to probe for spatial correlations in the underlying dynamics that have produced that network. We deduce an approximate formula for the distribution of the edge-centered motifs in empirical networks of social face-to-face interactions. In the last section of this paper, we explore how the statistics of the edge-centered motifs can be used to infer the complete topology of the network they were sampled from. This leads to the needs of mathematical development, that we inaugurate here under the name of graph tiling theory.</p></details> |  |

These approaches have recently been adapted to earth observation data, but they are only able to handle single image inputs, limiting their use for many real-world tasks. In this work, we develop a new vision and language assistant called TEOChat that can engage in conversations about temporal sequences of earth observation data. To train TEOChat, we curate an instruction-following dataset composed of many single image and temporal tasks including building change and damage assessment, semantic change detection, and temporal scene classification. We show that TEOChat can perform a wide variety of spatial and temporal reasoning tasks, substantially outperforming previous vision and language assistants, and even achieving comparable or better performance than several specialist models trained to perform specific tasks. Furthermore, TEOChat achieves impressive zero-shot performance on a change detection and change question answering dataset, outperforms GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro on multiple temporal tasks, and exhibits stronger single image capabilities than a comparable single image instruction-following model on scene classification, visual question answering, and captioning. We publicly release our data, model, and code at https://github.com/ermongroup/TEOChat .</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at ICLR 2025</p></details> |

The Temporal Signal Semantic Encoder splits feature learning into high and low-frequency components, using a novel Signed Mask-Attention mechanism to emphasize important areas and downplay unimportant ones, with the features fused using ContraNorm. The Local Sensitive Response Encoder captures fluctuations without learning. These feature pyramids are then combined using a new cross-attention fusion mechanism. We also introduce a dataset with over 2,114 activity segments across 553 WiFi CSI samples, each lasting around 85 seconds.

However, existing remote sensing change detection (RSCD) approaches based on Mamba frequently struggle to effectively perceive the inherent locality of change regions as they direct flatten and scan RS images (i.e., the features of the same region of changes are not distributed continuously within the sequence but are mixed with features from other regions throughout the sequence). In this paper, we propose a novel locally adaptive SSM-based approach, termed CD-Lamba, which effectively enhances the locality of change detection while maintaining global perception. Specifically, our CD-Lamba includes a Locally Adaptive State-Space Scan (LASS) strategy for locality enhancement, a Cross-Temporal State-Space Scan (CTSS) strategy for bi-temporal feature fusion, and a Window Shifting and Perception (WSP) mechanism to enhance interactions across segmented windows. These strategies are integrated into a multi-scale Cross-Temporal Locally Adaptive State-Space Scan (CT-LASS) module to effectively highlight changes and refine changes' representations feature generation. CD-Lamba significantly enhances local-global spatio-temporal interactions in bi-temporal images, offering improved performance in RSCD tasks. Extensive experimental results show that CD-Lamba achieves state-of-the-art performance on four benchmark datasets with a satisfactory efficiency-accuracy trade-off. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/xwmaxwma/rschange.</p></details> |  |

Rabies is a prominent example with various instances globally, facilitated by a surplus of meso-predators (commonly, facultative synanthropic species e.g., golden jackals [Canis aureus, hereafter jackals]) thanks to the abundance of anthropogenic resources leading to dense populations close to human establishments. To mitigate rabies outbreaks and prevent human infections, authorities target the jackal which is the main rabies vector in many regions, through the dissemination of oral vaccines in known jackals' activity centers, as well as opportunistic culling to reduce population density. Because dilution (i.e., culling) is not selective towards sick or un-vaccinated individuals, these two complementary epizootic intervention policies (EIPs) can interfere with each other. Nonetheless, there is only limited examination of the interactive effectiveness of these EIPs and their potential influence on rabies epizootic spread dynamics, highlighting the need to understand these measures and the spread of rabies in wild jackals. In this study, we introduce a novel spatio-temporal extended-SIR (susceptible-infected-recovered) model with a graph-based spatial framework for evaluating mitigation efficiency. We implement the model in a case study using a jackal population in northern Israel, and using spatial and movement data collected by Advanced Tracking and Localization of Animals in real-life Systems (ATLAS) telemetry. An agent-based simulation approach allows us to explore various biologically-realistic scenarios, and assess the impact of different EIPs configurations. Our model suggests that under biologically-realistic underlying assumptions and scenarios, the effectiveness of both EIPs is not influenced much by the jackal population size but is sensitive to their dispersal between activity centers.</p></details> |  |
| **[Episodic Novelty Through Temporal Distance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15418v1)** | 2025-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Exploration in sparse reward environments remains a significant challenge in reinforcement learning, particularly in Contextual Markov Decision Processes (CMDPs), where environments differ across episodes. Existing episodic intrinsic motivation methods for CMDPs primarily rely on count-based approaches, which are ineffective in large state spaces, or on similarity-based methods that lack appropriate metrics for state comparison. To address these shortcomings, we propose Episodic Novelty Through Temporal Distance (ETD), a novel approach that introduces temporal distance as a robust metric for state similarity and intrinsic reward computation. By employing contrastive learning, ETD accurately estimates temporal distances and derives intrinsic rewards based on the novelty of states within the current episode. Extensive experiments on various benchmark tasks demonstrate that ETD significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, highlighting its effectiveness in enhancing exploration in sparse reward CMDPs.</p></details> | ICLR2025 |

Current state-of-the-art approaches are based on supervised learning with a conditioned policy. However, these approaches fall short in real-world applications that involve complex tasks with rich temporal and logical structures. In this paper, we propose temporal logic Specification-conditioned Decision Transformer (SDT), a novel framework that harnesses the expressive power of signal temporal logic (STL) to specify complex temporal rules that an agent should follow and the sequential modeling capability of Decision Transformer (DT). Empirical evaluations on the DSRL benchmarks demonstrate the better capacity of SDT in learning safe and high-reward policies compared with existing approaches. In addition, SDT shows good alignment with respect to different desired degrees of satisfaction of the STL specification that it is conditioned on.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in ICML 2024</p></details> |

Traditionally, visual data has been the primary source for object perception; however, it often proves insufficient in scenarios where visibility is obstructed or detailed observation is needed. This gap highlights the necessity of tactile sensing as a complementary or primary input for material recognition. Tactile data becomes particularly essential in contact-rich, small-scale manipulations where subtle deformations and surface interactions cannot be accurately captured by vision alone. This letter presents a novel approach leveraging a temporal binding foundation model for tactile sequence understanding to enhance material property recognition. By processing tactile sensor data with a temporal focus, the proposed system captures the sequential nature of tactile interactions, similar to human fingertip perception. Additionally, this letter demonstrates that, through tailored and specific design, the foundation model can more effectively capture temporal information embedded in tactile sequences, advancing material property understanding. Experimental results validate the model's capability to capture these temporal patterns, confirming its utility for material property recognition in visually restricted scenarios. This work underscores the necessity of embedding advanced tactile data processing frameworks within robotic systems to achieve truly embodied and responsive manipulation capabilities.</p></details> | 4 pages, |

In performing segmentation, deep learning (DL) algorithms improved accuracy significantly compared to traditional image processing approaches. More recently, studies showed that enhancing DL segmentation with motion information can further improve it. A range of methods for injecting motion information has been proposed, but many of them increase the dimensionality of input images (which is computationally expensive) or have not used an optimal method to insert motion information, such as non-DL registration, non-attention-based networks or single-headed attention. Here, we present a novel, computation-efficient alternative where a novel, scalable temporal attention module (TAM) extracts temporal feature interactions multiple times and where TAM has a multi-headed, KQV projection cross-attention architecture. The module can be seamlessly integrated into a wide range of existing CNN- or Transformer-based networks, providing novel flexibility for inclusion in future implementations. Extensive evaluations on different cardiac datasets, 2D echocardiography (CAMUS), and 3D echocardiography (MITEA) demonstrate the model's effectiveness when integrated into well-established backbone networks like UNet, FCN8s, UNetR, SwinUNetR, and the recent I2UNet. We further find that the optimized TAM-enhanced FCN8s network performs well compared to contemporary alternatives. Our results confirm TAM's robustness, scalability, and generalizability across diverse datasets and backbones.</p></details> |  |
| **[Synthesizing Late-Stage Contrast Enhancement in Breast MRI: A Comprehensive Pipeline Leveraging Temporal Contrast Enhancement Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01596v2)** | 2025-01-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) is essential for breast cancer diagnosis due to its ability to characterize tissue through contrast agent kinetics. However, traditional DCE-MRI protocols require multiple imaging phases, including early and late post-contrast acquisitions, leading to prolonged scan times, patient discomfort, motion artifacts, high costs, and limited accessibility. To overcome these limitations, this study presents a pipeline for synthesizing late-phase DCE-MRI images from early-phase data, replicating the time-intensity (TI) curve behavior in enhanced regions while maintaining visual fidelity across the entire image. The proposed approach introduces a novel loss function, Time Intensity Loss (TI-loss), leveraging the temporal behavior of contrast agents to guide the training of a generative model. Additionally, a new normalization strategy, TI-norm, preserves the contrast enhancement pattern across multiple image sequences at various timestamps, addressing limitations of conventional normalization methods. Two metrics are proposed to evaluate image quality: the Contrast Agent Pattern Score ($\mathcal{CP}_{s}$), which validates enhancement patterns in annotated regions, and the Average Difference in Enhancement ($\mathcal{ED}$), measuring differences between real and generated enhancements. Using a public DCE-MRI dataset with 1.5T and 3T scanners, the proposed method demonstrates accurate synthesis of late-phase images that outperform existing models in replicating the TI curve's behavior in regions of interest while preserving overall image quality. This advancement shows a potential to optimize DCE-MRI protocols by reducing scanning time without compromising diagnostic accuracy, and bringing generative models closer to practical implementation in clinical scenarios to enhance efficiency in breast cancer imaging.</p></details> |  |
| **[CEGRL-TKGR: A Causal Enhanced Graph Representation Learning Framework for Temporal Knowledge Graph Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07911v2)** | 2025-01-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal knowledge graph reasoning (TKGR) is increasingly gaining attention for its ability to extrapolate new events from historical data, thereby enriching the inherently incomplete temporal knowledge graphs. Existing graph-based representation learning frameworks have made significant strides in developing evolving representations for both entities and relational embeddings. Despite these achievements, there's a notable tendency in these models to inadvertently learn biased data representations and mine spurious correlations, consequently failing to discern the causal relationships between events. This often leads to incorrect predictions based on these false correlations. To address this, we propose an innovative Causal Enhanced Graph Representation Learning framework for TKGR (named CEGRL-TKGR). This framework introduces causal structures in graph-based representation learning to unveil the essential causal relationships between events, ultimately enhancing the performance of the TKGR task. Specifically, we first disentangle the evolutionary representations of entities and relations in a temporal knowledge graph sequence into two distinct components, namely causal representations and confounding representations. Then, drawing on causal intervention theory, we advocate the utilization of causal representations for predictions, aiming to mitigate the effects of erroneous correlations caused by confounding features, thus achieving more robust and accurate predictions. Finally, extensive experimental results on six benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our model in the link prediction task.</p></details> |  |

Traditional statistical TPPs have a long-standing history, with numerous models proposed and successfully applied across diverse domains. In recent years, advances in deep learning have spurred the development of neural TPPs, enabling greater flexibility and expressiveness in capturing complex temporal dynamics. The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has further sparked excitement, offering new possibilities for modeling and analyzing event sequences by leveraging their rich contextual understanding. This survey presents a comprehensive review of recent research on TPPs from three perspectives: Bayesian, deep learning, and LLM approaches. We begin with a review of the fundamental concepts of TPPs, followed by an in-depth discussion of model design and parameter estimation techniques in these three frameworks. We also revisit classic application areas of TPPs to highlight their practical relevance. Finally, we outline challenges and promising directions for future research.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Data-driven Dynamic Temporal Correlation Modeling Framework for Renewable Energy Scenario Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14233v1)** | 2025-01-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Renewable energy power is influenced by the atmospheric system, which exhibits nonlinear and time-varying features. To address this, a dynamic temporal correlation modeling framework is proposed for renewable energy scenario generation. A novel decoupled mapping path is employed for joint probability distribution modeling, formulating regression tasks for both marginal distributions and the correlation structure using proper scoring rules to ensure the rationality of the modeling process. The scenario generation process is divided into two stages. Firstly, the dynamic correlation network models temporal correlations based on a dynamic covariance matrix, capturing the time-varying features of renewable energy while enhancing the interpretability of the black-box model. Secondly, the implicit quantile network models the marginal quantile function in a nonparametric, continuous manner, enabling scenario generation through marginal inverse sampling. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed dynamic correlation quantile network outperforms state-of-the-art methods in quantifying uncertainty and capturing dynamic correlation for short-term renewable energy scenario generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hierarchical Spatio-Temporal State-Space Modeling for fMRI Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13074v2)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in deep learning structured state space models, especially the Mamba architecture, have demonstrated remarkable performance improvements while maintaining linear complexity. In this study, we introduce functional spatiotemporal Mamba (FST-Mamba), a Mamba-based model designed for discovering neurological biomarkers using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We focus on dynamic functional network connectivity (dFNC) derived from fMRI and propose a hierarchical spatiotemporal Mamba-based network that processes spatial and temporal information separately using Mamba-based encoders. Leveraging the topological uniqueness of the FNC matrix, we introduce a component-wise varied-scale aggregation (CVA) mechanism to aggregate connectivity across individual components within brain networks, enabling the model to capture component-level and network-level information. Additionally, we propose symmetric rotary position encoding (SymRope) to encode the relative positions of each functional connection while considering the symmetric nature of the FNC matrix. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in the proposed FST-Mamba model on various brain-based classification and regression tasks. We further show brain connectivities and dynamics that are crucial for the prediction. Our work reveals the substantial potential of attention-free sequence modeling in brain discovery.

Visualizing these graphs is crucial as it allows one to quickly identify anomalies, trends, patterns, and other properties that facilitate better decision-making. In this context, selecting an appropriate temporal resolution is essential for constructing and visually analyzing the layout. The choice of resolution is particularly important, especially when dealing with temporally sparse graphs. In such cases, changing the temporal resolution by grouping events (i.e., edges) from consecutive timestamps -- a technique known as timeslicing -- can aid in the analysis and reveal patterns that might not be discernible otherwise. However, selecting an appropriate temporal resolution is a challenging task. In this paper, we propose ZigzagNetVis, a methodology that suggests temporal resolutions potentially relevant for analyzing a given graph, i.e., resolutions that lead to substantial topological changes in the graph structure. ZigzagNetVis achieves this by leveraging zigzag persistent homology, a well-established technique from Topological Data Analysis (TDA). To improve visual graph analysis, ZigzagNetVis incorporates the colored barcode, a novel timeline-based visualization inspired by persistence barcodes commonly used in TDA. We also contribute with a web-based system prototype that implements suggestion methodology and visualization tools. Finally, we demonstrate the usefulness and effectiveness of ZigzagNetVis through a usage scenario, a user study with 27 participants, and a detailed quantitative evaluation.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This document contains the main article and supplementary material.

Formal language tools provide a robust and sound method to verify safety rules for such complex cyber-physical systems. In this paper, we propose a hybrid approach that combines the strengths of formal verification languages like Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) and Signal Temporal Logic (STL) to generate safe trajectories and optimal control inputs for autonomous vehicle navigation. We implement a symbolic path planning approach using LTL to generate a formally safe reference trajectory. A mixed integer linear programming (MILP) solver is then used on this reference trajectory to solve for the control inputs while satisfying the state, control and safety constraints described by STL. We test our proposed solution on two environments and compare the results with popular path planning algorithms. In contrast to conventional path planning algorithms, our formally safe solution excels in handling complex specification scenarios while ensuring both safety and comparable computation times.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 5 figures, Modelling Estimation and Controls Conference-2024</p></details> |

However, these training-based methods are prone to domain shifts and require high computational costs, which hinder their practical applicability in real-world scenarios. In this paper, unlike previous works, we propose a training-Free Zero-shot temporal Action Detection (FreeZAD) method, leveraging existing vision-language (ViL) models to directly classify and localize unseen activities within untrimmed videos without any additional fine-tuning or adaptation. We mitigate the need for explicit temporal modeling and reliance on pseudo-label quality by designing the LOGarithmic decay weighted Outer-Inner-Contrastive Score (LogOIC) and frequency-based Actionness Calibration. Furthermore, we introduce a test-time adaptation (TTA) strategy using Prototype-Centric Sampling (PCS) to expand FreeZAD, enabling ViL models to adapt more effectively for ZSTAD. Extensive experiments on the THUMOS14 and ActivityNet-1.3 datasets demonstrate that our training-free method outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised methods while requiring only 1/13 of the runtime. When equipped with TTA, the enhanced method further narrows the gap with fully supervised methods.</p></details> |  |

We demonstrate that this formalisation can be integrated into a neurosymbolic learning process by defining and verifying a differentiable loss function for the LTLf constraints, and automatically generating an implementation that integrates with PyTorch. We show that, by using this loss, the process learns to satisfy pre-specified logical constraints. Our approach offers a fully rigorous framework for constrained training, eliminating many of the inherent risks of ad-hoc, manual implementations of logical aspects directly in an "unsafe" programming language such as Python, while retaining efficiency in implementation.</p></details> |  |
| **[ME-CPT: Multi-Task Enhanced Cross-Temporal Point Transformer for Urban 3D Change Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14004v1)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The point clouds collected by the Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS) system provide accurate 3D information of urban land covers. By utilizing multi-temporal ALS point clouds, semantic changes in urban area can be captured, demonstrating significant potential in urban planning, emergency management, and infrastructure maintenance. Existing 3D change detection methods struggle to efficiently extract multi-class semantic information and change features, still facing the following challenges: (1) the difficulty of accurately modeling cross-temporal point clouds spatial relationships for effective change feature extraction; (2) class imbalance of change samples which hinders distinguishability of semantic features; (3) the lack of real-world datasets for 3D semantic change detection. To resolve these challenges, we propose the Multi-task Enhanced Cross-temporal Point Transformer (ME-CPT) network. ME-CPT establishes spatiotemporal correspondences between point cloud across different epochs and employs attention mechanisms to jointly extract semantic change features, facilitating information exchange and change comparison. Additionally, we incorporate a semantic segmentation task and through the multi-task training strategy, further enhance the distinguishability of semantic features, reducing the impact of class imbalance in change types. Moreover, we release a 22.5 $km^2$ 3D semantic change detection dataset, offering diverse scenes for comprehensive evaluation. Experiments on multiple datasets show that the proposed MT-CPT achieves superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art methods. The source code and dataset will be released upon acceptance at \url{https://github.com/zhangluqi0209/ME-CPT}.</p></details> |  |
| **[BOPIM: Bayesian Optimization for influence maximization on temporal networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04700v3)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The goal of influence maximization (IM) is to select a small set of seed nodes which maximizes the spread of influence on a network. In this work, we propose BOPIM, a Bayesian Optimization (BO) algorithm for IM on temporal networks. The IM task is well-suited for a BO solution due to its expensive and complicated objective function. There are at least two key challenges, however, that must be overcome, primarily due to the inputs coming from a cardinality-constrained, non-Euclidean, combinatorial space. The first is constructing the kernel function for the Gaussian Process regression. We propose two kernels, one based on the Hamming distance between seed sets and the other leveraging the Jaccard coefficient between node's neighbors. The second challenge is the acquisition function. For this, we use the Expected Improvement function, suitably adjusting for noise in the observations, and optimize it using a greedy algorithm to account for the cardinality constraint. In numerical experiments on real-world networks, we prove that BOPIM outperforms competing methods and yields comparable influence spreads to a gold-standard greedy algorithm while being as much as ten times faster. In addition, we find that the Hamming kernel performs favorably compared to the Jaccard kernel in nearly all settings, a somewhat surprising result as the former does not explicitly account for the graph structure. Finally, we demonstrate two ways that the proposed method can quantify uncertainty in optimal seed sets. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to look at uncertainty in the seed sets for IM.</p></details> |  |

In this article, we introduce DiffVC, a diffusion-based perceptual neural video compression framework that effectively integrates foundational diffusion model with the video conditional coding paradigm. This framework uses temporal context from previously decoded frame and the reconstructed latent representation of the current frame to guide the diffusion model in generating high-quality results. To accelerate the iterative inference process of diffusion model, we propose the Temporal Diffusion Information Reuse (TDIR) strategy, which significantly enhances inference efficiency with minimal performance loss by reusing the diffusion information from previous frames. Additionally, to address the challenges posed by distortion differences across various bitrates, we propose the Quantization Parameter-based Prompting (QPP) mechanism, which utilizes quantization parameters as prompts fed into the foundational diffusion model to explicitly modulate intermediate features, thereby enabling a robust variable bitrate diffusion-based neural compression framework. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed solution delivers excellent performance in both perception metrics and visual quality.</p></details> |  |
| **[Zero-Shot Trajectory Planning for Signal Temporal Logic Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13457v1)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Signal Temporal Logic (STL) is a powerful specification language for describing complex temporal behaviors of continuous signals, making it well-suited for high-level robotic task descriptions. However, generating executable plans for STL tasks is challenging, as it requires consideration of the coupling between the task specification and the system dynamics. Existing approaches either follow a model-based setting that explicitly requires knowledge of the system dynamics or adopt a task-oriented data-driven approach to learn plans for specific tasks. In this work, we investigate the problem of generating executable STL plans for systems whose dynamics are unknown a priori. We propose a new planning framework that uses only task-agnostic data during the offline training stage, enabling zero-shot generalization to new STL tasks. Our framework is hierarchical, involving: (i) decomposing the STL task into a set of progress and time constraints, (ii) searching for time-aware waypoints guided by task-agnostic data, and (iii) generating trajectories using a pre-trained safe diffusion model. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method indeed in achieving zero-shot generalization to various STL tasks.</p></details> | submitted |

Despite advancements in artificial intelligence enabling automated sleep staging, significant challenges remain: (1) Simultaneously extracting prominent temporal and spatial sleep features from multi-channel raw signals, including characteristic sleep waveforms and salient spatial brain networks. (2) Capturing the spatial-temporal coupling patterns essential for accurate sleep staging. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework named ST-USleepNet, comprising a spatial-temporal graph construction module (ST) and a U-shaped sleep network (USleepNet). The ST module converts raw signals into a spatial-temporal graph based on signal similarity, temporal, and spatial relationships to model spatial-temporal coupling patterns. The USleepNet employs a U-shaped structure for both the temporal and spatial streams, mirroring its original use in image segmentation to isolate significant targets. Applied to raw sleep signals and graph data from the ST module, USleepNet effectively segments these inputs, simultaneously extracting prominent temporal and spatial sleep features. Testing on three datasets demonstrates that ST-USleepNet outperforms existing baselines, and model visualizations confirm its efficacy in extracting prominent sleep features and temporal-spatial coupling patterns across various sleep stages. The code is available at: https://github.com/Majy-Yuji/ST-USleepNet.git.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Spatio-temporal Graph Network Allowing Incomplete Trajectory Input for Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13973v1)** | 2025-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pedestrian trajectory prediction is important in the research of mobile robot navigation in environments with pedestrians. Most pedestrian trajectory prediction algorithms require the input historical trajectories to be complete. If a pedestrian is unobservable in any frame in the past, then its historical trajectory become incomplete, the algorithm will not predict its future trajectory. To address this limitation, we propose the STGN-IT, a spatio-temporal graph network allowing incomplete trajectory input, which can predict the future trajectories of pedestrians with incomplete historical trajectories. STGN-IT uses the spatio-temporal graph with an additional encoding method to represent the historical trajectories and observation states of pedestrians. Moreover, STGN-IT introduces static obstacles in the environment that may affect the future trajectories as nodes to further improve the prediction accuracy. A clustering algorithm is also applied in the construction of spatio-temporal graphs. Experiments on public datasets show that STGN-IT outperforms state of the art algorithms on these metrics.</p></details> |  |
| **[HiMoE: Heterogeneity-Informed Mixture-of-Experts for Fair Spatial-Temporal Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00316v2)** | 2025-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Achieving fair prediction performance across nodes is crucial in the spatial-temporal domain, as it ensures the validity and reliability of forecasting outcomes. However, existing models focus primarily on improving the overall accuracy of the prediction, often neglecting the goal of achieving uniformity in the predictions. This task becomes particularly challenging due to the inherent spatial-temporal heterogeneity of the nodes. To address this issue, we propose a novel Heterogeneity-informed Mixture-of-Experts (HiMoE) for fair spatial-temporal forecasting. In particular, we design the Heterogeneity-Informed Graph Convolutional Network (HiGCN), which leverages the fusion of multi-graph and edge masking to flexibly model spatial dependencies. Moreover, we introduce the Node-wise Mixture-of-Experts (NMoE), which allocates prediction tasks of different nodes to suitable experts through graph decoupling routing. To further improve the model, fairness-aware loss and evaluation functions are proposed, optimizing the model with fairness and accuracy as objectives. Experiments on four datasets from different real-world scenarios demonstrate that HiMoE achieves the state-of-the-art performance, outperforming the best baseline with at lease 9.22% in all metrics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Making Temporal Betweenness Computation Faster and Restless](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12708v1)** | 2025-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bu{\ss} et al [KDD 2020] recently proved that the problem of computing the betweenness of all nodes of a temporal graph is computationally hard in the case of foremost and fastest paths, while it is solvable in time O(n 3 T 2 ) in the case of shortest and shortest foremost paths, where n is the number of nodes and T is the number of distinct time steps. A new algorithm for temporal betweenness computation is introduced in this paper. In the case of shortest and shortest foremost paths, it requires O(n + M ) space and runs in time where M is the number of temporal edges, thus significantly improving the algorithm of Bu{\ss} et al in terms of time complexity (note that T is usually large). Experimental evidence is provided that our algorithm performs between twice and almost 250 times better than the algorithm of Bu{\ss} et al. Moreover, we were able to compute the exact temporal betweenness values of several large temporal graphs with over a million of temporal edges. For such size, only approximate computation was possible by using the algorithm of Santoro and Sarpe [WWW 2022]. Maybe more importantly, our algorithm extends to the case of restless walks (that is, walks with waiting constraints in each node), thus providing a polynomial-time algorithm (with complexity O(nM )) for computing the temporal betweenness in the case of several different optimality criteria. Such restless computation was known only for the shortest criterion (Rymar et al [JGAA 2023]), with complexity O(n 2 M T 2 ). We performed an extensive experimental validation by comparing different waiting constraints and different optimisation criteria. Moreover, as a case study, we investigate six public transit networks including Berlin, Rome, and Paris. Overall we find a general consistency between the different variants of betweenness centrality. However, we do measure a sensible influence of waiting constraints, and note some cases of low correlation for certain pairs of criteria in some networks.</p></details> |  |

We derive non-asymptotic bounds that lead to convergence rates, addressing both temporal and spatial dependence in the observed measurements. By accounting for dependencies across time and space, our models better reflect the complexities of real-world data, enhancing both predictive performance and theoretical robustness. We also tackle the curse of dimensionality by modeling the data on a manifold, exploring the intrinsic dimensionality of high-dimensional data. We broaden existing theoretical findings of temporal-spatial analysis by applying them to neural networks in more general contexts and demonstrate that our proof techniques are effective for models with short-range dependence. Our empirical simulations across various synthetic response functions underscore the superior performance of our method, outperforming established approaches in the existing literature. These findings provide valuable insights into the strong capabilities of dense neural networks (Dense NN) for temporal-spatial modeling across a broad range of function classes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Image Motion Blur Removal in the Temporal Dimension with Video Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12604v1)** | 2025-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most motion deblurring algorithms rely on spatial-domain convolution models, which struggle with the complex, non-linear blur arising from camera shake and object motion. In contrast, we propose a novel single-image deblurring approach that treats motion blur as a temporal averaging phenomenon. Our core innovation lies in leveraging a pre-trained video diffusion transformer model to capture diverse motion dynamics within a latent space. It sidesteps explicit kernel estimation and effectively accommodates diverse motion patterns. We implement the algorithm within a diffusion-based inverse problem framework. Empirical results on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms existing techniques in deblurring complex motion blur scenarios. This work paves the way for utilizing powerful video diffusion models to address single-image deblurring challenges.</p></details> |  |
| **[Ultralow-dimensionality reduction for identifying critical transitions by spatial-temporal PCA](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12582v1)** | 2025-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Discovering dominant patterns and exploring dynamic behaviors especially critical state transitions and tipping points in high-dimensional time-series data are challenging tasks in study of real-world complex systems, which demand interpretable data representations to facilitate comprehension of both spatial and temporal information within the original data space. Here, we proposed a general and analytical ultralow-dimensionality reduction method for dynamical systems named spatial-temporal principal component analysis (stPCA) to fully represent the dynamics of a high-dimensional time-series by only a single latent variable without distortion, which transforms high-dimensional spatial information into one-dimensional temporal information based on nonlinear delay-embedding theory. The dynamics of this single variable is analytically solved and theoretically preserves the temporal property of original high-dimensional time-series, thereby accurately and reliably identifying the tipping point before an upcoming critical transition. Its applications to real-world datasets such as individual-specific heterogeneous ICU records demonstrated the effectiveness of stPCA, which quantitatively and robustly provides the early-warning signals of the critical/tipping state on each patient.</p></details> |  |
| **[TOFFE -- Temporally-binned Object Flow from Events for High-speed and Energy-Efficient Object Detection and Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12482v1)** | 2025-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Object detection and tracking is an essential perception task for enabling fully autonomous navigation in robotic systems. Edge robot systems such as small drones need to execute complex maneuvers at high-speeds with limited resources, which places strict constraints on the underlying algorithms and hardware. Traditionally, frame-based cameras are used for vision-based perception due to their rich spatial information and simplified synchronous sensing capabilities. However, obtaining detailed information across frames incurs high energy consumption and may not even be required. In addition, their low temporal resolution renders them ineffective in high-speed motion scenarios. Event-based cameras offer a biologically-inspired solution to this by capturing only changes in intensity levels at exceptionally high temporal resolution and low power consumption, making them ideal for high-speed motion scenarios. However, their asynchronous and sparse outputs are not natively suitable with conventional deep learning methods. In this work, we propose TOFFE, a lightweight hybrid framework for performing event-based object motion estimation (including pose, direction, and speed estimation), referred to as Object Flow. TOFFE integrates bio-inspired Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) and conventional Analog Neural Networks (ANNs), to efficiently process events at high temporal resolutions while being simple to train. Additionally, we present a novel event-based synthetic dataset involving high-speed object motion to train TOFFE. Our experimental results show that TOFFE achieves 5.7x/8.3x reduction in energy consumption and 4.6x/5.8x reduction in latency on edge GPU(Jetson TX2)/hybrid hardware(Loihi-2 and Jetson TX2), compared to previous event-based object detection baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

However, most existing works in visual self-supervised learning focus on static images or artificial data streams. Towards exploring a more realistic learning substrate, we investigate streaming self-supervised learning from long-form real-world egocentric video streams. Inspired by the event segmentation mechanism in human perception and memory, we propose "Memory Storyboard" that groups recent past frames into temporal segments for more effective summarization of the past visual streams for memory replay. To accommodate efficient temporal segmentation, we propose a two-tier memory hierarchy: the recent past is stored in a short-term memory, and the storyboard temporal segments are then transferred to a long-term memory. Experiments on real-world egocentric video datasets including SAYCam and KrishnaCam show that contrastive learning objectives on top of storyboard frames result in semantically meaningful representations which outperform those produced by state-of-the-art unsupervised continual learning methods.</p></details> | 20 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Exploring Temporally-Aware Features for Point Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12218v1)** | 2025-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Point tracking in videos is a fundamental task with applications in robotics, video editing, and more. While many vision tasks benefit from pre-trained feature backbones to improve generalizability, point tracking has primarily relied on simpler backbones trained from scratch on synthetic data, which may limit robustness in real-world scenarios. Additionally, point tracking requires temporal awareness to ensure coherence across frames, but using temporally-aware features is still underexplored. Most current methods often employ a two-stage process: an initial coarse prediction followed by a refinement stage to inject temporal information and correct errors from the coarse stage. These approach, however, is computationally expensive and potentially redundant if the feature backbone itself captures sufficient temporal information. In this work, we introduce Chrono, a feature backbone specifically designed for point tracking with built-in temporal awareness. Leveraging pre-trained representations from self-supervised learner DINOv2 and enhanced with a temporal adapter, Chrono effectively captures long-term temporal context, enabling precise prediction even without the refinement stage. Experimental results demonstrate that Chrono achieves state-of-the-art performance in a refiner-free setting on the TAP-Vid-DAVIS and TAP-Vid-Kinetics datasets, among common feature backbones used in point tracking as well as DINOv2, with exceptional efficiency.

While many promising methods have been developed using online corpora and captioned photographs, their application to scientific domains, where data encodes highly specialized knowledge, remains in its early stages. We present a self-supervised masked modeling framework for 3D particle trajectory analysis in Time Projection Chambers (TPCs). These detectors produce globally sparse (<1% occupancy) but locally dense point clouds, capturing meter-scale particle trajectories at millimeter resolution. Starting with PointMAE, this work proposes volumetric tokenization to group sparse ionization points into resolution-agnostic patches, as well as an auxiliary energy infilling task to improve trajectory semantics. This approach -- which we call Point-based Liquid Argon Masked Autoencoder (PoLAr-MAE) -- achieves 99.4% track and 97.7% shower classification F-scores, matching that of supervised baselines without any labeled data. While the model learns rich particle trajectory representations, it struggles with sub-token phenomena like overlapping or short-lived particle trajectories. To support further research, we release PILArNet-M -- the largest open LArTPC dataset (1M+ events, 5.2B labeled points) -- to advance SSL in high energy physics (HEP).

However, the majority of existing trajectory prediction models have neither considered reducing the uncertainty as one objective during the training stage nor provided reliable uncertainty quantification during inference stage under potential distribution shift. Therefore, in this paper, we propose the Conformal Uncertainty Quantification under Distribution Shift framework, CUQDS, to quantify the uncertainty of the predicted trajectories of existing trajectory prediction models under potential data distribution shift, while considering improving the prediction accuracy of the models and reducing the estimated uncertainty during the training stage. Specifically, CUQDS includes 1) a learning-based Gaussian process regression module that models the output distribution of the base model (any existing trajectory prediction or time series forecasting neural networks) and reduces the estimated uncertainty by additional loss term, and 2) a statistical-based Conformal P control module to calibrate the estimated uncertainty from the Gaussian process regression module in an online setting under potential distribution shift between training and testing data.</p></details> | 9 pages, 2 figures |
| **[Trajectory Flow Matching with Applications to Clinical Time Series Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21154v2)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modeling stochastic and irregularly sampled time series is a challenging problem found in a wide range of applications, especially in medicine. Neural stochastic differential equations (Neural SDEs) are an attractive modeling technique for this problem, which parameterize the drift and diffusion terms of an SDE with neural networks. However, current algorithms for training Neural SDEs require backpropagation through the SDE dynamics, greatly limiting their scalability and stability. To address this, we propose Trajectory Flow Matching (TFM), which trains a Neural SDE in a simulation-free manner, bypassing backpropagation through the dynamics. TFM leverages the flow matching technique from generative modeling to model time series. In this work we first establish necessary conditions for TFM to learn time series data. Next, we present a reparameterization trick which improves training stability. Finally, we adapt TFM to the clinical time series setting, demonstrating improved performance on three clinical time series datasets both in terms of absolute performance and uncertainty prediction.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2024 Spotlight</p></details> |
| **[Unified Spatial-Temporal Edge-Enhanced Graph Networks for Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02504v1)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pedestrian trajectory prediction aims to forecast future movements based on historical paths. Spatial-temporal (ST) methods often separately model spatial interactions among pedestrians and temporal dependencies of individuals. They overlook the direct impacts of interactions among different pedestrians across various time steps (i.e., high-order cross-time interactions). This limits their ability to capture ST inter-dependencies and hinders prediction performance. To address these limitations, we propose UniEdge with three major designs. Firstly, we introduce a unified ST graph data structure that simplifies high-order cross-time interactions into first-order relationships, enabling the learning of ST inter-dependencies in a single step. This avoids the information loss caused by multi-step aggregation. Secondly, traditional GNNs focus on aggregating pedestrian node features, neglecting the propagation of implicit interaction patterns encoded in edge features. We propose the Edge-to-Edge-Node-to-Node Graph Convolution (E2E-N2N-GCN), a novel dual-graph network that jointly models explicit N2N social interactions among pedestrians and implicit E2E influence propagation across these interaction patterns. Finally, to overcome the limited receptive fields and challenges in capturing long-range dependencies of auto-regressive architectures, we introduce a transformer encoder-based predictor that enables global modeling of temporal correlation. UniEdge outperforms state-of-the-arts on multiple datasets, including ETH, UCY, and SDD.</p></details> |  |

Remote assistance concepts, where operators provide discrete inputs to aid specific automation modules like planning, is gaining interest due to its reduced workload on the human remote operator and improved safety. However, these concepts are challenging to implement and maintain due to their deep integration and interaction with the automated driving system. In this paper, we propose a solution to facilitate the implementation of remote assistance concepts that intervene on planning level and extend the operational design domain of the vehicle at runtime. Using arbitration graphs, a modular decision-making framework, we integrate remote assistance into an existing automated driving system without modifying the original software components. Our simulative implementation demonstrates this approach in two use cases, allowing operators to adjust planner constraints and enable trajectory generation beyond nominal operational design domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 8 figures, handed in for possible publication at IEEE IV 2025, video demonstration available at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVSO-YOeGMk</p></details> |
| **[One Diffusion Step to Real-World Super-Resolution via Flow Trajectory Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01993v1)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models (DMs) have significantly advanced the development of real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR), but the computational cost of multi-step diffusion models limits their application. One-step diffusion models generate high-quality images in a one sampling step, greatly reducing computational overhead and inference latency. However, most existing one-step diffusion methods are constrained by the performance of the teacher model, where poor teacher performance results in image artifacts. To address this limitation, we propose FluxSR, a novel one-step diffusion Real-ISR technique based on flow matching models. We use the state-of-the-art diffusion model FLUX.1-dev as both the teacher model and the base model. First, we introduce Flow Trajectory Distillation (FTD) to distill a multi-step flow matching model into a one-step Real-ISR. Second, to improve image realism and address high-frequency artifact issues in generated images, we propose TV-LPIPS as a perceptual loss and introduce Attention Diversification Loss (ADL) as a regularization term to reduce token similarity in transformer, thereby eliminating high-frequency artifacts. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing one-step diffusion-based Real-ISR methods. The code and model will be released at https://github.com/JianzeLi-114/FluxSR.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Generalization via Sharpness-Aware Trajectory Matching for Dataset Condensation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01865v1)** | 2025-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dataset condensation aims to synthesize datasets with a few representative samples that can effectively represent the original datasets. This enables efficient training and produces models with performance close to those trained on the original sets. Most existing dataset condensation methods conduct dataset learning under the bilevel (inner- and outer-loop) based optimization. However, the preceding methods perform with limited dataset generalization due to the notoriously complicated loss landscape and expensive time-space complexity of the inner-loop unrolling of bilevel optimization. These issues deteriorate when the datasets are learned via matching the trajectories of networks trained on the real and synthetic datasets with a long horizon inner-loop. To address these issues, we introduce Sharpness-Aware Trajectory Matching (SATM), which enhances the generalization capability of learned synthetic datasets by optimising the sharpness of the loss landscape and objective simultaneously. Moreover, our approach is coupled with an efficient hypergradient approximation that is mathematically well-supported and straightforward to implement along with controllable computational overhead. Empirical evaluations of SATM demonstrate its effectiveness across various applications, including in-domain benchmarks and out-of-domain settings. Moreover, its easy-to-implement properties afford flexibility, allowing it to integrate with other advanced sharpness-aware minimizers. Our code will be released.</p></details> |  |

However, the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) are based on supervised deep learning - which leads to challenges when the distribution of trajectories changes due to such a shock. We provide a neuro-symbolic rule-based framework to conduct error correction and detection of these models to integrate into our movement trajectory platform. We provide a suite of experiments on several recent SOTA models where we show highly accurate error detection, the ability to improve accuracy with a changing test distribution, and accuracy improvement for the base use case in addition to a suite of theoretical properties that informed algorithm development. Specifically, we show an F1 scores for predicting errors of up to 0.984, significant performance increase for out-of distribution accuracy (8.51% improvement over SOTA for zero-shot accuracy), and accuracy improvement over the SOTA model.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we explore pre-training world models for heterogeneous environments by addressing key transfer barriers in both data diversity and model flexibility. We introduce UniTraj, a unified dataset comprising over one million trajectories from 80 environments, designed to scale data while preserving critical diversity. Additionally, we propose TrajWorld, a novel architecture capable of flexibly handling varying sensor and actuator information and capturing environment dynamics in-context. Pre-training TrajWorld on UniTraj demonstrates significant improvements in transition prediction and achieves a new state-of-the-art for off-policy evaluation. To the best of our knowledge, this work, for the first time, demonstrates the transfer benefits of world models across heterogeneous and complex control environments.</p></details> |  |

The key challenge lies in leveraging latent spatiotemporal correlations within RSS data while navigating complex road networks. To address this, we develop a Hidden Markov Model (HMM)-based RSS embedding (HRE) technique that employs alternating optimization to infer vehicle trajectories from RSS measurements. This model captures spatiotemporal dependencies while a road graph ensures network compliance. Additionally, we introduce a maximum speed-constrained rough trajectory estimation (MSR) method to guide the optimization process, enabling rapid convergence to a favorable local solution.</p></details> |  |
| **[Resilient UAV Trajectory Planning via Few-Shot Meta-Offline Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01268v1)** | 2025-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has been a promising essence in future 5G-beyond and 6G systems. Its main advantage lies in its robust model-free decision-making in complex and large-dimension wireless environments. However, most existing RL frameworks rely on online interaction with the environment, which might not be feasible due to safety and cost concerns. Another problem with online RL is the lack of scalability of the designed algorithm with dynamic or new environments. This work proposes a novel, resilient, few-shot meta-offline RL algorithm combining offline RL using conservative Q-learning (CQL) and meta-learning using model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML). The proposed algorithm can train RL models using static offline datasets without any online interaction with the environments. In addition, with the aid of MAML, the proposed model can be scaled up to new unseen environments. We showcase the proposed algorithm for optimizing an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) 's trajectory and scheduling policy to minimize the age-of-information (AoI) and transmission power of limited-power devices. Numerical results show that the proposed few-shot meta-offline RL algorithm converges faster than baseline schemes, such as deep Q-networks and CQL. In addition, it is the only algorithm that can achieve optimal joint AoI and transmission power using an offline dataset with few shots of data points and is resilient to network failures due to unprecedented environmental changes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning to Learn Weight Generation via Trajectory Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01117v1)** | 2025-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion-based algorithms have emerged as promising techniques for weight generation, particularly in scenarios like multi-task learning that require frequent weight updates. However, existing solutions suffer from limited cross-task transferability. In addition, they only utilize optimal weights as training samples, ignoring the value of other weights in the optimization process. To address these issues, we propose Lt-Di, which integrates the diffusion algorithm with meta-learning to generate weights for unseen tasks. Furthermore, we extend the vanilla diffusion algorithm into a trajectory diffusion algorithm to utilize other weights along the optimization trajectory. Trajectory diffusion decomposes the entire diffusion chain into multiple shorter ones, improving training and inference efficiency. We analyze the convergence properties of the weight generation paradigm and improve convergence efficiency without additional time overhead. Our experiments demonstrate Lt-Di's higher accuracy while reducing computational overhead across various tasks, including zero-shot and few-shot learning, multi-domain generalization, and large-scale language model fine-tuning.Our code is released at https://github.com/tuantuange/Lt-Di.</p></details> |  |
| **[GTG: Generalizable Trajectory Generation Model for Urban Mobility](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01107v1)** | 2025-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory data mining is crucial for smart city management. However, collecting large-scale trajectory datasets is challenging due to factors such as commercial conflicts and privacy regulations. Therefore, we urgently need trajectory generation techniques to address this issue. Existing trajectory generation methods rely on the global road network structure of cities. When the road network structure changes, these methods are often not transferable to other cities. In fact, there exist invariant mobility patterns between different cities: 1) People prefer paths with the minimal travel cost; 2) The travel cost of roads has an invariant relationship with the topological features of the road network. Based on the above insight, this paper proposes a Generalizable Trajectory Generation model (GTG). The model consists of three parts: 1) Extracting city-invariant road representation based on Space Syntax method; 2) Cross-city travel cost prediction through disentangled adversarial training; 3) Travel preference learning by shortest path search and preference update. By learning invariant movement patterns, the model is capable of generating trajectories in new cities. Experiments on three datasets demonstrates that our model significantly outperforms existing models in terms of generalization ability.</p></details> | 12 pages, 5 figures |

We provide non-asymptotic high-probability upper bounds for matrices $A,C$, the Kalman filter gain $K$, and the closed loop matrix $A-KC $, based on multiple sample trajectories, and further give the first non-asymptotic high-probability upper bounds for the system poles, which cover both (marginally) stable systems and unstable systems. We show that, with high probability, the non-asymptotic estimation errors of these matrices decay at a rate of at least $ \mathcal{O}(\sqrt{1/N}) $, while the estimation error of the system poles decays at a rate of at least $ \mathcal{O}(N^{\frac{1}{2n}}) $, where $ N $ represents the number of sample trajectories. Furthermore, we prove that SIMs become ill-conditioned when the ratio $n/m$ is large, regardless of the system parameters. Numerical experiments are conducted to validate the non-asymptotic results and the ill-conditionedness of SIM.</p></details> | 23 pages, 7 figures |

However, it is challenging to obtain sufficiently accurate representations of the environmental dynamics due to uncertainties in complex systems and environments. An inaccurate environment model may degrade the sample efficiency and performance of model-based RL. Furthermore, while model-based RL can improve sample efficiency, it often still requires substantial training time to learn from scratch, potentially limiting its advantages over model-free approaches. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a knowledge-informed model-based residual reinforcement learning framework aimed at enhancing learning efficiency by infusing established expert knowledge into the learning process and avoiding the issue of beginning from zero. Our approach integrates traffic expert knowledge into a virtual environment model, employing the Intelligent Driver Model (IDM) for basic dynamics and neural networks for residual dynamics, thus ensuring adaptability to complex scenarios. We propose a novel strategy that combines traditional control methods with residual RL, facilitating efficient learning and policy optimization without the need to learn from scratch. The proposed approach is applied to CAV trajectory control tasks for the dissipation of stop-and-go waves in mixed traffic flow. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed approach enables the CAV agent to achieve superior performance in trajectory control compared to the baseline agents in terms of sample efficiency, traffic flow smoothness and traffic mobility.

We present a real-time communication-free distributed algorithm for navigating robots to their desired goals certified by control barrier functions, that model and control the onboard sensing behavior to keep neighbors in the limited field of view for position estimation. The approach is robust to temporary tracking loss and directly synthesizes control in real time to stabilize visual contact through control Lyapunov-barrier functions. The main contributions of this paper are a continuous-time robust trajectory generation and control method certified by control barrier functions for distributed multi-robot systems and a discrete optimization procedure, namely, MPC-CBF, to approximate the certified controller. In addition, we propose a linear surrogate of high-order control barrier function constraints and use sequential quadratic programming to solve MPC-CBF efficiently. We demonstrate results in simulation with 10 robots and physical experiments with 2 custom-built UAVs. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first of its kind to generate a robust continuous-time trajectory and controller concurrently, certified by control barrier functions utilizing piecewise splines.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 10 figures, submitted to RSS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Enhancing Offline Reinforcement Learning with Curriculum Learning-Based Trajectory Valuation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00601v1)** | 2025-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The success of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) relies on the availability and quality of training data, often requiring extensive interactions with specific environments. In many real-world scenarios, where data collection is costly and risky, offline reinforcement learning (RL) offers a solution by utilizing data collected by domain experts and searching for a batch-constrained optimal policy. This approach is further augmented by incorporating external data sources, expanding the range and diversity of data collection possibilities. However, existing offline RL methods often struggle with challenges posed by non-matching data from these external sources. In this work, we specifically address the problem of source-target domain mismatch in scenarios involving mixed datasets, characterized by a predominance of source data generated from random or suboptimal policies and a limited amount of target data generated from higher-quality policies. To tackle this problem, we introduce Transition Scoring (TS), a novel method that assigns scores to transitions based on their similarity to the target domain, and propose Curriculum Learning-Based Trajectory Valuation (CLTV), which effectively leverages these transition scores to identify and prioritize high-quality trajectories through a curriculum learning approach. Our extensive experiments across various offline RL methods and MuJoCo environments, complemented by rigorous theoretical analysis, demonstrate that CLTV enhances the overall performance and transferability of policies learned by offline RL algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at AAMAS 2025</p></details> |

In this paper, we present a fast and efficient real-time trajectory planning and control approach for fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicles, leveraging the differential flatness property of fixed-wing aircraft in coordinated flight conditions to generate dynamically feasible trajectories. The approach provides the ability to continuously replan trajectories, which we show is useful to dynamically account for the curvature constraint as the aircraft advances along its path. Extensive simulations and real-world experiments validate our approach, showcasing its effectiveness in generating trajectories even in challenging conditions for small FW such as wind disturbances.</p></details> | Approved at Icra 25 |

Existing cross-domain policy transfer methods mostly aim at learning domain correspondences or corrections to facilitate policy learning, such as learning task/domain-specific discriminators, representations, or policies. This design philosophy often results in heavy model architectures or task/domain-specific modeling, lacking flexibility. This reality makes us wonder: can we directly bridge the domain gaps universally at the data level, instead of relying on complex downstream cross-domain policy transfer procedures? In this study, we propose the Cross-Domain Trajectory EDiting (xTED) framework that employs a specially designed diffusion model for cross-domain trajectory adaptation. Our proposed model architecture effectively captures the intricate dependencies among states, actions, and rewards, as well as the dynamics patterns within target data. Edited by adding noises and denoising with the pre-trained diffusion model, source domain trajectories can be transformed to align with target domain properties while preserving original semantic information. This process effectively corrects underlying domain gaps, enhancing state realism and dynamics reliability in source data, and allowing flexible integration with various single-domain and cross-domain downstream policy learning methods. Despite its simplicity, xTED demonstrates superior performance in extensive simulation and real-robot experiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>xTED ...</summary><p>xTED offers a novel, generic, flexible, simple and effective paradigm that casts cross-domain policy adaptation as a data pre-processing problem</p></details> |
| **[K Nearest Neighbor-Guided Trajectory Similarity Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00285v1)** | 2025-02-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory similarity is fundamental to many spatio-temporal data mining applications. Recent studies propose deep learning models to approximate conventional trajectory similarity measures, exploiting their fast inference time once trained. Although efficient inference has been reported, challenges remain in similarity approximation accuracy due to difficulties in trajectory granularity modeling and in exploiting similarity signals in the training data. To fill this gap, we propose TSMini, a highly effective trajectory similarity model with a sub-view modeling mechanism capable of learning multi-granularity trajectory patterns and a k nearest neighbor-based loss that guides TSMini to learn not only absolute similarity values between trajectories but also their relative similarity ranks. Together, these two innovations enable highly accurate trajectory similarity approximation. Experiments show that TSMini can outperform the state-of-the-art models by 22% in accuracy on average when learning trajectory similarity measures.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory Optimization Under Stochastic Dynamics Leveraging Maximum Mean Discrepancy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19045v1)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper addresses sampling-based trajectory optimization for risk-aware navigation under stochastic dynamics. Typically such approaches operate by computing $\tilde{N}$ perturbed rollouts around the nominal dynamics to estimate the collision risk associated with a sequence of control commands. We consider a setting where it is expensive to estimate risk using perturbed rollouts, for example, due to expensive collision-checks. We put forward two key contributions. First, we develop an algorithm that distills the statistical information from a larger set of rollouts to a reduced-set with sample size $N<<\tilde{N}$. Consequently, we estimate collision risk using just $N$ rollouts instead of $\tilde{N}$. Second, we formulate a novel surrogate for the collision risk that can leverage the distilled statistical information contained in the reduced-set. We formalize both algorithmic contributions using distribution embedding in Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) and Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD). We perform extensive benchmarking to demonstrate that our MMD-based approach leads to safer trajectories at low sample regime than existing baselines using Conditional Value-at Risk (CVaR) based collision risk estimate.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://github.com/Basant1861/MPC-MMD</p></details> |
| **[Best Policy Learning from Trajectory Preference Feedback](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18873v1)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We address the problem of best policy identification in preference-based reinforcement learning (PbRL), where learning occurs from noisy binary preferences over trajectory pairs rather than explicit numerical rewards. This approach is useful for post-training optimization of generative AI models during multi-turn user interactions, where preference feedback is more robust than handcrafted reward models. In this setting, learning is driven by both an offline preference dataset -- collected from a rater of unknown 'competence' -- and online data collected with pure exploration. Since offline datasets may exhibit out-of-distribution (OOD) biases, principled online data collection is necessary. To address this, we propose Posterior Sampling for Preference Learning ($\mathsf{PSPL}$), a novel algorithm inspired by Top-Two Thompson Sampling, that maintains independent posteriors over the true reward model and transition dynamics. We provide the first theoretical guarantees for PbRL in this setting, establishing an upper bound on the simple Bayesian regret of $\mathsf{PSPL}$. Since the exact algorithm can be computationally impractical, we also provide an approximate version that outperforms existing baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can Optimization Trajectories Explain Multi-Task Transfer?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14677v2)** | 2025-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the widespread adoption of multi-task training in deep learning, little is understood about how multi-task learning (MTL) affects generalization. Prior work has conjectured that the negative effects of MTL are due to optimization challenges that arise during training, and many optimization methods have been proposed to improve multi-task performance. However, recent work has shown that these methods fail to consistently improve multi-task generalization. In this work, we seek to improve our understanding of these failures by empirically studying how MTL impacts the optimization of tasks, and whether this impact can explain the effects of MTL on generalization. We show that MTL results in a generalization gap (a gap in generalization at comparable training loss) between single-task and multi-task trajectories early into training. However, we find that factors of the optimization trajectory previously proposed to explain generalization gaps in single-task settings cannot explain the generalization gaps between single-task and multi-task models. Moreover, we show that the amount of gradient conflict between tasks is correlated with negative effects to task optimization, but is not predictive of generalization. Our work sheds light on the underlying causes for failures in MTL and, importantly, raises questions about the role of general purpose multi-task optimization algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages; Published in TMLR</p></details> |

During the flight phases, where the ground reaction forces are not available for regulation, the limb swinging trajectories are significant for the stability of the next stance phase. Due to the conservation of angular momentum, improper leg and arm swinging results in highly tilted and unsustainable body configurations at the next stance phase landing. In such cases, the robotic system fails to maintain locomotion independent of the stability of the center of mass trajectories. This problem is more apparent for fast and high flight time trajectories. This paper proposes a real-time nonlinear limb trajectory optimization problem for humanoid running. The optimization problem is tested on two different humanoid robot models, and the generated trajectories are verified using a running algorithm for both robots in a simulation environment.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted for publication at the IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA), Atlanta 2025. v2: - A Github link to the proposed optimization tool is added. - There are no changes in the method and results</p></details> |

However, the current limiter in the control loops of the GFM IBR poses challenges to the effectiveness of power swing detection functions designed for SG-based systems. Among various current limiting strategies, current saturation algorithms (CSAs), widely employed for their strict current limiting capability, are the focus of this paper. The paper presents a theoretical analysis of the conditions for entering and exiting the current saturation mode of the GFM IBR under three CSAs. Furthermore, the corresponding impedance trajectories observed by the distance relay on the GFM IBR side are investigated. The analysis results reveal that the unique impedance trajectories under these CSAs markedly differ from those associated with SGs. Moreover, it is demonstrated that the conventional power swing detection scheme may lose functionality due to the rapid movement of the trajectory or its failure to pass through the detection zones. Conclusions are validated through simulations in MATLAB/Simulink.</p></details> |  |

Unlike conventional grasping tasks where the object's geometry is assumed simple, we aim to achieve a "dynamic grasp" of the irregular objects, which requires continuous adjustment during the grasping process. To effectively handle irregular objects, we propose a trajectory optimization framework that comprises two phases. Firstly, in a specified time limit of 10s, initial offline trajectories are computed for a seamless motion from an initial configuration of the robot to grasp the object and deliver it to a pre-defined target location. Secondly, fast online trajectory optimization is implemented to update robot trajectories in real-time within 100 ms. This helps to mitigate pose estimation errors from the vision system. To account for model inaccuracies, disturbances, and other non-modeled effects, trajectory tracking controllers for both the robot and the gripper are implemented to execute the optimal trajectories from the proposed framework. The intensive experimental results effectively demonstrate the performance of our trajectory planning framework in both simulation and real-world scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages.

| **[A New Perspective to Fish Trajectory Imputation: A Methodology for Spatiotemporal Modeling of Acoustically Tagged Fish Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13220v2)** | 2025-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The focus of this paper is a key component of a methodology for understanding, interpolating, and predicting fish movement patterns based on spatiotemporal data recorded by spatially static acoustic receivers. Unlike GPS trackers which emit satellite signals from the animal's location, acoustic receivers are akin to stationary motion sensors that record movements within their detection range. Thus, for periods of time, fish may be far from the receivers, resulting in the absence of observations. The lack of information on the fish's location for extended time periods poses challenges to the understanding of fish movement patterns, and hence, the identification of proper statistical inference frameworks for modeling the trajectories. As the initial step in our methodology, in this paper, we devise and implement a simulation-based imputation strategy that relies on both Markov chain and random-walk principles to enhance our dataset over time. This methodology will be generalizable and applicable to all fish species with similar migration patterns or data with similar structures due to the use of static acoustic receivers.</p></details> |  |

While deep learning methods have shown significant promise, the application of large language models (LLMs) to this domain remains underexplored. This study pioneers the use of LLMs for flight trajectory prediction by reframing it as a language modeling problem. Specifically, We extract features representing the aircraft's position and status from ADS-B flight data to construct a prompt-based dataset, where trajectory waypoints are converted into language tokens. The dataset is then employed to fine-tune LLMs, enabling them to learn complex spatiotemporal patterns for accurate predictions. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that LLMs achieve notable performance improvements in both single-step and multi-step predictions compared to traditional methods, with LLaMA-3.1 model achieving the highest overall accuracy. However, the high inference latency of LLMs poses a challenge for real-time applications, underscoring the need for further research in this promising direction.</p></details> | 9 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Target-driven Self-Distillation for Partial Observed Trajectories Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16767v1)** | 2025-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate prediction of future trajectories of traffic agents is essential for ensuring safe autonomous driving. However, partially observed trajectories can significantly degrade the performance of even state-of-the-art models. Previous approaches often rely on knowledge distillation to transfer features from fully observed trajectories to partially observed ones. This involves firstly training a fully observed model and then using a distillation process to create the final model. While effective, they require multi-stage training, making the training process very expensive. Moreover, knowledge distillation can lead to a performance degradation of the model. In this paper, we introduce a Target-driven Self-Distillation method (TSD) for motion forecasting. Our method leverages predicted accurate targets to guide the model in making predictions under partial observation conditions. By employing self-distillation, the model learns from the feature distributions of both fully observed and partially observed trajectories during a single end-to-end training process. This enhances the model's ability to predict motion accurately in both fully observed and partially observed scenarios. We evaluate our method on multiple datasets and state-of-the-art motion forecasting models. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves significant performance improvements in both settings. To facilitate further research, we will release our code and model checkpoints.</p></details> |  |

This study proposes a framework to assess the feasibility of UAM route integration using probabilistic aircraft trajectory prediction. By leveraging conditional Normalizing Flows, the framework predicts short-term trajectory distributions of conventional aircraft, enabling UAM vehicles to dynamically adjust speeds and maintain safe separations. The methodology was applied to airspace over Seoul metropolitan area, encompassing interactions between UAM and conventional traffic at multiple altitudes and lanes. The results reveal that different physical locations of lanes and routes experience varying interaction patterns and encounter dynamics. For instance, Lane 1 at lower altitudes (1,500 ft and 2,000 ft) exhibited minimal interactions with conventional aircraft, resulting in the largest separations and the most stable delay proportions. In contrast, Lane 4 near the airport experienced more frequent and complex interactions due to its proximity to departing traffic. The limited trajectory data for departing aircraft in this region occasionally led to tighter separations and increased operational challenges. This study underscores the potential of predictive modeling in facilitating UAM integration while highlighting critical trade-offs between safety and efficiency. The findings contribute to refining airspace management strategies and offer insights for scaling UAM operations in complex urban environments.</p></details> | 10 pages, 7 figures |

We find that the smallest model with highest inductive bias exhibits the best OoD generalization across different augmentation strategies when trained on the smaller A2 dataset and tested on the large WO dataset. In the converse setting, training all models on the larger WO dataset and testing on the smaller A2 dataset, we find that all models generalize poorly, even though the model with the highest inductive bias still exhibits the best generalization ability.

However, the development and ranking of state-of-the-art (SotA) models are driven by their In-Distribution (ID) performance on individual competition datasets. We present an OoD testing protocol that homogenizes datasets and prediction tasks across two large-scale motion datasets. We introduce a novel prediction algorithm based on polynomial representations for agent trajectory and road geometry on both the input and output sides of the model. With a much smaller model size, training effort, and inference time, we reach near SotA performance for ID testing and significantly improve robustness in OoD testing. Within our OoD testing protocol, we further study two augmentation strategies of SotA models and their effects on model generalization. Highlighting the contrast between ID and OoD performance, we suggest adding OoD testing to the evaluation criteria of trajectory prediction models.</p></details> |  |

This capability hinges on solving non-convex optimal control problems in real-time, although traditional iterative methods such as sequential convex programming impose significant computational challenges. To mitigate this burden, the Autonomous Rendezvous Transformer (ART) introduced a generative model trained to provide near-optimal initial guesses. This approach provides convergence to better local optima (e.g., fuel optimality), improves feasibility rates, and results in faster convergence speed of optimization algorithms through warm-starting. This work extends the capabilities of ART to address robust chance-constrained optimal control problems. Specifically, ART is applied to challenging rendezvous scenarios in Low Earth Orbit (LEO), ensuring fault-tolerant behavior under uncertainty. Through extensive experimentation, the proposed warm-starting strategy is shown to consistently produce high-quality reference trajectories, achieving up to 30\% cost improvement and 50\% reduction in infeasible cases compared to conventional methods, demonstrating robust performance across multiple state representations. Additionally, a post hoc evaluation framework is proposed to assess the quality of generated trajectories and mitigate runtime failures, marking an initial step toward the reliable deployment of AI-driven solutions in safety-critical autonomous systems such as spacecraft.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to the IEEE Aerospace Conference 2025. 13 pages, 10 figures</p></details> |

While numerous studies have focused on modeling interactions among pedestrians to forecast their movements, the influence of environmental factors and scene-object placements has been comparatively underexplored. In this paper, we present a novel trajectory prediction model that integrates both pedestrian interactions and environmental context to improve prediction accuracy. Our approach captures spatial and temporal interactions among pedestrians within a sparse graph framework. To account for pedestrian-scene interactions, we employ advanced image enhancement and semantic segmentation techniques to extract detailed scene features. These scene and interaction features are then fused through a cross-attention mechanism, enabling the model to prioritize relevant environmental factors that influence pedestrian movements. Finally, a temporal convolutional network processes the fused features to predict future pedestrian trajectories. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches, achieving ADE and FDE values of 0.252 and 0.372 meters, respectively, underscoring the importance of incorporating both social interactions and environmental context in pedestrian trajectory prediction.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by 2024 International Conference on Intelligent Computing and its Emerging Applications</p></details> |

However, current IRL works cannot learn incrementally from an ongoing trajectory because they have to wait to collect at least one complete trajectory to learn. To bridge the gap, this paper considers the problem of learning a reward function and a corresponding policy while observing the initial state-action pair of an ongoing trajectory and keeping updating the learned reward and policy when new state-action pairs of the ongoing trajectory are observed. We formulate this problem as an online bi-level optimization problem where the upper level dynamically adjusts the learned reward according to the newly observed state-action pairs with the help of a meta-regularization term, and the lower level learns the corresponding policy. We propose a novel algorithm to solve this problem and guarantee that the algorithm achieves sub-linear local regret $O(\sqrt{T}+\log T+\sqrt{T}\log T)$. If the reward function is linear, we prove that the proposed algorithm achieves sub-linear regret $O(\log T)$. Experiments are used to validate the proposed algorithm.</p></details> |  |

Due to the complexity of intersection scenarios and the limitations of single-vehicle perception, the performance of vehicle-centric prediction methods has reached a plateau. Furthermore, most works underutilize critical intersection information, including traffic signals, and behavior patterns induced by road structures. Therefore, we propose a multi-agent trajectory prediction framework at signalized intersections dedicated to Infrastructure-to-Everything (I2XTraj). Our framework leverages dynamic graph attention to integrate knowledge from traffic signals and driving behaviors. A continuous signal-informed mechanism is proposed to adaptively process real-time traffic signals from infrastructure devices. Additionally, leveraging the prior knowledge of the intersection topology, we propose a driving strategy awareness mechanism to model the joint distribution of goal intentions and maneuvers. To the best of our knowledge, I2XTraj represents the first multi-agent trajectory prediction framework explicitly designed for infrastructure deployment, supplying subscribable prediction services to all vehicles at intersections. I2XTraj demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on both the Vehicle-to-Infrastructure dataset V2X-Seq and the aerial-view dataset SinD for signalized intersections. Quantitative evaluations show that our approach outperforms existing methods by more than 30% in both multi-agent and single-agent scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Zero-Shot Trajectory Planning for Signal Temporal Logic Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13457v1)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Signal Temporal Logic (STL) is a powerful specification language for describing complex temporal behaviors of continuous signals, making it well-suited for high-level robotic task descriptions. However, generating executable plans for STL tasks is challenging, as it requires consideration of the coupling between the task specification and the system dynamics. Existing approaches either follow a model-based setting that explicitly requires knowledge of the system dynamics or adopt a task-oriented data-driven approach to learn plans for specific tasks. In this work, we investigate the problem of generating executable STL plans for systems whose dynamics are unknown a priori. We propose a new planning framework that uses only task-agnostic data during the offline training stage, enabling zero-shot generalization to new STL tasks. Our framework is hierarchical, involving: (i) decomposing the STL task into a set of progress and time constraints, (ii) searching for time-aware waypoints guided by task-agnostic data, and (iii) generating trajectories using a pre-trained safe diffusion model. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method indeed in achieving zero-shot generalization to various STL tasks.</p></details> | submitted |
| **[One Fits All: General Mobility Trajectory Modeling via Masked Conditional Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13347v1)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory data play a crucial role in many applications, ranging from network optimization to urban planning. Existing studies on trajectory data are task-specific, and their applicability is limited to the specific tasks on which they have been trained, such as generation, recovery, or prediction. However, the potential of a unified model has not yet been fully explored in trajectory modeling. Although various trajectory tasks differ in inputs, outputs, objectives, and conditions, they share common mobility patterns. Based on these common patterns, we can construct a general framework that enables a single model to address different tasks. However, building a trajectory task-general framework faces two critical challenges: 1) the diversity in the formats of different tasks and 2) the complexity of the conditions imposed on different tasks. In this work, we propose a general trajectory modeling framework via masked conditional diffusion (named GenMove). Specifically, we utilize mask conditions to unify diverse formats. To adapt to complex conditions associated with different tasks, we utilize historical trajectory data to obtain contextual trajectory embeddings, which include rich contexts such as spatiotemporal characteristics and user preferences. Integrating the contextual trajectory embedding into diffusion models through a classifier-free guidance approach allows the model to flexibly adjust its outputs based on different conditions. Extensive experiments on mainstream tasks demonstrate that our model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, with the highest performance improvement exceeding 13% in generation tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Spatio-temporal Graph Network Allowing Incomplete Trajectory Input for Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13973v1)** | 2025-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pedestrian trajectory prediction is important in the research of mobile robot navigation in environments with pedestrians. Most pedestrian trajectory prediction algorithms require the input historical trajectories to be complete. If a pedestrian is unobservable in any frame in the past, then its historical trajectory become incomplete, the algorithm will not predict its future trajectory. To address this limitation, we propose the STGN-IT, a spatio-temporal graph network allowing incomplete trajectory input, which can predict the future trajectories of pedestrians with incomplete historical trajectories. STGN-IT uses the spatio-temporal graph with an additional encoding method to represent the historical trajectories and observation states of pedestrians. Moreover, STGN-IT introduces static obstacles in the environment that may affect the future trajectories as nodes to further improve the prediction accuracy. A clustering algorithm is also applied in the construction of spatio-temporal graphs. Experiments on public datasets show that STGN-IT outperforms state of the art algorithms on these metrics.</p></details> |  |

We apply state feedback linearisation control for the process and propose a simplified implementation of the model control loop which results in a simple model in Brunovsky-form that represents the nominal feedback linearised dynamics of the nonlinear process. To compensate possibly unmatched model uncertainties, we employ Lyapunov redesign with numeric derivatives of the output. It turns out that for a special initialisation of the model, the MFC reduces to a single-loop control design. We illustrate our results by a numerical example.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning segmentation from point trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12392v1)** | 2025-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the problem of segmenting objects in videos based on their motion and no other forms of supervision. Prior work has often approached this problem by using the principle of common fate, namely the fact that the motion of points that belong to the same object is strongly correlated. However, most authors have only considered instantaneous motion from optical flow. In this work, we present a way to train a segmentation network using long-term point trajectories as a supervisory signal to complement optical flow. The key difficulty is that long-term motion, unlike instantaneous motion, is difficult to model -- any parametric approximation is unlikely to capture complex motion patterns over long periods of time. We instead draw inspiration from subspace clustering approaches, proposing a loss function that seeks to group the trajectories into low-rank matrices where the motion of object points can be approximately explained as a linear combination of other point tracks. Our method outperforms the prior art on motion-based segmentation, which shows the utility of long-term motion and the effectiveness of our formulation.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2024 Spotlight.

| **[Algorithm Selection with Probing Trajectories: Benchmarking the Choice of Classifier Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11414v1)** | 2025-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent approaches to training algorithm selectors in the black-box optimisation domain have advocated for the use of training data that is algorithm-centric in order to encapsulate information about how an algorithm performs on an instance, rather than relying on information derived from features of the instance itself. Probing-trajectories that consist of a sequence of objective performance per function evaluation obtained from a short run of an algorithm have recently shown particular promise in training accurate selectors. However, training models on this type of data requires an appropriately chosen classifier given the sequential nature of the data. There are currently no clear guidelines for choosing the most appropriate classifier for algorithm selection using time-series data from the plethora of models available. To address this, we conduct a large benchmark study using 17 different classifiers and three types of trajectory on a classification task using the BBOB benchmark suite using both leave-one-instance out and leave-one-problem out cross-validation. In contrast to previous studies using tabular data, we find that the choice of classifier has a significant impact, showing that feature-based and interval-based models are the best choices.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in Applications of Evolutionary Computation 28th International Conference, EvoApplications 2025</p></details> |
| **[Spatio-temporal characterisation of underwater noise through semantic trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11131v1)** | 2025-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Underwater noise pollution from human activities, particularly shipping, has been recognised as a serious threat to marine life. The sound generated by vessels can have various adverse effects on fish and aquatic ecosystems in general. In this setting, the estimation and analysis of the underwater noise produced by vessels is an important challenge for the preservation of the marine environment. In this paper we propose a model for the spatio-temporal characterisation of the underwater noise generated by vessels. The approach is based on the reconstruction of the vessels' trajectories from Automatic Identification System (AIS) data and on their deployment in a spatio-temporal database. Trajectories are enriched with semantic information like the acoustic characteristics of the vessels' engines or the activity performed by the vessels. We define a model for underwater noise propagation and use the trajectories' information to infer how noise propagates in the area of interest. We develop our approach for the case study of the fishery activities in the Northern Adriatic sea, an area of the Mediterranean sea which is well known to be highly exploited. We implement our approach using MobilityDB, an open source geospatial trajectory data management and analysis platform, which offers spatio-temporal operators and indexes improving the efficiency of our system. We use this platform to conduct various analyses of the underwater noise generated in the Northern Adriatic Sea, aiming at estimating the impact of fishing activities on underwater noise pollution and at demonstrating the flexibility and expressiveness of our approach.</p></details> |  |

To further enhance temporal features, we introduce a Temporal Feature Enhancement Module, which integrates spectral features into temporal data using residual cross-attention. This enhanced temporal information is then employed for precise 3D trajectory estimation and classification.

| **[Audio Array-Based 3D UAV Trajectory Estimation with LiDAR Pseudo-Labeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12698v5)** | 2025-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As small unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) become increasingly prevalent, there is growing concern regarding their impact on public safety and privacy, highlighting the need for advanced tracking and trajectory estimation solutions. In response, this paper introduces a novel framework that utilizes audio array for 3D UAV trajectory estimation. Our approach incorporates a self-supervised learning model, starting with the conversion of audio data into mel-spectrograms, which are analyzed through an encoder to extract crucial temporal and spectral information. Simultaneously, UAV trajectories are estimated using LiDAR point clouds via unsupervised methods. These LiDAR-based estimations act as pseudo labels, enabling the training of an Audio Perception Network without requiring labeled data. In this architecture, the LiDAR-based system operates as the Teacher Network, guiding the Audio Perception Network, which serves as the Student Network. Once trained, the model can independently predict 3D trajectories using only audio signals, with no need for LiDAR data or external ground truth during deployment. To further enhance precision, we apply Gaussian Process modeling for improved spatiotemporal tracking. Our method delivers top-tier performance on the MMAUD dataset, establishing a new benchmark in trajectory estimation using self-supervised learning techniques without reliance on ground truth annotations.</p></details> | Accepted for ICASSP |
| **[Risk-Informed Diffusion Transformer for Long-Tail Trajectory Prediction in the Crash Scenario](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16349v1)** | 2025-01-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction methods have been widely applied in autonomous driving technologies. Although the overall performance accuracy of trajectory prediction is relatively high, the lack of trajectory data in critical scenarios in the training data leads to the long-tail phenomenon. Normally, the trajectories of the tail data are more critical and more difficult to predict and may include rare scenarios such as crashes. To solve this problem, we extracted the trajectory data from real-world crash scenarios, which contain more long-tail data. Meanwhile, based on the trajectory data in this scenario, we integrated graph-based risk information and diffusion with transformer and proposed the Risk-Informed Diffusion Transformer (RI-DiT) trajectory prediction method. Extensive experiments were conducted on trajectory data in the real-world crash scenario, and the results show that the algorithm we proposed has good performance. When predicting the data of the tail 10\% (Top 10\%), the minADE and minFDE indicators are 0.016/2.667 m. At the same time, we showed the trajectory conditions of different long-tail distributions. The distribution of trajectory data is closer to the tail, the less smooth the trajectory is. Through the trajectory data in real-world crash scenarios, Our work expands the methods to overcome the long-tail challenges in trajectory prediction. Our method, RI-DiT, integrates inverse time to collision (ITTC) and the feature of traffic flow, which can predict long-tail trajectories more accurately and improve the safety of autonomous driving systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Three-dimensional Trajectory Optimization for Quadrotor Tail-sitter UAVs: Traversing through Given Waypoints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08347v3)** | 2025-01-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Given the evolving application scenarios of current fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), it is necessary for UAVs to possess agile and rapid 3-dimensional flight capabilities. Typically, the trajectory of a tail-sitter is generated separately for vertical and level flights. This limits the tail-sitter's ability to move in a 3-dimensional airspace and makes it difficult to establish a smooth transition between vertical and level flights. In the present work, a 3-dimensional trajectory optimization method is proposed for quadrotor tail-sitters. Especially, the differential dynamics constraints are eliminated when generating the trajectory of the tail-sitter by utilizing differential flatness method. Additionally, the temporal parameters of the trajectory are generated using the state-of-the-art trajectory generation method called MINCO (minimum control). Subsequently, we convert the speed constraint on the vehicle into a soft constraint by discretizing the trajectory in time. This increases the likelihood that the control input limits are satisfied and the trajectory is feasible. Then, we utilize a kind of model predictive control (MPC) method to track trajectories. Even if restricting the tail-sitter's motion to a 2-dimensional horizontal plane, the solutions still outperform those of the L1 Guidance Law and Dubins path.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient and Safe Trajectory Planning for Autonomous Agricultural Vehicle Headland Turning in Cluttered Orchard Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10636v1)** | 2025-01-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous agricultural vehicles (AAVs), including field robots and autonomous tractors, are becoming essential in modern farming by improving efficiency and reducing labor costs. A critical task in AAV operations is headland turning between crop rows. This task is challenging in orchards with limited headland space, irregular boundaries, operational constraints, and static obstacles. While traditional trajectory planning methods work well in arable farming, they often fail in cluttered orchard environments. This letter presents a novel trajectory planner that enhances the safety and efficiency of AAV headland maneuvers, leveraging advancements in autonomous driving. Our approach includes an efficient front-end algorithm and a high-performance back-end optimization. Applied to vehicles with various implements, it outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both standard and challenging orchard fields. This work bridges agricultural and autonomous driving technologies, facilitating a broader adoption of AAVs in complex orchards.</p></details> |  |
| **[On Learning Informative Trajectory Embeddings for Imitation, Classification and Regression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09327v2)** | 2025-01-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In real-world sequential decision making tasks like autonomous driving, robotics, and healthcare, learning from observed state-action trajectories is critical for tasks like imitation, classification, and clustering. For example, self-driving cars must replicate human driving behaviors, while robots and healthcare systems benefit from modeling decision sequences, whether or not they come from expert data. Existing trajectory encoding methods often focus on specific tasks or rely on reward signals, limiting their ability to generalize across domains and tasks. Inspired by the success of embedding models like CLIP and BERT in static domains, we propose a novel method for embedding state-action trajectories into a latent space that captures the skills and competencies in the dynamic underlying decision-making processes. This method operates without the need for reward labels, enabling better generalization across diverse domains and tasks. Our contributions are threefold: (1) We introduce a trajectory embedding approach that captures multiple abilities from state-action data. (2) The learned embeddings exhibit strong representational power across downstream tasks, including imitation, classification, clustering, and regression. (3) The embeddings demonstrate unique properties, such as controlling agent behaviors in IQ-Learn and an additive structure in the latent space. Experimental results confirm that our method outperforms traditional approaches, offering more flexible and powerful trajectory representations for various applications.

| **[STPOTR: Simultaneous Human Trajectory and Pose Prediction Using a Non-Autoregressive Transformer for Robot Following Ahead](http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.07600v4)** | 2025-01-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we develop a neural network model to predict future human motion from an observed human motion history. We propose a non-autoregressive transformer architecture to leverage its parallel nature for easier training and fast, accurate predictions at test time. The proposed architecture divides human motion prediction into two parts: 1) the human trajectory, which is the hip joint 3D position over time and 2) the human pose which is the all other joints 3D positions over time with respect to a fixed hip joint. We propose to make the two predictions simultaneously, as the shared representation can improve the model performance. Therefore, the model consists of two sets of encoders and decoders. First, a multi-head attention module applied to encoder outputs improves human trajectory. Second, another multi-head self-attention module applied to encoder outputs concatenated with decoder outputs facilitates learning of temporal dependencies. Our model is well-suited for robotic applications in terms of test accuracy and speed, and compares favorably with respect to state-of-the-art methods. We demonstrate the real-world applicability of our work via the Robot Follow-Ahead task, a challenging yet practical case study for our proposed model.</p></details> |  |
| **[BILTS: A Bi-Invariant Similarity Measure for Robust Object Trajectory Recognition under Reference Frame Variations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04392v2)** | 2025-01-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When similar object motions are performed in diverse contexts but are meant to be recognized under a single classification, these contextual variations act as disturbances that negatively affect accurate motion recognition. In this paper, we focus on contextual variations caused by reference frame variations. To robustly deal with these variations, similarity measures have been introduced that compare object motion trajectories in a context-invariant manner. However, most are highly sensitive to noise near singularities, where the measure is not uniquely defined, and lack bi-invariance (invariance to both world and body frame variations). To address these issues, we propose the novel \textit{Bi-Invariant Local Trajectory-Shape Similarity} (BILTS) measure. Compared to other measures, the BILTS measure uniquely offers bi-invariance, boundedness, and third-order shape identity. Aimed at practical implementations, we devised a discretized and regularized version of the BILTS measure which shows exceptional robustness to singularities. This is demonstrated through rigorous recognition experiments using multiple datasets. On average, BILTS attained the highest recognition ratio and least sensitivity to contextual variations compared to other invariant object motion similarity measures. We believe that the BILTS measure is a valuable tool for recognizing motions performed in diverse contexts and has potential in other applications, including the recognition, segmentation, and adaptation of both motion and force trajectories.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted as a regular research paper for consideration in the Journal of Intelligent & Robotic Systems.

We utilised a U-Net-based feature extractor, via its latent vector representation, to capture scene representations and a graph-aware transformer encoder for capturing social interactions. These components are integrated to learn an agent-scene aware embedding, enabling the model to learn spatial dynamics and forecast the future trajectory of pedestrians. The model is designed to produce both deterministic and stochastic outcomes, with the stochastic predictions being generated by incorporating a Conditional Variational Auto-Encoder (CVAE). ASTRA also proposes a simple yet effective weighted penalty loss function, which helps to yield predictions that outperform a wide array of state-of-the-art deterministic and generative models. ASTRA demonstrates an average improvement of 27%/10% in deterministic/stochastic settings on the ETH-UCY dataset, and 26% improvement on the PIE dataset, respectively, along with seven times fewer parameters than the existing state-of-the-art model (see Figure 1). Additionally, the model's versatility allows it to generalize across different perspectives, such as Bird's Eye View (BEV) and Ego-Vehicle View (EVV).</p></details> |  |
| **[Real-Time Generation of Near-Minimum-Energy Trajectories via Constraint-Informed Residual Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09450v1)** | 2025-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Industrial robotics demands significant energy to operate, making energy-reduction methodologies increasingly important. Strategies for planning minimum-energy trajectories typically involve solving nonlinear optimal control problems (OCPs), which rarely cope with real-time requirements. In this paper, we propose a paradigm for generating near minimum-energy trajectories for manipulators by learning from optimal solutions. Our paradigm leverages a residual learning approach, which embeds boundary conditions while focusing on learning only the adjustments needed to steer a standard solution to an optimal one. Compared to a computationally expensive OCP-based planner, our paradigm achieves 87.3% of the performance near the training dataset and 50.8% far from the dataset, while being two to three orders of magnitude faster.</p></details> |  |

The paper investigates the dynamical properties of the closed-loop systems, with a focus on characterizing undesirable behaviors that may emerge due to the use of CBF-based filters. These undesirable behaviors include unbounded trajectories, limit cycles, and undesired equilibria, which can be locally stable and even form a continuum. Our analysis offer the following contributions: (i) conditions under which trajectories remain bounded and (ii) conditions under which limit cycles do not exist; (iii) we show that undesired equilibria can be characterized by solving an algebraic equation, and (iv) we provide examples that show that asymptotically stable undesired equilibria can exist for a large class of nominal controllers and design parameters of the safety filter (even for convex safe sets). Further, for the specific class of planar systems, (v) we provide explicit formulas for the total number of undesired equilibria and the proportion of saddle points and asymptotically stable equilibria, and (vi) in the case of linear planar systems, we present an exhaustive analysis of their global stability properties. Examples throughout the paper illustrate the results.</p></details> |  |

The framework leverages the concept of regularity for set-valued output maps. Specifically, we demonstrate that, for output-regular maps, one can utilize a set-valued observability measure that is concave with respect to finite-horizon state trajectories. By maximizing this measure, optimized estimation-aware trajectories can be designed for a broad class of systems, including those with locally linearized dynamics. To illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, we provide a representative example in the context of trajectory planning for vision-based estimation. We present an estimation-aware trajectory for an uncooperative target-tracking problem that uses a machine learning (ML)-based estimation module on an ego-satellite.</p></details> | 25 pages, 5 figures |

The ineffectiveness comes from the conflict between the fact of asymmetric and multi-modal distribution of likely outcomes and symmetric and single-modal original distribution and supervision losses. Instead, we propose constructing a mixed Gaussian prior for a normalizing flow model for trajectory prediction. The prior is constructed by analyzing the trajectory patterns in the training samples without requiring extra annotations while showing better expressiveness and being multi-modal and asymmetric. Besides diversity, it also provides better controllability for probabilistic trajectory generation. We name our method Mixed Gaussian Flow (MGF).

Current video-based hand pose reconstruction methods primarily focus on improving frame-wise 3D pose using adjacent frames rather than studying consistent 4D hand trajectories in space. Despite the additional temporal cues, they generally underperform compared to image-based methods due to the scarcity of annotated video data. To address these issues, we repurpose a state-of-the-art image-based transformer to take in multiple frames and directly predict a coherent trajectory. We introduce two types of lightweight attention layers: cross-view self-attention to fuse temporal information, and global cross-attention to bring in larger spatial context. Our method infers 4D hand trajectories similar to the ground truth while maintaining strong 2D reprojection alignment. We apply the method to both egocentric and allocentric videos. It significantly outperforms existing methods in global trajectory accuracy while being comparable to the state-of-the-art in single-image pose estimation.

| **[Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction Based on Social Interactions Learning With Random Weights](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07711v1)** | 2025-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pedestrian trajectory prediction is a critical technology in the evolution of self-driving cars toward complete artificial intelligence. Over recent years, focusing on the trajectories of pedestrians to model their social interactions has surged with great interest in more accurate trajectory predictions. However, existing methods for modeling pedestrian social interactions rely on pre-defined rules, struggling to capture non-explicit social interactions. In this work, we propose a novel framework named DTGAN, which extends the application of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to graph sequence data, with the primary objective of automatically capturing implicit social interactions and achieving precise predictions of pedestrian trajectory. DTGAN innovatively incorporates random weights within each graph to eliminate the need for pre-defined interaction rules. We further enhance the performance of DTGAN by exploring diverse task loss functions during adversarial training, which yields improvements of 16.7\% and 39.3\% on metrics ADE and FDE, respectively. The effectiveness and accuracy of our framework are verified on two public datasets. The experimental results show that our proposed DTGAN achieves superior performance and is well able to understand pedestrians' intentions.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages,7 figures,Accepted to IEEE Transactions on Multimedia (TMM)</p></details> |
| **[Computing Safety Margins of Parameterized Nonlinear Systems for Vulnerability Assessment via Trajectory Sensitivities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07498v1)** | 2025-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Physical systems experience nonlinear disturbances which have the potential to disrupt desired behavior. For a particular disturbance, whether or not the system recovers from the disturbance to a desired stable equilibrium point depends on system parameter values, which are typically uncertain and time-varying. Therefore, to quantify proximity to vulnerability we define the safety margin to be the smallest change in parameter values from a nominal value such that the system will no longer be able to recover from the disturbance. Safety margins are valuable but challenging to compute as related methods, such as those for robust region of attraction estimation, are often either overly conservative or computationally intractable for high dimensional systems. Recently, we developed algorithms to compute safety margins efficiently and non-conservatively by exploiting the large sensitivity of the system trajectory near the region of attraction boundary to small perturbations. Although these algorithms have enjoyed empirical success, they lack theoretical guarantees that would ensure their generalizability. This work develops a novel characterization of safety margins in terms of trajectory sensitivities, and uses this to derive well-posedness and convergence guarantees for these algorithms, enabling their generalizability and successful application to a large class of nonlinear systems.</p></details> | 16 pages |

During preliminary mission design, mission parameters are subject to frequent changes, necessitating that trajectory designers efficiently generate high-quality control solutions for these new scenarios. Generative machine learning models can be trained to learn how the solution structure varies with respect to a conditional parameter, thereby accelerating the global search for missions with updated parameters. In this work, state-of-the-art diffusion models are integrated with the indirect approach for trajectory optimization within a global search framework. This framework is tested on two low-thrust transfers of different complexity in the circular restricted three-body problem. By generating and analyzing a training data set, we develop mathematical relations and techniques to understand the complex structures in the costate domain of locally optimal solutions for these problems. A diffusion model is trained on this data and successfully accelerates the global search for both problems. The model predicts how the costate solution structure changes, based on the maximum spacecraft thrust magnitude. Warm-starting a numerical solver with diffusion model samples for the costates at the initial time increases the number of solutions generated per minute for problems with unseen thrust magnitudes by one to two orders of magnitude in comparison to samples from a uniform distribution and from an adjoint control transformation.</p></details> |  |

However, optimal controllers are highly sensitive to model mismatch, which can occur due to loaded equipment, packages to be delivered, or pre-existing variability in fundamental structural and thrust-related parameters. To circumvent this problem, optimal controllers can be paired with parameter estimators to improve their trajectory planning performance and perform adaptive control. However, UAV platforms are limited in terms of onboard processing power, oftentimes making nonlinear parameter estimation too computationally expensive to consider. To address these issues, we propose a relaxed, affine-in-parameters multirotor model along with an efficient optimal parameter estimator. We convexify the nominal Moving Horizon Parameter Estimation (MHPE) problem into a linear-quadratic form (LQ-MHPE) via an affine-in-parameter relaxation on the nonlinear dynamics, resulting in fast quadratic programs (QPs) that facilitate adaptive Model Predictve Control (MPC) in real time. We compare this approach to the equivalent nonlinear estimator in Monte Carlo simulations, demonstrating a decrease in average solve time and trajectory optimality cost by 98.2% and 23.9-56.2%, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures, to be published in IEEE Sustech 2025</p></details> |

| **[Pitch Plane Trajectory Tracking Control for Sounding Rockets via Adaptive Feedback Linearization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05285v1)** | 2025-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes a pitch plane trajectory tacking control solution for suborbital launch vehicles relying on adaptive feedback linearization. Initially, the 2D dynamics and kinematics for a single-engine, thrust-vector-controlled sounding rocket are obtained for control design purposes. Then, an inner-outer control strategy, which simultaneously tackles attitude and position control, is adopted, with the inner-loop comprising the altitude and pitch control and the outer-loop addressing the horizontal (downrange) position control. Feedback linearization is used to cancel out the non-linearities in both the inner and outer dynamics. Making use of Lyapunov stability theory, an adaptation law, which provides online estimates on the inner-loop aerodynamic uncertainty, is jointly designed with the output tracking controller via adaptive backstepping, ensuring global reference tracking in the region where the feedback linearization is well-defined. The zero dynamics of the inner-stabilized system are then exploited to obtain the outerloop dynamics and derive a Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) with integral action, which can stabilize them as well as reject external disturbances. In the outermost loop, the estimate on the correspondent aerodynamic uncertainty is indirectly obtained by using the inner loop estimates together with known aerodynamics relations. The resulting inner-outer position control solution is proven to be asymptotically stable in the region of interest. Using a single-stage sounding rocket, propelled by a liquid engine, as reference vehicle, different mission scenarios are tested in a simulation environment to verify the adaptability of the proposed control strategy. The system is able to track the requested trajectories while rejecting external wind disturbances. Furthermore, the need to re-tune the control gains in between different mission scenarios is minimal to none.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper accepted to the IEEE Aerospace Conference 2025.

| **[Towards Generalizable Trajectory Prediction Using Dual-Level Representation Learning And Adaptive Prompting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04815v1)** | 2025-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing vehicle trajectory prediction models struggle with generalizability, prediction uncertainties, and handling complex interactions. It is often due to limitations like complex architectures customized for a specific dataset and inefficient multimodal handling. We propose Perceiver with Register queries (PerReg+), a novel trajectory prediction framework that introduces: (1) Dual-Level Representation Learning via Self-Distillation (SD) and Masked Reconstruction (MR), capturing global context and fine-grained details. Additionally, our approach of reconstructing segmentlevel trajectories and lane segments from masked inputs with query drop, enables effective use of contextual information and improves generalization; (2) Enhanced Multimodality using register-based queries and pretraining, eliminating the need for clustering and suppression; and (3) Adaptive Prompt Tuning during fine-tuning, freezing the main architecture and optimizing a small number of prompts for efficient adaptation. PerReg+ sets a new state-of-the-art performance on nuScenes [1], Argoverse 2 [2], and Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD) [3]. Remarkable, our pretrained model reduces the error by 6.8% on smaller datasets, and multi-dataset training enhances generalization. In cross-domain tests, PerReg+ reduces B-FDE by 11.8% compared to its non-pretrained variant.</p></details> |  |

| **[Motion Manifold Flow Primitives for Task-Conditioned Trajectory Generation under Complex Task-Motion Dependencies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19681v3)** | 2025-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Effective movement primitives should be capable of encoding and generating a rich repertoire of trajectories -- typically collected from human demonstrations -- conditioned on task-defining parameters such as vision or language inputs. While recent methods based on the motion manifold hypothesis, which assumes that a set of trajectories lies on a lower-dimensional nonlinear subspace, address challenges such as limited dataset size and the high dimensionality of trajectory data, they often struggle to capture complex task-motion dependencies, i.e., when motion distributions shift drastically with task variations. To address this, we introduce Motion Manifold Flow Primitives (MMFP), a framework that decouples the training of the motion manifold from task-conditioned distributions. Specifically, we employ flow matching models, state-of-the-art conditional deep generative models, to learn task-conditioned distributions in the latent coordinate space of the learned motion manifold. Experiments are conducted on language-guided trajectory generation tasks, where many-to-many text-motion correspondences introduce complex task-motion dependencies, highlighting MMFP's superiority over existing methods.</p></details> | 8 pages, 11 figures |

In this task, the model is required to make predictions based on natural language instructions, egocentric view images before manipulation, and the given end-effector trajectories. Conventional methods typically perform success prediction only after the manipulation is executed, limiting their efficiency in executing the entire task sequence. We propose a novel approach that enables the prediction of success or failure by aligning the given trajectories and images with natural language instructions. We introduce Trajectory Encoder to apply learnable weighting to the input trajectories, allowing the model to consider temporal dynamics and interactions between objects and the end effector, improving the model's ability to predict manipulation outcomes accurately. We constructed a dataset based on the RT-1 dataset, a large-scale benchmark for open-vocabulary object manipulation tasks, to evaluate our method. The experimental results show that our method achieved a higher prediction accuracy than baseline approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for presentation at LangRob @ CoRL 2024</p></details> |
| **[Frenet-Serret-Based Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04273v1)** | 2025-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction is a crucial element of guidance, navigation, and control systems. This paper presents two novel trajectory-prediction methods based on real-time position measurements and adaptive input and state estimation (AISE). The first method, called AISE/va, uses position measurements to estimate the target velocity and acceleration. The second method, called AISE/FS, models the target trajectory as a 3D curve using the Frenet-Serret formulas, which require estimates of velocity, acceleration, and jerk. To estimate velocity, acceleration, and jerk in real time, AISE computes first, second, and third derivatives of the position measurements. AISE does not rely on assumptions about the target maneuver, measurement noise, or disturbances. For trajectory prediction, both methods use measurements of the target position and estimates of its derivatives to extrapolate from the current position. The performance of AISE/va and AISE/FS is compared numerically with the $\alpha$-$\beta$-$\gamma$ filter, which shows that AISE/FS provides more accurate trajectory prediction than AISE/va and traditional methods, especially for complex target maneuvers.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures.

However, predictive modeling of such data remains challenging due to high dimensionality, irregular sampling, and data sparsity. To address these issues, we propose ImageFlowNet, a novel model designed to forecast disease trajectories from initial images while preserving spatial details. ImageFlowNet first learns multiscale joint representation spaces across patients and time points, then optimizes deterministic or stochastic flow fields within these spaces using a position-parameterized neural ODE/SDE framework. The model leverages a UNet architecture to create robust multiscale representations and mitigates data scarcity by combining knowledge from all patients. We provide theoretical insights that support our formulation of ODEs, and motivate our regularizations involving high-level visual features, latent space organization, and trajectory smoothness. We validate ImageFlowNet on three longitudinal medical image datasets depicting progression in geographic atrophy, multiple sclerosis, and glioblastoma, demonstrating its ability to effectively forecast disease progression and outperform existing methods. Our contributions include the development of ImageFlowNet, its theoretical underpinnings, and empirical validation on real-world datasets.

These forecasts allow us to anticipate events that lead to collisions and, therefore, to mitigate them. Deep Neural Networks have excelled in motion forecasting, but overconfidence and weak uncertainty quantification persist. Deep Ensembles address these concerns, yet applying them to multimodal distributions remains challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel approach named Hierarchical Light Transformer Ensembles (HLT-Ens) aimed at efficiently training an ensemble of Transformer architectures using a novel hierarchical loss function. HLT-Ens leverages grouped fully connected layers, inspired by grouped convolution techniques, to capture multimodal distributions effectively. We demonstrate that HLT-Ens achieves state-of-the-art performance levels through extensive experimentation, offering a promising avenue for improving trajectory forecasting techniques.</p></details> | WACV 2025 |
| **[Hybrid Machine Learning Model with a Constrained Action Space for Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03666v1)** | 2025-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction is crucial to advance autonomous driving, improving safety, and efficiency. Although end-to-end models based on deep learning have great potential, they often do not consider vehicle dynamic limitations, leading to unrealistic predictions. To address this problem, this work introduces a novel hybrid model that combines deep learning with a kinematic motion model. It is able to predict object attributes such as acceleration and yaw rate and generate trajectories based on them. A key contribution is the incorporation of expert knowledge into the learning objective of the deep learning model. This results in the constraint of the available action space, thus enabling the prediction of physically feasible object attributes and trajectories, thereby increasing safety and robustness. The proposed hybrid model facilitates enhanced interpretability, thereby reinforcing the trustworthiness of deep learning methods and promoting the development of safe planning solutions. Experiments conducted on the publicly available real-world Argoverse dataset demonstrate realistic driving behaviour, with benchmark comparisons and ablation studies showing promising results.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to 2025 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV)</p></details> |
| **[Collision Risk Quantification and Conflict Resolution in Trajectory Tracking for Acceleration-Actuated Multi-Robot Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03585v1)** | 2025-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One of the pivotal challenges in a multi-robot system is how to give attention to accuracy and efficiency while ensuring safety. Prior arts cannot strictly guarantee collision-free for an arbitrarily large number of robots or the results are considerably conservative. Smoothness of the avoidance trajectory also needs to be further optimized. This paper proposes an accelerationactuated simultaneous obstacle avoidance and trajectory tracking method for arbitrarily large teams of robots, that provides a nonconservative collision avoidance strategy and gives approaches for deadlock avoidance. We propose two ways of deadlock resolution, one involves incorporating an auxiliary velocity vector into the error function of the trajectory tracking module, which is proven to have no influence on global convergence of the tracking error. Furthermore, unlike the traditional methods that they address conflicts after a deadlock occurs, our decision-making mechanism avoids the near-zero velocity, which is much more safer and efficient in crowed environments. Extensive comparison show that the proposed method is superior to the existing studies when deployed in a large-scale robot system, with minimal invasiveness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Modeling Cell Type Developmental Trajectory using Multinomial Unbalanced Optimal Transport](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03501v1)** | 2025-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Single-cell trajectory analysis aims to reconstruct the biological developmental processes of cells as they evolve over time, leveraging temporal correlations in gene expression. During cellular development, gene expression patterns typically change and vary across different cell types. A significant challenge in this analysis is that RNA sequencing destroys the cell, making it impossible to track gene expression across multiple stages for the same cell. Recent advances have introduced the use of optimal transport tools to model the trajectory of individual cells. In this paper, our focus shifts to a question of greater practical importance: we examine the differentiation of cell types over time. Specifically, we propose a novel method based on discrete unbalanced optimal transport to model the developmental trajectory of cell types. Our method detects biological changes in cell types and infers their transitions to different states by analyzing the transport matrix. We validated our method using single-cell RNA sequencing data from mouse embryonic fibroblasts. The results accurately identified major developmental changes in cell types, which were corroborated by experimental evidence. Furthermore, the inferred transition probabilities between cell types are highly congruent to biological ground truth.</p></details> |  |

Conventional multidisciplinary analysis and optimization (MDAO) can be expensive, while surrogate-based optimization can struggle with challenging physical constraints. This work proposes physics-constrained generative adversarial networks (physicsGAN), to intelligently parameterize the takeoff control profiles of an eVTOL aircraft and to transform the original design space to a feasible space. Specifically, the transformed feasible space refers to a space where all designs directly satisfy all design constraints. The physicsGAN-enabled surrogate-based takeoff trajectory design framework was demonstrated on the Airbus A3 Vahana. The physicsGAN generated only feasible control profiles of power and wing angle in the feasible space with around 98.9% of designs satisfying all constraints. The proposed design framework obtained 99.6% accuracy compared with simulation-based optimal design and took only 2.2 seconds, which reduced the computational time by around 200 times. Meanwhile, data-driven GAN-enabled surrogate-based optimization took 21.9 seconds using a derivative-free optimizer, which was around an order of magnitude slower than the proposed framework. Moreover, the data-driven GAN-based optimization using gradient-based optimizers could not consistently find the optimal design during random trials and got stuck in an infeasible region, which is problematic in real practice. Therefore, the proposed physicsGAN-based design framework outperformed data-driven GAN-based design to the extent of efficiency (2.2 seconds), optimality (99.6% accurate), and feasibility (100% feasible). According to the literature review, this is the first physics-constrained generative artificial intelligence enabled by surrogate models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Confe...</summary><p>Conference version with 10 pages and 7 figures</p></details> |
| **[Through-The-Mask: Mask-based Motion Trajectories for Image-to-Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03059v1)** | 2025-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the task of Image-to-Video (I2V) generation, which involves transforming static images into realistic video sequences based on a textual description. While recent advancements produce photorealistic outputs, they frequently struggle to create videos with accurate and consistent object motion, especially in multi-object scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose a two-stage compositional framework that decomposes I2V generation into: (i) An explicit intermediate representation generation stage, followed by (ii) A video generation stage that is conditioned on this representation. Our key innovation is the introduction of a mask-based motion trajectory as an intermediate representation, that captures both semantic object information and motion, enabling an expressive but compact representation of motion and semantics. To incorporate the learned representation in the second stage, we utilize object-level attention objectives. Specifically, we consider a spatial, per-object, masked-cross attention objective, integrating object-specific prompts into corresponding latent space regions and a masked spatio-temporal self-attention objective, ensuring frame-to-frame consistency for each object. We evaluate our method on challenging benchmarks with multi-object and high-motion scenarios and empirically demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results in temporal coherence, motion realism, and text-prompt faithfulness. Additionally, we introduce \benchmark, a new challenging benchmark for single-object and multi-object I2V generation, and demonstrate our method's superiority on this benchmark.

| **[Generating Counterfactual Trajectories with Latent Diffusion Models for Concept Discovery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10356v2)** | 2025-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trustworthiness is a major prerequisite for the safe application of opaque deep learning models in high-stakes domains like medicine. Understanding the decision-making process not only contributes to fostering trust but might also reveal previously unknown decision criteria of complex models that could advance the state of medical research. The discovery of decision-relevant concepts from black box models is a particularly challenging task. This study proposes Concept Discovery through Latent Diffusion-based Counterfactual Trajectories (CDCT), a novel three-step framework for concept discovery leveraging the superior image synthesis capabilities of diffusion models. In the first step, CDCT uses a Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) to generate a counterfactual trajectory dataset. This dataset is used to derive a disentangled representation of classification-relevant concepts using a Variational Autoencoder (VAE). Finally, a search algorithm is applied to identify relevant concepts in the disentangled latent space. The application of CDCT to a classifier trained on the largest public skin lesion dataset revealed not only the presence of several biases but also meaningful biomarkers. Moreover, the counterfactuals generated within CDCT show better FID scores than those produced by a previously established state-of-the-art method, while being 12 times more resource-efficient. Unsupervised concept discovery holds great potential for the application of trustworthy AI and the further development of human knowledge in various domains. CDCT represents a further step in this direction.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR) 2024</p></details> |

While many promising methods have been developed using online corpora and captioned photographs, their application to scientific domains, where data encodes highly specialized knowledge, remains in its early stages. We present a self-supervised masked modeling framework for 3D particle trajectory analysis in Time Projection Chambers (TPCs). These detectors produce globally sparse (<1% occupancy) but locally dense point clouds, capturing meter-scale particle trajectories at millimeter resolution. Starting with PointMAE, this work proposes volumetric tokenization to group sparse ionization points into resolution-agnostic patches, as well as an auxiliary energy infilling task to improve trajectory semantics. This approach -- which we call Point-based Liquid Argon Masked Autoencoder (PoLAr-MAE) -- achieves 99.4% track and 97.7% shower classification F-scores, matching that of supervised baselines without any labeled data. While the model learns rich particle trajectory representations, it struggles with sub-token phenomena like overlapping or short-lived particle trajectories. To support further research, we release PILArNet-M -- the largest open LArTPC dataset (1M+ events, 5.2B labeled points) -- to advance SSL in high energy physics (HEP).

However, the majority of existing trajectory prediction models have neither considered reducing the uncertainty as one objective during the training stage nor provided reliable uncertainty quantification during inference stage under potential distribution shift. Therefore, in this paper, we propose the Conformal Uncertainty Quantification under Distribution Shift framework, CUQDS, to quantify the uncertainty of the predicted trajectories of existing trajectory prediction models under potential data distribution shift, while considering improving the prediction accuracy of the models and reducing the estimated uncertainty during the training stage. Specifically, CUQDS includes 1) a learning-based Gaussian process regression module that models the output distribution of the base model (any existing trajectory prediction or time series forecasting neural networks) and reduces the estimated uncertainty by additional loss term, and 2) a statistical-based Conformal P control module to calibrate the estimated uncertainty from the Gaussian process regression module in an online setting under potential distribution shift between training and testing data.</p></details> | 9 pages, 2 figures |
| **[Trajectory Flow Matching with Applications to Clinical Time Series Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21154v2)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modeling stochastic and irregularly sampled time series is a challenging problem found in a wide range of applications, especially in medicine. Neural stochastic differential equations (Neural SDEs) are an attractive modeling technique for this problem, which parameterize the drift and diffusion terms of an SDE with neural networks. However, current algorithms for training Neural SDEs require backpropagation through the SDE dynamics, greatly limiting their scalability and stability. To address this, we propose Trajectory Flow Matching (TFM), which trains a Neural SDE in a simulation-free manner, bypassing backpropagation through the dynamics. TFM leverages the flow matching technique from generative modeling to model time series. In this work we first establish necessary conditions for TFM to learn time series data. Next, we present a reparameterization trick which improves training stability. Finally, we adapt TFM to the clinical time series setting, demonstrating improved performance on three clinical time series datasets both in terms of absolute performance and uncertainty prediction.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2024 Spotlight</p></details> |
| **[Unified Spatial-Temporal Edge-Enhanced Graph Networks for Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02504v1)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pedestrian trajectory prediction aims to forecast future movements based on historical paths. Spatial-temporal (ST) methods often separately model spatial interactions among pedestrians and temporal dependencies of individuals. They overlook the direct impacts of interactions among different pedestrians across various time steps (i.e., high-order cross-time interactions). This limits their ability to capture ST inter-dependencies and hinders prediction performance. To address these limitations, we propose UniEdge with three major designs. Firstly, we introduce a unified ST graph data structure that simplifies high-order cross-time interactions into first-order relationships, enabling the learning of ST inter-dependencies in a single step. This avoids the information loss caused by multi-step aggregation. Secondly, traditional GNNs focus on aggregating pedestrian node features, neglecting the propagation of implicit interaction patterns encoded in edge features. We propose the Edge-to-Edge-Node-to-Node Graph Convolution (E2E-N2N-GCN), a novel dual-graph network that jointly models explicit N2N social interactions among pedestrians and implicit E2E influence propagation across these interaction patterns. Finally, to overcome the limited receptive fields and challenges in capturing long-range dependencies of auto-regressive architectures, we introduce a transformer encoder-based predictor that enables global modeling of temporal correlation. UniEdge outperforms state-of-the-arts on multiple datasets, including ETH, UCY, and SDD.</p></details> |  |

Remote assistance concepts, where operators provide discrete inputs to aid specific automation modules like planning, is gaining interest due to its reduced workload on the human remote operator and improved safety. However, these concepts are challenging to implement and maintain due to their deep integration and interaction with the automated driving system. In this paper, we propose a solution to facilitate the implementation of remote assistance concepts that intervene on planning level and extend the operational design domain of the vehicle at runtime. Using arbitration graphs, a modular decision-making framework, we integrate remote assistance into an existing automated driving system without modifying the original software components. Our simulative implementation demonstrates this approach in two use cases, allowing operators to adjust planner constraints and enable trajectory generation beyond nominal operational design domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 8 figures, handed in for possible publication at IEEE IV 2025, video demonstration available at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVSO-YOeGMk</p></details> |
| **[One Diffusion Step to Real-World Super-Resolution via Flow Trajectory Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01993v1)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models (DMs) have significantly advanced the development of real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR), but the computational cost of multi-step diffusion models limits their application. One-step diffusion models generate high-quality images in a one sampling step, greatly reducing computational overhead and inference latency. However, most existing one-step diffusion methods are constrained by the performance of the teacher model, where poor teacher performance results in image artifacts. To address this limitation, we propose FluxSR, a novel one-step diffusion Real-ISR technique based on flow matching models. We use the state-of-the-art diffusion model FLUX.1-dev as both the teacher model and the base model. First, we introduce Flow Trajectory Distillation (FTD) to distill a multi-step flow matching model into a one-step Real-ISR. Second, to improve image realism and address high-frequency artifact issues in generated images, we propose TV-LPIPS as a perceptual loss and introduce Attention Diversification Loss (ADL) as a regularization term to reduce token similarity in transformer, thereby eliminating high-frequency artifacts. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing one-step diffusion-based Real-ISR methods. The code and model will be released at https://github.com/JianzeLi-114/FluxSR.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Generalization via Sharpness-Aware Trajectory Matching for Dataset Condensation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01865v1)** | 2025-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dataset condensation aims to synthesize datasets with a few representative samples that can effectively represent the original datasets. This enables efficient training and produces models with performance close to those trained on the original sets. Most existing dataset condensation methods conduct dataset learning under the bilevel (inner- and outer-loop) based optimization. However, the preceding methods perform with limited dataset generalization due to the notoriously complicated loss landscape and expensive time-space complexity of the inner-loop unrolling of bilevel optimization. These issues deteriorate when the datasets are learned via matching the trajectories of networks trained on the real and synthetic datasets with a long horizon inner-loop. To address these issues, we introduce Sharpness-Aware Trajectory Matching (SATM), which enhances the generalization capability of learned synthetic datasets by optimising the sharpness of the loss landscape and objective simultaneously. Moreover, our approach is coupled with an efficient hypergradient approximation that is mathematically well-supported and straightforward to implement along with controllable computational overhead. Empirical evaluations of SATM demonstrate its effectiveness across various applications, including in-domain benchmarks and out-of-domain settings. Moreover, its easy-to-implement properties afford flexibility, allowing it to integrate with other advanced sharpness-aware minimizers. Our code will be released.</p></details> |  |

However, the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) are based on supervised deep learning - which leads to challenges when the distribution of trajectories changes due to such a shock. We provide a neuro-symbolic rule-based framework to conduct error correction and detection of these models to integrate into our movement trajectory platform. We provide a suite of experiments on several recent SOTA models where we show highly accurate error detection, the ability to improve accuracy with a changing test distribution, and accuracy improvement for the base use case in addition to a suite of theoretical properties that informed algorithm development. Specifically, we show an F1 scores for predicting errors of up to 0.984, significant performance increase for out-of distribution accuracy (8.51% improvement over SOTA for zero-shot accuracy), and accuracy improvement over the SOTA model.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we explore pre-training world models for heterogeneous environments by addressing key transfer barriers in both data diversity and model flexibility. We introduce UniTraj, a unified dataset comprising over one million trajectories from 80 environments, designed to scale data while preserving critical diversity. Additionally, we propose TrajWorld, a novel architecture capable of flexibly handling varying sensor and actuator information and capturing environment dynamics in-context.

| **[Trajectory Map-Matching in Urban Road Networks Based on RSS Measurements](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01280v1)** | 2025-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes an RSS-based approach to reconstruct vehicle trajectories within a road network, enforcing signal propagation rules and vehicle mobility constraints to mitigate the impact of RSS noise and sparsity. The key challenge lies in leveraging latent spatiotemporal correlations within RSS data while navigating complex road networks. To address this, we develop a Hidden Markov Model (HMM)-based RSS embedding (HRE) technique that employs alternating optimization to infer vehicle trajectories from RSS measurements. This model captures spatiotemporal dependencies while a road graph ensures network compliance. Additionally, we introduce a maximum speed-constrained rough trajectory estimation (MSR) method to guide the optimization process, enabling rapid convergence to a favorable local solution.</p></details> |  |
| **[Resilient UAV Trajectory Planning via Few-Shot Meta-Offline Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01268v1)** | 2025-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has been a promising essence in future 5G-beyond and 6G systems. Its main advantage lies in its robust model-free decision-making in complex and large-dimension wireless environments. However, most existing RL frameworks rely on online interaction with the environment, which might not be feasible due to safety and cost concerns. Another problem with online RL is the lack of scalability of the designed algorithm with dynamic or new environments. This work proposes a novel, resilient, few-shot meta-offline RL algorithm combining offline RL using conservative Q-learning (CQL) and meta-learning using model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML). The proposed algorithm can train RL models using static offline datasets without any online interaction with the environments. In addition, with the aid of MAML, the proposed model can be scaled up to new unseen environments. We showcase the proposed algorithm for optimizing an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) 's trajectory and scheduling policy to minimize the age-of-information (AoI) and transmission power of limited-power devices. Numerical results show that the proposed few-shot meta-offline RL algorithm converges faster than baseline schemes, such as deep Q-networks and CQL. In addition, it is the only algorithm that can achieve optimal joint AoI and transmission power using an offline dataset with few shots of data points and is resilient to network failures due to unprecedented environmental changes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning to Learn Weight Generation via Trajectory Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01117v1)** | 2025-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion-based algorithms have emerged as promising techniques for weight generation, particularly in scenarios like multi-task learning that require frequent weight updates. However, existing solutions suffer from limited cross-task transferability. In addition, they only utilize optimal weights as training samples, ignoring the value of other weights in the optimization process. To address these issues, we propose Lt-Di, which integrates the diffusion algorithm with meta-learning to generate weights for unseen tasks. Furthermore, we extend the vanilla diffusion algorithm into a trajectory diffusion algorithm to utilize other weights along the optimization trajectory. Trajectory diffusion decomposes the entire diffusion chain into multiple shorter ones, improving training and inference efficiency. We analyze the convergence properties of the weight generation paradigm and improve convergence efficiency without additional time overhead. Our experiments demonstrate Lt-Di's higher accuracy while reducing computational overhead across various tasks, including zero-shot and few-shot learning, multi-domain generalization, and large-scale language model fine-tuning.Our code is released at https://github.com/tuantuange/Lt-Di.</p></details> |  |
| **[GTG: Generalizable Trajectory Generation Model for Urban Mobility](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01107v1)** | 2025-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory data mining is crucial for smart city management. However, collecting large-scale trajectory datasets is challenging due to factors such as commercial conflicts and privacy regulations. Therefore, we urgently need trajectory generation techniques to address this issue. Existing trajectory generation methods rely on the global road network structure of cities. When the road network structure changes, these methods are often not transferable to other cities. In fact, there exist invariant mobility patterns between different cities: 1) People prefer paths with the minimal travel cost; 2) The travel cost of roads has an invariant relationship with the topological features of the road network. Based on the above insight, this paper proposes a Generalizable Trajectory Generation model (GTG). The model consists of three parts: 1) Extracting city-invariant road representation based on Space Syntax method; 2) Cross-city travel cost prediction through disentangled adversarial training; 3) Travel preference learning by shortest path search and preference update. By learning invariant movement patterns, the model is capable of generating trajectories in new cities. Experiments on three datasets demonstrates that our model significantly outperforms existing models in terms of generalization ability.</p></details> | 12 pages, 5 figures |

We provide non-asymptotic high-probability upper bounds for matrices $A,C$, the Kalman filter gain $K$, and the closed loop matrix $A-KC $, based on multiple sample trajectories, and further give the first non-asymptotic high-probability upper bounds for the system poles, which cover both (marginally) stable systems and unstable systems. We show that, with high probability, the non-asymptotic estimation errors of these matrices decay at a rate of at least $ \mathcal{O}(\sqrt{1/N}) $, while the estimation error of the system poles decays at a rate of at least $ \mathcal{O}(N^{\frac{1}{2n}}) $, where $ N $ represents the number of sample trajectories. Furthermore, we prove that SIMs become ill-conditioned when the ratio $n/m$ is large, regardless of the system parameters. Numerical experiments are conducted to validate the non-asymptotic results and the ill-conditionedness of SIM.</p></details> | 23 pages, 7 figures |

However, it is challenging to obtain sufficiently accurate representations of the environmental dynamics due to uncertainties in complex systems and environments. An inaccurate environment model may degrade the sample efficiency and performance of model-based RL. Furthermore, while model-based RL can improve sample efficiency, it often still requires substantial training time to learn from scratch, potentially limiting its advantages over model-free approaches. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a knowledge-informed model-based residual reinforcement learning framework aimed at enhancing learning efficiency by infusing established expert knowledge into the learning process and avoiding the issue of beginning from zero. Our approach integrates traffic expert knowledge into a virtual environment model, employing the Intelligent Driver Model (IDM) for basic dynamics and neural networks for residual dynamics, thus ensuring adaptability to complex scenarios. We propose a novel strategy that combines traditional control methods with residual RL, facilitating efficient learning and policy optimization without the need to learn from scratch. The proposed approach is applied to CAV trajectory control tasks for the dissipation of stop-and-go waves in mixed traffic flow. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed approach enables the CAV agent to achieve superior performance in trajectory control compared to the baseline agents in terms of sample efficiency, traffic flow smoothness and traffic mobility.

We present a real-time communication-free distributed algorithm for navigating robots to their desired goals certified by control barrier functions, that model and control the onboard sensing behavior to keep neighbors in the limited field of view for position estimation. The approach is robust to temporary tracking loss and directly synthesizes control in real time to stabilize visual contact through control Lyapunov-barrier functions. The main contributions of this paper are a continuous-time robust trajectory generation and control method certified by control barrier functions for distributed multi-robot systems and a discrete optimization procedure, namely, MPC-CBF, to approximate the certified controller. In addition, we propose a linear surrogate of high-order control barrier function constraints and use sequential quadratic programming to solve MPC-CBF efficiently. We demonstrate results in simulation with 10 robots and physical experiments with 2 custom-built UAVs. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first of its kind to generate a robust continuous-time trajectory and controller concurrently, certified by control barrier functions utilizing piecewise splines.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 10 figures, submitted to RSS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Enhancing Offline Reinforcement Learning with Curriculum Learning-Based Trajectory Valuation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00601v1)** | 2025-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The success of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) relies on the availability and quality of training data, often requiring extensive interactions with specific environments. In many real-world scenarios, where data collection is costly and risky, offline reinforcement learning (RL) offers a solution by utilizing data collected by domain experts and searching for a batch-constrained optimal policy. This approach is further augmented by incorporating external data sources, expanding the range and diversity of data collection possibilities. However, existing offline RL methods often struggle with challenges posed by non-matching data from these external sources. In this work, we specifically address the problem of source-target domain mismatch in scenarios involving mixed datasets, characterized by a predominance of source data generated from random or suboptimal policies and a limited amount of target data generated from higher-quality policies. To tackle this problem, we introduce Transition Scoring (TS), a novel method that assigns scores to transitions based on their similarity to the target domain, and propose Curriculum Learning-Based Trajectory Valuation (CLTV), which effectively leverages these transition scores to identify and prioritize high-quality trajectories through a curriculum learning approach. Our extensive experiments across various offline RL methods and MuJoCo environments, complemented by rigorous theoretical analysis, demonstrate that CLTV enhances the overall performance and transferability of policies learned by offline RL algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at AAMAS 2025</p></details> |

In this paper, we present a fast and efficient real-time trajectory planning and control approach for fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicles, leveraging the differential flatness property of fixed-wing aircraft in coordinated flight conditions to generate dynamically feasible trajectories. The approach provides the ability to continuously replan trajectories, which we show is useful to dynamically account for the curvature constraint as the aircraft advances along its path.

Existing cross-domain policy transfer methods mostly aim at learning domain correspondences or corrections to facilitate policy learning, such as learning task/domain-specific discriminators, representations, or policies. This design philosophy often results in heavy model architectures or task/domain-specific modeling, lacking flexibility. This reality makes us wonder: can we directly bridge the domain gaps universally at the data level, instead of relying on complex downstream cross-domain policy transfer procedures? In this study, we propose the Cross-Domain Trajectory EDiting (xTED) framework that employs a specially designed diffusion model for cross-domain trajectory adaptation. Our proposed model architecture effectively captures the intricate dependencies among states, actions, and rewards, as well as the dynamics patterns within target data. Edited by adding noises and denoising with the pre-trained diffusion model, source domain trajectories can be transformed to align with target domain properties while preserving original semantic information. This process effectively corrects underlying domain gaps, enhancing state realism and dynamics reliability in source data, and allowing flexible integration with various single-domain and cross-domain downstream policy learning methods. Despite its simplicity, xTED demonstrates superior performance in extensive simulation and real-robot experiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>xTED ...</summary><p>xTED offers a novel, generic, flexible, simple and effective paradigm that casts cross-domain policy adaptation as a data pre-processing problem</p></details> |
| **[K Nearest Neighbor-Guided Trajectory Similarity Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00285v1)** | 2025-02-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory similarity is fundamental to many spatio-temporal data mining applications. Recent studies propose deep learning models to approximate conventional trajectory similarity measures, exploiting their fast inference time once trained. Although efficient inference has been reported, challenges remain in similarity approximation accuracy due to difficulties in trajectory granularity modeling and in exploiting similarity signals in the training data. To fill this gap, we propose TSMini, a highly effective trajectory similarity model with a sub-view modeling mechanism capable of learning multi-granularity trajectory patterns and a k nearest neighbor-based loss that guides TSMini to learn not only absolute similarity values between trajectories but also their relative similarity ranks. Together, these two innovations enable highly accurate trajectory similarity approximation. Experiments show that TSMini can outperform the state-of-the-art models by 22% in accuracy on average when learning trajectory similarity measures.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory Optimization Under Stochastic Dynamics Leveraging Maximum Mean Discrepancy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19045v1)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper addresses sampling-based trajectory optimization for risk-aware navigation under stochastic dynamics. Typically such approaches operate by computing $\tilde{N}$ perturbed rollouts around the nominal dynamics to estimate the collision risk associated with a sequence of control commands. We consider a setting where it is expensive to estimate risk using perturbed rollouts, for example, due to expensive collision-checks. We put forward two key contributions. First, we develop an algorithm that distills the statistical information from a larger set of rollouts to a reduced-set with sample size $N<<\tilde{N}$. Consequently, we estimate collision risk using just $N$ rollouts instead of $\tilde{N}$. Second, we formulate a novel surrogate for the collision risk that can leverage the distilled statistical information contained in the reduced-set. We formalize both algorithmic contributions using distribution embedding in Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) and Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD). We perform extensive benchmarking to demonstrate that our MMD-based approach leads to safer trajectories at low sample regime than existing baselines using Conditional Value-at Risk (CVaR) based collision risk estimate.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://github.com/Basant1861/MPC-MMD</p></details> |
| **[Best Policy Learning from Trajectory Preference Feedback](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18873v1)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We address the problem of best policy identification in preference-based reinforcement learning (PbRL), where learning occurs from noisy binary preferences over trajectory pairs rather than explicit numerical rewards. This approach is useful for post-training optimization of generative AI models during multi-turn user interactions, where preference feedback is more robust than handcrafted reward models. In this setting, learning is driven by both an offline preference dataset -- collected from a rater of unknown 'competence' -- and online data collected with pure exploration. Since offline datasets may exhibit out-of-distribution (OOD) biases, principled online data collection is necessary. To address this, we propose Posterior Sampling for Preference Learning ($\mathsf{PSPL}$), a novel algorithm inspired by Top-Two Thompson Sampling, that maintains independent posteriors over the true reward model and transition dynamics. We provide the first theoretical guarantees for PbRL in this setting, establishing an upper bound on the simple Bayesian regret of $\mathsf{PSPL}$. Since the exact algorithm can be computationally impractical, we also provide an approximate version that outperforms existing baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can Optimization Trajectories Explain Multi-Task Transfer?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14677v2)** | 2025-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the widespread adoption of multi-task training in deep learning, little is understood about how multi-task learning (MTL) affects generalization. Prior work has conjectured that the negative effects of MTL are due to optimization challenges that arise during training, and many optimization methods have been proposed to improve multi-task performance. However, recent work has shown that these methods fail to consistently improve multi-task generalization. In this work, we seek to improve our understanding of these failures by empirically studying how MTL impacts the optimization of tasks, and whether this impact can explain the effects of MTL on generalization. We show that MTL results in a generalization gap (a gap in generalization at comparable training loss) between single-task and multi-task trajectories early into training. However, we find that factors of the optimization trajectory previously proposed to explain generalization gaps in single-task settings cannot explain the generalization gaps between single-task and multi-task models. Moreover, we show that the amount of gradient conflict between tasks is correlated with negative effects to task optimization, but is not predictive of generalization. Our work sheds light on the underlying causes for failures in MTL and, importantly, raises questions about the role of general purpose multi-task optimization algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages; Published in TMLR</p></details> |

During the flight phases, where the ground reaction forces are not available for regulation, the limb swinging trajectories are significant for the stability of the next stance phase. Due to the conservation of angular momentum, improper leg and arm swinging results in highly tilted and unsustainable body configurations at the next stance phase landing. In such cases, the robotic system fails to maintain locomotion independent of the stability of the center of mass trajectories. This problem is more apparent for fast and high flight time trajectories. This paper proposes a real-time nonlinear limb trajectory optimization problem for humanoid running. The optimization problem is tested on two different humanoid robot models, and the generated trajectories are verified using a running algorithm for both robots in a simulation environment.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted for publication at the IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA), Atlanta 2025. v2: - A Github link to the proposed optimization tool is added. - There are no changes in the method and results</p></details> |

However, the current limiter in the control loops of the GFM IBR poses challenges to the effectiveness of power swing detection functions designed for SG-based systems. Among various current limiting strategies, current saturation algorithms (CSAs), widely employed for their strict current limiting capability, are the focus of this paper. The paper presents a theoretical analysis of the conditions for entering and exiting the current saturation mode of the GFM IBR under three CSAs. Furthermore, the corresponding impedance trajectories observed by the distance relay on the GFM IBR side are investigated. The analysis results reveal that the unique impedance trajectories under these CSAs markedly differ from those associated with SGs. Moreover, it is demonstrated that the conventional power swing detection scheme may lose functionality due to the rapid movement of the trajectory or its failure to pass through the detection zones. Conclusions are validated through simulations in MATLAB/Simulink.</p></details> |  |

Unlike conventional grasping tasks where the object's geometry is assumed simple, we aim to achieve a "dynamic grasp" of the irregular objects, which requires continuous adjustment during the grasping process. To effectively handle irregular objects, we propose a trajectory optimization framework that comprises two phases. Firstly, in a specified time limit of 10s, initial offline trajectories are computed for a seamless motion from an initial configuration of the robot to grasp the object and deliver it to a pre-defined target location. Secondly, fast online trajectory optimization is implemented to update robot trajectories in real-time within 100 ms. This helps to mitigate pose estimation errors from the vision system. To account for model inaccuracies, disturbances, and other non-modeled effects, trajectory tracking controllers for both the robot and the gripper are implemented to execute the optimal trajectories from the proposed framework. The intensive experimental results effectively demonstrate the performance of our trajectory planning framework in both simulation and real-world scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages.

Unlike GPS trackers which emit satellite signals from the animal's location, acoustic receivers are akin to stationary motion sensors that record movements within their detection range. Thus, for periods of time, fish may be far from the receivers, resulting in the absence of observations. The lack of information on the fish's location for extended time periods poses challenges to the understanding of fish movement patterns, and hence, the identification of proper statistical inference frameworks for modeling the trajectories. As the initial step in our methodology, in this paper, we devise and implement a simulation-based imputation strategy that relies on both Markov chain and random-walk principles to enhance our dataset over time. This methodology will be generalizable and applicable to all fish species with similar migration patterns or data with similar structures due to the use of static acoustic receivers.</p></details> |  |

While deep learning methods have shown significant promise, the application of large language models (LLMs) to this domain remains underexplored. This study pioneers the use of LLMs for flight trajectory prediction by reframing it as a language modeling problem. Specifically, We extract features representing the aircraft's position and status from ADS-B flight data to construct a prompt-based dataset, where trajectory waypoints are converted into language tokens. The dataset is then employed to fine-tune LLMs, enabling them to learn complex spatiotemporal patterns for accurate predictions. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that LLMs achieve notable performance improvements in both single-step and multi-step predictions compared to traditional methods, with LLaMA-3.1 model achieving the highest overall accuracy. However, the high inference latency of LLMs poses a challenge for real-time applications, underscoring the need for further research in this promising direction.</p></details> | 9 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Target-driven Self-Distillation for Partial Observed Trajectories Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16767v1)** | 2025-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate prediction of future trajectories of traffic agents is essential for ensuring safe autonomous driving. However, partially observed trajectories can significantly degrade the performance of even state-of-the-art models. Previous approaches often rely on knowledge distillation to transfer features from fully observed trajectories to partially observed ones. This involves firstly training a fully observed model and then using a distillation process to create the final model. While effective, they require multi-stage training, making the training process very expensive. Moreover, knowledge distillation can lead to a performance degradation of the model. In this paper, we introduce a Target-driven Self-Distillation method (TSD) for motion forecasting. Our method leverages predicted accurate targets to guide the model in making predictions under partial observation conditions. By employing self-distillation, the model learns from the feature distributions of both fully observed and partially observed trajectories during a single end-to-end training process. This enhances the model's ability to predict motion accurately in both fully observed and partially observed scenarios. We evaluate our method on multiple datasets and state-of-the-art motion forecasting models. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves significant performance improvements in both settings. To facilitate further research, we will release our code and model checkpoints.</p></details> |  |

This study proposes a framework to assess the feasibility of UAM route integration using probabilistic aircraft trajectory prediction. By leveraging conditional Normalizing Flows, the framework predicts short-term trajectory distributions of conventional aircraft, enabling UAM vehicles to dynamically adjust speeds and maintain safe separations. The methodology was applied to airspace over Seoul metropolitan area, encompassing interactions between UAM and conventional traffic at multiple altitudes and lanes. The results reveal that different physical locations of lanes and routes experience varying interaction patterns and encounter dynamics. For instance, Lane 1 at lower altitudes (1,500 ft and 2,000 ft) exhibited minimal interactions with conventional aircraft, resulting in the largest separations and the most stable delay proportions. In contrast, Lane 4 near the airport experienced more frequent and complex interactions due to its proximity to departing traffic. The limited trajectory data for departing aircraft in this region occasionally led to tighter separations and increased operational challenges. This study underscores the potential of predictive modeling in facilitating UAM integration while highlighting critical trade-offs between safety and efficiency. The findings contribute to refining airspace management strategies and offer insights for scaling UAM operations in complex urban environments.</p></details> | 10 pages, 7 figures |

| **[Improving Out-of-Distribution Generalization of Trajectory Prediction for Autonomous Driving via Polynomial Representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13431v3)** | 2025-01-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robustness against Out-of-Distribution (OoD) samples is a key performance indicator of a trajectory prediction model. However, the development and ranking of state-of-the-art (SotA) models are driven by their In-Distribution (ID) performance on individual competition datasets. We present an OoD testing protocol that homogenizes datasets and prediction tasks across two large-scale motion datasets. We introduce a novel prediction algorithm based on polynomial representations for agent trajectory and road geometry on both the input and output sides of the model. With a much smaller model size, training effort, and inference time, we reach near SotA performance for ID testing and significantly improve robustness in OoD testing. Within our OoD testing protocol, we further study two augmentation strategies of SotA models and their effects on model generalization. Highlighting the contrast between ID and OoD performance, we suggest adding OoD testing to the evaluation criteria of trajectory prediction models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Robust Spacecraft Trajectory Optimization via Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05585v2)** | 2025-01-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Future multi-spacecraft missions require robust autonomous trajectory optimization capabilities to ensure safe and efficient rendezvous operations. This capability hinges on solving non-convex optimal control problems in real-time, although traditional iterative methods such as sequential convex programming impose significant computational challenges. To mitigate this burden, the Autonomous Rendezvous Transformer (ART) introduced a generative model trained to provide near-optimal initial guesses. This approach provides convergence to better local optima (e.g., fuel optimality), improves feasibility rates, and results in faster convergence speed of optimization algorithms through warm-starting. This work extends the capabilities of ART to address robust chance-constrained optimal control problems. Specifically, ART is applied to challenging rendezvous scenarios in Low Earth Orbit (LEO), ensuring fault-tolerant behavior under uncertainty. Through extensive experimentation, the proposed warm-starting strategy is shown to consistently produce high-quality reference trajectories, achieving up to 30\% cost improvement and 50\% reduction in infeasible cases compared to conventional methods, demonstrating robust performance across multiple state representations. Additionally, a post hoc evaluation framework is proposed to assess the quality of generated trajectories and mitigate runtime failures, marking an initial step toward the reliable deployment of AI-driven solutions in safety-critical autonomous systems such as spacecraft.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to the IEEE Aerospace Conference 2025. 13 pages, 10 figures</p></details> |

Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction using Scene Features](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13848v1)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate prediction of pedestrian trajectories is crucial for enhancing the safety of autonomous vehicles and reducing traffic fatalities involving pedestrians. While numerous studies have focused on modeling interactions among pedestrians to forecast their movements, the influence of environmental factors and scene-object placements has been comparatively underexplored. In this paper, we present a novel trajectory prediction model that integrates both pedestrian interactions and environmental context to improve prediction accuracy. Our approach captures spatial and temporal interactions among pedestrians within a sparse graph framework. To account for pedestrian-scene interactions, we employ advanced image enhancement and semantic segmentation techniques to extract detailed scene features. These scene and interaction features are then fused through a cross-attention mechanism, enabling the model to prioritize relevant environmental factors that influence pedestrian movements. Finally, a temporal convolutional network processes the fused features to predict future pedestrian trajectories. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches, achieving ADE and FDE values of 0.252 and 0.372 meters, respectively, underscoring the importance of incorporating both social interactions and environmental context in pedestrian trajectory prediction.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by 2024 International Conference on Intelligent Computing and its Emerging Applications</p></details> |
| **[In-Trajectory Inverse Reinforcement Learning: Learn Incrementally Before An Ongoing Trajectory Terminates](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15612v5)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) aims to learn a reward function and a corresponding policy that best fit the demonstrated trajectories of an expert. However, current IRL works cannot learn incrementally from an ongoing trajectory because they have to wait to collect at least one complete trajectory to learn. To bridge the gap, this paper considers the problem of learning a reward function and a corresponding policy while observing the initial state-action pair of an ongoing trajectory and keeping updating the learned reward and policy when new state-action pairs of the ongoing trajectory are observed. We formulate this problem as an online bi-level optimization problem where the upper level dynamically adjusts the learned reward according to the newly observed state-action pairs with the help of a meta-regularization term, and the lower level learns the corresponding policy. We propose a novel algorithm to solve this problem and guarantee that the algorithm achieves sub-linear local regret $O(\sqrt{T}+\log T+\sqrt{T}\log T)$. If the reward function is linear, we prove that the proposed algorithm achieves sub-linear regret $O(\log T)$. Experiments are used to validate the proposed algorithm.</p></details> |  |

Following this approach, in this work we propose a closed-loop neuromorphic control system for an event-based robotic arm. The proposed system consists of a shifted Winner-Take-All spiking network for interpolating a reference trajectory and a spiking comparator network responsible for controlling the flow continuity of the trajectory, which is fed back to the actual position of the robot. The comparator model is based on a differential position comparison neural network, which governs the execution of the next trajectory points to close the control loop between both components of the system. To evaluate the system, we implemented and deployed the model on a mixed-signal analog-digital neuromorphic platform, the DYNAP-SE2, to facilitate integration and communication with the ED-Scorbot robotic arm platform. Experimental results on one joint of the robot validate the use of this architecture and pave the way for future neuro-inspired control of the entire robot.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 7 figures, conference, ISCAS 2025, accepted for publication, Spiking Neural Network</p></details> |
| **[Knowledge-Informed Multi-Agent Trajectory Prediction at Signalized Intersections for Infrastructure-to-Everything](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13461v1)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-agent trajectory prediction at signalized intersections is crucial for developing efficient intelligent transportation systems and safe autonomous driving systems. Due to the complexity of intersection scenarios and the limitations of single-vehicle perception, the performance of vehicle-centric prediction methods has reached a plateau. Furthermore, most works underutilize critical intersection information, including traffic signals, and behavior patterns induced by road structures. Therefore, we propose a multi-agent trajectory prediction framework at signalized intersections dedicated to Infrastructure-to-Everything (I2XTraj). Our framework leverages dynamic graph attention to integrate knowledge from traffic signals and driving behaviors. A continuous signal-informed mechanism is proposed to adaptively process real-time traffic signals from infrastructure devices. Additionally, leveraging the prior knowledge of the intersection topology, we propose a driving strategy awareness mechanism to model the joint distribution of goal intentions and maneuvers. To the best of our knowledge, I2XTraj represents the first multi-agent trajectory prediction framework explicitly designed for infrastructure deployment, supplying subscribable prediction services to all vehicles at intersections. I2XTraj demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on both the Vehicle-to-Infrastructure dataset V2X-Seq and the aerial-view dataset SinD for signalized intersections. Quantitative evaluations show that our approach outperforms existing methods by more than 30% in both multi-agent and single-agent scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Zero-Shot Trajectory Planning for Signal Temporal Logic Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13457v1)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Signal Temporal Logic (STL) is a powerful specification language for describing complex temporal behaviors of continuous signals, making it well-suited for high-level robotic task descriptions. However, generating executable plans for STL tasks is challenging, as it requires consideration of the coupling between the task specification and the system dynamics. Existing approaches either follow a model-based setting that explicitly requires knowledge of the system dynamics or adopt a task-oriented data-driven approach to learn plans for specific tasks. In this work, we investigate the problem of generating executable STL plans for systems whose dynamics are unknown a priori. We propose a new planning framework that uses only task-agnostic data during the offline training stage, enabling zero-shot generalization to new STL tasks. Our framework is hierarchical, involving: (i) decomposing the STL task into a set of progress and time constraints, (ii) searching for time-aware waypoints guided by task-agnostic data, and (iii) generating trajectories using a pre-trained safe diffusion model. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method indeed in achieving zero-shot generalization to various STL tasks.</p></details> | submitted |
| **[One Fits All: General Mobility Trajectory Modeling via Masked Conditional Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13347v1)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory data play a crucial role in many applications, ranging from network optimization to urban planning. Existing studies on trajectory data are task-specific, and their applicability is limited to the specific tasks on which they have been trained, such as generation, recovery, or prediction. However, the potential of a unified model has not yet been fully explored in trajectory modeling. Although various trajectory tasks differ in inputs, outputs, objectives, and conditions, they share common mobility patterns. Based on these common patterns, we can construct a general framework that enables a single model to address different tasks. However, building a trajectory task-general framework faces two critical challenges: 1) the diversity in the formats of different tasks and 2) the complexity of the conditions imposed on different tasks. In this work, we propose a general trajectory modeling framework via masked conditional diffusion (named GenMove). Specifically, we utilize mask conditions to unify diverse formats. To adapt to complex conditions associated with different tasks, we utilize historical trajectory data to obtain contextual trajectory embeddings, which include rich contexts such as spatiotemporal characteristics and user preferences. Integrating the contextual trajectory embedding into diffusion models through a classifier-free guidance approach allows the model to flexibly adjust its outputs based on different conditions. Extensive experiments on mainstream tasks demonstrate that our model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, with the highest performance improvement exceeding 13% in generation tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Spatio-temporal Graph Network Allowing Incomplete Trajectory Input for Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13973v1)** | 2025-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pedestrian trajectory prediction is important in the research of mobile robot navigation in environments with pedestrians. Most pedestrian trajectory prediction algorithms require the input historical trajectories to be complete. If a pedestrian is unobservable in any frame in the past, then its historical trajectory become incomplete, the algorithm will not predict its future trajectory. To address this limitation, we propose the STGN-IT, a spatio-temporal graph network allowing incomplete trajectory input, which can predict the future trajectories of pedestrians with incomplete historical trajectories. STGN-IT uses the spatio-temporal graph with an additional encoding method to represent the historical trajectories and observation states of pedestrians. Moreover, STGN-IT introduces static obstacles in the environment that may affect the future trajectories as nodes to further improve the prediction accuracy. A clustering algorithm is also applied in the construction of spatio-temporal graphs. Experiments on public datasets show that STGN-IT outperforms state of the art algorithms on these metrics.</p></details> |  |

We apply state feedback linearisation control for the process and propose a simplified implementation of the model control loop which results in a simple model in Brunovsky-form that represents the nominal feedback linearised dynamics of the nonlinear process. To compensate possibly unmatched model uncertainties, we employ Lyapunov redesign with numeric derivatives of the output. It turns out that for a special initialisation of the model, the MFC reduces to a single-loop control design. We illustrate our results by a numerical example.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning segmentation from point trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12392v1)** | 2025-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the problem of segmenting objects in videos based on their motion and no other forms of supervision. Prior work has often approached this problem by using the principle of common fate, namely the fact that the motion of points that belong to the same object is strongly correlated. However, most authors have only considered instantaneous motion from optical flow. In this work, we present a way to train a segmentation network using long-term point trajectories as a supervisory signal to complement optical flow. The key difficulty is that long-term motion, unlike instantaneous motion, is difficult to model -- any parametric approximation is unlikely to capture complex motion patterns over long periods of time. We instead draw inspiration from subspace clustering approaches, proposing a loss function that seeks to group the trajectories into low-rank matrices where the motion of object points can be approximately explained as a linear combination of other point tracks. Our method outperforms the prior art on motion-based segmentation, which shows the utility of long-term motion and the effectiveness of our formulation.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2024 Spotlight.

| **[Algorithm Selection with Probing Trajectories: Benchmarking the Choice of Classifier Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11414v1)** | 2025-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent approaches to training algorithm selectors in the black-box optimisation domain have advocated for the use of training data that is algorithm-centric in order to encapsulate information about how an algorithm performs on an instance, rather than relying on information derived from features of the instance itself. Probing-trajectories that consist of a sequence of objective performance per function evaluation obtained from a short run of an algorithm have recently shown particular promise in training accurate selectors. However, training models on this type of data requires an appropriately chosen classifier given the sequential nature of the data. There are currently no clear guidelines for choosing the most appropriate classifier for algorithm selection using time-series data from the plethora of models available. To address this, we conduct a large benchmark study using 17 different classifiers and three types of trajectory on a classification task using the BBOB benchmark suite using both leave-one-instance out and leave-one-problem out cross-validation. In contrast to previous studies using tabular data, we find that the choice of classifier has a significant impact, showing that feature-based and interval-based models are the best choices.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in Applications of Evolutionary Computation 28th International Conference, EvoApplications 2025</p></details> |

The sound generated by vessels can have various adverse effects on fish and aquatic ecosystems in general. In this setting, the estimation and analysis of the underwater noise produced by vessels is an important challenge for the preservation of the marine environment. In this paper we propose a model for the spatio-temporal characterisation of the underwater noise generated by vessels. The approach is based on the reconstruction of the vessels' trajectories from Automatic Identification System (AIS) data and on their deployment in a spatio-temporal database. Trajectories are enriched with semantic information like the acoustic characteristics of the vessels' engines or the activity performed by the vessels. We define a model for underwater noise propagation and use the trajectories' information to infer how noise propagates in the area of interest. We develop our approach for the case study of the fishery activities in the Northern Adriatic sea, an area of the Mediterranean sea which is well known to be highly exploited. We implement our approach using MobilityDB, an open source geospatial trajectory data management and analysis platform, which offers spatio-temporal operators and indexes improving the efficiency of our system. We use this platform to conduct various analyses of the underwater noise generated in the Northern Adriatic Sea, aiming at estimating the impact of fishing activities on underwater noise pollution and at demonstrating the flexibility and expressiveness of our approach.</p></details> |  |

| **[Audio Array-Based 3D UAV Trajectory Estimation with LiDAR Pseudo-Labeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12698v5)** | 2025-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As small unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) become increasingly prevalent, there is growing concern regarding their impact on public safety and privacy, highlighting the need for advanced tracking and trajectory estimation solutions. In response, this paper introduces a novel framework that utilizes audio array for 3D UAV trajectory estimation. Our approach incorporates a self-supervised learning model, starting with the conversion of audio data into mel-spectrograms, which are analyzed through an encoder to extract crucial temporal and spectral information. Simultaneously, UAV trajectories are estimated using LiDAR point clouds via unsupervised methods. These LiDAR-based estimations act as pseudo labels, enabling the training of an Audio Perception Network without requiring labeled data. In this architecture, the LiDAR-based system operates as the Teacher Network, guiding the Audio Perception Network, which serves as the Student Network. Once trained, the model can independently predict 3D trajectories using only audio signals, with no need for LiDAR data or external ground truth during deployment. To further enhance precision, we apply Gaussian Process modeling for improved spatiotemporal tracking. Our method delivers top-tier performance on the MMAUD dataset, establishing a new benchmark in trajectory estimation using self-supervised learning techniques without reliance on ground truth annotations.</p></details> | Accepted for ICASSP |
| **[Risk-Informed Diffusion Transformer for Long-Tail Trajectory Prediction in the Crash Scenario](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16349v1)** | 2025-01-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction methods have been widely applied in autonomous driving technologies. Although the overall performance accuracy of trajectory prediction is relatively high, the lack of trajectory data in critical scenarios in the training data leads to the long-tail phenomenon. Normally, the trajectories of the tail data are more critical and more difficult to predict and may include rare scenarios such as crashes. To solve this problem, we extracted the trajectory data from real-world crash scenarios, which contain more long-tail data. Meanwhile, based on the trajectory data in this scenario, we integrated graph-based risk information and diffusion with transformer and proposed the Risk-Informed Diffusion Transformer (RI-DiT) trajectory prediction method. Extensive experiments were conducted on trajectory data in the real-world crash scenario, and the results show that the algorithm we proposed has good performance. When predicting the data of the tail 10\% (Top 10\%), the minADE and minFDE indicators are 0.016/2.667 m. At the same time, we showed the trajectory conditions of different long-tail distributions. The distribution of trajectory data is closer to the tail, the less smooth the trajectory is. Through the trajectory data in real-world crash scenarios, Our work expands the methods to overcome the long-tail challenges in trajectory prediction. Our method, RI-DiT, integrates inverse time to collision (ITTC) and the feature of traffic flow, which can predict long-tail trajectories more accurately and improve the safety of autonomous driving systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Three-dimensional Trajectory Optimization for Quadrotor Tail-sitter UAVs: Traversing through Given Waypoints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08347v3)** | 2025-01-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Given the evolving application scenarios of current fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), it is necessary for UAVs to possess agile and rapid 3-dimensional flight capabilities. Typically, the trajectory of a tail-sitter is generated separately for vertical and level flights. This limits the tail-sitter's ability to move in a 3-dimensional airspace and makes it difficult to establish a smooth transition between vertical and level flights. In the present work, a 3-dimensional trajectory optimization method is proposed for quadrotor tail-sitters. Especially, the differential dynamics constraints are eliminated when generating the trajectory of the tail-sitter by utilizing differential flatness method. Additionally, the temporal parameters of the trajectory are generated using the state-of-the-art trajectory generation method called MINCO (minimum control). Subsequently, we convert the speed constraint on the vehicle into a soft constraint by discretizing the trajectory in time. This increases the likelihood that the control input limits are satisfied and the trajectory is feasible. Then, we utilize a kind of model predictive control (MPC) method to track trajectories. Even if restricting the tail-sitter's motion to a 2-dimensional horizontal plane, the solutions still outperform those of the L1 Guidance Law and Dubins path.</p></details> |  |

A critical task in AAV operations is headland turning between crop rows.

While traditional trajectory planning methods work well in arable farming, they often fail in cluttered orchard environments. This letter presents a novel trajectory planner that enhances the safety and efficiency of AAV headland maneuvers, leveraging advancements in autonomous driving. Our approach includes an efficient front-end algorithm and a high-performance back-end optimization. Applied to vehicles with various implements, it outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both standard and challenging orchard fields. This work bridges agricultural and autonomous driving technologies, facilitating a broader adoption of AAVs in complex orchards.</p></details> |  |
| **[On Learning Informative Trajectory Embeddings for Imitation, Classification and Regression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09327v2)** | 2025-01-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In real-world sequential decision making tasks like autonomous driving, robotics, and healthcare, learning from observed state-action trajectories is critical for tasks like imitation, classification, and clustering. For example, self-driving cars must replicate human driving behaviors, while robots and healthcare systems benefit from modeling decision sequences, whether or not they come from expert data. Existing trajectory encoding methods often focus on specific tasks or rely on reward signals, limiting their ability to generalize across domains and tasks. Inspired by the success of embedding models like CLIP and BERT in static domains, we propose a novel method for embedding state-action trajectories into a latent space that captures the skills and competencies in the dynamic underlying decision-making processes. This method operates without the need for reward labels, enabling better generalization across diverse domains and tasks. Our contributions are threefold: (1) We introduce a trajectory embedding approach that captures multiple abilities from state-action data. (2) The learned embeddings exhibit strong representational power across downstream tasks, including imitation, classification, clustering, and regression. (3) The embeddings demonstrate unique properties, such as controlling agent behaviors in IQ-Learn and an additive structure in the latent space. Experimental results confirm that our method outperforms traditional approaches, offering more flexible and powerful trajectory representations for various applications.

We propose a non-autoregressive transformer architecture to leverage its parallel nature for easier training and fast, accurate predictions at test time. The proposed architecture divides human motion prediction into two parts: 1) the human trajectory, which is the hip joint 3D position over time and 2) the human pose which is the all other joints 3D positions over time with respect to a fixed hip joint. We propose to make the two predictions simultaneously, as the shared representation can improve the model performance. Therefore, the model consists of two sets of encoders and decoders. First, a multi-head attention module applied to encoder outputs improves human trajectory. Second, another multi-head self-attention module applied to encoder outputs concatenated with decoder outputs facilitates learning of temporal dependencies. Our model is well-suited for robotic applications in terms of test accuracy and speed, and compares favorably with respect to state-of-the-art methods. We demonstrate the real-world applicability of our work via the Robot Follow-Ahead task, a challenging yet practical case study for our proposed model.</p></details> |  |
| **[BILTS: A Bi-Invariant Similarity Measure for Robust Object Trajectory Recognition under Reference Frame Variations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04392v2)** | 2025-01-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When similar object motions are performed in diverse contexts but are meant to be recognized under a single classification, these contextual variations act as disturbances that negatively affect accurate motion recognition. In this paper, we focus on contextual variations caused by reference frame variations. To robustly deal with these variations, similarity measures have been introduced that compare object motion trajectories in a context-invariant manner. However, most are highly sensitive to noise near singularities, where the measure is not uniquely defined, and lack bi-invariance (invariance to both world and body frame variations). To address these issues, we propose the novel \textit{Bi-Invariant Local Trajectory-Shape Similarity} (BILTS) measure. Compared to other measures, the BILTS measure uniquely offers bi-invariance, boundedness, and third-order shape identity. Aimed at practical implementations, we devised a discretized and regularized version of the BILTS measure which shows exceptional robustness to singularities. This is demonstrated through rigorous recognition experiments using multiple datasets. On average, BILTS attained the highest recognition ratio and least sensitivity to contextual variations compared to other invariant object motion similarity measures. We believe that the BILTS measure is a valuable tool for recognizing motions performed in diverse contexts and has potential in other applications, including the recognition, segmentation, and adaptation of both motion and force trajectories.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted as a regular research paper for consideration in the Journal of Intelligent & Robotic Systems.

We utilised a U-Net-based feature extractor, via its latent vector representation, to capture scene representations and a graph-aware transformer encoder for capturing social interactions. These components are integrated to learn an agent-scene aware embedding, enabling the model to learn spatial dynamics and forecast the future trajectory of pedestrians. The model is designed to produce both deterministic and stochastic outcomes, with the stochastic predictions being generated by incorporating a Conditional Variational Auto-Encoder (CVAE). ASTRA also proposes a simple yet effective weighted penalty loss function, which helps to yield predictions that outperform a wide array of state-of-the-art deterministic and generative models. ASTRA demonstrates an average improvement of 27%/10% in deterministic/stochastic settings on the ETH-UCY dataset, and 26% improvement on the PIE dataset, respectively, along with seven times fewer parameters than the existing state-of-the-art model (see Figure 1).

Strategies for planning minimum-energy trajectories typically involve solving nonlinear optimal control problems (OCPs), which rarely cope with real-time requirements. In this paper, we propose a paradigm for generating near minimum-energy trajectories for manipulators by learning from optimal solutions. Our paradigm leverages a residual learning approach, which embeds boundary conditions while focusing on learning only the adjustments needed to steer a standard solution to an optimal one. Compared to a computationally expensive OCP-based planner, our paradigm achieves 87.3% of the performance near the training dataset and 50.8% far from the dataset, while being two to three orders of magnitude faster.</p></details> |  |

The paper investigates the dynamical properties of the closed-loop systems, with a focus on characterizing undesirable behaviors that may emerge due to the use of CBF-based filters. These undesirable behaviors include unbounded trajectories, limit cycles, and undesired equilibria, which can be locally stable and even form a continuum. Our analysis offer the following contributions: (i) conditions under which trajectories remain bounded and (ii) conditions under which limit cycles do not exist; (iii) we show that undesired equilibria can be characterized by solving an algebraic equation, and (iv) we provide examples that show that asymptotically stable undesired equilibria can exist for a large class of nominal controllers and design parameters of the safety filter (even for convex safe sets). Further, for the specific class of planar systems, (v) we provide explicit formulas for the total number of undesired equilibria and the proportion of saddle points and asymptotically stable equilibria, and (vi) in the case of linear planar systems, we present an exhaustive analysis of their global stability properties. Examples throughout the paper illustrate the results.</p></details> |  |

The framework leverages the concept of regularity for set-valued output maps. Specifically, we demonstrate that, for output-regular maps, one can utilize a set-valued observability measure that is concave with respect to finite-horizon state trajectories. By maximizing this measure, optimized estimation-aware trajectories can be designed for a broad class of systems, including those with locally linearized dynamics. To illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, we provide a representative example in the context of trajectory planning for vision-based estimation. We present an estimation-aware trajectory for an uncooperative target-tracking problem that uses a machine learning (ML)-based estimation module on an ego-satellite.</p></details> | 25 pages, 5 figures |
| **[MGF: Mixed Gaussian Flow for Diverse Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12238v2)** | 2025-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To predict future trajectories, the normalizing flow with a standard Gaussian prior suffers from weak diversity. The ineffectiveness comes from the conflict between the fact of asymmetric and multi-modal distribution of likely outcomes and symmetric and single-modal original distribution and supervision losses. Instead, we propose constructing a mixed Gaussian prior for a normalizing flow model for trajectory prediction. The prior is constructed by analyzing the trajectory patterns in the training samples without requiring extra annotations while showing better expressiveness and being multi-modal and asymmetric. Besides diversity, it also provides better controllability for probabilistic trajectory generation. We name our method Mixed Gaussian Flow (MGF). It achieves state-of-the-art performance in the evaluation of both trajectory alignment and diversity on the popular UCY/ETH and SDD datasets.

Such a trajectory design is a challenging problem not only for trajectory design but also for flight operations, and in particular, it is essential to evaluate the impact of operational uncertainties to ensure mission success. In this study, we design the low-thrust trajectory from Earth orbit to a lunar transfer orbit by differential dynamic programming using the Sundman transformation. The results of Monte Carlo simulations with operational uncertainties confirm that the spacecraft can be successfully guided to the lunar transfer orbit by using the feedback control law of differential dynamic programming in the angular domain.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at 2023 AAS/AIAA Astrodynamics Specialist Conference, Big Sky, MT.

| **[Predicting 4D Hand Trajectory from Monocular Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08329v1)** | 2025-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present HaPTIC, an approach that infers coherent 4D hand trajectories from monocular videos. Current video-based hand pose reconstruction methods primarily focus on improving frame-wise 3D pose using adjacent frames rather than studying consistent 4D hand trajectories in space. Despite the additional temporal cues, they generally underperform compared to image-based methods due to the scarcity of annotated video data. To address these issues, we repurpose a state-of-the-art image-based transformer to take in multiple frames and directly predict a coherent trajectory. We introduce two types of lightweight attention layers: cross-view self-attention to fuse temporal information, and global cross-attention to bring in larger spatial context. Our method infers 4D hand trajectories similar to the ground truth while maintaining strong 2D reprojection alignment. We apply the method to both egocentric and allocentric videos. It significantly outperforms existing methods in global trajectory accuracy while being comparable to the state-of-the-art in single-image pose estimation.

| **[Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction Based on Social Interactions Learning With Random Weights](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07711v1)** | 2025-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pedestrian trajectory prediction is a critical technology in the evolution of self-driving cars toward complete artificial intelligence. Over recent years, focusing on the trajectories of pedestrians to model their social interactions has surged with great interest in more accurate trajectory predictions. However, existing methods for modeling pedestrian social interactions rely on pre-defined rules, struggling to capture non-explicit social interactions. In this work, we propose a novel framework named DTGAN, which extends the application of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to graph sequence data, with the primary objective of automatically capturing implicit social interactions and achieving precise predictions of pedestrian trajectory. DTGAN innovatively incorporates random weights within each graph to eliminate the need for pre-defined interaction rules. We further enhance the performance of DTGAN by exploring diverse task loss functions during adversarial training, which yields improvements of 16.7\% and 39.3\% on metrics ADE and FDE, respectively. The effectiveness and accuracy of our framework are verified on two public datasets. The experimental results show that our proposed DTGAN achieves superior performance and is well able to understand pedestrians' intentions.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages,7 figures,Accepted to IEEE Transactions on Multimedia (TMM)</p></details> |
| **[Computing Safety Margins of Parameterized Nonlinear Systems for Vulnerability Assessment via Trajectory Sensitivities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07498v1)** | 2025-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Physical systems experience nonlinear disturbances which have the potential to disrupt desired behavior. For a particular disturbance, whether or not the system recovers from the disturbance to a desired stable equilibrium point depends on system parameter values, which are typically uncertain and time-varying. Therefore, to quantify proximity to vulnerability we define the safety margin to be the smallest change in parameter values from a nominal value such that the system will no longer be able to recover from the disturbance. Safety margins are valuable but challenging to compute as related methods, such as those for robust region of attraction estimation, are often either overly conservative or computationally intractable for high dimensional systems. Recently, we developed algorithms to compute safety margins efficiently and non-conservatively by exploiting the large sensitivity of the system trajectory near the region of attraction boundary to small perturbations. Although these algorithms have enjoyed empirical success, they lack theoretical guarantees that would ensure their generalizability. This work develops a novel characterization of safety margins in terms of trajectory sensitivities, and uses this to derive well-posedness and convergence guarantees for these algorithms, enabling their generalizability and successful application to a large class of nonlinear systems.</p></details> | 16 pages |
| **[Global Search for Optimal Low Thrust Spacecraft Trajectories using Diffusion Models and the Indirect Method](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07005v1)** | 2025-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long time-duration low-thrust nonlinear optimal spacecraft trajectory global search is a computationally and time expensive problem characterized by clustering patterns in locally optimal solutions. During preliminary mission design, mission parameters are subject to frequent changes, necessitating that trajectory designers efficiently generate high-quality control solutions for these new scenarios. Generative machine learning models can be trained to learn how the solution structure varies with respect to a conditional parameter, thereby accelerating the global search for missions with updated parameters. In this work, state-of-the-art diffusion models are integrated with the indirect approach for trajectory optimization within a global search framework. This framework is tested on two low-thrust transfers of different complexity in the circular restricted three-body problem. By generating and analyzing a training data set, we develop mathematical relations and techniques to understand the complex structures in the costate domain of locally optimal solutions for these problems. A diffusion model is trained on this data and successfully accelerates the global search for both problems. The model predicts how the costate solution structure changes, based on the maximum spacecraft thrust magnitude. Warm-starting a numerical solver with diffusion model samples for the costates at the initial time increases the number of solutions generated per minute for problems with unseen thrust magnitudes by one to two orders of magnitude in comparison to samples from a uniform distribution and from an adjoint control transformation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Estimation of Relaxed Model Parameters for Robust UAV Trajectory Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10941v2)** | 2025-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Online trajectory optimization and optimal control methods are crucial for enabling sustainable unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) services, such as agriculture, environmental monitoring, and transportation, where available actuation and energy are limited. However, optimal controllers are highly sensitive to model mismatch, which can occur due to loaded equipment, packages to be delivered, or pre-existing variability in fundamental structural and thrust-related parameters. To circumvent this problem, optimal controllers can be paired with parameter estimators to improve their trajectory planning performance and perform adaptive control. However, UAV platforms are limited in terms of onboard processing power, oftentimes making nonlinear parameter estimation too computationally expensive to consider. To address these issues, we propose a relaxed, affine-in-parameters multirotor model along with an efficient optimal parameter estimator. We convexify the nominal Moving Horizon Parameter Estimation (MHPE) problem into a linear-quadratic form (LQ-MHPE) via an affine-in-parameter relaxation on the nonlinear dynamics, resulting in fast quadratic programs (QPs) that facilitate adaptive Model Predictve Control (MPC) in real time. We compare this approach to the equivalent nonlinear estimator in Monte Carlo simulations, demonstrating a decrease in average solve time and trajectory optimality cost by 98.2% and 23.9-56.2%, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures, to be published in IEEE Sustech 2025</p></details> |

While promising approaches exist, they often revolve around pedestrian datasets excluding traffic-related information, or resemble architectures that are either not real-time capable or robust. To address these limitations, we first introduce a dedicated benchmark based on Argoverse 2, specifically targeting pedestrians in traffic environments. Following this, we present Snapshot, a modular, feed-forward neural network that outperforms the current state of the art, reducing the Average Displacement Error (ADE) by 8.8% while utilizing significantly less information. Despite its agent-centric encoding scheme, Snapshot demonstrates scalability, real-time performance, and robustness to varying motion histories. Moreover, by integrating Snapshot into a modular autonomous driving software stack, we showcase its real-world applicability.</p></details> | 8 Pages, 9 Figures |
| **[Pitch Plane Trajectory Tracking Control for Sounding Rockets via Adaptive Feedback Linearization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05285v1)** | 2025-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes a pitch plane trajectory tacking control solution for suborbital launch vehicles relying on adaptive feedback linearization. Initially, the 2D dynamics and kinematics for a single-engine, thrust-vector-controlled sounding rocket are obtained for control design purposes. Then, an inner-outer control strategy, which simultaneously tackles attitude and position control, is adopted, with the inner-loop comprising the altitude and pitch control and the outer-loop addressing the horizontal (downrange) position control. Feedback linearization is used to cancel out the non-linearities in both the inner and outer dynamics. Making use of Lyapunov stability theory, an adaptation law, which provides online estimates on the inner-loop aerodynamic uncertainty, is jointly designed with the output tracking controller via adaptive backstepping, ensuring global reference tracking in the region where the feedback linearization is well-defined. The zero dynamics of the inner-stabilized system are then exploited to obtain the outerloop dynamics and derive a Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) with integral action, which can stabilize them as well as reject external disturbances. In the outermost loop, the estimate on the correspondent aerodynamic uncertainty is indirectly obtained by using the inner loop estimates together with known aerodynamics relations. The resulting inner-outer position control solution is proven to be asymptotically stable in the region of interest. Using a single-stage sounding rocket, propelled by a liquid engine, as reference vehicle, different mission scenarios are tested in a simulation environment to verify the adaptability of the proposed control strategy. The system is able to track the requested trajectories while rejecting external wind disturbances. Furthermore, the need to re-tune the control gains in between different mission scenarios is minimal to none.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper accepted to the IEEE Aerospace Conference 2025.

It is often due to limitations like complex architectures customized for a specific dataset and inefficient multimodal handling. We propose Perceiver with Register queries (PerReg+), a novel trajectory prediction framework that introduces: (1) Dual-Level Representation Learning via Self-Distillation (SD) and Masked Reconstruction (MR), capturing global context and fine-grained details. Additionally, our approach of reconstructing segmentlevel trajectories and lane segments from masked inputs with query drop, enables effective use of contextual information and improves generalization; (2) Enhanced Multimodality using register-based queries and pretraining, eliminating the need for clustering and suppression; and (3) Adaptive Prompt Tuning during fine-tuning, freezing the main architecture and optimizing a small number of prompts for efficient adaptation. PerReg+ sets a new state-of-the-art performance on nuScenes [1], Argoverse 2 [2], and Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD) [3]. Remarkable, our pretrained model reduces the error by 6.8% on smaller datasets, and multi-dataset training enhances generalization. In cross-domain tests, PerReg+ reduces B-FDE by 11.8% compared to its non-pretrained variant.</p></details> |  |

While recent methods based on the motion manifold hypothesis, which assumes that a set of trajectories lies on a lower-dimensional nonlinear subspace, address challenges such as limited dataset size and the high dimensionality of trajectory data, they often struggle to capture complex task-motion dependencies, i.e., when motion distributions shift drastically with task variations. To address this, we introduce Motion Manifold Flow Primitives (MMFP), a framework that decouples the training of the motion manifold from task-conditioned distributions. Specifically, we employ flow matching models, state-of-the-art conditional deep generative models, to learn task-conditioned distributions in the latent coordinate space of the learned motion manifold. Experiments are conducted on language-guided trajectory generation tasks, where many-to-many text-motion correspondences introduce complex task-motion dependencies, highlighting MMFP's superiority over existing methods.</p></details> | 8 pages, 11 figures |

In this task, the model is required to make predictions based on natural language instructions, egocentric view images before manipulation, and the given end-effector trajectories. Conventional methods typically perform success prediction only after the manipulation is executed, limiting their efficiency in executing the entire task sequence. We propose a novel approach that enables the prediction of success or failure by aligning the given trajectories and images with natural language instructions. We introduce Trajectory Encoder to apply learnable weighting to the input trajectories, allowing the model to consider temporal dynamics and interactions between objects and the end effector, improving the model's ability to predict manipulation outcomes accurately. We constructed a dataset based on the RT-1 dataset, a large-scale benchmark for open-vocabulary object manipulation tasks, to evaluate our method.

This paper presents two novel trajectory-prediction methods based on real-time position measurements and adaptive input and state estimation (AISE). The first method, called AISE/va, uses position measurements to estimate the target velocity and acceleration. The second method, called AISE/FS, models the target trajectory as a 3D curve using the Frenet-Serret formulas, which require estimates of velocity, acceleration, and jerk. To estimate velocity, acceleration, and jerk in real time, AISE computes first, second, and third derivatives of the position measurements. AISE does not rely on assumptions about the target maneuver, measurement noise, or disturbances. For trajectory prediction, both methods use measurements of the target position and estimates of its derivatives to extrapolate from the current position. The performance of AISE/va and AISE/FS is compared numerically with the $\alpha$-$\beta$-$\gamma$ filter, which shows that AISE/FS provides more accurate trajectory prediction than AISE/va and traditional methods, especially for complex target maneuvers.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures.

However, predictive modeling of such data remains challenging due to high dimensionality, irregular sampling, and data sparsity. To address these issues, we propose ImageFlowNet, a novel model designed to forecast disease trajectories from initial images while preserving spatial details. ImageFlowNet first learns multiscale joint representation spaces across patients and time points, then optimizes deterministic or stochastic flow fields within these spaces using a position-parameterized neural ODE/SDE framework. The model leverages a UNet architecture to create robust multiscale representations and mitigates data scarcity by combining knowledge from all patients. We provide theoretical insights that support our formulation of ODEs, and motivate our regularizations involving high-level visual features, latent space organization, and trajectory smoothness. We validate ImageFlowNet on three longitudinal medical image datasets depicting progression in geographic atrophy, multiple sclerosis, and glioblastoma, demonstrating its ability to effectively forecast disease progression and outperform existing methods. Our contributions include the development of ImageFlowNet, its theoretical underpinnings, and empirical validation on real-world datasets.

These forecasts allow us to anticipate events that lead to collisions and, therefore, to mitigate them. Deep Neural Networks have excelled in motion forecasting, but overconfidence and weak uncertainty quantification persist. Deep Ensembles address these concerns, yet applying them to multimodal distributions remains challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel approach named Hierarchical Light Transformer Ensembles (HLT-Ens) aimed at efficiently training an ensemble of Transformer architectures using a novel hierarchical loss function. HLT-Ens leverages grouped fully connected layers, inspired by grouped convolution techniques, to capture multimodal distributions effectively. We demonstrate that HLT-Ens achieves state-of-the-art performance levels through extensive experimentation, offering a promising avenue for improving trajectory forecasting techniques.</p></details> | WACV 2025 |

Although end-to-end models based on deep learning have great potential, they often do not consider vehicle dynamic limitations, leading to unrealistic predictions. To address this problem, this work introduces a novel hybrid model that combines deep learning with a kinematic motion model. It is able to predict object attributes such as acceleration and yaw rate and generate trajectories based on them. A key contribution is the incorporation of expert knowledge into the learning objective of the deep learning model. This results in the constraint of the available action space, thus enabling the prediction of physically feasible object attributes and trajectories, thereby increasing safety and robustness. The proposed hybrid model facilitates enhanced interpretability, thereby reinforcing the trustworthiness of deep learning methods and promoting the development of safe planning solutions. Experiments conducted on the publicly available real-world Argoverse dataset demonstrate realistic driving behaviour, with benchmark comparisons and ablation studies showing promising results.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to 2025 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV)</p></details> |
| **[Collision Risk Quantification and Conflict Resolution in Trajectory Tracking for Acceleration-Actuated Multi-Robot Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03585v1)** | 2025-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One of the pivotal challenges in a multi-robot system is how to give attention to accuracy and efficiency while ensuring safety. Prior arts cannot strictly guarantee collision-free for an arbitrarily large number of robots or the results are considerably conservative. Smoothness of the avoidance trajectory also needs to be further optimized. This paper proposes an accelerationactuated simultaneous obstacle avoidance and trajectory tracking method for arbitrarily large teams of robots, that provides a nonconservative collision avoidance strategy and gives approaches for deadlock avoidance. We propose two ways of deadlock resolution, one involves incorporating an auxiliary velocity vector into the error function of the trajectory tracking module, which is proven to have no influence on global convergence of the tracking error. Furthermore, unlike the traditional methods that they address conflicts after a deadlock occurs, our decision-making mechanism avoids the near-zero velocity, which is much more safer and efficient in crowed environments. Extensive comparison show that the proposed method is superior to the existing studies when deployed in a large-scale robot system, with minimal invasiveness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Modeling Cell Type Developmental Trajectory using Multinomial Unbalanced Optimal Transport](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03501v1)** | 2025-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Single-cell trajectory analysis aims to reconstruct the biological developmental processes of cells as they evolve over time, leveraging temporal correlations in gene expression. During cellular development, gene expression patterns typically change and vary across different cell types. A significant challenge in this analysis is that RNA sequencing destroys the cell, making it impossible to track gene expression across multiple stages for the same cell. Recent advances have introduced the use of optimal transport tools to model the trajectory of individual cells. In this paper, our focus shifts to a question of greater practical importance: we examine the differentiation of cell types over time. Specifically, we propose a novel method based on discrete unbalanced optimal transport to model the developmental trajectory of cell types. Our method detects biological changes in cell types and infers their transitions to different states by analyzing the transport matrix. We validated our method using single-cell RNA sequencing data from mouse embryonic fibroblasts. The results accurately identified major developmental changes in cell types, which were corroborated by experimental evidence. Furthermore, the inferred transition probabilities between cell types are highly congruent to biological ground truth.</p></details> |  |

Conventional multidisciplinary analysis and optimization (MDAO) can be expensive, while surrogate-based optimization can struggle with challenging physical constraints. This work proposes physics-constrained generative adversarial networks (physicsGAN), to intelligently parameterize the takeoff control profiles of an eVTOL aircraft and to transform the original design space to a feasible space. Specifically, the transformed feasible space refers to a space where all designs directly satisfy all design constraints. The physicsGAN-enabled surrogate-based takeoff trajectory design framework was demonstrated on the Airbus A3 Vahana. The physicsGAN generated only feasible control profiles of power and wing angle in the feasible space with around 98.9% of designs satisfying all constraints. The proposed design framework obtained 99.6% accuracy compared with simulation-based optimal design and took only 2.2 seconds, which reduced the computational time by around 200 times. Meanwhile, data-driven GAN-enabled surrogate-based optimization took 21.9 seconds using a derivative-free optimizer, which was around an order of magnitude slower than the proposed framework. Moreover, the data-driven GAN-based optimization using gradient-based optimizers could not consistently find the optimal design during random trials and got stuck in an infeasible region, which is problematic in real practice. Therefore, the proposed physicsGAN-based design framework outperformed data-driven GAN-based design to the extent of efficiency (2.2 seconds), optimality (99.6% accurate), and feasibility (100% feasible). According to the literature review, this is the first physics-constrained generative artificial intelligence enabled by surrogate models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Confe...</summary><p>Conference version with 10 pages and 7 figures</p></details> |

While recent advancements produce photorealistic outputs, they frequently struggle to create videos with accurate and consistent object motion, especially in multi-object scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose a two-stage compositional framework that decomposes I2V generation into: (i) An explicit intermediate representation generation stage, followed by (ii) A video generation stage that is conditioned on this representation. Our key innovation is the introduction of a mask-based motion trajectory as an intermediate representation, that captures both semantic object information and motion, enabling an expressive but compact representation of motion and semantics. To incorporate the learned representation in the second stage, we utilize object-level attention objectives. Specifically, we consider a spatial, per-object, masked-cross attention objective, integrating object-specific prompts into corresponding latent space regions and a masked spatio-temporal self-attention objective, ensuring frame-to-frame consistency for each object. We evaluate our method on challenging benchmarks with multi-object and high-motion scenarios and empirically demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results in temporal coherence, motion realism, and text-prompt faithfulness. Additionally, we introduce \benchmark, a new challenging benchmark for single-object and multi-object I2V generation, and demonstrate our method's superiority on this benchmark.

Understanding the decision-making process not only contributes to fostering trust but might also reveal previously unknown decision criteria of complex models that could advance the state of medical research. The discovery of decision-relevant concepts from black box models is a particularly challenging task. This study proposes Concept Discovery through Latent Diffusion-based Counterfactual Trajectories (CDCT), a novel three-step framework for concept discovery leveraging the superior image synthesis capabilities of diffusion models. In the first step, CDCT uses a Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) to generate a counterfactual trajectory dataset. This dataset is used to derive a disentangled representation of classification-relevant concepts using a Variational Autoencoder (VAE). Finally, a search algorithm is applied to identify relevant concepts in the disentangled latent space. The application of CDCT to a classifier trained on the largest public skin lesion dataset revealed not only the presence of several biases but also meaningful biomarkers. Moreover, the counterfactuals generated within CDCT show better FID scores than those produced by a previously established state-of-the-art method, while being 12 times more resource-efficient. Unsupervised concept discovery holds great potential for the application of trustworthy AI and the further development of human knowledge in various domains. CDCT represents a further step in this direction.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR) 2024</p></details> |

Large deviations for stochastic approximations provide asymptotic estimates of the probability that the learning algorithm deviates from its expected path, given by a limit ODE, and the large deviation rate function gives insights to the most likely way that such deviations occur. In this paper we prove a large deviation principle for general stochastic approximations with state-dependent Markovian noise and decreasing step size. Using the weak convergence approach to large deviations, we generalize previous results for stochastic approximations and identify the appropriate scaling sequence for the large deviation principle. We also give a new representation for the rate function, in which the rate function is expressed as an action functional involving the family of Markov transition kernels. Examples of learning algorithms that are covered by the large deviation principle include stochastic gradient descent, persistent contrastive divergence and the Wang-Landau algorithm.</p></details> | 60 p |

In this paper, we systematically explore the abilities of open LLMs with less than ten billion parameters to handle multilingual machine translation (MT) tasks. We conduct comprehensive evaluations on six popular LLMs and find that models like Gemma2-9B exhibit impressive multilingual translation capabilities. We then introduce the Parallel-First Monolingual-Second (PFMS) data mixing strategy in the continual pretraining stage to further enhance the MT performance and present GemmaX2-28, a 9B model achieving top-tier multilingual translation performance across 28 languages. Specifically, GemmaX2-28 consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) models such as TowerInstruct and XALMA and achieves competitive performance with Google Translate and GPT-4-turbo.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accept to NAACL2025 Main Conference</p></details> |
| **[SAISA: Towards Multimodal Large Language Models with Both Training and Inference Efficiency](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02458v1)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) mainly fall into two architectures, each involving a trade-off between training and inference efficiency: embedding space alignment (e.g., LLaVA-1.5) is inefficient during inference, while cross-attention space alignment (e.g., Flamingo) is inefficient in training. In this paper, we compare these two architectures and identify the key factors for building efficient MLLMs. A primary difference between them lies in how attention is applied to visual tokens, particularly in their interactions with each other. To investigate whether attention among visual tokens is necessary, we propose a new self-attention mechanism, NAAViT (\textbf{N}o \textbf{A}ttention \textbf{A}mong \textbf{Vi}sual \textbf{T}okens), which eliminates this type of attention. Our pilot experiment on LLaVA-1.5 shows that attention among visual tokens is highly redundant. Based on these insights, we introduce SAISA (\textbf{S}elf-\textbf{A}ttention \textbf{I}nput \textbf{S}pace \textbf{A}lignment), a novel architecture that enhance both training and inference efficiency. SAISA directly aligns visual features with the input spaces of NAAViT self-attention blocks, reducing computational overhead in both self-attention blocks and feed-forward networks (FFNs). Using the same configuration as LLaVA-1.5, SAISA reduces inference FLOPs by 66\% and training budget by 26\%, while achieving superior performance in terms of accuracy. Comprehensive ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of SAISA across various LLMs and visual encoders. The code and model will be publicly available at https://github.com/icip-cas/SAISA.</p></details> |  |
| **[Personalization Toolkit: Training Free Personalization of Large Vision Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02452v1)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) have significant potential to deliver personalized assistance by adapting to individual users' unique needs and preferences. Personalization of LVLMs is an emerging area that involves customizing models to recognize specific object instances and provide tailored responses. However, existing approaches rely on time-consuming test-time training for each user and object, rendering them impractical. This paper proposes a novel, training-free approach to LVLM personalization by leveraging pre-trained vision foundation models to extract distinct features, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) techniques to recognize instances in the visual input, and visual prompting methods. Our model-agnostic vision toolkit enables flexible and efficient personalization without extensive retraining. We demonstrate state-of-the-art results, outperforming conventional training-based approaches and establish a new standard for LVLM personalization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generative Psycho-Lexical Approach for Constructing Value Systems in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02444v1)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Values are core drivers of individual and collective perception, cognition, and behavior. Value systems, such as Schwartz's Theory of Basic Human Values, delineate the hierarchy and interplay among these values, enabling cross-disciplinary investigations into decision-making and societal dynamics. Recently, the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has raised concerns regarding their elusive intrinsic values. Despite growing efforts in evaluating, understanding, and aligning LLM values, a psychologically grounded LLM value system remains underexplored. This study addresses the gap by introducing the Generative Psycho-Lexical Approach (GPLA), a scalable, adaptable, and theoretically informed method for constructing value systems. Leveraging GPLA, we propose a psychologically grounded five-factor value system tailored for LLMs. For systematic validation, we present three benchmarking tasks that integrate psychological principles with cutting-edge AI priorities. Our results reveal that the proposed value system meets standard psychological criteria, better captures LLM values, improves LLM safety prediction, and enhances LLM alignment, when compared to the canonical Schwartz's values.</p></details> |  |

However, the complexity of XR environments makes it difficult to accurately extract relevant contextual data and scene/object parameters from an overwhelming volume of XR artifacts. It leads to not only increased costs with pay-per-use models, but also elevated levels of generation errors. Moreover, existing approaches focusing on coding script generation are often prone to generation errors, resulting in flawed or invalid scripts, application crashes, and ultimately a degraded user experience. To overcome these challenges, we introduce LLMER, a novel framework that creates interactive XR worlds using JSON data generated by LLMs. Unlike prior approaches focusing on coding script generation, LLMER translates natural language inputs into JSON data, significantly reducing the likelihood of application crashes and processing latency. It employs a multi-stage strategy to supply only the essential contextual information adapted to the user's request and features multiple modules designed for various XR tasks. Our preliminary user study reveals the effectiveness of the proposed system, with over 80% reduction in consumed tokens and around 60% reduction in task completion time compared to state-of-the-art approaches. The analysis of users' feedback also illuminates a series of directions for further optimization.</p></details> |  |
| **[JailbreakEval: An Integrated Toolkit for Evaluating Jailbreak Attempts Against Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09321v2)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Jailbreak attacks induce Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate harmful responses, posing severe misuse threats. Though research on jailbreak attacks and defenses is emerging, there is no consensus on evaluating jailbreaks, i.e., the methods to assess the harmfulness of an LLM's response are varied. Each approach has its own set of strengths and weaknesses, impacting their alignment with human values, as well as the time and financial cost. This diversity challenges researchers in choosing suitable evaluation methods and comparing different attacks and defenses. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of jailbreak evaluation methodologies, drawing from nearly 90 jailbreak research published between May 2023 and April 2024. Our study introduces a systematic taxonomy of jailbreak evaluators, offering indepth insights into their strengths and weaknesses, along with the current status of their adaptation. To aid further research, we propose JailbreakEval, a toolkit for evaluating jailbreak attempts. JailbreakEval includes various evaluators out-of-the-box, enabling users to obtain results with a single command or customized evaluation workflows. In summary, we regard JailbreakEval to be a catalyst that simplifies the evaluation process in jailbreak research and fosters an inclusive standard for jailbreak evaluation within the community.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is the Extended Version for the Poster at NDSS Symposium 2025, Feb 24-28, 2025.

| **[Activation-Informed Merging of Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02421v1)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model merging, a method that combines the parameters and embeddings of multiple fine-tuned large language models (LLMs), offers a promising approach to enhance model performance across various tasks while maintaining computational efficiency. This paper introduces Activation-Informed Merging (AIM), a technique that integrates the information from the activation space of LLMs into the merging process to improve performance and robustness. AIM is designed as a flexible, complementary solution that is applicable to any existing merging method. It aims to preserve critical weights from the base model, drawing on principles from continual learning~(CL) and model compression. Utilizing a task-agnostic calibration set, AIM selectively prioritizes essential weights during merging. We empirically demonstrate that AIM significantly enhances the performance of merged models across multiple benchmarks. Our findings suggest that considering the activation-space information can provide substantial advancements in the model merging strategies for LLMs with up to 40\% increase in benchmark performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[LV-XAttn: Distributed Cross-Attention for Long Visual Inputs in Multimodal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02406v1)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cross-attention is commonly adopted in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for integrating visual information into the language backbone. However, in applications with large visual inputs, such as video understanding, processing a large number of visual tokens in cross-attention layers leads to high memory demands and often necessitates distributed computation across multiple GPUs. Existing distributed attention mechanisms face significant communication overheads, making cross-attention layers a critical bottleneck for efficient training and inference of MLLMs. To address this, we propose LV-XAttn, a distributed, exact cross-attention mechanism with minimal communication overhead. We observe that in applications involving large visual inputs the size of the query block is typically much smaller than that of the key-value blocks. Thus, in LV-XAttn we keep the large key-value blocks locally on each GPU and exchange smaller query blocks across GPUs. We also introduce an efficient activation recomputation technique enabling support for longer visual context. We theoretically analyze the communication benefits of LV-XAttn and show that it can achieve speedups for a wide range of models. Our evaluations with mPLUG-Owl3 and OpenFlamingo models find that LV-XAttn achieves up to 5.58$\times$ end-to-end speedup compared to existing approaches.</p></details> |  |

To address this limitation, we propose a method that bridges the natural language understanding capabilities of LLMs with the symbolic reasoning strengths of action languages. Our approach, termed "LLM+AL," leverages the LLM's strengths in semantic parsing and commonsense knowledge generation alongside the action language's proficiency in automated reasoning based on encoded knowledge. We compare LLM+AL against state-of-the-art LLMs, including ChatGPT-4, Claude 3 Opus, Gemini Ultra 1.0, and o1-preview, using benchmarks for complex reasoning about actions. Our findings indicate that, although all methods exhibit errors, LLM+AL, with relatively minimal human corrections, consistently leads to correct answers, whereas standalone LLMs fail to improve even with human feedback. LLM+AL also contributes to automated generation of action languages.</p></details> | 42 pages |

Although there are works on data-driven identification of such systems, the literature is quite scarce in terms of works that tackle the identification of LPV models for large-scale systems. Since large-scale systems are ubiquitous in practice, this work develops a methodology for the local and global identification of large-scale LPV systems based on nonintrusive reduced-order modeling. The developed method is coined as DMD-LPV for being inspired in the Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD). To validate the proposed identification method, we identify a system described by a discretized linear diffusion equation, with the diffusion gain defined by a polynomial over a parameter. The experiments show that the proposed method can easily identify a reduced-order LPV model of a given large-scale system without the need to perform identification in the full-order dimension, and with almost no performance decay over performing a reduction, given that the model structure is well-established.</p></details> | <details><summary>39 pa...</summary><p>39 pages, 8 figures.

While recent advances in self-supervised pre-training have shown remarkable potential for improving model generalization in various vision tasks, their effectiveness in gaze estimation remains unexplored due to the geometric nature of the gaze regression task. We propose UniGaze, which leverages large-scale, in-the-wild facial datasets through self-supervised pre-training for gaze estimation. We carefully curate multiple facial datasets that capture diverse variations in identity, lighting, background, and head poses. By directly applying Masked Autoencoder (MAE) pre-training on normalized face images with a Vision Transformer (ViT) backbone, our UniGaze learns appropriate feature representations within the specific input space required by downstream gaze estimation models. Through comprehensive experiments using challenging cross-dataset evaluation and novel protocols, including leave-one-dataset-out and joint-dataset settings, we demonstrate that UniGaze significantly improves generalization across multiple data domains while minimizing reliance on costly labeled data. The source code and pre-trained models will be released upon acceptance.</p></details> |  |

The distinguishing and innovative features of Evalita-LLM are the following: (i) all tasks are native Italian, avoiding issues of translating from Italian and potential cultural biases; (ii) in addition to well established multiple-choice tasks, the benchmark includes generative tasks, enabling more natural interaction with LLMs; (iii) all tasks are evaluated against multiple prompts, this way mitigating the model sensitivity to specific prompts and allowing a fairer and objective evaluation. We propose an iterative methodology, where candidate tasks and candidate prompts are validated against a set of LLMs used for development. We report experimental results from the benchmark's development phase, and provide performance statistics for several state-of-the-art LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>42 pa...</summary><p>42 pages, 1 figure, 32 tables</p></details> |

However, DL has shown limitations in solving constrained NP-hard problems often encountered in network optimization, such as those involving quality of service (QoS) or discrete variables like user indices. Current solutions rely on domain-specific architectures or heuristic techniques, and a general DL approach for constrained optimization remains undeveloped. Moreover, even minor changes in communication objectives demand time-consuming retraining, limiting their adaptability to dynamic environments where task objectives, constraints, environmental factors, and communication scenarios frequently change. To address these challenges, we propose a large language model for resource allocation optimizer (LLM-RAO), a novel approach that harnesses the capabilities of LLMs to address the complex resource allocation problem while adhering to QoS constraints. By employing a prompt-based tuning strategy to flexibly convey ever-changing task descriptions and requirements to the LLM, LLM-RAO demonstrates robust performance and seamless adaptability in dynamic environments without requiring extensive retraining. Simulation results reveal that LLM-RAO achieves up to a 40% performance enhancement compared to conventional DL methods and up to an $80$\% improvement over analytical approaches. Moreover, in scenarios with fluctuating communication objectives, LLM-RAO attains up to 2.9 times the performance of traditional DL-based networks.</p></details> |  |

The first prompt was broad, the second focused on poetic structure, and the third prompt emphasized cultural specificity. To support this analysis, four comparative tables were created. The first table presents the results of the cultural items produced after the three prompts, the second categorizes these outputs based on Aixela framework of Proper nouns and Common expressions, the third table summarizes the cultural items generated by human translators, a custom translation engine, and a Large Language Model. The final table outlines the strategies employed by Chat Generative PreTrained Transformer Pro following the culture specific prompt. Compared to the outputs of cultural items from reference human translation and the custom translation engine in prior studies the findings indicate that the culture oriented prompts used with Chat Generative PreTrained Transformer Pro did not yield significant enhancements of cultural items during the translation of African poetry from English to French. Among the fifty four cultural items, the human translation produced thirty three cultural items in repetition, the custom translation engine generated Thirty eight cultural items in repetition while Chat Generative PreTrained Transformer Pro produced forty one cultural items in repetition. The untranslated cultural items revealed inconsistencies in Large language models approach to translating cultural items in African poetry from English to French.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 4 tables. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2406.03450, arXiv:2312.15304 by other authors</p></details> |

However, the inefficiency and redundancy in processing extended in-context tokens remain a challenge. Many attempts to address this rely on compressing tokens with smaller text encoders, yet we question whether text encoders are truly indispensable. Our journey leads to an unexpected discovery-a much smaller vision encoder, applied directly to sequences of text tokens, can rival text encoders on text tasks. When pre-trained on large amounts of data and transferred to multiple mid-sized or small text understanding benchmarks, VIST leads to comparable results with 16% fewer FLOPs and 50% less memory usage. We further uncover significant token redundancy and devise a frequency-based masking strategy to guide the focus of the visual encoder toward the most critical tokens. Interestingly, we observe the trained visual encoder performs like a summarizer, selectively ignoring less important words such as prepositions and conjunctions. This approach delivers remarkable results, outperforming traditional text encoder-based methods by 5.7% on average over benchmarks like TriviaQA, NQ, PopQA, TREF, SST2, and SST5, setting a new standard for token efficiency in LLMs.</p></details> |  |

We focus on general and domain-specific large language models (LLMs) using a combination of static and prompt-based methods.

By leveraging their ability to process and interpret large-scale information, LLMs have shown potential to address domain-specific challenges, including those in autonomous driving systems. This paper proposes a novel framework that leverages LLMs for risk-aware analysis of generated driving scenarios. We hypothesize that LLMs can effectively evaluate whether driving scenarios generated by autonomous driving testing simulators are safety-critical. To validate this hypothesis, we conducted an empirical evaluation to assess the effectiveness of LLMs in performing this task. This framework will also provide feedback to generate the new safety-critical scenario by using adversarial method to modify existing non-critical scenarios and test their effectiveness in validating motion planning algorithms.

However, they often require different preprocessing strategies, levels of reasoning, or knowledge. Generalist LLMs (e.g. GPT-4) trained on very large multi-topic corpora can perform well in a variety of tasks. They require significant financial, energy, and hardware resources that may not be justified for basic tasks. This implies potentially investing in unnecessary costs for a given query. To overcome this problem, a routing mechanism routes user queries to the most suitable components, such as smaller LLMs or experts in specific topics. This approach may improve response quality while minimising costs. Routing can be expanded to other components of the conversational agent architecture, such as the selection of optimal embedding strategies. This paper explores key considerations for integrating routing into LLM-based systems, focusing on resource management, cost definition, and strategy selection. Our main contributions include a formalisation of the problem, a novel taxonomy of existing approaches emphasising relevance and resource efficiency, and a comparative analysis of these strategies in relation to industry practices. Finally, we identify critical challenges and directions for future research.</p></details> |  |

However, their substantial sizes pose considerable challenges, particularly in computational demands and inference speed, due to their quadratic complexity. In this work, we have identified a key pattern: certain seemingly meaningless special tokens (i.e., separators) contribute disproportionately to attention scores compared to semantically meaningful tokens. This observation suggests that information of the segments between these separator tokens can be effectively condensed into the separator tokens themselves without significant information loss. Guided by this insight, we introduce SepLLM, a plug-and-play framework that accelerates inference by compressing these segments and eliminating redundant tokens. Additionally, we implement efficient kernels for training acceleration. Experimental results across training-free, training-from-scratch, and post-training settings demonstrate SepLLM's effectiveness. Notably, using the Llama-3-8B backbone, SepLLM achieves over 50% reduction in KV cache on the GSM8K-CoT benchmark while maintaining comparable performance. Furthermore, in streaming settings, SepLLM effectively processes sequences of up to 4 million tokens or more while maintaining consistent language modeling capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>We ha...</summary><p>We have made our code publicly available at sepllm.github.io.

| **[EALD-MLLM: Emotion Analysis in Long-sequential and De-identity videos with Multi-modal Large Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00574v2)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Emotion AI is the ability of computers to understand human emotional states. Existing works have achieved promising progress, but two limitations remain to be solved: 1) Previous studies have been more focused on short sequential video emotion analysis while overlooking long sequential video. However, the emotions in short sequential videos only reflect instantaneous emotions, which may be deliberately guided or hidden. In contrast, long sequential videos can reveal authentic emotions; 2) Previous studies commonly utilize various signals such as facial, speech, and even sensitive biological signals (e.g., electrocardiogram). However, due to the increasing demand for privacy, developing Emotion AI without relying on sensitive signals is becoming important. To address the aforementioned limitations, in this paper, we construct a dataset for Emotion Analysis in Long-sequential and De-identity videos called EALD by collecting and processing the sequences of athletes' post-match interviews. In addition to providing annotations of the overall emotional state of each video, we also provide the Non-Facial Body Language (NFBL) annotations for each player. NFBL is an inner-driven emotional expression and can serve as an identity-free clue to understanding the emotional state. Moreover, we provide a simple but effective baseline for further research. More precisely, we evaluate the Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) with de-identification signals (e.g., visual, speech, and NFBLs) to perform emotion analysis. Our experimental results demonstrate that: 1) MLLMs can achieve comparable, even better performance than the supervised single-modal models, even in a zero-shot scenario; 2) NFBL is an important cue in long sequential emotion analysis. EALD will be available on the open-source platform.</p></details> |  |

Notably, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated ``intelligent'' abilities such as complex reasoning and abstract language comprehension, reflecting cognitive-like behaviors. However, current research on emergent abilities in large models predominantly focuses on the relationship between model performance and size, leaving a significant gap in the systematic quantitative analysis of the internal structures and mechanisms driving these emergent abilities. Drawing inspiration from neuroscience research on brain network structure and self-organization, we propose (i) a general network representation of large models, (ii) a new analytical framework, called Neuron-based Multifractal Analysis (NeuroMFA), for structural analysis, and (iii) a novel structure-based metric as a proxy for emergent abilities of large models. By linking structural features to the capabilities of large models, NeuroMFA provides a quantitative framework for analyzing emergent phenomena in large models. Our experiments show that the proposed method yields a comprehensive measure of network's evolving heterogeneity and organization, offering theoretical foundations and a new perspective for investigating emergent abilities in large models.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2025: https://openreview.net/forum?id=nt8gBX58Kh</p></details> |
| **[Large Language Models for Recommendation with Deliberative User Preference Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02061v1)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While recent advancements in aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with recommendation tasks have shown great potential and promising performance overall, these aligned recommendation LLMs still face challenges in complex scenarios. This is primarily due to the current alignment approach focusing on optimizing LLMs to generate user feedback directly, without incorporating deliberation. To overcome this limitation and develop more reliable LLMs for recommendations, we propose a new Deliberative Recommendation task, which incorporates explicit reasoning about user preferences as an additional alignment goal. We then introduce the Deliberative User Preference Alignment framework, designed to enhance reasoning capabilities by utilizing verbalized user feedback in a step-wise manner to tackle this task. The framework employs collaborative step-wise experts and tailored training strategies for each expert. Experimental results across three real-world datasets demonstrate the rationality of the deliberative task formulation and the superior performance of the proposed framework in improving both prediction accuracy and reasoning quality.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-objective Evolution of Heuristic Using Large Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16867v2)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Heuristics are commonly used to tackle various search and optimization problems. Design heuristics usually require tedious manual crafting with domain knowledge. Recent works have incorporated Large Language Models (LLMs) into automatic heuristic search, leveraging their powerful language and coding capacity. However, existing research focuses on the optimal performance on the target problem as the sole objective, neglecting other criteria such as efficiency and scalability, which are vital in practice. To tackle this challenge, we propose to model the heuristic search as a multi-objective optimization problem and consider introducing additional practical criteria beyond optimal performance. Due to the complexity of the search space, conventional multi-objective optimization methods struggle to effectively handle LLM-based multi-objective heuristic search. We propose the first LLM-based multi-objective heuristic search framework, Multi-objective Evolution of Heuristic (MEoH), which integrates LLMs in a zero-shot manner to generate a non-dominated set of heuristics to meet multiple design criteria. We design a new dominance-dissimilarity mechanism for effective population management and selection, which incorporates both code dissimilarity in the search space and dominance in the objective space. MEoH is demonstrated in two well-known combinatorial optimization problems: the online Bin Packing Problem (BPP) and the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). The results indicate that a variety of elite heuristics are automatically generated in a single run, offering more trade-off options than the existing methods. It successfully achieves competitive or superior performance while improving efficiency up to 10 times. Moreover, we also observe that the multi-objective search introduces novel insights into heuristic design and leads to the discovery of diverse heuristics.</p></details> |  |

However, methods like ZeRO-3 that drastically reduce GPU memory pressure often incur heavy communication to ensure global synchronization and consistency. Established efforts such as ZeRO++ use secondary partitions to avoid inter-node communications, given that intra-node GPU-GPU transfer generally has more bandwidth and lower latency than inter-node connections. However, as more capable infrastructure like Frontier, equipped with AMD GPUs, emerged with impressive computing capability, there is a need for investigations on the hardware topology and to develop targeted strategies to improve training efficiency. In this work, we propose a collection of communication and optimization strategies for ZeRO++ to reduce communication costs and improve memory utilization. In this paper, we propose a 3-level hierarchical partitioning specifically for the current 2nd ranked supercomputing cluster, Frontier, which aims at leveraging various bandwidths across layers of communications (GCD-GCD, GPU-GPU, and inter-node) to reduce communication overhead. For a 20B GPT model, we observe a 1.71x increase in TFLOPS per GPU when compared with ZeRO++ up to 384 GCDs and a scaling efficiency of 0.94 for up to 384 GCDs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Added...</summary><p>Added references and clarifications</p></details> |

To address this conflict, we present Data Guard - a fine-grained, purpose-based access control system for large data warehouses. Data Guard enables authoring policies based on semantic descriptions of data and purpose of data access. Data Guard then translates these policies into SQL views that mask data from the underlying warehouse tables. At access time, Data Guard ensures compliance by transparently routing each table access to the appropriate data-masking view based on the purpose of the access, thus minimizing the effort of adopting Data Guard in existing applications. Our enforcement solution allows masking data at much finer granularities than what traditional solutions allow. In addition to row and column level data masking, Data Guard can mask data at the sub-cell level for columns with non-atomic data types such as structs, arrays, and maps. This fine-grained masking allows Data Guard to preserve data utility for consumers while ensuring compliance. We implemented a number of performance optimizations to minimize the overhead of data masking operations. We perform numerous experiments to identify the key factors that influence the data masking overhead and demonstrate the efficiency of our implementation.</p></details> |  |

However, the representation learning capabilities of videotext retrieval models remain constrained by lowquality and limited training data annotations. To address this issue, we present a novel ViDeoText Retrieval Paradigm with RElevance-based AugMentation, namely DREAM, which enhances video and text data using large foundation models to learn more generalized features. Specifically, we first adopt a simple augmentation method, which generates self-similar data by randomly duplicating or dropping subwords and frames. In addition, inspired by the recent advancement in visual and language generative models, we propose a more robust augmentation method through textual paraphrasing and video stylization using large language models (LLMs) and visual generative models (VGMs). To further enrich video and text information, we propose a relevance-based augmentation method, where LLMs and VGMs generate and integrate new relevant information into the original data. Leveraging this enriched data, extensive experiments on several video-text retrieval benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of DREAM over existing methods.</p></details> | NAACL 2025 |

Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) has emerged as a promising compression technique for LLMs, offering considerable reductions in memory overhead. However, existing SVD-based methods often struggle to effectively mitigate the errors introduced by SVD truncation, leading to a noticeable performance gap when compared to the original models. Furthermore, applying a uniform compression ratio across all transformer layers fails to account for the varying importance of different layers. To address these challenges, we propose AdaSVD, an adaptive SVD-based LLM compression approach. Specifically, AdaSVD introduces adaComp, which adaptively compensates for SVD truncation errors by alternately updating the singular matrices U and V^T. Additionally, AdaSVD introduces adaCR, which adaptively assigns layer-specific compression ratios based on the relative importance of each layer. Extensive experiments across multiple LLM families and evaluation metrics demonstrate that AdaSVD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) SVD-based methods, achieving superior performance with significantly reduced memory requirements.

This process demands a nuanced understanding of the variations among passages linked to the query. In this work, we introduce RankFlow, a multi-role reranking workflow that leverages the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) and role specializations to improve reranking performance. RankFlow enlists LLMs to fulfill four distinct roles: the query Rewriter, the pseudo Answerer, the passage Summarizer, and the Reranker. This orchestrated approach enables RankFlow to: (1) accurately interpret queries, (2) draw upon LLMs' extensive pre-existing knowledge, (3) distill passages into concise versions, and (4) assess passages in a comprehensive manner, resulting in notably better reranking results. Our experimental results reveal that RankFlow outperforms existing leading approaches on widely recognized IR benchmarks, such as TREC-DL, BEIR, and NovelEval. Additionally, we investigate the individual contributions of each role in RankFlow. Code is available at https://github.com/jincan333/RankFlow.</p></details> |  |

To address this issue, we propose a novel CITER (\textbf{C}ollaborative \textbf{I}nference with \textbf{T}oken-l\textbf{E}vel \textbf{R}outing) framework that enables efficient collaboration between small and large language models (SLMs & LLMs) through a token-level routing strategy. Specifically, CITER routes non-critical tokens to an SLM for efficiency and routes critical tokens to an LLM for generalization quality. We formulate router training as a policy optimization, where the router receives rewards based on both the quality of predictions and the inference costs of generation. This allows the router to learn to predict token-level routing scores and make routing decisions based on both the current token and the future impact of its decisions. To further accelerate the reward evaluation process, we introduce a shortcut which significantly reduces the costs of the reward estimation and improving the practicality of our approach. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets demonstrate that CITER reduces the inference costs while preserving high-quality generation, offering a promising solution for real-time and resource-constrained applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mitigating Object Hallucinations in Large Vision-Language Models via Attention Calibration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01969v1)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) exhibit impressive multimodal reasoning capabilities but remain highly susceptible to object hallucination, where models generate responses that are not factually aligned with the visual content. Recent works attribute this issue to an inherent bias of LVLMs where vision token attention map has a fixed correlation with spatial position, and propose to mitigate this issue by reordering visual tokens. However, we find that different LVLMs exhibit different correlations between attention and spatial position, which makes the existing solution difficult to generalize to other LVLMs. To address this issue, we first introduce a training-free solution, Uniform Attention Calibration (UAC), that estimates the bias from single meaningless input image and applies a calibration matrix to rectify attention imbalances. To further alleviate the bias, we relax the assumption of single meaningless input in UAC and introduce a fine-tuning solution, Dynamic Attention Calibration (DAC), that enforces the consistent outputs wherever the object locates in the image via a plug-and-plays module. Comprehensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that UAC and DAC significantly reduce object hallucination while improving general multimodal alignment. Our methods achieve state-of-the-art performance across diverse LVLM architectures on various metrics.</p></details> |  |

We show here that -- for the first time -- the models can also generate valid metalinguistic analyses of language data. We outline a research program where the behavioral interpretability of LLMs on these tasks is tested via prompting. LLMs are trained primarily on text -- as such, evaluating their metalinguistic abilities improves our understanding of their general capabilities and sheds new light on theoretical models in linguistics. We show that OpenAI's o1 vastly outperforms other models on tasks involving drawing syntactic trees and phonological generalization. We speculate that OpenAI o1's unique advantage over other models may result from the model's chain-of-thought mechanism, which mimics the structure of human reasoning used in complex cognitive tasks, such as linguistic analysis.</p></details> |  |

We extend this frontier by looking at Large Inference Models (LIMs) that have become indispensable across various applications. However, their scale and complexity often come at a significant computational cost. We introduce a novel approach that leverages one-bit algorithm unrolling, effectively integrating information from the physical world in the model architecture. Our method achieves a bit-per-link rate significantly lower than the 1.58 bits reported in prior work, thanks to the natural sparsity that emerges in our network architectures. We numerically demonstrate that the proposed one-bit algorithm unrolling scheme can improve both training and test outcomes by effortlessly increasing the number of layers while substantially compressing the network. Additionally, we provide theoretical results on the generalization gap, convergence rate, stability, and sensitivity of our proposed one-bit algorithm unrolling.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rethinking Homogeneity of Vision and Text Tokens in Large Vision-and-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01906v1)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large vision-and-language models (LVLMs) typically treat visual and textual embeddings as homogeneous inputs to a large language model (LLM). However, these inputs are inherently different: visual inputs are multi-dimensional and contextually rich, often pre-encoded by models like CLIP, while textual inputs lack this structure. In this paper, we propose Decomposed Attention (D-Attn), a novel method that processes visual and textual embeddings differently by decomposing the 1-D causal self-attention in LVLMs. After the attention decomposition, D-Attn diagonalizes visual-to-visual self-attention, reducing computation from $\mathcal{O}(|V|^2)$ to $\mathcal{O}(|V|)$ for $|V|$ visual embeddings without compromising performance. Moreover, D-Attn debiases positional encodings in textual-to-visual cross-attention, further enhancing visual understanding. Finally, we introduce an $\alpha$-weighting strategy to merge visual and textual information, maximally preserving the pre-trained LLM's capabilities with minimal modifications. Extensive experiments and rigorous analyses validate the effectiveness of D-Attn, demonstrating significant improvements on multiple image benchmarks while significantly reducing computational costs. Code, data, and models will be publicly available.</p></details> |  |

CMT leverages metaphorical mappings to structure abstract reasoning, improving models' ability to process and explain intricate concepts. By incorporating CMT-based prompts, we guide LLMs toward more structured and human-like reasoning patterns. To evaluate this approach, we compare four native models (Llama3.2, Phi3, Gemma2, and Mistral) against their CMT-augmented counterparts on benchmark tasks spanning domain-specific reasoning, creative insight, and metaphor interpretation. Responses were automatically evaluated using the Llama3.3 70B model. Experimental results indicate that CMT prompting significantly enhances reasoning accuracy, clarity, and metaphorical coherence, outperforming baseline models across all evaluated tasks.</p></details> |  |

Whereas traditional Markowitz-based mean-variance portfolios are widespread, network-based optimisation techniques offer a more flexible tool to capture complex interdependencies between asset values. However, most of the existing studies do not contain firms at risk of default and remove any firms that drop off indices over a certain time. This is the first study to also incorporate such firms in portfolio optimisation on a large scale. We propose and empirically test a novel method that leverages Graph Attention networks (GATs), a subclass of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). GNNs, as deep learning-based models, can exploit network data to uncover nonlinear relationships. Their ability to handle high-dimensional data and accommodate customised layers for specific purposes makes them appealing for large-scale problems such as mid- and small-cap portfolio optimisation. This study utilises 30 years of data on mid-cap firms, creating graphs of firms using distance correlation and the Triangulated Maximally Filtered Graph approach. These graphs are the inputs to a GAT model incorporating weight and allocation constraints and a loss function derived from the Sharpe ratio, thus focusing on maximising portfolio risk-adjusted returns. This new model is benchmarked against a network characteristic-based portfolio, a mean variance-based portfolio, and an equal-weighted portfolio. The results show that the portfolio produced by the GAT-based model outperforms all benchmarks and is consistently superior to other strategies over a long period, while also being informative of market dynamics.</p></details> | <details><summary>39 pa...</summary><p>39 pages, 10 figures, v2</p></details> |
| **[Channel-Wise Mixed-Precision Quantization for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13056v3)** | 2025-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable success across a wide range of language tasks, but their deployment on edge devices remains challenging due to the substantial memory requirements imposed by their large parameter sizes. Weight-only quantization presents a promising solution to reduce the memory footprint of LLMs. However, existing approaches primarily focus on integer-bit quantization, limiting their adaptability to fractional-bit quantization tasks and preventing the full utilization of available storage space on devices. In this paper, we introduce Channel-Wise Mixed-Precision Quantization (CMPQ), a novel mixed-precision quantization method that allocates quantization precision in a channel-wise pattern based on activation distributions. By assigning different precision levels to different weight channels, CMPQ can adapt to any bit-width constraint. CMPQ employs a non-uniform quantization strategy and incorporates two outlier extraction techniques that collaboratively preserve the critical information, thereby minimizing the quantization loss. Experiments on different sizes of LLMs demonstrate that CMPQ not only enhances performance in integer-bit quantization tasks but also achieves significant performance gains with a modest increase in memory usage. CMPQ thus represents an adaptive and effective approach to LLM quantization, offering substantial benefits across diverse device capabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[ResQ: Mixed-Precision Quantization of Large Language Models with Low-Rank Residuals](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14363v2)** | 2025-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Post-training quantization (PTQ) of large language models (LLMs) holds the promise in reducing the prohibitive computational cost at inference time. Quantization of all weight, activation and key-value (KV) cache tensors to 4-bit without significantly degrading generalizability is challenging, due to the high quantization error caused by extreme outliers in activations. To tackle this problem, we propose ResQ, a PTQ method that pushes further the state-of-the-art. By means of principal component analysis (PCA), it identifies a low-rank subspace (in practice 1/8 of the hidden dimension) in which activation variances are highest, and keep the coefficients within this subspace in high precision, e.g. 8-bit, while quantizing the rest to 4-bit. Within each subspace, invariant random rotation is applied to further suppress outliers. We show that this is a provably optimal mixed precision quantization scheme that minimizes error. With the Llama and Qwen2.5 families of models, we demonstrate that ResQ outperforms recent uniform and mixed precision PTQ methods on a variety of benchmarks, achieving up to 33\% lower perplexity on Wikitext than the next best method SpinQuant, and upto 3\times speedup over 16-bit baseline.

Our GLOV meta-prompts an LLM with the downstream task description, querying it for suitable VLM prompts (e.g., for zero-shot classification with CLIP). These prompts are ranked according to a purity measure obtained through a fitness function. In each respective optimization step, the ranked prompts are fed as in-context examples (with their accuracies) to equip the LLM with the knowledge of the type of text prompts preferred by the downstream VLM. Furthermore, we also explicitly steer the LLM generation process in each optimization step by specifically adding an offset difference vector of the embeddings from the positive and negative solutions found by the LLM, in previous optimization steps, to the intermediate layer of the network for the next generation step. This offset vector steers the LLM generation toward the type of language preferred by the downstream VLM, resulting in enhanced performance on the downstream vision tasks. We comprehensively evaluate our GLOV on 16 diverse datasets using two families of VLMs, i.e., dual-encoder (e.g., CLIP) and encoder-decoder (e.g., LLaVa) models -- showing that the discovered solutions can enhance the recognition performance by up to 15.0% and 57.5% (3.8% and 21.6% on average) for these models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/jmiemirza/GLOV</p></details> |

To address this, we introduce SelfCheckAgent, a novel framework integrating three different agents: the Symbolic Agent, the Specialized Detection Agent, and the Contextual Consistency Agent. These agents provide a robust multi-dimensional approach to hallucination detection. Notable results include the Contextual Consistency Agent leveraging Llama 3.1 with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) to achieve outstanding performance on the WikiBio dataset, with NonFactual hallucination detection scoring 93.64%, Factual 70.26%, and Ranking 78.48% respectively. On the AIME dataset, GPT-4o with CoT excels in NonFactual detection with 94.89% but reveals trade-offs in Factual with 30.58% and Ranking with 30.68%, underscoring the complexity of hallucination detection in the complex mathematical domains. The framework also incorporates a triangulation strategy, which increases the strengths of the SelfCheckAgent, yielding significant improvements in real-world hallucination identification. The comparative analysis demonstrates SelfCheckAgent's applicability across diverse domains, positioning it as a crucial advancement for trustworthy LLMs. These findings highlight the potentiality of consistency-driven methodologies in detecting hallucinations in LLMs.</p></details> |  |

Despite their significance, large-scale, high-quality clinical trial outcome data are not readily available to the public, limiting advances in trial outcome predictive modeling. Methods: We introduce the Clinical Trial Outcome (CTO) knowledge base, a fully reproducible, large-scale (around 125K drug and biologics trials), open-source of clinical trial information including large language model (LLM) interpretations of publications, matched trials over phases, sentiment analysis from news, stock prices of trial sponsors, and other trial-related metrics. From this knowledge base, we additionally performed manual annotation of a set of recent clinical trials from 2020-2024. Results: We evaluated the quality of our knowledge base by generating high-quality trial outcome labels that demonstrate strong agreement with previously published expert annotations, achieving an F1 score of 94 for Phase 3 trials and 91 across all phases. Additionally, we benchmarked a suite of standard machine learning models on our manually annotated set, highlighting the distribution shift of recent trials and the need for continuously updated labeling methods. Conclusions: By analyzing CTO's performance on recent trials, we showed a need for recent, high-quality trial outcome labels. We release our knowledge base and labels to the public at https://chufangao.github.io/CTOD, which will also be regularly updated to support ongoing research in clinical trial outcomes, offering insights that could optimize the drug development process.</p></details> |  |

Per-sequence extraction probabilities provide finer-grained information than has been studied in prior work. We re-analyze the effects of decoding schemes, model sizes, prefix lengths, partial sequence leakages, and token positions to uncover new insights that were not possible in previous works due to their choice of metrics. We perform this study on two pre-trained models, Llama and OPT, trained on the Common Crawl and The Pile respectively. We discover that 1) Extraction Rate, the predominant metric used in prior quantification work, underestimates the threat of leakage of training data in randomized LLMs by as much as 2.14X. 2) Although on average, larger models and longer prefixes can extract more data, this is not true for a substantial portion of individual sequences. 30.4-41.5% of our sequences are easier to extract with either shorter prefixes or smaller models. 3) Contrary to previous beliefs, partial leakage in commonly used decoding schemes like top-k and top-p is not easier than leaking verbatim training data. 4) Extracting later tokens in a sequence is as much as 10.12X easier than extracting earlier tokens. The insights gained from our analysis shed light on the nature of memorization of training data on a per-sequence basis.</p></details> |  |

Hardware code like Verilog constitutes a small portion of training data, and few hardware benchmarks exist. The open-source VerilogEval benchmark, released in November 2023, provided a consistent evaluation framework for LLMs on code completion tasks. Since then, both commercial and open models have seen significant development. In this work, we evaluate new commercial and open models since VerilogEval's original release-including GPT-4o, GPT-4 Turbo, Llama3.1 (8B/70B/405B), Llama3 70B, Mistral Large, DeepSeek Coder (33B and 6.7B), CodeGemma 7B, and RTL-Coder-against an improved VerilogEval benchmark suite. We find measurable improvements in state-of-the-art models: GPT-4o achieves a 63% pass rate on specification-to-RTL tasks. The recently released and open Llama3.1 405B achieves a 58% pass rate, almost matching GPT-4o, while the smaller domain-specific RTL-Coder 6.7B models achieve an impressive 34% pass rate. Additionally, we enhance VerilogEval's infrastructure by automatically classifying failures, introducing in-context learning support, and extending the tasks to specification-to-RTL translation. We find that prompt engineering remains crucial for achieving good pass rates and varies widely with model and task. A benchmark infrastructure that allows for prompt engineering and failure analysis is essential for continued model development and deployment.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper revisits and improves the benchmark first presented in arXiv:2309.07544.

| **[Evaluation of Large Language Models via Coupled Token Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01754v1)** | 2025-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>State of the art large language models rely on randomization to respond to a prompt. As an immediate consequence, a model may respond differently to the same prompt if asked multiple times. In this work, we argue that the evaluation and ranking of large language models should control for the randomization underpinning their functioning. Our starting point is the development of a causal model for coupled autoregressive generation, which allows different large language models to sample responses with the same source of randomness. Building upon our causal model, we first show that, on evaluations based on benchmark datasets, coupled autoregressive generation leads to the same conclusions as vanilla autoregressive generation but using provably fewer samples. However, we further show that, on evaluations based on (human) pairwise comparisons, coupled and vanilla autoregressive generation can surprisingly lead to different rankings when comparing more than two models, even with an infinite amount of samples. This suggests that the apparent advantage of a model over others in existing evaluation protocols may not be genuine but rather confounded by the randomness inherent to the generation process. To illustrate and complement our theoretical results, we conduct experiments with several large language models from the Llama family. We find that, across multiple knowledge areas from the popular MMLU benchmark dataset, coupled autoregressive generation requires up to 40% fewer samples to reach the same conclusions as vanilla autoregressive generation. Further, using data from the LMSYS Chatbot Arena platform, we find that the win-rates derived from pairwise comparisons by a strong large language model to prompts differ under coupled and vanilla autoregressive generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Breaking Focus: Contextual Distraction Curse in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01609v1)** | 2025-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized generative systems, achieving excellent performance across diverse domains. Although these models perform well in controlled environments, their real-world applications frequently encounter inputs containing both essential and irrelevant details. Our investigation has revealed a critical vulnerability in LLMs, which we term Contextual Distraction Vulnerability (CDV). This phenomenon arises when models fail to maintain consistent performance on questions modified with semantically coherent but irrelevant context. To systematically investigate this vulnerability, we propose an efficient tree-based search methodology to automatically generate CDV examples. Our approach successfully generates CDV examples across four datasets, causing an average performance degradation of approximately 45% in state-of-the-art LLMs. To address this critical issue, we explore various mitigation strategies and find that post-targeted training approaches can effectively enhance model robustness against contextual distractions. Our findings highlight the fundamental nature of CDV as an ability-level challenge rather than a knowledge-level issue since models demonstrate the necessary knowledge by answering correctly in the absence of distractions. This calls the community's attention to address CDV during model development to ensure reliability. The code is available at https://github.com/wyf23187/LLM_CDV.</p></details> |  |

However, many current methodologies evaluate scenarios in isolation, without considering the broader context or the spectrum of potential biases within each situation. To address this, we introduce the Sensitivity Testing on Offensive Progressions (STOP) dataset, which includes 450 offensive progressions containing 2,700 unique sentences of varying severity that progressively escalate from less to more explicitly offensive. Covering a broad spectrum of 9 demographics and 46 sub-demographics, STOP ensures inclusivity and comprehensive coverage. We evaluate several leading closed- and open-source models, including GPT-4, Mixtral, and Llama 3. Our findings reveal that even the best-performing models detect bias inconsistently, with success rates ranging from 19.3% to 69.8%. We also demonstrate how aligning models with human judgments on STOP can improve model answer rates on sensitive tasks such as BBQ, StereoSet, and CrowS-Pairs by up to 191%, while maintaining or even improving performance. STOP presents a novel framework for assessing the complex nature of biases in LLMs, which will enable more effective bias mitigation strategies and facilitates the creation of fairer language models.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages (excluding references), accepted to EMNLP 2024 Main Conference</p></details> |

Existing methods seek to mitigate these risks by applying constrained adversarial fine-tuning to CLIP vision encoders on ImageNet-scale data, ensuring their generalization ability is preserved. However, this limited adversarial training restricts robustness and broader generalization. In this work, we explore an alternative approach of leveraging existing vision classification models that have been adversarially pre-trained on large-scale data. Our analysis reveals two principal contributions: (1) the extensive scale and diversity of adversarial pre-training enables these models to demonstrate superior robustness against diverse adversarial threats, ranging from imperceptible perturbations to advanced jailbreaking attempts, without requiring additional adversarial training, and (2) end-to-end MLLM integration with these robust models facilitates enhanced adaptation of language components to robust visual features, outperforming existing plug-and-play methodologies on complex reasoning tasks. Through systematic evaluation across visual question-answering, image captioning, and jail-break attacks, we demonstrate that MLLMs trained with these robust models achieve superior adversarial robustness while maintaining favorable clean performance. Our framework achieves 2x and 1.5x average robustness gains in captioning and VQA tasks, respectively, and delivers over 10% improvement against jailbreak attacks.

However, these datasets, which often consist of millions of individual data points, frequently contain anomalous movements that pose significant challenges. Traditionally, anomalous movements are identified either manually or through basic statistical methods, approaches that are time-consuming and prone to high rates of unidentified anomalies in large datasets. This study focuses on the development of automated classifiers for a large telemetry dataset comprising detections from fifty acoustically tagged dusky kob monitored in the Breede Estuary, South Africa. Using an array of 16 acoustic receivers deployed throughout the estuary between 2016 and 2021, we collected over three million individual data points. We present detailed guidelines for data pre-processing, resampling strategies, labelling process, feature engineering, data splitting methodologies, and the selection and interpretation of machine learning and deep learning models for anomaly detection. Among the evaluated models, neural networks autoencoder (NN-AE) demonstrated superior performance, aided by our proposed threshold-finding algorithm. NN-AE achieved a high recall with no false normal (i.e., no misclassifications of anomalous movements as normal patterns), a critical factor in ensuring that no true anomalies are overlooked. In contrast, other models exhibited false normal fractions exceeding 0.9, indicating they failed to detect the majority of true anomalies; a significant limitation for telemetry studies where undetected anomalies can distort interpretations of movement patterns. While the NN-AE's performance highlights its reliability and robustness in detecting anomalies, it faced challenges in accurately learning normal movement patterns when these patterns gradually deviated from anomalous ones.</p></details> |  |

As a consequence, learning effective representations of numbers is critical for the success of large language models as they become more integrated into everyday decisions. However, these models face a challenge: depending on context, the same sequence of digit tokens, e.g., 911, can be treated as a number or as a string. What kind of representations arise from this duality, and what are its downstream implications? Using a similarity-based prompting technique from cognitive science, we show that LLMs learn representational spaces that blend string-like and numerical representations. In particular, we show that elicited similarity judgments from these models over integer pairs can be captured by a combination of Levenshtein edit distance and numerical Log-Linear distance, suggesting an entangled representation. In a series of experiments we show how this entanglement is reflected in the latent embeddings, how it can be reduced but not entirely eliminated by context, and how it can propagate into a realistic decision scenario. These results shed light on a representational tension in transformer models that must learn what a number is from text input.</p></details> | 16 pages, 8 figures |

However, with the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs), there has been a notable shift towards incorporating LLMs with vision modalities. Following this, the training paradigms for incorporating vision modalities into LLMs have evolved. Initially, the approach was to integrate the modalities through pretraining the modality integrator, named Single-stage Tuning. It has since branched out into methods focusing on performance enhancement, denoted as Two-stage Tuning, and those prioritizing parameter efficiency, referred to as Direct Adaptation. However, existing surveys primarily address the latest Vision Large Language Models (VLLMs) with Two-stage Tuning, leaving a gap in understanding the evolution of training paradigms and their unique parameter-efficient considerations. This paper categorizes and reviews 34 VLLMs from top conferences, journals, and highly cited Arxiv papers, focusing on parameter efficiency during adaptation from the training paradigm perspective. We first introduce the architecture of LLMs and parameter-efficient learning methods, followed by a discussion on vision encoders and a comprehensive taxonomy of modality integrators. We then review three training paradigms and their efficiency considerations, summarizing benchmarks in the VLLM field. To gain deeper insights into their effectiveness in parameter efficiency, we compare and discuss the experimental results of representative models, among which the experiment of the Direct Adaptation paradigm is replicated. Providing insights into recent developments and practical uses, this survey is a vital guide for researchers and practitioners navigating the efficient integration of vision modalities into LLMs.</p></details> | 28 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Large language models that replace human participants can harmfully misportray and flatten identity groups](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01908v3)** | 2025-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are increasing in capability and popularity, propelling their application in new domains -- including as replacements for human participants in computational social science, user testing, annotation tasks, and more. In many settings, researchers seek to distribute their surveys to a sample of participants that are representative of the underlying human population of interest. This means in order to be a suitable replacement, LLMs will need to be able to capture the influence of positionality (i.e., relevance of social identities like gender and race). However, we show that there are two inherent limitations in the way current LLMs are trained that prevent this. We argue analytically for why LLMs are likely to both misportray and flatten the representations of demographic groups, then empirically show this on 4 LLMs through a series of human studies with 3200 participants across 16 demographic identities. We also discuss a third limitation about how identity prompts can essentialize identities. Throughout, we connect each limitation to a pernicious history of epistemic injustice against the value of lived experiences that explains why replacement is harmful for marginalized demographic groups. Overall, we urge caution in use cases where LLMs are intended to replace human participants whose identities are relevant to the task at hand. At the same time, in cases where the benefits of LLM replacement are determined to outweigh the harms (e.g., the goal is to supplement rather than fully replace, engaging human participants may cause them harm), we provide inference-time techniques that we empirically demonstrate do reduce, but do not remove, these harms.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Nature Machine Intelligence</p></details> |

Machine unlearning has emerged to alleviate this concern; however, existing training-time unlearning approaches, relying on coarse-grained loss combinations, have limitations in precisely separating knowledge and balancing removal effectiveness with model utility. In contrast, we propose Fine-grained Activation manipuLation by Contrastive Orthogonal uNalignment (FALCON), a novel representation-guided unlearning approach that leverages information-theoretic guidance for efficient parameter selection, employs contrastive mechanisms to enhance representation separation, and projects conflict gradients onto orthogonal subspaces to resolve conflicts between forgetting and retention objectives. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FALCON achieves superior unlearning effectiveness while maintaining model utility, exhibiting robust resistance against knowledge recovery attempts.</p></details> | Under Review |
| **[Trust-Oriented Adaptive Guardrails for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08959v2)** | 2025-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Guardrail, an emerging mechanism designed to ensure that large language models (LLMs) align with human values by moderating harmful or toxic responses, requires a sociotechnical approach in their design. This paper addresses a critical issue: existing guardrails lack a well-founded methodology to accommodate the diverse needs of different user groups, particularly concerning access rights. Supported by trust modeling (primarily on `social' aspect) and enhanced with online in-context learning via retrieval-augmented generation (on `technical' aspect), we introduce an adaptive guardrail mechanism, to dynamically moderate access to sensitive content based on user trust metrics. User trust metrics, defined as a novel combination of direct interaction trust and authority-verified trust, enable the system to precisely tailor the strictness of content moderation by aligning with the user's credibility and the specific context of their inquiries. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of the adaptive guardrail in meeting diverse user needs, outperforming existing guardrails while securing sensitive information and precisely managing potentially hazardous content through a context-aware knowledge base. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to introduce trust-oriented concept into a guardrail system, offering a scalable solution that enriches the discourse on ethical deployment for next-generation LLM service.</p></details> | Under Review |

With ever-increasing model capabilities, existing text anonymization methods are currently lacking behind regulatory requirements and adversarial threats. In this work, we take two steps to bridge this gap: First, we present a new setting for evaluating anonymization in the face of adversarial LLM inferences, allowing for a natural measurement of anonymization performance while remedying some of the shortcomings of previous metrics. Then, within this setting, we develop a novel LLM-based adversarial anonymization framework leveraging the strong inferential capabilities of LLMs to inform our anonymization procedure. We conduct a comprehensive experimental evaluation of adversarial anonymization across 13 LLMs on real-world and synthetic online texts, comparing it against multiple baselines and industry-grade anonymizers. Our evaluation shows that adversarial anonymization outperforms current commercial anonymizers both in terms of the resulting utility and privacy. We support our findings with a human study (n=50) highlighting a strong and consistent human preference for LLM-anonymized texts.</p></details> | <details><summary>Inter...</summary><p>International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR 2024)</p></details> |

Despite its benefits, vanilla CoT often fails to fully verify intermediate inferences and can produce misleading explanations. In this work, we propose Layered Chain-of-Thought (Layered-CoT) Prompting, a novel framework that systematically segments the reasoning process into multiple layers, each subjected to external checks and optional user feedback. We expand on the key concepts, present three scenarios -- medical triage, financial risk assessment, and agile engineering -- and demonstrate how Layered-CoT surpasses vanilla CoT in terms of transparency, correctness, and user engagement. By integrating references from recent arXiv papers on interactive explainability, multi-agent frameworks, and agent-based collaboration, we illustrate how Layered-CoT paves the way for more reliable and grounded explanations in high-stakes domains.</p></details> |  |

MIA has become relevant in recent years, following the rapid development of large language models (LLM). Many are concerned about the usage of copyrighted materials for training them and call for methods for detecting such usage. However, recent research has largely concluded that current MIA methods do not work on LLMs. Even when they seem to work, it is usually because of the ill-designed experimental setup where other shortcut features enable "cheating." In this work, we argue that MIA still works on LLMs, but only when multiple documents are presented for testing. We construct new benchmarks that measure the MIA performances at a continuous scale of data samples, from sentences (n-grams) to a collection of documents (multiple chunks of tokens). To validate the efficacy of current MIA approaches at greater scales, we adapt a recent work on Dataset Inference (DI) for the task of binary membership detection that aggregates paragraph-level MIA features to enable MIA at document and collection of documents level. This baseline achieves the first successful MIA on pre-trained and fine-tuned LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Findi...</summary><p>Findings of NAACL 2025.

However, it remains unclear if large language models can effectively explore the state-space within an unknown environment. This work isolates exploration as the sole objective, tasking the agent with delivering information that enhances future returns. Within this framework, we argue that measuring agent returns is not sufficient for a fair evaluation and decompose missing rewards into exploration and exploitation components based on the optimal achievable return. Comprehensive experiments with various models reveal that most struggle to sufficiently explore the state-space and weak exploration is insufficient. We observe a positive correlation between parameter count and exploration performance, with larger models demonstrating superior capabilities. Furthermore, we show that our decomposition provides insights into differences in behaviors driven by prompt engineering, offering a valuable tool for refining performance in exploratory tasks.</p></details> |  |

High-quality captions require a balance between precision and recall, which remains challenging for current multimodal large language models (MLLMs). In this work, we hypothesize that this limitation stems from weakening and increasingly noisy visual attention as responses lengthen. To address this issue, we propose SPARC (Selective Progressive Attention ReCalibration), a training-free method that enhances the contribution of visual tokens during decoding. SPARC is founded on three key observations: (1) increasing the influence of all visual tokens reduces recall; thus, SPARC selectively amplifies visual tokens; (2) as captions lengthen, visual attention becomes noisier, so SPARC identifies critical visual tokens by leveraging attention differences across time steps; (3) as visual attention gradually weakens, SPARC reinforces it to preserve its influence. Our experiments, incorporating both automated and human evaluations, demonstrate that existing methods improve the precision of MLLMs at the cost of recall. In contrast, our proposed method enhances both precision and recall with minimal computational overhead.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we show that RM methods inherently reduce models' robustness, causing them to misbehave even when a single non-adversarial forget-token is in the retain-query. Toward understanding underlying causes, we reframe the unlearning process as backdoor attacks and defenses: forget-tokens act as backdoor triggers that, when activated in retain-queries, cause disruptions in RM models' behaviors, similar to successful backdoor attacks. To mitigate this vulnerability, we propose Random Noise Augmentation -- a model and method agnostic approach with theoretical guarantees for improving the robustness of RM methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RNA significantly improves the robustness of RM models while enhancing the unlearning performances.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 4 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

Many ophthalmic tasks have shown substantial improvement through the integration of LLMs. However, before these models can be widely adopted in clinical practice, evaluating their capabilities and identifying their limitations is crucial. To address this research gap and support the real-world application of LLMs, we introduce the OphthBench, a specialized benchmark designed to assess LLM performance within the context of Chinese ophthalmic practices. This benchmark systematically divides a typical ophthalmic clinical workflow into five key scenarios: Education, Triage, Diagnosis, Treatment, and Prognosis. For each scenario, we developed multiple tasks featuring diverse question types, resulting in a comprehensive benchmark comprising 9 tasks and 591 questions. This comprehensive framework allows for a thorough assessment of LLMs' capabilities and provides insights into their practical application in Chinese ophthalmology. Using this benchmark, we conducted extensive experiments and analyzed the results from 39 popular LLMs. Our evaluation highlights the current gap between LLM development and its practical utility in clinical settings, providing a clear direction for future advancements. By bridging this gap, we aim to unlock the potential of LLMs and advance their development in ophthalmology.</p></details> |  |

Consequently, more techniques, such as input/output guardrails and safety alignment, are proposed to prevent potential misuse of such Human-AI conversations. However, the ability to identify these guardrails has significant implications, both for adversarial exploitation and for auditing purposes by red team operators. In this work, we propose a novel method, AP-Test, which identifies the presence of a candidate guardrail by leveraging guardrail-specific adversarial prompts to query the AI agent. Extensive experiments of four candidate guardrails under diverse scenarios showcase the effectiveness of our method. The ablation study further illustrates the importance of the components we designed, such as the loss terms.</p></details> |  |

We propose \textbf{QLESS} (Quantized Low-rank Gradient Similarity Search), which integrates gradient quantization with the LESS framework to enable memory-efficient data valuation and selection. QLESS employs a two-step compression process: first, it obtains low-dimensional gradient representations through LoRA-based random projection; then, it quantizes these gradients to low-bitwidth representations. Experiments on multiple LLM architectures (LLaMA, Mistral, Qwen) and benchmarks (MMLU, BBH, TyDiQA) show that QLESS achieves comparable data selection performance to LESS while reducing memory usage by up to 16x. Even 1-bit gradient quantization preserves data valuation quality. These findings underscore QLESS as a practical, scalable approach to identifying informative examples within strict memory constraints.</p></details> |  |

Detecting, analyzing, and mitigating such biases is becoming a focus of research. One type of bias that has been understudied so far are geocultural biases. Those can be caused by an imbalance in the representation of different geographic regions and cultures in the training data, but also by value judgments contained therein. In this paper, we make a first step towards analyzing musical biases in LLMs, particularly ChatGPT and Mixtral. We conduct two experiments. In the first, we prompt LLMs to provide lists of the "Top 100" musical contributors of various categories and analyze their countries of origin. In the second experiment, we ask the LLMs to numerically rate various aspects of the musical cultures of different countries. Our results indicate a strong preference of the LLMs for Western music cultures in both experiments.</p></details> |  |

Addressing this, we introduce a method to generate distributions of camera poses conditioned on textual descriptions, facilitating robust reasoning for broadly defined concepts. Our approach employs a diffusion-based architecture to refine noisy 6DoF camera poses towards plausible locations, with conditional signals derived from pre-trained text encoders. Integration with the pretrained Vision-Language Model, CLIP, establishes a strong linkage between text descriptions and pose distributions. Enhancement of localization accuracy is achieved by rendering candidate poses using 3D Gaussian splatting, which corrects misaligned samples through visual reasoning. We validate our method's superiority by comparing it against standard distribution estimation methods across five large-scale datasets, demonstrating consistent outperformance.

These lack interpretability and adaptability, failing to effectively capture behavioral patterns. Many researchers, including us, believe that Large Language Models (LLMs) could bridge this gap due to their robust reasoning abilities for complex tasks. In this paper, we test this hypothesis by applying LLMs to real-world cryptocurrency transaction graphs, specifically within the Bitcoin network. We introduce a three-tiered framework to assess LLM capabilities: foundational metrics, characteristic overview, and contextual interpretation. This includes a new, human-readable graph representation format, LLM4TG, and a connectivity-enhanced sampling algorithm, CETraS, which simplifies larger transaction graphs. Experimental results show that LLMs excel at foundational metrics and offer detailed characteristic overviews. Their effectiveness in contextual interpretation suggests they can provide useful explanations of transaction behaviors, even with limited labeled data.</p></details> |  |

While AudioSet is a pivotal step to bridge this gap as a universal-domain dataset, its restricted accessibility and limited range of evaluation use cases challenge its role as the sole resource. Therefore, we introduce \texttt{BirdSet}, a large-scale benchmark dataset for audio classification focusing on avian bioacoustics. \texttt{BirdSet} surpasses AudioSet with over 6,800 recording hours~($\uparrow\!17\%$) from nearly 10,000 classes~($\uparrow\!18\times$) for training and more than 400 hours~($\uparrow\!7\times$) across eight strongly labeled evaluation datasets. It serves as a versatile resource for use cases such as multi-label classification, covariate shift or self-supervised learning. We benchmark six well-known DL models in multi-label classification across three distinct training scenarios and outline further evaluation use cases in audio classification. We host our dataset on Hugging Face for easy accessibility and offer an extensive codebase to reproduce our results.</p></details> | accepted@ICLR2025 |

Despite significant advancements, the propensity of Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate harmful and unethical content poses critical challenges. Measuring value alignment of LLMs becomes crucial for their regulation and responsible deployment. Although numerous benchmarks have been constructed to assess social bias, toxicity, and ethical issues in LLMs, those static benchmarks suffer from evaluation chronoeffect, in which, as models rapidly evolve, existing benchmarks may leak into training data or become saturated, overestimating ever-developing LLMs. To tackle this problem, we propose GETA, a novel generative evolving testing approach based on adaptive testing methods in measurement theory. Unlike traditional adaptive testing methods that rely on a static test item pool, GETA probes the underlying moral boundaries of LLMs by dynamically generating test items tailored to model capability. GETA co-evolves with LLMs by learning a joint distribution of item difficulty and model value conformity, thus effectively addressing evaluation chronoeffect. We evaluated various popular LLMs with GETA and demonstrated that 1) GETA can dynamically create difficulty-tailored test items and 2) GETA's evaluation results are more consistent with models' performance on unseen OOD and i.i.d. items, laying the groundwork for future evaluation paradigms.</p></details> | Under Review |

This paper introduces a novel inference-time alignment approach that ensures LLMs generate safe responses almost surely, i.e., with a probability approaching one. We achieve this by framing the safe generation of inference-time responses as a constrained Markov decision process within the LLM's latent space. Crucially, we augment a safety state that tracks the evolution of safety constraints and enables us to demonstrate formal safety guarantees upon solving the MDP in the latent space. Building on this foundation, we propose InferenceGuard, a practical implementation that safely aligns LLMs without modifying the model weights. Empirically, we demonstrate InferenceGuard effectively balances safety and task performance, outperforming existing inference-time alignment methods in generating safe and aligned responses.</p></details> |  |

However, annotating RS images with rich linguistic semantics at scale demands expertise in RS and substantial human labor, making it costly and often impractical. In this study, we propose a workflow that leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate multimodal datasets with semantically rich captions at scale from plain OpenStreetMap (OSM) data for images sourced from the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. This approach facilitates the generation of paired remote sensing data and can be readily scaled up using openly available data. Within this framework, we present RSTeller, a multimodal dataset comprising over 1.3 million RS images, each accompanied by two descriptive captions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RSTeller enhances the performance of multiple existing vision language models for RS scene understanding through continual pre-training. Our methodology significantly reduces the manual effort and expertise needed for annotating remote sensing imagery while democratizing access to high-quality annotated data. This advancement fosters progress in visual language modeling and encourages broader participation in remote sensing research and applications.

This paper examines memorization in LLM supervised fine-tuning (SFT), exploring its relationships with training duration, dataset size, and inter-sample similarity. By analyzing memorization probabilities over sequence lengths, we link this skewness to the token generation process, offering insights for estimating memorization and comparing it to established metrics. Through theoretical analysis and empirical evaluation, we provide a comprehensive understanding of memorization behaviors and propose strategies to detect and mitigate risks, contributing to more privacy-preserving LLMs.</p></details> |  |

However, our study identifies significant risks associated with this technique. First, we demonstrate that autotuning, a method used to auto-select models' roles based on the question, can lead to the generation of harmful outputs, even when the model is tasked with adopting neutral roles. Second, we investigate how different roles affect the likelihood of generating biased or harmful content. Through testing on benchmarks containing stereotypical and harmful questions, we find that role-play consistently amplifies the risk of biased outputs. Our results underscore the need for careful consideration of both role simulation and tuning processes when deploying LLMs in sensitive or high-stakes contexts.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 7 figures, 3 tables, submitted to CogSci 2025</p></details> |

However, leveraging LLMs effectively in this domain requires a robust and comprehensive evaluation benchmark. To address this need, we present AtmosSci-Bench, a novel benchmark designed to systematically assess LLM performance across five core categories of atmospheric science problems: hydrology, atmospheric dynamics, atmospheric physics, geophysics, and physical oceanography. We employ a template-based question generation framework, enabling scalable and diverse multiple-choice questions curated from graduate-level atmospheric science problems. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of representative LLMs, categorized into four groups: instruction-tuned models, advanced reasoning models, math-augmented models, and domain-specific climate models. Our analysis provides some interesting insights into the reasoning and problem-solving capabilities of LLMs in atmospheric science. We believe AtmosSci-Bench can serve as a critical step toward advancing LLM applications in climate service by offering a standard and rigorous evaluation framework.

Meanwhile, integrating reasoning with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) remains challenging due to ineffective task decomposition and redundant retrieval, which can introduce noise and degrade response quality. In this paper, we propose DeepRAG, a framework that models retrieval-augmented reasoning as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), enabling strategic and adaptive retrieval. By iteratively decomposing queries, DeepRAG dynamically determines whether to retrieve external knowledge or rely on parametric reasoning at each step. Experiments show that DeepRAG improves retrieval efficiency while improving answer accuracy by 21.99%, demonstrating its effectiveness in optimizing retrieval-augmented reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large Language Model-Enhanced Multi-Armed Bandits](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01118v1)** | 2025-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have been adopted to solve sequential decision-making tasks such as multi-armed bandits (MAB), in which an LLM is directly instructed to select the arms to pull in every iteration. However, this paradigm of direct arm selection using LLMs has been shown to be suboptimal in many MAB tasks. Therefore, we propose an alternative approach which combines the strengths of classical MAB and LLMs. Specifically, we adopt a classical MAB algorithm as the high-level framework and leverage the strong in-context learning capability of LLMs to perform the sub-task of reward prediction. Firstly, we incorporate the LLM-based reward predictor into the classical Thompson sampling (TS) algorithm and adopt a decaying schedule for the LLM temperature to ensure a transition from exploration to exploitation. Next, we incorporate the LLM-based reward predictor (with a temperature of 0) into a regression oracle-based MAB algorithm equipped with an explicit exploration mechanism. We also extend our TS-based algorithm to dueling bandits where only the preference feedback between pairs of arms is available, which requires non-trivial algorithmic modifications. We conduct empirical evaluations using both synthetic MAB tasks and experiments designed using real-world text datasets, in which the results show that our algorithms consistently outperform previous baseline methods based on direct arm selection. Interestingly, we also demonstrate that in challenging tasks where the arms lack semantic meanings that can be exploited by the LLM, our approach achieves considerably better performance than LLM-based direct arm selection.</p></details> | Preprint |

These works often include classical Chinese and complex narratives, making them difficult for children to read. To bridge this gap, we introduce a child-friendly literary adaptation (CLA) task to adapt the Chinese literary classic into engaging and accessible text for children. However, recent large language models (LLMs) overlook children's reading preferences (\ie, vivid character portrayals, concise narrative structures, and appropriate readability), which poses challenges in CLA. In this paper, we propose a method called InstructChild, which augments the LLM with these preferences for adaptation. Specifically, we first obtain the characters' personalities and narrative structure as additional information for fine-grained instruction tuning. Then, we devise a readability metric as the reward to align the LLM with the children's reading level. Finally, a lookahead decoding strategy is applied to improve the readability of the generated text during inference. To support the evaluation of CLA task, we construct the Classic4Children dataset, which comprises both the original and child-friendly versions of the Four Great Classical Novels of Chinese literature. Experimental results show that our InstructChild significantly improves automatic and human evaluation performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NAACL 2025 Findings</p></details> |

Therefore, some attempts employ In-context Learning (ICL) to explore the potential of large language models (LLMs) for their extensive knowledge and complex reasoning abilities. However, these efforts are inadequate in understanding mulitmodal data and exploiting LLMs' knowledge for product bundling. To bridge the gap, we introduce Bundle-MLLM, a novel framework that fine-tunes LLMs through a hybrid item tokenization approach within a well-designed optimization strategy. Specifically, we integrate textual, media, and relational data into a unified tokenization, introducing a soft separation token to distinguish between textual and non-textual tokens. Additionally, a streamlined yet powerful multimodal fusion module is employed to embed all non-textual features into a single, informative token, significantly boosting efficiency. To tailor product bundling tasks for LLMs, we reformulate the task as a multiple-choice question with candidate items as options. We further propose a progressive optimization strategy that fine-tunes LLMs for disentangled objectives: 1) learning bundle patterns and 2) enhancing multimodal semantic understanding specific to product bundling. Extensive experiments on four datasets across two domains demonstrate that our approach outperforms a range of state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by KDD 2025 (CR)</p></details> |
| **[Knowledge Synthesis of Photosynthesis Research Using a Large Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01059v1)** | 2025-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The development of biological data analysis tools and large language models (LLMs) has opened up new possibilities for utilizing AI in plant science research, with the potential to contribute significantly to knowledge integration and research gap identification. Nonetheless, current LLMs struggle to handle complex biological data and theoretical models in photosynthesis research and often fail to provide accurate scientific contexts. Therefore, this study proposed a photosynthesis research assistant (PRAG) based on OpenAI's GPT-4o with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) techniques and prompt optimization. Vector databases and an automated feedback loop were used in the prompt optimization process to enhance the accuracy and relevance of the responses to photosynthesis-related queries. PRAG showed an average improvement of 8.7% across five metrics related to scientific writing, with a 25.4% increase in source transparency. Additionally, its scientific depth and domain coverage were comparable to those of photosynthesis research papers. A knowledge graph was used to structure PRAG's responses with papers within and outside the database, which allowed PRAG to match key entities with 63% and 39.5% of the database and test papers, respectively. PRAG can be applied for photosynthesis research and broader plant science domains, paving the way for more in-depth data analysis and predictive capabilities.</p></details> | 17 pages, 6 figures |

Nevertheless, LVLMs remain vulnerable to the issue of object hallucinations. Previous efforts to mitigate this issue focus on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or incorporating external knowledge, both of which entail significant costs related to training and the acquisition of external data. To address these challenges, we propose a novel model-agnostic approach termed Internal Fact-based Contrastive Decoding (IFCD), designed to mitigate and suppress hallucinations during the inference process of LVLMs by exploiting the LVLMs' own hallucinations. IFCD is grounded in experimental observations that alterations to the LVLMs' internal representations tend to amplify hallucinations caused by language bias. By contrasting disturbed distribution, IFCD calibrates the LVLMs' output and effectively removes the hallucinatory logits from the final predictions. Experimental results validate that IFCD significantly alleviates both object-level and attribute-level hallucinations while achieving an average 9% accuracy improvement on POPE and 8% accuracy improvement on MME object hallucinations subset compared with direct decoding, respectively.</p></details> |  |

This study aimed to investigate how LLMs are currently used in qualitative analysis and their potential applications in software engineering research, focusing on the benefits, limitations, and practices associated with their use. A systematic mapping study was conducted, analyzing 21 relevant studies to explore reported uses of LLMs for qualitative analysis. The findings indicate that LLMs are primarily used for tasks such as coding, thematic analysis, and data categorization, offering benefits like increased efficiency and support for new researchers. However, limitations such as output variability, challenges in capturing nuanced perspectives, and ethical concerns related to privacy and transparency were also identified. The study emphasizes the need for structured strategies and guidelines to optimize LLM use in qualitative research within software engineering, enhancing their effectiveness while addressing ethical considerations. While LLMs show promise in supporting qualitative analysis, human expertise remains crucial for interpreting data, and ongoing exploration of best practices will be vital for their successful integration into empirical software engineering research.</p></details> |  |

We present dynamic context cutoff, a human-inspired method enabling LLMs to self-terminate processing upon acquiring sufficient task-relevant information. Through analysis of model internals, we discover that specific attention heads inherently encode "sufficiency signals" - detectable through lightweight classifiers - that predict when critical information has been processed. This reveals a new efficiency paradigm: models' internal understanding naturally dictates processing needs rather than external compression heuristics. Comprehensive experiments across six QA datasets (up to 40K tokens) with three model families (LLaMA/Qwen/Mistral, 1B0-70B) demonstrate 1.33x average token reduction while improving accuracy by 1.3%. Furthermore, our method demonstrates better performance with the same rate of token reduction compared to other context efficiency methods. Additionally, we observe an emergent scaling phenomenon: while smaller models require require probing for sufficiency detection, larger models exhibit intrinsic self-assessment capabilities through prompting.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Website: https://royxie.com/when-to-stop-project/</p></details> |

However, this swift advancement has also introduced new vulnerabilities. Jailbreaking, a form of attack that induces LLMs to produce harmful content through carefully crafted prompts, presents a significant challenge to the safe and trustworthy development of LLMs. Previous jailbreak methods primarily exploited the internal properties or capabilities of LLMs, such as optimization-based jailbreak methods and methods that leveraged the model's context-learning abilities. In this paper, we introduce a novel jailbreak method, SQL Injection Jailbreak (SIJ), which targets the external properties of LLMs, specifically, the way LLMs construct input prompts. By injecting jailbreak information into user prompts, SIJ successfully induces the model to output harmful content. Our SIJ method achieves near 100\% attack success rates on five well-known open-source LLMs on the AdvBench and HEx-PHI, while incurring lower time costs compared to previous methods. For closed-source models, SIJ achieves near 100% attack success rate on GPT-3.5-turbo. Additionally, SIJ exposes a new vulnerability in LLMs that urgently requires mitigation. To address this, we propose a simple defense method called Self-Reminder-Key to counter SIJ and demonstrate its effectiveness through experimental results.

| **[Encrypted Large Model Inference: The Equivariant Encryption Paradigm](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01013v1)** | 2025-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large scale deep learning model, such as modern language models and diffusion architectures, have revolutionized applications ranging from natural language processing to computer vision. However, their deployment in distributed or decentralized environments raises significant privacy concerns, as sensitive data may be exposed during inference. Traditional techniques like secure multi-party computation, homomorphic encryption, and differential privacy offer partial remedies but often incur substantial computational overhead, latency penalties, or limited compatibility with non-linear network operations. In this work, we introduce Equivariant Encryption (EE), a novel paradigm designed to enable secure, "blind" inference on encrypted data with near zero performance overhead. Unlike fully homomorphic approaches that encrypt the entire computational graph, EE selectively obfuscates critical internal representations within neural network layers while preserving the exact functionality of both linear and a prescribed set of non-linear operations. This targeted encryption ensures that raw inputs, intermediate activations, and outputs remain confidential, even when processed on untrusted infrastructure. We detail the theoretical foundations of EE, compare its performance and integration complexity against conventional privacy preserving techniques, and demonstrate its applicability across a range of architectures, from convolutional networks to large language models. Furthermore, our work provides a comprehensive threat analysis, outlining potential attack vectors and baseline strategies, and benchmarks EE against standard inference pipelines in decentralized settings. The results confirm that EE maintains high fidelity and throughput, effectively bridging the gap between robust data confidentiality and the stringent efficiency requirements of modern, large scale model inference.</p></details> |  |

Depending on the $\ell_1$ and $\ell_{\infty}$ norms of the squared difference of vectorized pre-change and post-change correlation matrices, detection statistics are constructed for dense and sparse settings, respectively. The proposed detection procedures possess the bless-dimension property, as a novel algorithm for threshold selection is designed based on sign-flip permutation. Theoretical evaluations of the proposed methods are conducted in terms of average run length and expected detection delay. Numerical studies are conducted to examine the finite sample performances of the proposed methods. Our methods are effective because the average detection delays have slopes similar to that of the optimal exact CUSUM test. Moreover, a combined $\ell_1$ and $\ell_{\infty}$ norm approach is proposed and has expected performance for transitions from sparse to dense settings. Our method is applied to forecast El Ni{\~n}o events and achieves state-of-the-art hit rates greater than 0.86, while false alarm rates are 0. This application illustrates the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed methodology in detecting fundamental changes with minimal delay.</p></details> |  |

When such base models are deprecated and replaced, all associated LoRA modules must be retrained, requiring access to either the original training data or a substantial amount of synthetic data that mirrors the original distribution. However, the original data is often inaccessible due to privacy or licensing issues, and generating synthetic data may be impractical and insufficiently representative. These factors complicate the fine-tuning process considerably. To address this challenge, we introduce a new adapter, Cross-Model Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA-X), which enables the training-free transfer of LoRA parameters across source and target models, eliminating the need for original or synthetic training data. Our approach imposes the adapter to operate within the subspace of the source base model. This constraint is necessary because our prior knowledge of the target model is limited to its weights, and the criteria for ensuring the adapter's transferability are restricted to the target base model's weights and subspace. To facilitate the transfer of LoRA parameters of the source model to a target model, we employ the adapter only in the layers of the target model that exhibit an acceptable level of subspace similarity. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of LoRA-X for text-to-image generation, including Stable Diffusion v1.5 and Stable Diffusion XL.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2025</p></details> |
| **[Decision Theoretic Foundations for Conformal Prediction: Optimal Uncertainty Quantification for Risk-Averse Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02561v1)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A fundamental question in data-driven decision making is how to quantify the uncertainty of predictions in ways that can usefully inform downstream action. This interface between prediction uncertainty and decision-making is especially important in risk-sensitive domains, such as medicine. In this paper, we develop decision-theoretic foundations that connect uncertainty quantification using prediction sets with risk-averse decision-making. Specifically, we answer three fundamental questions: (1) What is the correct notion of uncertainty quantification for risk-averse decision makers? We prove that prediction sets are optimal for decision makers who wish to optimize their value at risk. (2) What is the optimal policy that a risk averse decision maker should use to map prediction sets to actions? We show that a simple max-min decision policy is optimal for risk-averse decision makers. Finally, (3) How can we derive prediction sets that are optimal for such decision makers? We provide an exact characterization in the population regime and a distribution free finite-sample construction. Answering these questions naturally leads to an algorithm, Risk-Averse Calibration (RAC), which follows a provably optimal design for deriving action policies from predictions. RAC is designed to be both practical-capable of leveraging the quality of predictions in a black-box manner to enhance downstream utility-and safe-adhering to a user-defined risk threshold and optimizing the corresponding risk quantile of the user's downstream utility. Finally, we experimentally demonstrate the significant advantages of RAC in applications such as medical diagnosis and recommendation systems. Specifically, we show that RAC achieves a substantially improved trade-off between safety and utility, offering higher utility compared to existing methods while maintaining the safety guarantee.</p></details> |  |

Our method addresses three critical requirements for effective training: precise 3D region segmentation, comprehensive textual descriptions, and sufficient dataset scale. By leveraging state-of-the-art open-vocabulary image segmentation models and region-aware Vision-Language Models, we develop an automatic pipeline that generates high-quality 3D mask-text pairs. Applying this pipeline to multiple 3D scene datasets, we create Mosaic3D-5.6M, a dataset of over 30K annotated scenes with 5.6M mask-text pairs, significantly larger than existing datasets. Building upon this data, we propose Mosaic3D, a foundation model combining a 3D encoder trained with contrastive learning and a lightweight mask decoder for open-vocabulary 3D semantic and instance segmentation. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on open-vocabulary 3D semantic and instance segmentation tasks including ScanNet200, Matterport3D, and ScanNet++, with ablation studies validating the effectiveness of our large-scale training data.</p></details> | <details><summary>proje...</summary><p>project page: https://nvlabs.github.io/Mosaic3D/</p></details> |

Even when using MRI, radiologists exhibit low specificity and significant inter-observer variability, leading to potential delays or inaccuracies in identifying clinically significant cancers. This leads to numerous unnecessary biopsies and risks of missing clinically significant cancers. Here we present prostate vision contrastive network (ProViCNet), prostate organ-specific vision foundation models for Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Trans-Rectal Ultrasound imaging (TRUS) for comprehensive cancer detection. ProViCNet was trained and validated using 4,401 patients across six institutions, as a prostate cancer detection model on radiology images relying on patch-level contrastive learning guided by biopsy confirmed radiologist annotations. ProViCNet demonstrated consistent performance across multiple internal and external validation cohorts with area under the receiver operating curve values ranging from 0.875 to 0.966, significantly outperforming radiologists in the reader study (0.907 versus 0.805, p<0.001) for mpMRI, while achieving 0.670 to 0.740 for TRUS. We also integrated ProViCNet with standard PSA to develop a virtual screening test, and we showed that we can maintain the high sensitivity for detecting clinically significant cancers while more than doubling specificity from 15% to 38% (p<0.001), thereby substantially reducing unnecessary biopsies. These findings highlight that ProViCNet's potential for enhancing prostate cancer diagnosis accuracy and reduce unnecessary biopsies, thereby optimizing diagnostic pathways.</p></details> | 44pages |

However, the advantages of domain-specific histopathology foundation models over general-purpose models for specialized tasks such as cell analysis remain underexplored. This study investigates the representation learning gap between these two categories by analyzing multi-level patch embeddings applied to cell instance segmentation and classification. We implement an encoder-decoder architecture with a consistent decoder and various encoders. These include convolutional, vision transformer (ViT), and hybrid encoders pre-trained on ImageNet-22K or LVD-142M, representing general-purpose foundation models. These are compared against ViT encoders from the recently released UNI, Virchow2, and Prov-GigaPath foundation models, trained on patches extracted from hundreds of thousands of histopathology whole-slide images. The decoder integrates patch embeddings from different encoder depths via skip connections to generate semantic and distance maps. These maps are then post-processed to create instance segmentation masks where each label corresponds to an individual cell and to perform cell-type classification. All encoders remain frozen during training to assess their pre-trained feature extraction capabilities. Using the PanNuke and CoNIC histopathology datasets, and the newly introduced Nissl-stained CytoDArk0 dataset for brain cytoarchitecture studies, we evaluate instance-level detection, segmentation accuracy, and cell-type classification. This study provides insights into the comparative strengths and limitations of general-purpose vs. histopathology foundation models, offering guidance for model selection in cell-focused histopathology and brain cytoarchitecture analysis workflows.</p></details> |  |

Since most resources are developed primarily for English, cross-linguistic applications of moral foundation theory remain limited. Using Chinese as a case study, this paper evaluates the effectiveness of applying English resources to machine translated text, local language lexicons, multilingual language models, and large language models (LLMs) in measuring MFs in non-English texts. The results indicate that machine translation and local lexicon approaches are insufficient for complex moral assessments, frequently resulting in a substantial loss of cultural information. In contrast, multilingual models and LLMs demonstrate reliable cross-language performance with transfer learning, with LLMs excelling in terms of data efficiency. Importantly, this study also underscores the need for human-in-the-loop validation of automated MF assessment, as the most advanced models may overlook cultural nuances in cross-language measurements. The findings highlight the potential of LLMs for cross-language MF measurements and other complex multilingual deductive coding tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 2 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |

However, a significant challenge lies in the scarcity and high cost of obtaining high-quality materials datasets. While foundation models pre-trained on large datasets have excelled in fields like natural language processing by leveraging latent features through transfer learning, their application in materials science remains limited. Here, we present a foundation model specifically designed for composite materials. Pre-trained on a dataset of short-fiber composites to learn robust latent features, the model accurately predicts homogenized stiffness during transfer learning, even with limited training data. Additionally, our model effectively predicts the material's nonlinear behavior by transferring these learned features to an Interaction-based Material Network, which is a constitutive surrogate model. These results demonstrate the potential of our foundation model to capture complex material behaviors. Our findings validate the feasibility and effectiveness of foundation models in composite materials. We anticipate extending this approach to more complex three-dimensional composite materials, polycrystalline materials, and beyond. Moreover, this framework enables high-accuracy predictions even when experimental data are scarce, paving the way for more efficient and cost-effective materials design and analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Domain Graph Foundation Models: Robust Knowledge Transfer via Topology Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02017v1)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in CV and NLP have inspired researchers to develop general-purpose graph foundation models through pre-training across diverse domains. However, a fundamental challenge arises from the substantial differences in graph topologies across domains. Additionally, real-world graphs are often sparse and prone to noisy connections and adversarial attacks. To address these issues, we propose the Multi-Domain Graph Foundation Model (MDGFM), a unified framework that aligns and leverages cross-domain topological information to facilitate robust knowledge transfer. MDGFM bridges different domains by adaptively balancing features and topology while refining original graphs to eliminate noise and align topological structures. To further enhance knowledge transfer, we introduce an efficient prompt-tuning approach. By aligning topologies, MDGFM not only improves multi-domain pre-training but also enables robust knowledge transfer to unseen domains. Theoretical analyses provide guarantees of MDGFM's effectiveness and domain generalization capabilities. Extensive experiments on both homophilic and heterophilic graph datasets validate the robustness and efficacy of our method.</p></details> |  |

However, the representation learning capabilities of videotext retrieval models remain constrained by lowquality and limited training data annotations. To address this issue, we present a novel ViDeoText Retrieval Paradigm with RElevance-based AugMentation, namely DREAM, which enhances video and text data using large foundation models to learn more generalized features. Specifically, we first adopt a simple augmentation method, which generates self-similar data by randomly duplicating or dropping subwords and frames. In addition, inspired by the recent advancement in visual and language generative models, we propose a more robust augmentation method through textual paraphrasing and video stylization using large language models (LLMs) and visual generative models (VGMs). To further enrich video and text information, we propose a relevance-based augmentation method, where LLMs and VGMs generate and integrate new relevant information into the original data. Leveraging this enriched data, extensive experiments on several video-text retrieval benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of DREAM over existing methods.</p></details> | NAACL 2025 |

Recent advances in automated harvesting offer a promising solution by enabling efficient, cost-effective, and ergonomic fruit picking within tight harvesting windows. However, existing harvesting technologies often indiscriminately harvest all visible and accessible fruits, including those that are unripe or undersized. This study introduces a novel foundation model-based framework for efficient apple ripeness and size estimation. Specifically, we curated two public RGBD-based Fuji apple image datasets, integrating expanded annotations for ripeness ("Ripe" vs. "Unripe") based on fruit color and image capture dates. The resulting comprehensive dataset, Fuji-Ripeness-Size Dataset, includes 4,027 images and 16,257 annotated apples with ripeness and size labels. Using Grounding-DINO, a language-model-based object detector, we achieved robust apple detection and ripeness classification, outperforming other state-of-the-art models. Additionally, we developed and evaluated six size estimation algorithms, selecting the one with the lowest error and variation for optimal performance. The Fuji-Ripeness-Size Dataset and the apple detection and size estimation algorithms are made publicly available, which provides valuable benchmarks for future studies in automated and selective harvesting.</p></details> |  |

Extending these capabilities to unseen multimodal distributions, i.e., multimodal domain adaptation and generalization, is even more challenging due to the distinct characteristics of different modalities. Significant progress has been made over the years, with applications ranging from action recognition to semantic segmentation. Besides, the recent advent of large-scale pre-trained multimodal foundation models, such as CLIP, has inspired works leveraging these models to enhance adaptation and generalization performances or adapting them to downstream tasks. This survey provides the first comprehensive review of recent advances from traditional approaches to foundation models, covering: (1) Multimodal domain adaptation; (2) Multimodal test-time adaptation; (3) Multimodal domain generalization; (4) Domain adaptation and generalization with the help of multimodal foundation models; and (5) Adaptation of multimodal foundation models. For each topic, we formally define the problem and thoroughly review existing methods. Additionally, we analyze relevant datasets and applications, highlighting open challenges and potential future research directions.

Trained on 4.2M global time series samples from NASA's Harmonized Landsat and Sentinel-2 data archive at 30m resolution, the new 300M and 600M parameter models incorporate temporal and location embeddings for enhanced performance across various geospatial tasks. Through extensive benchmarking with GEO-Bench, the 600M version outperforms the previous Prithvi-EO model by 8\% across a range of tasks. It also outperforms six other geospatial foundation models when benchmarked on remote sensing tasks from different domains and resolutions (i.e. from 0.1m to 15m). The results demonstrate the versatility of the model in both classical earth observation and high-resolution applications. Early involvement of end-users and subject matter experts (SMEs) are among the key factors that contributed to the project's success. In particular, SME involvement allowed for constant feedback on model and dataset design, as well as successful customization for diverse SME-led applications in disaster response, land use and crop mapping, and ecosystem dynamics monitoring. Prithvi-EO-2.0 is available on Hugging Face and IBM terratorch, with additional resources on GitHub. The project exemplifies the Trusted Open Science approach embraced by all involved organizations.</p></details> |  |

To formalise certain properties of the data and to ensure data quality, there is a need to describe the schema of such graphs. Because of the breadth of applications and availability of different data models, such as RDF and property graphs, both the Semantic Web and the database community have independently developed graph schema languages: SHACL, ShEx, and PG-Schema. Each language has its unique approach to defining constraints and validating graph data, leaving potential users in the dark about their commonalities and differences. In this paper, we provide formal, concise definitions of the core components of each of these schema languages. We employ a uniform framework to facilitate a comprehensive comparison between the languages and identify a common set of functionalities, shedding light on both overlapping and distinctive features of the three languages.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be published at WWW 2025</p></details> |
| **[A Framework for Double-Blind Federated Adaptation of Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01289v1)** | 2025-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The availability of foundational models (FMs) pre-trained on large-scale data has advanced the state-of-the-art in many computer vision tasks. While FMs have demonstrated good zero-shot performance on many image classification tasks, there is often scope for performance improvement by adapting the FM to the downstream task. However, the data that is required for this adaptation typically exists in silos across multiple entities (data owners) and cannot be collated at a central location due to regulations and privacy concerns. At the same time, a learning service provider (LSP) who owns the FM cannot share the model with the data owners due to proprietary reasons. In some cases, the data owners may not even have the resources to store such large FMs. Hence, there is a need for algorithms to adapt the FM in a double-blind federated manner, i.e., the data owners do not know the FM or each other's data, and the LSP does not see the data for the downstream tasks. In this work, we propose a framework for double-blind federated adaptation of FMs using fully homomorphic encryption (FHE). The proposed framework first decomposes the FM into a sequence of FHE-friendly blocks through knowledge distillation. The resulting FHE-friendly model is adapted for the downstream task via low-rank parallel adapters that can be learned without backpropagation through the FM. Since the proposed framework requires the LSP to share intermediate representations with the data owners, we design a privacy-preserving permutation scheme to prevent the data owners from learning the FM through model extraction attacks. Finally, a secure aggregation protocol is employed for federated learning of the low-rank parallel adapters. Empirical results on four datasets demonstrate the practical feasibility of the proposed framework.</p></details> |  |

The technique utilizes image segmentation methods to identify fixed regions for calculating feature importance scores as explanations. Therefore, poor segmentation can weaken the explanation and reduce the importance of segments, ultimately affecting the overall clarity of interpretation. To address these challenges, we introduce the DSEG-LIME (Data-Driven Segmentation LIME) framework, featuring: i) a data-driven segmentation for human-recognized feature generation by foundation model integration, and ii) a user-steered granularity in the hierarchical segmentation procedure through composition. Our findings demonstrate that DSEG outperforms on several XAI metrics on pre-trained ImageNet models and improves the alignment of explanations with human-recognized concepts.

| **[Exploring Few-Shot Defect Segmentation in General Industrial Scenarios with Metric Learning and Vision Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01216v1)** | 2025-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Industrial defect segmentation is critical for manufacturing quality control. Due to the scarcity of training defect samples, few-shot semantic segmentation (FSS) holds significant value in this field. However, existing studies mostly apply FSS to tackle defects on simple textures, without considering more diverse scenarios. This paper aims to address this gap by exploring FSS in broader industrial products with various defect types. To this end, we contribute a new real-world dataset and reorganize some existing datasets to build a more comprehensive few-shot defect segmentation (FDS) benchmark. On this benchmark, we thoroughly investigate metric learning-based FSS methods, including those based on meta-learning and those based on Vision Foundation Models (VFMs). We observe that existing meta-learning-based methods are generally not well-suited for this task, while VFMs hold great potential. We further systematically study the applicability of various VFMs in this task, involving two paradigms: feature matching and the use of Segment Anything (SAM) models. We propose a novel efficient FDS method based on feature matching. Meanwhile, we find that SAM2 is particularly effective for addressing FDS through its video track mode. The contributed dataset and code will be available at: https://github.com/liutongkun/GFDS.</p></details> |  |
| **[Al-Khwarizmi: Discovering Physical Laws with Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01702v1)** | 2025-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inferring physical laws from data is a central challenge in science and engineering, including but not limited to healthcare, physical sciences, biosciences, social sciences, sustainability, climate, and robotics. Deep networks offer high-accuracy results but lack interpretability, prompting interest in models built from simple components. The Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy) method has become the go-to approach for building such modular and interpretable models. SINDy leverages sparse regression with L1 regularization to identify key terms from a library of candidate functions. However, SINDy's choice of candidate library and optimization method requires significant technical expertise, limiting its widespread applicability. This work introduces Al-Khwarizmi, a novel agentic framework for physical law discovery from data, which integrates foundational models with SINDy. Leveraging LLMs, VLMs, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), our approach automates physical law discovery, incorporating prior knowledge and iteratively refining candidate solutions via reflection. Al-Khwarizmi operates in two steps: it summarizes system observations-comprising textual descriptions, raw data, and plots-followed by a secondary step that generates candidate feature libraries and optimizer configurations to identify hidden physics laws correctly. Evaluating our algorithm on over 198 models, we demonstrate state-of-the-art performance compared to alternatives, reaching a 20 percent increase against the best-performing alternative.</p></details> |  |
| **[GFM-RAG: Graph Foundation Model for Retrieval Augmented Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01113v1)** | 2025-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has proven effective in integrating knowledge into large language models (LLMs). However, conventional RAGs struggle to capture complex relationships between pieces of knowledge, limiting their performance in intricate reasoning that requires integrating knowledge from multiple sources. Recently, graph-enhanced retrieval augmented generation (GraphRAG) builds graph structure to explicitly model these relationships, enabling more effective and efficient retrievers. Nevertheless, its performance is still hindered by the noise and incompleteness within the graph structure. To address this, we introduce GFM-RAG, a novel graph foundation model (GFM) for retrieval augmented generation. GFM-RAG is powered by an innovative graph neural network that reasons over graph structure to capture complex query-knowledge relationships. The GFM with 8M parameters undergoes a two-stage training process on large-scale datasets, comprising 60 knowledge graphs with over 14M triples and 700k documents. This results in impressive performance and generalizability for GFM-RAG, making it the first graph foundation model applicable to unseen datasets for retrieval without any fine-tuning required. Extensive experiments on three multi-hop QA datasets and seven domain-specific RAG datasets demonstrate that GFM-RAG achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining efficiency and alignment with neural scaling laws, highlighting its potential for further improvement.</p></details> | 19 pages, 6 figures |

Traditional processing methods rely heavily on task-specific designs to address these challenges and fail to account for the variability of data. To address these limitations, we present a generative seismic foundation model (GSFM), a unified framework based on generative diffusion models (GDMs), designed to tackle multi-task seismic processing challenges, including denoising, backscattered noise attenuation, interpolation, and low-frequency extrapolation. GSFM leverages a pre-training stage on synthetic data to capture the features of clean, complete, and broadband seismic data distributions and applies an iterative fine-tuning strategy to adapt the model to field data. By adopting a target-oriented diffusion process prediction, GSFM improves computational efficiency without compromising accuracy. Synthetic data tests demonstrate GSFM surpasses benchmarks with equivalent architectures in all tasks and achieves performance comparable to traditional pre-training strategies, even after their fine-tuning. Also, field data tests suggest that our iterative fine-tuning approach addresses the generalization limitations of conventional pre-training and fine-tuning paradigms, delivering significantly enhanced performance across diverse tasks. Furthermore, GSFM's inherent probabilistic nature enables effective uncertainty quantification, offering valuable insights into the reliability of processing results.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we introduce Pulse-PPG, the first open-source PPG foundation model trained exclusively on raw PPG data collected over a 100-day field study with 120 participants. Existing PPG foundation models are either open-source but trained on clinical data or closed-source, limiting their applicability in real-world settings. We evaluate Pulse-PPG across multiple datasets and downstream tasks, comparing its performance against a state-of-the-art foundation model trained on clinical data. Our results demonstrate that Pulse-PPG, trained on uncurated field data, exhibits superior generalization across clinical and mobile health applications in both lab and field settings. This suggests that exposure to real-world variability enables the model to learn fine-grained representations, making it more adaptable across tasks. Furthermore, pre-training on field data surprisingly outperforms its pre-training on clinical data in many tasks, reinforcing the importance of training on real-world, diverse datasets. To encourage further advancements in robust foundation models leveraging field data, we plan to release Pulse-PPG, providing researchers with a powerful resource for developing more generalizable PPG-based models.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The first two listed authors contributed equally to this research</p></details> |
| **[Adapting Foundation Models for Few-Shot Medical Image Segmentation: Actively and Sequentially](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01000v1)** | 2025-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in foundation models have brought promising results in computer vision, including medical image segmentation. Fine-tuning foundation models on specific low-resource medical tasks has become a standard practice. However, ensuring reliable and robust model adaptation when the target task has a large domain gap and few annotated samples remains a challenge. Previous few-shot domain adaptation (FSDA) methods seek to bridge the distribution gap between source and target domains by utilizing auxiliary data. The selection and scheduling of auxiliaries are often based on heuristics, which can easily cause negative transfer. In this work, we propose an Active and Sequential domain AdaPtation (ASAP) framework for dynamic auxiliary dataset selection in FSDA. We formulate FSDA as a multi-armed bandit problem and derive an efficient reward function to prioritize training on auxiliary datasets that align closely with the target task, through a single-round fine-tuning. Empirical validation on diverse medical segmentation datasets demonstrates that our method achieves favorable segmentation performance, significantly outperforming the state-of-the-art FSDA methods, achieving an average gain of 27.75% on MRI and 7.52% on CT datasets in Dice score. Code is available at the git repository: https://github.com/techicoco/ASAP.</p></details> |  |
| **[EffoVPR: Effective Foundation Model Utilization for Visual Place Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18065v2)** | 2025-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The task of Visual Place Recognition (VPR) is to predict the location of a query image from a database of geo-tagged images. Recent studies in VPR have highlighted the significant advantage of employing pre-trained foundation models like DINOv2 for the VPR task. However, these models are often deemed inadequate for VPR without further fine-tuning on VPR-specific data. In this paper, we present an effective approach to harness the potential of a foundation model for VPR. We show that features extracted from self-attention layers can act as a powerful re-ranker for VPR, even in a zero-shot setting. Our method not only outperforms previous zero-shot approaches but also introduces results competitive with several supervised methods. We then show that a single-stage approach utilizing internal ViT layers for pooling can produce global features that achieve state-of-the-art performance, with impressive feature compactness down to 128D. Moreover, integrating our local foundation features for re-ranking further widens this performance gap. Our method also demonstrates exceptional robustness and generalization, setting new state-of-the-art performance, while handling challenging conditions such as occlusion, day-night transitions, and seasonal variations.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |

To predict the next-patch's distribution, we propose a TimeFlow Loss based on flow-matching, which facilitates native pre-training of Transformers on time series without discrete tokenization. Conditioned on arbitrary-length time series, our model is pre-trained without specifying any prior distribution and can generate multiple probable predictions, achieving flexibility in representation learning beyond using parametric densities. Towards time series foundation models, we leverage minimal but crucial adaptations of Transformers and curate TimeBench with 1 trillion time points, comprising mostly real-world datasets and synthetic data. By mitigating mode collapse through TimeFlow Loss, we pre-train a family of Sundial models on TimeBench, which exhibit unprecedented model capacity and generalization performance on zero-shot forecasting. In addition to presenting good scaling behavior, Sundial achieves new state-of-the-art on both point forecasting and probabilistic forecasting benchmarks. We believe that Sundial's pioneering generative paradigm will facilitate a wide variety of forecasting scenarios.</p></details> |  |

However, these pre-trained models often require full fine-tuning on each downstream task to achieve substantial improvements, limiting their versatility and usability, and leading to considerable resource wastage. To tackle these challenges, we propose NeuroLM, the first multi-task foundation model that leverages the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by regarding EEG signals as a foreign language, endowing the model with multi-task learning and inference capabilities. Our approach begins with learning a text-aligned neural tokenizer through vector-quantized temporal-frequency prediction, which encodes EEG signals into discrete neural tokens. These EEG tokens, generated by the frozen vector-quantized (VQ) encoder, are then fed into an LLM that learns causal EEG information via multi-channel autoregression. Consequently, NeuroLM can understand both EEG and language modalities. Finally, multi-task instruction tuning adapts NeuroLM to various downstream tasks. We are the first to demonstrate that, by specific incorporation with LLMs, NeuroLM unifies diverse EEG tasks within a single model through instruction tuning. The largest variant NeuroLM-XL has record-breaking 1.7B parameters for EEG signal processing, and is pre-trained on a large-scale corpus comprising approximately 25,000-hour EEG data. When evaluated on six diverse downstream datasets, NeuroLM showcases the huge potential of this multi-task learning paradigm.</p></details> | <details><summary>The T...</summary><p>The Thirteenth International Conference on Learning Representations</p></details> |

However, existing methods, whether based on manual feature extraction or deep learning, face two major challenges: the lack of large-scale datasets for robust feature learning and evaluation, and poor detection performance due to inter-subject variations. To address these challenges, we curate an EEG-AD corpus containing 813 subjects, which forms the world's largest EEG-AD dataset to the best of our knowledge. Using this unique dataset, we propose LEAD, the first large foundation model for EEG-based AD detection. Our method encompasses an entire pipeline, from data selection and preprocessing to self-supervised contrastive pretraining, fine-tuning, and key setups such as subject-independent evaluation and majority voting for subject-level detection. We pre-train the model on 11 EEG datasets and unified fine-tune it on 5 AD datasets. Our self-supervised pre-training design includes sample-level and subject-level contrasting to extract useful general EEG features. Fine-tuning is performed on 5 channel-aligned datasets together. The backbone encoder incorporates temporal and channel embeddings to capture features across both temporal and spatial dimensions. Our method demonstrates outstanding AD detection performance, achieving up to a 9.86% increase in F1 score at the sample-level and up to a 9.31% at the subject-level compared to state-of-the-art methods. The results of our model strongly confirm the effectiveness of contrastive pre-training and channel-aligned unified fine-tuning for addressing inter-subject variation.

In the Earth science and remote sensing communities, there is growing interest in transforming the use of Earth observation data, including satellite and aerial imagery, through foundation models. Various foundation models have been developed for remote sensing, such as those for multispectral, high-resolution, and hyperspectral images, and have demonstrated superior performance on various downstream tasks compared to traditional supervised models. These models are evolving rapidly, with capabilities to handle multispectral, multitemporal, and multisensor data. Most studies use masked autoencoders in combination with Vision Transformers (ViTs) as the backbone for pretraining. While the models showed promising performance, ViTs face challenges, such as quadratic computational scaling with input length, which may limit performance on multiband and multitemporal data with long sequences. This research aims to address these challenges by proposing SatMamba, a new pretraining framework that combines masked autoencoders with State Space Model, offering linear computational scaling. Experiments on high-resolution imagery across various downstream tasks show promising results, paving the way for more efficient foundation models and unlocking the full potential of Earth observation data.

| **[Current Pathology Foundation Models are unrobust to Medical Center Differences](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18055v2)** | 2025-02-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pathology Foundation Models (FMs) hold great promise for healthcare. Before they can be used in clinical practice, it is essential to ensure they are robust to variations between medical centers. We measure whether pathology FMs focus on biological features like tissue and cancer type, or on the well known confounding medical center signatures introduced by staining procedure and other differences. We introduce the Robustness Index. This novel robustness metric reflects to what degree biological features dominate confounding features. Ten current publicly available pathology FMs are evaluated. We find that all current pathology foundation models evaluated represent the medical center to a strong degree. Significant differences in the robustness index are observed. Only one model so far has a robustness index greater than one, meaning biological features dominate confounding features, but only slightly. A quantitative approach to measure the influence of medical center differences on FM-based prediction performance is described. We analyze the impact of unrobustness on classification performance of downstream models, and find that cancer-type classification errors are not random, but specifically attributable to same-center confounders: images of other classes from the same medical center. We visualize FM embedding spaces, and find these are more strongly organized by medical centers than by biological factors. As a consequence, the medical center of origin is predicted more accurately than the tissue source and cancer type. The robustness index introduced here is provided with the aim of advancing progress towards clinical adoption of robust and reliable pathology FMs.</p></details> |  |

Unlike traditional CNN-based approaches, which often suffer from inaccurate depth estimation and rely on multi-stage object detection pipelines, this study employs a Vision Transformer (ViT)-based foundation model as the backbone, which excels at capturing global features for depth estimation. It integrates a detection transformer (DETR) architecture to improve both depth estimation and object detection performance in a one-stage manner. Specifically, a hierarchical feature fusion block is introduced to extract richer visual features from the foundation model, further enhancing feature extraction capabilities. Depth estimation accuracy is further improved by incorporating a relative depth estimation model trained on large-scale data and fine-tuning it through transfer learning. Additionally, the use of queries in the transformer's decoder, which consider reference points and the dimensions of 2D bounding boxes, enhances recognition performance. The proposed model outperforms recent state-of-the-art methods, as demonstrated through quantitative and qualitative evaluations on the KITTI 3D benchmark and a custom dataset collected from high-elevation racing environments.

To enhance prediction accuracy, previous studies have integrated diverse data modalities, such as clinical notes, medical images, and genomic data, leveraging their complementary information. However, existing approaches face two major limitations. First, they struggle to incorporate newly arrived data with varying distributions into training, such as patient records from different hospitals, thus rendering sub-optimal generalizability and limited utility in real-world applications. Second, most multimodal integration methods rely on simplistic concatenation or task-specific pipelines, which fail to capture the complex interdependencies across modalities. To address these, we propose a continually evolving multi-modal foundation model. Extensive experiments on the TCGA dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, highlighting its potential to advance cancer prognosis by enabling robust and adaptive multimodal integration.</p></details> | 9 pages, 1 figure |

These systems have evolved into complex, multilayered architectures that leverage vast datasets and often incorporate thousands of predictive models. The maintenance and enhancement of these models is a labor intensive process that requires extensive feature engineering. This approach not only exacerbates technical debt but also hampers innovation in extending these systems to emerging problem domains. In this report, we present our research to address these challenges by utilizing a large foundation model with a textual interface for ranking and recommendation tasks. We illustrate several key advantages of our approach: (1) a single model can manage multiple predictive tasks involved in ranking and recommendation, (2) decoder models with textual interface due to their comprehension of reasoning capabilities, can generalize to new recommendation surfaces and out-of-domain problems, and (3) by employing natural language interfaces for task definitions and verbalizing member behaviors and their social connections, we eliminate the need for feature engineering and the maintenance of complex directed acyclic graphs of model dependencies. We introduce our research pre-production model, 360Brew V1.0, a 150B parameter, decoder-only model that has been trained and fine-tuned on LinkedIn's data and tasks. This model is capable of solving over 30 predictive tasks across various segments of the LinkedIn platform, achieving performance levels comparable to or exceeding those of current production systems based on offline metrics, without task-specific fine-tuning. Notably, each of these tasks is conventionally addressed by dedicated models that have been developed and maintained over multiple years by teams of a similar or larger size than our own.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we introduce a multi-modal foundation model for scientific problems, named PROSE-PDE. Our model, designed for bi-modality to bi-modality learning, is a multi-operator learning approach which can predict future states of spatiotemporal systems while concurrently learning the underlying governing equations of the physical system. Specifically, we focus on multi-operator learning by training distinct one-dimensional time-dependent nonlinear constant coefficient partial differential equations, with potential applications to many physical applications including physics, geology, and biology. More importantly, we provide three extrapolation studies to demonstrate that PROSE-PDE can generalize physical features through the robust training of multiple operators and that the proposed model can extrapolate to predict PDE solutions whose models or data were unseen during the training. Furthermore, we show through systematic numerical experiments that the utilization of the symbolic modality in our model effectively resolves the well-posedness problems with training multiple operators and thus enhances our model's predictive capabilities.</p></details> |  |

Molecular representation is key to building such models. Previous works have typically focused on a single representation or view of the molecules. Here, we develop a multi-view foundation model approach, that integrates molecular views of graph, image and text. Single-view foundation models are each pre-trained on a dataset of up to 200M molecules and then aggregated into combined representations. Our multi-view model is validated on a diverse set of 18 tasks, encompassing ligand-protein binding, molecular solubility, metabolism and toxicity. We show that the multi-view models perform robustly and are able to balance the strengths and weaknesses of specific views. We then apply this model to screen compounds against a large (>100 targets) set of G Protein-Coupled receptors (GPCRs). From this library of targets, we identify 33 that are related to Alzheimer's disease. On this subset, we employ our model to identify strong binders, which are validated through structure-based modeling and identification of key binding motifs.</p></details> | <details><summary>37 pa...</summary><p>37 pages including supplement. 10 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |
| **[Towards Fast, Specialized Machine Learning Force Fields: Distilling Foundation Models via Energy Hessians](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09009v2)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The foundation model (FM) paradigm is transforming Machine Learning Force Fields (MLFFs), leveraging general-purpose representations and scalable training to perform a variety of computational chemistry tasks. Although MLFF FMs have begun to close the accuracy gap relative to first-principles methods, there is still a strong need for faster inference speed. Additionally, while research is increasingly focused on general-purpose models which transfer across chemical space, practitioners typically only study a small subset of systems at a given time. This underscores the need for fast, specialized MLFFs relevant to specific downstream applications, which preserve test-time physical soundness while maintaining train-time scalability. In this work, we introduce a method for transferring general-purpose representations from MLFF foundation models to smaller, faster MLFFs specialized to specific regions of chemical space. We formulate our approach as a knowledge distillation procedure, where the smaller "student" MLFF is trained to match the Hessians of the energy predictions of the "teacher" foundation model. Our specialized MLFFs can be up to 20 $\times$ faster than the original foundation model, while retaining, and in some cases exceeding, its performance and that of undistilled models. We also show that distilling from a teacher model with a direct force parameterization into a student model trained with conservative forces (i.e., computed as derivatives of the potential energy) successfully leverages the representations from the large-scale teacher for improved accuracy, while maintaining energy conservation during test-time molecular dynamics simulations. More broadly, our work suggests a new paradigm for MLFF development, in which foundation models are released along with smaller, specialized simulation "engines" for common chemical subsets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a conference paper at ICLR 2025.

However, not all biosignals are the same: high-fidelity biosignals, such as photoplethysmogram (PPG), contain more physiological information, but require optical sensors with a high power footprint. Alternatively, a lower-fidelity biosignal such as accelerometry has a significantly smaller power footprint and is available in almost any wearable device. While accelerometry is widely used for activity recognition and fitness, it is less explored for health biomarkers and diagnosis. Here, we show that an accelerometry foundation model can predict a wide variety of health targets. To achieve improved performance, we distill representational knowledge from PPG encoders to accelerometery encoders using 20 million minutes of unlabeled data, collected from ~172K participants in the Apple Heart and Movement Study under informed consent. We observe strong cross-modal alignment on unseen data, e.g., 99.2% top-1 accuracy for retrieving PPG embeddings from accelerometry embeddings. We show that distilled accelerometry encoders have significantly more informative representations compared to self-supervised or supervised encoders trained directly on accelerometry data, observed by at least 23%-49% improved performance for predicting heart rate and heart rate variability. We also show that distilled accelerometry encoders are readily predictive of a wide array of downstream health targets, i.e., they are generalist foundation models. We believe accelerometry foundation models for health may unlock new opportunities for developing digital biomarkers from any wearable device.</p></details> | updated format |

Here, we argue that genuine "foundation models" of regulatory biology will remain out of reach unless guided by frameworks that integrate mechanistic insight with principled experimental design. We present one such ground-up, semi-mechanistic framework that unifies perturbation-based experimental designs across both in vitro and in vivo CRISPR screens, accounting for differentiating and non-differentiating cellular systems. By revealing previously unrecognised assumptions in published machine learning methods, our approach clarifies links with popular techniques such as variational autoencoders and structural causal models. In practice, this framework suggests a modified loss function that we demonstrate can improve predictive performance, and further suggests an error analysis that informs batching strategies. Ultimately, since cellular regulation emerges from innumerable interactions amongst largely uncharted molecular components, we contend that systems-level understanding cannot be achieved through structural biology alone. Instead, we argue that real progress will require a first-principles perspective on how experiments capture biological phenomena, how data are generated, and how these processes can be reflected in more faithful modelling architectures.</p></details> | 19 pages, 8 figures |

Recently, vision-language models, such as the Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) model, have demonstrated potential in improving diagnostic accuracy by leveraging large-scale image-text datasets. However, since CLIP was not initially designed for medical images, several CLIP-like models trained specifically on medical images have been developed. Despite their enhanced performance, issues of fairness - particularly regarding demographic attributes - remain largely unaddressed. In this study, we perform a comprehensive fairness analysis of CLIP-like models applied to X-ray image classification. We assess their performance and fairness across diverse patient demographics and disease categories using zero-shot inference and various fine-tuning techniques, including Linear Probing, Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), and full fine-tuning. Our results indicate that while fine-tuning improves model accuracy, fairness concerns persist, highlighting the need for further fairness interventions in these foundational models.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted for presentation at the 2025 IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI 2025)</p></details> |

Our approach uses a block causal transformer architecture to model next frame predictions, leveraging previous frames as contextual priors rather than relying solely on sub-frames or pixel-based inputs commonly used in image generation methods. This block causal framework more effectively captures the spatial dependencies inherent in nonlinear spatiotemporal dynamics and physical phenomena. In an ablation study, next frame prediction demonstrated a 2.9x accuracy improvement over next token prediction. BCAT is trained on a diverse range of fluid dynamics datasets, including incompressible and compressible Navier-Stokes equations across various geometries and parameter regimes, as well as the shallow-water equations. The model's performance was evaluated on 6 distinct downstream prediction tasks and tested on about 8K trajectories to measure robustness on a variety of fluid dynamics simulations. BCAT achieved an average relative error of 1.92% across all evaluation tasks, outperforming prior approaches on standard benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Graph Foundation Models: Learning Generalities Across Graphs via Task-Trees](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16441v2)** | 2025-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models aim to create general, cross-task, and cross-domain machine learning models by pretraining on large-scale datasets to capture shared patterns or concepts, such as contours, colors, textures, and edges in images, or tokens, words, and sentences in text. However, identifying generalities across graph-structured data remains a significant challenge, as different graph-based tasks necessitate distinct inductive biases, thereby impeding the development of graph foundation models. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel approach for learning cross-task generalities in graphs. Specifically, we propose task-trees as basic learning instances to align task spaces (node, link, graph) on graphs. Then, we conduct a theoretical analysis to examine their stability, transferability, and generalization. Our findings indicate that when a graph neural network (GNN) is pretrained on diverse task-trees using a reconstruction objective, it acquires transferable knowledge, enabling effective adaptation to downstream tasks with an appropriate set of fine-tuning samples. To empirically validate this approach, we develop a pretrained graph model based on task-trees, termed Graph Generality Identifier on Task-Trees (GIT). Extensive experiments demonstrate that a single pretrained GIT model can be effectively adapted to over 30 different graphs across five domains via fine-tuning, in-context learning, or zero-shot learning. Our data and code are available at https://github.com/Zehong-Wang/GIT.</p></details> |  |
| **[Foundational Models for 3D Point Clouds: A Survey and Outlook](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18594v1)** | 2025-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The 3D point cloud representation plays a crucial role in preserving the geometric fidelity of the physical world, enabling more accurate complex 3D environments. While humans naturally comprehend the intricate relationships between objects and variations through a multisensory system, artificial intelligence (AI) systems have yet to fully replicate this capacity. To bridge this gap, it becomes essential to incorporate multiple modalities. Models that can seamlessly integrate and reason across these modalities are known as foundation models (FMs). The development of FMs for 2D modalities, such as images and text, has seen significant progress, driven by the abundant availability of large-scale datasets. However, the 3D domain has lagged due to the scarcity of labelled data and high computational overheads. In response, recent research has begun to explore the potential of applying FMs to 3D tasks, overcoming these challenges by leveraging existing 2D knowledge. Additionally, language, with its capacity for abstract reasoning and description of the environment, offers a promising avenue for enhancing 3D understanding through large pre-trained language models (LLMs). Despite the rapid development and adoption of FMs for 3D vision tasks in recent years, there remains a gap in comprehensive and in-depth literature reviews. This article aims to address this gap by presenting a comprehensive overview of the state-of-the-art methods that utilize FMs for 3D visual understanding. We start by reviewing various strategies employed in the building of various 3D FMs. Then we categorize and summarize use of different FMs for tasks such as perception tasks. Finally, the article offers insights into future directions for research and development in this field.

While significant progress has been made in robotic manipulation, existing approaches often fall short in generalization to complex environmental variations and addressing memory-dependent tasks. To bridge this gap, we introduce SAM2Act, a multi-view robotic transformer-based policy that leverages multi-resolution upsampling with visual representations from large-scale foundation model. SAM2Act achieves a state-of-the-art average success rate of 86.8% across 18 tasks in the RLBench benchmark, and demonstrates robust generalization on The Colosseum benchmark, with only a 4.3% performance gap under diverse environmental perturbations. Building on this foundation, we propose SAM2Act+, a memory-based architecture inspired by SAM2, which incorporates a memory bank, an encoder, and an attention mechanism to enhance spatial memory. To address the need for evaluating memory-dependent tasks, we introduce MemoryBench, a novel benchmark designed to assess spatial memory and action recall in robotic manipulation. SAM2Act+ achieves competitive performance on MemoryBench, significantly outperforming existing approaches and pushing the boundaries of memory-enabled robotic systems.

Due to various reasons exposed, logit scores on the CLIP head remain large irrespective of whether the image-language pairs reconcile. It is difficult to address in data space, given the few-shot regime. We propose a penalty incorporated into loss objective that penalizes incorrect classifications whenever one is made during finetuning, by moving an amount of log-likelihood to the true class commensurate to the relative amplitudes of the two likelihoods. We refer to it as \textit{confidence misalignment penalty (CMP)}. Extensive experiments on $12$ vision datasets and $5$ domain generalization datasets supports the calibration performance of our method against stat-of-the-art. CMP outperforms the benchmarked prompt learning methods, demonstrating average improvement in Expected Calibration Error (ECE) by average $6.01$\%, $4.01$ \% at minimum and $9.72$\% at maximum.</p></details> |  |
| **[Tuning Vision Foundation Model via Test-Time Prompt-Guided Training for VFSS Segmentations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18474v1)** | 2025-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision foundation models have demonstrated exceptional generalization capabilities in segmentation tasks for both generic and specialized images. However, a performance gap persists between foundation models and task-specific, specialized models. Fine-tuning foundation models on downstream datasets is often necessary to bridge this gap. Unfortunately, obtaining fully annotated ground truth for downstream datasets is both challenging and costly. To address this limitation, we propose a novel test-time training paradigm that enhances the performance of foundation models on downstream datasets without requiring full annotations. Specifically, our method employs simple point prompts to guide a test-time semi-self-supervised training task. The model learns by resolving the ambiguity of the point prompt through various augmentations. This approach directly tackles challenges in the medical imaging field, where acquiring annotations is both time-intensive and expensive. We conducted extensive experiments on our new Videofluoroscopy dataset (VFSS-5k) for the instance segmentation task, achieving an average Dice coefficient of 0.868 across 12 anatomies with a single model.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quantifying uncertainty in lung cancer segmentation with foundation models applied to mixed-domain datasets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13113v3)** | 2025-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical image foundation models have shown the ability to segment organs and tumors with minimal fine-tuning. These models are typically evaluated on task-specific in-distribution (ID) datasets. However, reliable performance on ID datasets does not guarantee robust generalization on out-of-distribution (OOD) datasets. Importantly, once deployed for clinical use, it is impractical to have `ground truth' delineations to assess ongoing performance drifts, especially when images fall into the OOD category due to different imaging protocols. Hence, we introduced a comprehensive set of computationally fast metrics to evaluate the performance of multiple foundation models (Swin UNETR, SimMIM, iBOT, SMIT) trained with self-supervised learning (SSL). All models were fine-tuned on identical datasets for lung tumor segmentation from computed tomography (CT) scans. The evaluation was performed on two public lung cancer datasets (LRAD: n = 140, 5Rater: n = 21) with different image acquisitions and tumor stages compared to training data (n = 317 public resource with stage III-IV lung cancers) and a public non-cancer dataset containing volumetric CT scans of patients with pulmonary embolism (n = 120). All models produced similarly accurate tumor segmentation on the lung cancer testing datasets. SMIT produced the highest F1-score (LRAD: 0.60, 5Rater: 0.64) and lowest entropy (LRAD: 0.06, 5Rater: 0.12), indicating higher tumor detection rate and confident segmentations. In the OOD dataset, SMIT misdetected the least number of tumors, marked by a median volume occupancy of 5.67 cc compared to the best method SimMIM of 9.97 cc. Our analysis shows that additional metrics such as entropy and volume occupancy may help better understand model performance on mixed domain datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at SPIE Medical Imaging 2025</p></details> |
| **[General Geospatial Inference with a Population Dynamics Foundation Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07207v4)** | 2025-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Supporting the health and well-being of dynamic populations around the world requires governmental agencies, organizations and researchers to understand and reason over complex relationships between human behavior and local contexts in order to identify high-risk groups and strategically allocate limited resources. Traditional approaches to these classes of problems often entail developing manually curated, task-specific features and models to represent human behavior and the natural and built environment, which can be challenging to adapt to new, or even, related tasks. To address this, we introduce a Population Dynamics Foundation Model (PDFM) that aims to capture the relationships between diverse data modalities and is applicable to a broad range of geospatial tasks. We first construct a geo-indexed dataset for postal codes and counties across the United States, capturing rich aggregated information on human behavior from maps, busyness, and aggregated search trends, and environmental factors such as weather and air quality. We then model this data and the complex relationships between locations using a graph neural network, producing embeddings that can be adapted to a wide range of downstream tasks using relatively simple models. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach by benchmarking it on 27 downstream tasks spanning three distinct domains: health indicators, socioeconomic factors, and environmental measurements. The approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on all 27 geospatial interpolation tasks, and on 25 out of the 27 extrapolation and super-resolution tasks. We combined the PDFM with a state-of-the-art forecasting foundation model, TimesFM, to predict unemployment and poverty, achieving performance that surpasses fully supervised forecasting. The full set of embeddings and sample code are publicly available for researchers.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, 16 figures, preprint; v4: updated authors</p></details> |
| **[Privacy-Preserving Edge Speech Understanding with Tiny Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01649v1)** | 2025-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robust speech recognition systems rely on cloud service providers for inference. It needs to ensure that an untrustworthy provider cannot deduce the sensitive content in speech. Sanitization can be done on speech content keeping in mind that it has to avoid compromising transcription accuracy. Realizing the under utilized capabilities of tiny speech foundation models (FMs), for the first time, we propose a novel use: enhancing speech privacy on resource-constrained devices. We introduce XYZ, an edge/cloud privacy preserving speech inference engine that can filter sensitive entities without compromising transcript accuracy. We utilize a timestamp based on-device masking approach that utilizes a token to entity prediction model to filter sensitive entities. Our choice of mask strategically conceals parts of the input and hides sensitive data. The masked input is sent to a trusted cloud service or to a local hub to generate the masked output. The effectiveness of XYZ hinges on how well the entity time segments are masked. Our recovery is a confidence score based approach that chooses the best prediction between cloud and on-device model. We implement XYZ on a 64 bit Raspberry Pi 4B. Experiments show that our solution leads to robust speech recognition without forsaking privacy. XYZ with < 100 MB memory, achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) speech transcription performance while filtering about 83% of private entities directly on-device. XYZ is 16x smaller in memory and 17x more compute efficient than prior privacy preserving speech frameworks and has a relative reduction in word error rate (WER) by 38.8-77.5% when compared to existing offline transcription services.</p></details> |  |
| **[netFound: Foundation Model for Network Security](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17025v4)** | 2025-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Developing generalizable ML-based solutions for disparate learning problems in network security is highly desired. However, despite a rich history of applying ML to network security, most existing solutions lack generalizability. This lack of progress can be attributed to an overreliance on supervised learning techniques and the associated challenges of curating well-specified labeled training data. This paper addresses a fundamental gap by introducing a novel transformer-based network foundation model, netFound. We employ self-supervised learning techniques on abundant, unlabeled network telemetry data for pre-training. This pretrained model can subsequently be fine-tuned to create generalizable learning artifacts for disparate learning tasks, even when using commonly available but challenging labeled datasets that are sparse, noisy, and skewed. To realize this goal, netFound leverages various domain-specific attributes and constraints unique to network data (packet traces) by developing multi-modal embeddings, protocol-aware tokenization, data-driven token composition, and hierarchical transformers. Our results demonstrate that netFound's domain-specific design choices ensure that it (1) effectively captures the hidden networking context in production settings, (2) outperforms four different SOTA methods on five different learning tasks, and (3) is robust to both noisy labels and learning shortcuts -- critical for developing generalizable ML models in practical settings.</p></details> |  |

Although medical foundation models have emerged, solutions for cardiac imaging, especially echocardiography videos, are still unexplored. In this paper, we introduce EchoFM, a foundation model specifically designed to represent and analyze echocardiography videos. In EchoFM, we propose a self-supervised learning framework that captures both spatial and temporal variability patterns through a spatio-temporal consistent masking strategy and periodic-driven contrastive learning. This framework can effectively capture the spatio-temporal dynamics of echocardiography and learn the representative video features without any labels. We pre-train our model on an extensive dataset comprising over 290,000 echocardiography videos covering 26 scan views across different imaging modes, with up to 20 million frames of images. The pre-trained EchoFM can then be easily adapted and fine-tuned for a variety of downstream tasks, serving as a robust backbone model. Our evaluation was systemically designed for four downstream tasks after the echocardiography examination routine. Experiment results show that EchoFM surpasses state-of-the-art methods, including specialized echocardiography methods, self-supervised pre-training models, and general-purposed pre-trained foundation models, across all downstream tasks.</p></details> |  |

As a result, FM leaderboards have become essential tools for SE teams to compare and select the best third-party FMs for their specific products and purposes. However, the lack of standardized guidelines for FM evaluation and comparison threatens the transparency of FM leaderboards and limits stakeholders' ability to perform effective FM selection. As a first step towards addressing this challenge, our research focuses on understanding how these FM leaderboards operate in real-world scenarios ("leaderboard operations") and identifying potential pitfalls and areas for improvement ("leaderboard smells"). In this regard, we collect up to 1,045 FM leaderboards from five different sources: GitHub, Hugging Face Spaces, Papers With Code, spreadsheet and independent platform, to examine their documentation and engage in direct communication with leaderboard operators to understand their workflows. Through card sorting and negotiated agreement, we identify five distinct workflow patterns and develop a domain model that captures the key components and their interactions within these workflows. We then identify eight unique types of leaderboard smells in LBOps. By mitigating these smells, SE teams can improve transparency, accountability, and collaboration in current LBOps practices, fostering a more robust and responsible ecosystem for FM comparison and selection.</p></details> | <details><summary>Aweso...</summary><p>Awesome Foundation Model Leaderboard List: https://github.com/SAILResearch/awesome-foundation-model-leaderboards; Foundation Model Leaderboard Search Toolkit: https://huggingface.co/spaces/zhiminy/awesome-foundation-model-leaderboard-search</p></details> |

However, their roles in enhancing model generalization capabilities remain unclear. This paper studies the difference between SFT and RL on generalization and memorization, focusing on text-based rule variants and visual variants. We introduce GeneralPoints, an arithmetic reasoning card game, and adopt V-IRL, a real-world navigation environment, to assess how models trained with SFT and RL generalize to unseen variants in both textual and visual domains. We show that RL, especially when trained with an outcome-based reward, generalizes across both rule-based textual and visual variants. SFT, in contrast, tends to memorize training data and struggles to generalize out-of-distribution scenarios. Further analysis reveals that RL improves the model's underlying visual recognition capabilities, contributing to its enhanced generalization in the visual domain. Despite RL's superior generalization, we show that SFT remains essential for effective RL training; SFT stabilizes the model's output format, enabling subsequent RL to achieve its performance gains. These findings demonstrates the capability of RL for acquiring generalizable knowledge in complex, multi-modal tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Websi...</summary><p>Website at https://tianzhechu.com/SFTvsRL</p></details> |

While it resulted in improving the performance on diverse downstream tasks, it also introduced increased computational cost and inference time. In this work, we explore the distillation of a large foundation model into a smaller one, reducing the number of parameters by several orders of magnitude. Leveraging distillation techniques, our distilled model, H0-mini, achieves nearly comparable performance to large FMs at a significantly reduced inference cost. It is evaluated on several public benchmarks, achieving 3rd place on the HEST benchmark and 5th place on the EVA benchmark. Additionally, a robustness analysis conducted on the PLISM dataset demonstrates that our distilled model reaches excellent robustness to variations in staining and scanning conditions, significantly outperforming other state-of-the art models. This opens new perspectives to design lightweight and robust models for digital pathology, without compromising on performance.</p></details> | Preprint |

Most existing machine learning efforts focus on the development of task-specific models for each microstructure--property relationship. We propose utilizing pre-trained foundational vision transformers for the extraction of task-agnostic microstructure features and subsequent light-weight machine learning of a microstructure-dependent property. We demonstrate our approach with pre-trained state-of-the-art vision transformers (CLIP, DINOV2, SAM) in two case studies on machine-learning: (i) elastic modulus of two-phase microstructures based on simulations data; and (ii) Vicker's hardness of Ni-base and Co-base superalloys based on experimental data published in literature. Our results show the potential of foundational vision transformers for robust microstructure representation and efficient machine learning of microstructure--property relationships without the need for expensive task-specific training or fine-tuning of bespoke deep learning models.</p></details> |  |

However, accurately segmenting catheter and guidewire structures is challenging due to the limited availability of labeled data. Foundation models offer a promising solution by enabling the collection of similar domain data to train models whose weights can be fine-tuned for downstream tasks. Nonetheless, large-scale data collection for training is constrained by the necessity of maintaining patient privacy. This paper proposes a new method to train a foundation model in a decentralized federated learning setting for endovascular intervention. To ensure the feasibility of the training, we tackle the unseen data issue using differentiable Earth Mover's Distance within a knowledge distillation framework. Once trained, our foundation model's weights provide valuable initialization for downstream tasks, thereby enhancing task-specific performance. Intensive experiments show that our approach achieves new state-of-the-art results, contributing to advancements in endovascular intervention and robotic-assisted endovascular surgery, while addressing the critical issue of data sharing in the medical domain.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages.

Yet, the exponential growth in materials science literature comprising vast amounts of textual data has created significant bottlenecks in knowledge extraction, synthesis, and scientific reasoning. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer unprecedented opportunities to accelerate materials research through automated analysis and prediction. Still, their effective deployment requires domain-specific adaptation for understanding and solving domain-relevant tasks. Here, we present LLaMat, a family of foundational models for materials science developed through continued pretraining of LLaMA models on an extensive corpus of materials literature and crystallographic data. Through systematic evaluation, we demonstrate that LLaMat excels in materials-specific NLP and structured information extraction while maintaining general linguistic capabilities. The specialized LLaMat-CIF variant demonstrates unprecedented capabilities in crystal structure generation, predicting stable crystals with high coverage across the periodic table. Intriguingly, despite LLaMA-3's superior performance in comparison to LLaMA-2, we observe that LLaMat-2 demonstrates unexpectedly enhanced domain-specific performance across diverse materials science tasks, including structured information extraction from text and tables, more particularly in crystal structure generation, a potential adaptation rigidity in overtrained LLMs. Altogether, the present work demonstrates the effectiveness of domain adaptation towards developing practically deployable LLM copilots for materials research. Beyond materials science, our findings reveal important considerations for domain adaptation of LLMs, such as model selection, training methodology, and domain-specific performance, which may influence the development of specialized scientific AI systems.</p></details> |  |

The core design philosophy of VideoLLaMA3 is vision-centric. The meaning of "vision-centric" is two-fold: the vision-centric training paradigm and vision-centric framework design. The key insight of our vision-centric training paradigm is that high-quality image-text data is crucial for both image and video understanding. Instead of preparing massive video-text datasets, we focus on constructing large-scale and high-quality image-text datasets. VideoLLaMA3 has four training stages: 1) Vision Encoder Adaptation, which enables vision encoder to accept images of variable resolutions as input; 2) Vision-Language Alignment, which jointly tunes the vision encoder, projector, and LLM with large-scale image-text data covering multiple types (including scene images, documents, charts) as well as text-only data. 3) Multi-task Fine-tuning, which incorporates image-text SFT data for downstream tasks and video-text data to establish a foundation for video understanding. 4) Video-centric Fine-tuning, which further improves the model's capability in video understanding. As for the framework design, to better capture fine-grained details in images, the pretrained vision encoder is adapted to encode images of varying sizes into vision tokens with corresponding numbers, rather than a fixed number of tokens. For video inputs, we reduce the number of vision tokens according to their similarity so that the representation of videos will be more precise and compact. Benefit from vision-centric designs, VideoLLaMA3 achieves compelling performances in both image and video understanding benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>BZ, K...</summary><p>BZ, KL, ZC, ZH, YY, GC, SL, YJ, HZ, and XL contributed equally to this project.

Here, we introduce Threads, a slide-level foundation model capable of generating universal representations of whole-slide images of any size. Threads was pre-trained using a multimodal learning approach on a diverse cohort of 47,171 hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained tissue sections, paired with corresponding genomic and transcriptomic profiles - the largest such paired dataset to be used for foundation model development to date. This unique training paradigm enables Threads to capture the tissue's underlying molecular composition, yielding powerful representations applicable to a wide array of downstream tasks. In extensive benchmarking across 54 oncology tasks, including clinical subtyping, grading, mutation prediction, immunohistochemistry status determination, treatment response prediction, and survival prediction, Threads outperformed all baselines while demonstrating remarkable generalizability and label efficiency. It is particularly well suited for predicting rare events, further emphasizing its clinical utility. We intend to make the model publicly available for the broader community.</p></details> |  |
| **[Analyzing Toxicity in Open Source Software Communications Using Psycholinguistics and Moral Foundations Theory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13133v3)** | 2025-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Studies have shown that toxic behavior can cause contributors to leave, and hinder newcomers' (especially from underrepresented communities) participation in Open Source Software (OSS) projects. Thus, detection of toxic language plays a crucial role in OSS collaboration and inclusivity. Off-the-shelf toxicity detectors are ineffective when applied to OSS communications, due to the distinct nature of toxicity observed in these channels (e.g., entitlement and arrogance are more frequently observed on GitHub than on Reddit or Twitter). In this paper, we investigate a machine learning-based approach for the automatic detection of toxic communications in OSS. We leverage psycholinguistic lexicons, and Moral Foundations Theory to analyze toxicity in two types of OSS communication channels; issue comments and code reviews. Our evaluation indicates that our approach can achieve a significant performance improvement (up to 7% increase in F1 score) over the existing domain-specific toxicity detector. We found that using moral values as features is more effective than linguistic cues, resulting in 67.50% F1-measure in identifying toxic instances in code review data and 64.83% in issue comments. While the detection accuracy is far from accurate, this improvement demonstrates the potential of integrating moral and psycholinguistic features in toxicity detection models. These findings highlight the importance of context-specific models that consider the unique communication styles within OSS, where interpersonal and value-driven language dynamics differ markedly from general social media platforms. Future work could focus on refining these models to further enhance detection accuracy, possibly by incorporating community-specific norms and conversational context to better capture the nuanced expressions of toxicity in OSS environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[A foundation model for human-AI collaboration in medical literature mining](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16255v1)** | 2025-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Systematic literature review is essential for evidence-based medicine, requiring comprehensive analysis of clinical trial publications. However, the application of artificial intelligence (AI) models for medical literature mining has been limited by insufficient training and evaluation across broad therapeutic areas and diverse tasks. Here, we present LEADS, an AI foundation model for study search, screening, and data extraction from medical literature. The model is trained on 633,759 instruction data points in LEADSInstruct, curated from 21,335 systematic reviews, 453,625 clinical trial publications, and 27,015 clinical trial registries. We showed that LEADS demonstrates consistent improvements over four cutting-edge generic large language models (LLMs) on six tasks. Furthermore, LEADS enhances expert workflows by providing supportive references following expert requests, streamlining processes while maintaining high-quality results. A study with 16 clinicians and medical researchers from 14 different institutions revealed that experts collaborating with LEADS achieved a recall of 0.81 compared to 0.77 experts working alone in study selection, with a time savings of 22.6%. In data extraction tasks, experts using LEADS achieved an accuracy of 0.85 versus 0.80 without using LEADS, alongside a 26.9% time savings. These findings highlight the potential of specialized medical literature foundation models to outperform generic models, delivering significant quality and efficiency benefits when integrated into expert workflows for medical literature mining.</p></details> |  |
| **[MADation: Face Morphing Attack Detection with Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03800v3)** | 2025-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the considerable performance improvements of face recognition algorithms in recent years, the same scientific advances responsible for this progress can also be used to create efficient ways to attack them, posing a threat to their secure deployment. Morphing attack detection (MAD) systems aim to detect a specific type of threat, morphing attacks, at an early stage, preventing them from being considered for verification in critical processes. Foundation models (FM) learn from extensive amounts of unlabelled data, achieving remarkable zero-shot generalization to unseen domains. Although this generalization capacity might be weak when dealing with domain-specific downstream tasks such as MAD, FMs can easily adapt to these settings while retaining the built-in knowledge acquired during pre-training. In this work, we recognize the potential of FMs to perform well in the MAD task when properly adapted to its specificities. To this end, we adapt FM CLIP architectures with LoRA weights while simultaneously training a classification header. The proposed framework, MADation surpasses our alternative FM and transformer-based frameworks and constitutes the first adaption of FMs to the MAD task. MADation presents competitive results with current MAD solutions in the literature and even surpasses them in several evaluation scenarios. To encourage reproducibility and facilitate further research in MAD, we publicly release the implementation of MADation at https://github.com/gurayozgur/MADation</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at WACV 2025 workshops</p></details> |
| **[Rethinking the Bias of Foundation Model under Long-tailed Distribution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15955v1)** | 2025-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long-tailed learning has garnered increasing attention due to its practical significance. Among the various approaches, the fine-tuning paradigm has gained considerable interest with the advent of foundation models. However, most existing methods primarily focus on leveraging knowledge from these models, overlooking the inherent biases introduced by the imbalanced training data they rely on. In this paper, we examine how such imbalances from pre-training affect long-tailed downstream tasks. Specifically, we find the imbalance biases inherited in foundation models on downstream task as parameter imbalance and data imbalance. During fine-tuning, we observe that parameter imbalance plays a more critical role, while data imbalance can be mitigated using existing re-balancing strategies. Moreover, we find that parameter imbalance cannot be effectively addressed by current re-balancing techniques, such as adjusting the logits, during training, unlike data imbalance. To tackle both imbalances simultaneously, we build our method on causal learning and view the incomplete semantic factor as the confounder, which brings spurious correlations between input samples and labels. To resolve the negative effects of this, we propose a novel backdoor adjustment method that learns the true causal effect between input samples and labels, rather than merely fitting the correlations in the data. Notably, we achieve an average performance increase of about $1.67\%$ on each dataset.</p></details> |  |
| **[Benchmarking Vision Foundation Models for Input Monitoring in Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08083v2)** | 2025-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep neural networks (DNNs) remain challenged by distribution shifts in complex open-world domains like automated driving (AD): Absolute robustness against yet unknown novel objects (semantic shift) or styles like lighting conditions (covariate shift) cannot be guaranteed. Hence, reliable operation-time monitors for identification of out-of-training-data-distribution (OOD) scenarios are imperative. Current approaches for OOD classification are untested for complex domains like AD, are limited in the kinds of shifts they detect, or even require supervision with OOD samples. To prepare for unanticipated shifts, we instead establish a framework around a principled, unsupervised, and model-agnostic method that unifies detection of all kinds of shifts: Find a full model of the training data's feature distribution, to then use its density at new points as in-distribution (ID) score. To implement this, we propose to combine the newly available Vision Foundation Models (VFM) as feature extractors with one of four alternative density modeling techniques. In an extensive benchmark of 4 VFMs against 20 baselines, we show the superior performance of VFM feature encodings compared to shift-specific OOD monitors. Additionally, we find that sophisticated architectures outperform larger latent space dimensionality; and our method identifies samples with higher risk of errors on downstream tasks, despite being model-agnostic. This suggests that VFMs are promising to realize model-agnostic, unsupervised, reliable safety monitors in complex vision tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Survey on Computational Pathology Foundation Models: Datasets, Adaptation Strategies, and Evaluation Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15724v1)** | 2025-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computational pathology foundation models (CPathFMs) have emerged as a powerful approach for analyzing histopathological data, leveraging self-supervised learning to extract robust feature representations from unlabeled whole-slide images. These models, categorized into uni-modal and multi-modal frameworks, have demonstrated promise in automating complex pathology tasks such as segmentation, classification, and biomarker discovery. However, the development of CPathFMs presents significant challenges, such as limited data accessibility, high variability across datasets, the necessity for domain-specific adaptation, and the lack of standardized evaluation benchmarks. This survey provides a comprehensive review of CPathFMs in computational pathology, focusing on datasets, adaptation strategies, and evaluation tasks. We analyze key techniques, such as contrastive learning and multi-modal integration, and highlight existing gaps in current research. Finally, we explore future directions from four perspectives for advancing CPathFMs. This survey serves as a valuable resource for researchers, clinicians, and AI practitioners, guiding the advancement of CPathFMs toward robust and clinically applicable AI-driven pathology solutions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Swiss Cheese Model for AI Safety: A Taxonomy and Reference Architecture for Multi-Layered Guardrails of Foundation Model Based Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02205v4)** | 2025-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation Model (FM)-based agents are revolutionizing application development across various domains. However, their rapidly growing capabilities and autonomy have raised significant concerns about AI safety. Researchers are exploring better ways to design guardrails to ensure that the runtime behavior of FM-based agents remains within specific boundaries. Nevertheless, designing effective runtime guardrails is challenging due to the agents' autonomous and non-deterministic behavior. The involvement of multiple pipeline stages and agent artifacts, such as goals, plans, tools, at runtime further complicates these issues. Addressing these challenges at runtime requires multi-layered guardrails that operate effectively at various levels of the agent architecture. Therefore, in this paper, based on the results of a systematic literature review, we present a comprehensive taxonomy of runtime guardrails for FM-based agents to identify the key quality attributes for guardrails and design dimensions. Inspired by the Swiss Cheese Model, we also propose a reference architecture for designing multi-layered runtime guardrails for FM-based agents, which includes three dimensions: quality attributes, pipelines, and artifacts. The proposed taxonomy and reference architecture provide concrete and robust guidance for researchers and practitioners to build AI-safety-by-design from a software architecture perspective.</p></details> | 12 pages |
| **[Rethinking Bradley-Terry Models in Preference-Based Reward Modeling: Foundations, Theory, and Alternatives](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04991v2)** | 2025-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Bradley-Terry (BT) model is a common and successful practice in reward modeling for Large Language Model (LLM) alignment. However, it remains unclear why this model -- originally developed for multi-player stochastic game matching -- can be adopted to convert pairwise response comparisons to reward values and make predictions. Especially given the fact that only a limited number of prompt-response pairs are sparsely compared with others. In this paper, we first revisit the foundations of using BT models in reward modeling, and establish the convergence rate of BT reward models based on deep neural networks using embeddings, providing a theoretical foundation for their use. Despite theoretically sound, we argue that the BT model is not a necessary choice from the perspective of downstream optimization. This is because a reward model only needs to preserve the correct ranking predictions through a monotonic transformation of the true reward. We highlight the critical concept of order consistency in reward modeling and demonstrate that the BT model possesses this property. Consequently, we propose a simple and straightforward upper-bound algorithm, compatible with off-the-shelf binary classifiers, as an alternative order-consistent reward modeling objective. To offer practical insights, we empirically evaluate the performance of these different reward modeling approaches across more than 12,000 experimental setups, using $6$ base LLMs, $2$ datasets, and diverse annotation designs that vary in quantity, quality, and pairing choices in preference annotations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Grid Monitoring with Synchro-Waveform and AI Foundation Model Technologies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06942v2)** | 2025-01-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Purpose:This article advocates for the development of a next-generation grid monitoring and control system designed for future grids dominated by inverter-based resources. Leveraging recent progress in generative artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and networking technology, we develop a physics-based AI foundation model with high-resolution synchro-waveform measurement technology to enhance grid resilience and reduce economic losses from outages. Methods and Results:The proposed framework adopts the AI Foundation Model paradigm, where a generative and pre-trained (GPT) foundation model extracts physical features from power system measurements, enabling adaptation to a wide range of grid operation tasks. Replacing the large language models used in popular AI foundation models, this approach is based on the Wiener-Kallianpur-Rosenblatt innovation model for power system time series, trained to capture the physical laws of power flows and sinusoidal characteristics of grid measurements. The pre-trained foundation model causally extracts sufficient statistics from grid measurement time series for various downstream applications, including anomaly detection, over-current protection, probabilistic forecasting, and data compression for streaming synchro-waveform data. Numerical simulations using field-collected data demonstrate significantly improved fault detection accuracy and detection speed. Conclusion:The future grid will be rich in inverter-based resources, making it highly dynamic, stochastic, and low inertia. This work underscores the limitations of existing Supervisory-Control-and-Data-Acquisition and Phasor-Measurement-Unit monitoring systems and advocates for AI-enabled monitoring and control with high-resolution synchro-waveform technology to provide accurate situational awareness, rapid response to faults, and robust network protection.</p></details> |  |

SpineFM leverages the regular geometry of the spine, employing a novel inductive process to sequentially infer the location of each vertebra along the spinal column. Vertebrae are segmented using Medical-SAM-Adaptor, a robust foundation model that diverges from commonly used CNN-based models. We achieved outstanding results on two publicly available spine X-Ray datasets, with successful identification of 97.8\% and 99.6\% of annotated vertebrae, respectively.

| **[Temporal Binding Foundation Model for Material Property Recognition via Tactile Sequence Perception](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14934v1)** | 2025-01-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robots engaged in complex manipulation tasks require robust material property recognition to ensure adaptability and precision. Traditionally, visual data has been the primary source for object perception; however, it often proves insufficient in scenarios where visibility is obstructed or detailed observation is needed. This gap highlights the necessity of tactile sensing as a complementary or primary input for material recognition. Tactile data becomes particularly essential in contact-rich, small-scale manipulations where subtle deformations and surface interactions cannot be accurately captured by vision alone. This letter presents a novel approach leveraging a temporal binding foundation model for tactile sequence understanding to enhance material property recognition. By processing tactile sensor data with a temporal focus, the proposed system captures the sequential nature of tactile interactions, similar to human fingertip perception. Additionally, this letter demonstrates that, through tailored and specific design, the foundation model can more effectively capture temporal information embedded in tactile sequences, advancing material property understanding. Experimental results validate the model's capability to capture these temporal patterns, confirming its utility for material property recognition in visually restricted scenarios. This work underscores the necessity of embedding advanced tactile data processing frameworks within robotic systems to achieve truly embodied and responsive manipulation capabilities.</p></details> | 4 pages, |

With the increasing number of foundation models being released, model selection has become an important issue. In this work, we study the capabilities of foundation models in medical image classification tasks by conducting a benchmark study on the MedMNIST dataset. Specifically, we adopt various foundation models ranging from convolutional to Transformer-based models and implement both end-to-end training and linear probing for all classification tasks. The results demonstrate the significant potential of these pre-trained models when transferred for medical image classification. We further conduct experiments with different image sizes and various sizes of training data.

Despite notable progress in recent years, current RVOS models remain struggle to handle complicated object descriptions due to their limited video-language understanding. To address this limitation, we present \textbf{ReferDINO}, an end-to-end RVOS model that inherits strong vision-language understanding from the pretrained visual grounding foundation models, and is further endowed with effective temporal understanding and object segmentation capabilities. In ReferDINO, we contribute three technical innovations for effectively adapting the foundation models to RVOS: 1) an object-consistent temporal enhancer that capitalizes on the pretrained object-text representations to enhance temporal understanding and object consistency; 2) a grounding-guided deformable mask decoder that integrates text and grounding conditions to generate accurate object masks; 3) a confidence-aware query pruning strategy that significantly improves the object decoding efficiency without compromising performance. We conduct extensive experiments on five public RVOS benchmarks to demonstrate that our proposed ReferDINO outperforms state-of-the-art methods significantly.

To address this, we introduce VL-DCOPs, a framework that takes advantage of large multimodal foundation models (LFMs) to automatically generate constraints from both visual and linguistic instructions. We then introduce a spectrum of agent archetypes for solving VL-DCOPs: from a neuro-symbolic agent that delegates some of the algorithmic decisions to an LFM, to a fully neural agent that depends entirely on an LFM for coordination. We evaluate these agent archetypes using state-of-the-art LLMs (large language models) and VLMs (vision language models) on three novel VL-DCOP tasks and compare their respective advantages and drawbacks. Lastly, we discuss how this work extends to broader frontier challenges in the DCOP literature.</p></details> |  |

However, traditional AI methods often rely on task-specific model designs and training, which constrain both the scalability of model size and generalization across different tasks. Here, we introduce ChemFM, a large foundation model specifically developed for chemicals. ChemFM comprises 3 billion parameters and is pre-trained on 178 million molecules using self-supervised causal language modeling to extract generalizable molecular representations. This model can be adapted to diverse downstream chemical applications using either full-parameter or parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods. ChemFM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art task-specific AI models across all tested tasks. Notably, it achieves up to 67.48% performance improvement across 34 property prediction benchmarks, up to 33.80% reduction in mean average deviation between conditioned and actual properties of generated molecules in conditional molecular generation tasks, and up to 3.7% top-1 accuracy improvement across 4 reaction prediction datasets. Moreover, ChemFM demonstrates its superior performance in predicting antibiotic activity and cytotoxicity, highlighting its potential to advance the discovery of novel antibiotics. We anticipate that ChemFM will significantly advance chemistry research by providing a foundation model capable of effectively generalizing across a broad range of tasks with minimal additional training.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient 2D CT Foundation Model for Contrast Phase Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14066v1)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Purpose: The purpose of this study is to harness the efficiency of a 2D foundation model to develop a robust phase classifier that is resilient to domain shifts. Materials and Methods: This retrospective study utilized three public datasets from separate institutions. A 2D foundation model was trained on the DeepLesion dataset (mean age: 51.2, s.d.: 17.6; 2398 males) to generate embeddings from 2D CT slices for downstream contrast phase classification. The classifier was trained on the VinDr Multiphase dataset and externally validated on the WAW-TACE dataset. The 2D model was also compared to three 3D supervised models. Results: On the VinDr dataset (146 male, 63 female, 56 unidentified), the model achieved near-perfect AUROC scores and F1 scores of 99.2%, 94.2%, and 93.1% for non-contrast, arterial, and venous phases, respectively. The `Other' category scored lower (F1: 73.4%) due to combining multiple contrast phases into one class. On the WAW-TACE dataset (mean age: 66.1, s.d.: 10.0; 185 males), the model showed strong performance with AUROCs of 91.0% and 85.6%, and F1 scores of 87.3% and 74.1% for non-contrast and arterial phases. Venous phase performance was lower, with AUROC and F1 scores of 81.7% and 70.2% respectively, due to label mismatches. Compared to 3D supervised models, the approach trained faster, performed as well or better, and showed greater robustness to domain shifts. Conclusion: The robustness of the 2D Foundation model may be potentially useful for automation of hanging protocols and data orchestration for clinical deployment of AI algorithms.</p></details> |  |

We perform a thorough evaluation of various design choices, including the choice of backbone and loss functions, and evaluate the proposed methodology on zero-shot classification and image-retrieval tasks. While zero-shot image-retrieval remains challenging, zero-shot classification results demonstrate that the proposed approach can meaningfully align the representations of 3D MRI with tabular data.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 2 figures.

This study introduces an evaluation framework for assessing the clinical impact and translatability of SAM, MedSAM, and SAM2, using musculoskeletal MRI as a case study. We tested these models across zero-shot and finetuned paradigms to assess their ability to process diverse anatomical structures and effectuate clinically reliable biomarkers, including cartilage thickness, muscle volume, and disc height. We engineered a modular pipeline emphasizing scalability, clinical relevance, and workflow integration, reducing manual effort and aligning validation with end-user expectations. Hierarchical modeling revealed how dataset mixing, anatomical complexity, and MRI acquisition parameters influence performance, providing insights into the role of imaging refinements in improving segmentation accuracy. This work demonstrates how clinically focused evaluations can connect computational advancements with tangible applications, creating a pathway for foundation models to address medical challenges. By emphasizing interdisciplinary collaboration and aligning technical innovation with clinical priorities, our framework provides a roadmap for advancing machine learning technologies into scalable and impactful biomedical solutions.</p></details> |  |

In this study, we propose MEDFORM, a multimodal pre-training strategy that guides CT image representation learning using complementary information from clinical data for medical foundation model development. MEDFORM efficiently processes CT slice through multiple instance learning (MIL) and adopts a dual pre-training strategy: first pretraining the CT slice feature extractor using SimCLR-based self-supervised learning, then aligning CT and clinical modalities through cross-modal contrastive learning. Our model was pre-trained on three different cancer types: lung cancer (141,171 slices), breast cancer (8,100 slices), colorectal cancer (10,393 slices). The experimental results demonstrated that this dual pre-training strategy improves cancer classification performance and maintains robust performance in few-shot learning scenarios.

However, the first generation of ML approaches, which depend on supervised learning with annotated data to create task-specific models, faces significant limitations in scaling to the diverse sensor modalities, deployment configurations, application tasks, and operating dynamics characterizing real-world CPS-IoT systems. The success of task-agnostic foundation models (FMs), including multimodal large language models (LLMs), in addressing similar challenges across natural language, computer vision, and human speech has generated considerable enthusiasm for and exploration of FMs and LLMs as flexible building blocks in CPS-IoT analytics pipelines, promising to reduce the need for costly task-specific engineering. Nonetheless, a significant gap persists between the current capabilities of FMs and LLMs in the CPS-IoT domain and the requirements they must meet to be viable for CPS-IoT applications. In this paper, we analyze and characterize this gap through a thorough examination of the state of the art and our research, which extends beyond it in various dimensions. Based on the results of our analysis and research, we identify essential desiderata that CPS-IoT domain-specific FMs and LLMs must satisfy to bridge this gap.

One of the fundamental limitations of the top-performing SAR ATR methods is that the learning paradigm is supervised, task-specific, limited-category, closed-world learning, which depends on massive amounts of accurately annotated samples that are expensively labeled by expert SAR analysts and have limited generalization capability and scalability. In this work, we make the first attempt towards building a foundation model for SAR ATR, termed SARATR-X. SARATR-X learns generalizable representations via self-supervised learning (SSL) and provides a cornerstone for label-efficient model adaptation to generic SAR target detection and classification tasks. Specifically, SARATR-X is trained on 0.18 M unlabelled SAR target samples, which are curated by combining contemporary benchmarks and constitute the largest publicly available dataset till now. Considering the characteristics of SAR images, a backbone tailored for SAR ATR is carefully designed, and a two-step SSL method endowed with multi-scale gradient features was applied to ensure the feature diversity and model scalability of SARATR-X. The capabilities of SARATR-X are evaluated on classification under few-shot and robustness settings and detection across various categories and scenes, and impressive performance is achieved, often competitive with or even superior to prior fully supervised, semi-supervised, or self-supervised algorithms. Our SARATR-X and the curated dataset are released at https://github.com/waterdisappear/SARATR-X to foster research into foundation models for SAR image interpretation.</p></details> | 20 pages, 9 figures |

Previous work on GFMs focused on tailoring model architecture and pre-text tasks, and did not investigate the impact of pre-training data selection on model performance. However, recent works from other domains show that the pre-training data distribution is an important factor influencing the performance of the foundation models. With this motivation, our research explores how the geographic distribution of pre-training data affects the performance of GFMs. We evaluated several pre-training data distributions by sampling different compositions from a global data pool. Our experiments with two GFMs on downstream tasks indicate that balanced and globally representative data compositions often outperform region-specific sampling, highlighting the importance of diversity and global coverage in pre-training data. Our results suggest that the most appropriate data sampling technique may depend on the specific GFM architecture. These findings will support the development of robust GFMs by incorporating quality pre-training data distributions, ultimately improving machine learning solutions for Earth observation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Good Data for Generative AI @ AAAI 2025</p></details> |

However, prostate ultrasound images lack pixel-level cancer annotations, introducing label noise. Current approaches often focus on limited regions of interest (ROIs), disregarding anatomical context necessary for accurate diagnosis. Foundation models can overcome this limitation by analyzing entire images to capture global spatial relationships; however, they still encounter challenges stemming from the weak labels associated with coarse pathology annotations in ultrasound data. We introduce Cinepro, a novel framework that strengthens foundation models' ability to localize PCa in ultrasound cineloops. Cinepro adapts robust training by integrating the proportion of cancer tissue reported by pathology in a biopsy core into its loss function to address label noise, providing a more nuanced supervision. Additionally, it leverages temporal data across multiple frames to apply robust augmentations, enhancing the model's ability to learn stable cancer-related features. Cinepro demonstrates superior performance on a multi-center prostate ultrasound dataset, achieving an AUROC of 77.1% and a balanced accuracy of 83.8%, surpassing current benchmarks. These findings underscore Cinepro's promise in advancing foundation models for weakly labeled ultrasound data.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted to IEEE ISBI 2025</p></details> |
| **[Time-Series Foundation Model for Value-at-Risk Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11773v6)** | 2025-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study is the first to analyze the performance of a time-series foundation model for Value-at-Risk (VaR), which essentially forecasts the left-tail quantiles of returns. Foundation models, pre-trained on diverse datasets, can be applied in a zero-shot setting with minimal data or further improved through finetuning. We compare Google's TimesFM model to conventional parametric and non-parametric models, including GARCH and Generalized Autoregressive Score (GAS), using 19 years of daily returns from the S&P 100 index and its constituents. Backtesting with over 8.5 years of out-of-sample data shows that the fine-tuned foundation model consistently outperforms traditional methods in actual-over-expected ratios. For the quantile score loss function, it performs comparably to the best econometric model, GAS. Overall, the foundation model ranks as the best or among the top performers across the 0.01, 0.025, 0.05, and 0.1 quantile forecasting. Fine-tuning significantly improves accuracy, showing that zero-shot use is not optimal for VaR.</p></details> |  |
| **[Explainability for Vision Foundation Models: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12203v1)** | 2025-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As artificial intelligence systems become increasingly integrated into daily life, the field of explainability has gained significant attention. This trend is particularly driven by the complexity of modern AI models and their decision-making processes. The advent of foundation models, characterized by their extensive generalization capabilities and emergent uses, has further complicated this landscape. Foundation models occupy an ambiguous position in the explainability domain: their complexity makes them inherently challenging to interpret, yet they are increasingly leveraged as tools to construct explainable models. In this survey, we explore the intersection of foundation models and eXplainable AI (XAI) in the vision domain. We begin by compiling a comprehensive corpus of papers that bridge these fields. Next, we categorize these works based on their architectural characteristics. We then discuss the challenges faced by current research in integrating XAI within foundation models. Furthermore, we review common evaluation methodologies for these combined approaches. Finally, we present key observations and insights from our survey, offering directions for future research in this rapidly evolving field.</p></details> |  |
| **[Are Traditional Deep Learning Model Approaches as Effective as a Retinal-Specific Foundation Model for Ocular and Systemic Disease Detection?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12016v1)** | 2025-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Background: RETFound, a self-supervised, retina-specific foundation model (FM), showed potential in downstream applications. However, its comparative performance with traditional deep learning (DL) models remains incompletely understood. This study aimed to evaluate RETFound against three ImageNet-pretrained supervised DL models (ResNet50, ViT-base, SwinV2) in detecting ocular and systemic diseases. Methods: We fine-tuned/trained RETFound and three DL models on full datasets, 50%, 20%, and fixed sample sizes (400, 200, 100 images, with half comprising disease cases; for each DR severity class, 100 and 50 cases were used. Fine-tuned models were tested internally using the SEED (53,090 images) and APTOS-2019 (3,672 images) datasets and externally validated on population-based (BES, CIEMS, SP2, UKBB) and open-source datasets (ODIR-5k, PAPILA, GAMMA, IDRiD, MESSIDOR-2). Model performance was compared using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and Z-tests with Bonferroni correction (P<0.05/3). Interpretation: Traditional DL models are mostly comparable to RETFound for ocular disease detection with large datasets. However, RETFound is superior in systemic disease detection with smaller datasets. These findings offer valuable insights into the respective merits and limitation of traditional models and FMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[MedicoSAM: Towards foundation models for medical image segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11734v1)** | 2025-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical image segmentation is an important analysis task in clinical practice and research. Deep learning has massively advanced the field, but current approaches are mostly based on models trained for a specific task. Training such models or adapting them to a new condition is costly due to the need for (manually) labeled data. The emergence of vision foundation models, especially Segment Anything, offers a path to universal segmentation for medical images, overcoming these issues. Here, we study how to improve Segment Anything for medical images by comparing different finetuning strategies on a large and diverse dataset. We evaluate the finetuned models on a wide range of interactive and (automatic) semantic segmentation tasks. We find that the performance can be clearly improved for interactive segmentation. However, semantic segmentation does not benefit from pretraining on medical images. Our best model, MedicoSAM, is publicly available at https://github.com/computational-cell-analytics/medico-sam. We show that it is compatible with existing tools for data annotation and believe that it will be of great practical value.</p></details> |  |

However, graph learning has predominantly focused on single-graph models, tailored to specific tasks or datasets, lacking the ability to transfer learned knowledge to different domains. This limitation stems from the inherent complexity and diversity of graph structures, along with the different feature and label spaces specific to graph data. In this paper, we recognize text as an effective unifying medium and employ Text-Attributed Graphs (TAGs) to leverage this potential. We present our UniGraph framework, designed to learn a foundation model for TAGs, which is capable of generalizing to unseen graphs and tasks across diverse domains. Unlike single-graph models that use pre-computed node features of varying dimensions as input, our approach leverages textual features for unifying node representations, even for graphs such as molecular graphs that do not naturally have textual features. We propose a novel cascaded architecture of Language Models (LMs) and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) as backbone networks. Additionally, we propose the first pre-training algorithm specifically designed for large-scale self-supervised learning on TAGs, based on Masked Graph Modeling. We introduce graph instruction tuning using Large Language Models (LLMs) to enable zero-shot prediction ability. Our comprehensive experiments across various graph learning tasks and domains demonstrate the model's effectiveness in self-supervised representation learning on unseen graphs, few-shot in-context transfer, and zero-shot transfer, even surpassing or matching the performance of GNNs that have undergone supervised training on target datasets.</p></details> | KDD 2025 |
| **[Generalizable Disaster Damage Assessment via Change Detection with Vision Foundation Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08020v2)** | 2025-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increasing frequency and intensity of natural disasters call for rapid and accurate damage assessment. In response, disaster benchmark datasets from high-resolution satellite imagery have been constructed to develop methods for detecting damaged areas. However, these methods face significant challenges when applied to previously unseen regions due to the limited geographical and disaster-type diversity in the existing datasets. We introduce DAVI (Disaster Assessment with VIsion foundation model), a novel approach that addresses domain disparities and detects structural damage at the building level without requiring ground-truth labels for target regions. DAVI combines task-specific knowledge from a model trained on source regions with task-agnostic knowledge from an image segmentation model to generate pseudo labels indicating potential damage in target regions. It then utilizes a two-stage refinement process, which operate at both pixel and image levels, to accurately identify changes in disaster-affected areas. Our evaluation, including a case study on the 2023 T\"urkiye earthquake, demonstrates that our model achieves exceptional performance across diverse terrains (e.g., North America, Asia, and the Middle East) and disaster types (e.g., wildfires, hurricanes, and tsunamis). This confirms its robustness in disaster assessment without dependence on ground-truth labels and highlights its practical applicability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI 2025 (oral)</p></details> |

The lack of large-scale, comprehensive datasets and sophisticated monitoring systems has created a widening gap between industry advancement and public health oversight. This paper addresses this critical challenge by introducing Tobacco-1M, a comprehensive dataset of one million tobacco product images with hierarchical labels spanning 75 product categories, and DEFEND, a novel foundation model for tobacco product understanding. Our approach integrates a Feature Enhancement Module for rich multimodal representation learning, a Local-Global Visual Coherence mechanism for detailed feature discrimination, and an Enhanced Image-Text Alignment strategy for precise product characterization. Experimental results demonstrate DEFEND's superior performance, achieving 83.1% accuracy in product classification and 73.8% in visual question-answering tasks, outperforming existing methods by significant margins. Moreover, the model exhibits robust zero-shot learning capabilities with 45.6% accuracy on novel product categories. This work provides regulatory bodies and public health researchers with powerful tools for monitoring emerging tobacco products and marketing strategies, potentially revolutionizing approaches to tobacco control and public health surveillance.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 5 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

Here, we present a systematic evaluation of transfer learning strategies for brain tumor classification using these models. We analyzed 252 cases comprising five major tumor types: glioblastoma, astrocytoma, oligodendroglioma, primary central nervous system lymphoma, and metastatic tumors. Comparing state-of-the-art foundation models with conventional approaches, we found that foundation models demonstrated robust classification performance with as few as 10 patches per case, challenging the traditional assumption that extensive per-case image sampling is necessary. Furthermore, our evaluation revealed that simple transfer learning strategies like linear probing were sufficient, while fine-tuning often degraded model performance. These findings suggest a paradigm shift from extensive data collection to efficient utilization of pretrained features, providing practical implications for implementing AI-assisted diagnosis in clinical pathology.</p></details> | 25 pages, 7 figures |

These models are meant as foundation models with deep knowledge about e-commerce, that form a base for instruction- and fine-tuning. The e-Llama models are obtained by continuously pretraining the Llama 3.1 base models on 1 trillion tokens of domain-specific data. We discuss our approach and motivate our choice of hyperparameters with a series of ablation studies. To quantify how well the models have been adapted to the e-commerce domain, we define and implement a set of multilingual, e-commerce specific evaluation tasks. We show that, when carefully choosing the training setup, the Llama 3.1 models can be adapted towards the new domain without sacrificing significant performance on general domain tasks. We also explore the possibility of merging the adapted model and the base model for a better control of the performance trade-off between domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>inclu...</summary><p>include full author name</p></details> |

Current road obstacle detection methods typically assign a score to each pixel and apply a threshold to generate final predictions. However, selecting an appropriate threshold is challenging, and the per-pixel classification approach often leads to fragmented predictions with numerous false positives. In this work, we propose a novel method that leverages segment-level features from visual foundation models and likelihood ratios to predict road obstacles directly. By focusing on segments rather than individual pixels, our approach enhances detection accuracy, reduces false positives, and offers increased robustness to scene variability. We benchmark our approach against existing methods on the RoadObstacle and LostAndFound datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance without needing a predefined threshold.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 4 figures, and 1 table, to be published in VISAPP 2025</p></details> |
| **[Lotus: Diffusion-based Visual Foundation Model for High-quality Dense Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18124v5)** | 2025-01-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Leveraging the visual priors of pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models offers a promising solution to enhance zero-shot generalization in dense prediction tasks. However, existing methods often uncritically use the original diffusion formulation, which may not be optimal due to the fundamental differences between dense prediction and image generation. In this paper, we provide a systemic analysis of the diffusion formulation for the dense prediction, focusing on both quality and efficiency. And we find that the original parameterization type for image generation, which learns to predict noise, is harmful for dense prediction; the multi-step noising/denoising diffusion process is also unnecessary and challenging to optimize. Based on these insights, we introduce Lotus, a diffusion-based visual foundation model with a simple yet effective adaptation protocol for dense prediction. Specifically, Lotus is trained to directly predict annotations instead of noise, thereby avoiding harmful variance. We also reformulate the diffusion process into a single-step procedure, simplifying optimization and significantly boosting inference speed. Additionally, we introduce a novel tuning strategy called detail preserver, which achieves more accurate and fine-grained predictions. Without scaling up the training data or model capacity, Lotus achieves SoTA performance in zero-shot depth and normal estimation across various datasets. It also enhances efficiency, being significantly faster than most existing diffusion-based methods. Lotus' superior quality and efficiency also enable a wide range of practical applications, such as joint estimation, single/multi-view 3D reconstruction, etc. Project page: https://lotus3d.github.io/.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The first two authors contributed equally.

| **[Fixing Function-Level Code Generation Errors for Foundation Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00676v2)** | 2025-01-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Function-level code generation leverages foundation Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically produce source code with expected functionality. It has been widely investigated and applied in intelligent programming assistants, such as GitHub Copilot, to enhance software development productivity. Despite advancements in foundation LLMs, the generation involves many errors. Existing studies leverage static analysis tools (e.g., TBar) or add another fixing LLM (i.e., LDB) to post-process these errors. However, there are still many errors remaining to be solved because their root causes have not been investigated yet, making it challenging to design better fixing tools. In this paper, we first conducted an empirical study on the generation errors. Specifically, we reproduced 14 representative LLMs on the HumanEval dataset and verified their correctness. We obtained 12,837 code generation errors and conducted an analysis of their causes, leading to 19 categories of error causes. Our empirical analysis indicated that three of these causes can be directly fixed. Based on the findings, we proposed a fixing method called LlmFix, which addresses these three types of errors through a three-step process: filtering code for indentation correction, truncating redundant generated code, and importing missing modules. Evaluations of LlmFix are conducted from two perspectives: its performance on error-fixing tasks and its impact on improving function-level code generation tasks. For error fixing performance, we built an evaluation dataset LlmErrorEval. Experimental results show that LlmFix achieves a fix rate of 17.1% outperforming the best LDB by 8.9%. For code generation improvements, evaluations of LlmFix on both the HumanEval and MBPP datasets demonstrate its effectiveness, improving code generation accuracy by an average of 7.5% across 14 LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unveiling the Mystery of Weight in Large Foundation Models: Gaussian Distribution Never Fades](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10661v1)** | 2025-01-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a pioneering exploration of the mechanisms underlying large foundation models' (LFMs) weights, aiming to simplify AI research. Through extensive observation and analysis on prevailing LFMs, we find that regardless of initialization strategies, their weights predominantly follow a Gaussian distribution, with occasional sharp, inverted T-shaped, or linear patterns. We further discover that the weights share the i.i.d. properties of Gaussian noise, and explore their direct relationship. We find that transformation weights can be derived from Gaussian noise, and they primarily serve to increase the standard deviation of pre-trained weights, with their standard deviation growing with layer depth. In other words, transformation weights broaden the acceptable deviation from the optimal weights, facilitating adaptation to downstream tasks. Building upon the above conclusions, we thoroughly discussed the nature of optimal weights, ultimately concluding that they should exhibit zero-mean, symmetry, and sparsity, with the sparse values being a truncated Gaussian distribution and a few outliers. Our experiments in LFM adaptation and editing demonstrate the effectiveness of these insights. We hope these findings can provide a foundational understanding to pave the way for future advancements in the LFM community.</p></details> | Revisions ongoing |
| **[Exploring Prediction Targets in Masked Pre-Training for Speech Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10788v2)** | 2025-01-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Speech foundation models, such as HuBERT and its variants, are pre-trained on large amounts of unlabeled speech data and then used for a range of downstream tasks. These models use a masked prediction objective, where the model learns to predict information about masked input segments from the unmasked context. The choice of prediction targets in this framework impacts their performance on downstream tasks. For instance, models pre-trained with targets that capture prosody learn representations suited for speaker-related tasks, while those pre-trained with targets that capture phonetics learn representations suited for content-related tasks. Moreover, prediction targets can differ in the level of detail they capture. Models pre-trained with targets that encode fine-grained acoustic features perform better on tasks like denoising, while those pre-trained with targets focused on higher-level abstractions are more effective for content-related tasks. Despite the importance of prediction targets, the design choices that affect them have not been thoroughly studied. This work explores the design choices and their impact on downstream task performance. Our results indicate that the commonly used design choices for HuBERT can be suboptimal. We propose approaches to create more informative prediction targets and demonstrate their effectiveness through improvements across various downstream tasks.</p></details> | ICASSP 2025 |
| **[Universal Actions for Enhanced Embodied Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10105v1)** | 2025-01-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training on diverse, internet-scale data is a key factor in the success of recent large foundation models. Yet, using the same recipe for building embodied agents has faced noticeable difficulties. Despite the availability of many crowd-sourced embodied datasets, their action spaces often exhibit significant heterogeneity due to distinct physical embodiment and control interfaces for different robots, causing substantial challenges in developing embodied foundation models using cross-domain data. In this paper, we introduce UniAct, a new embodied foundation modeling framework operating in a tokenized Universal Action Space. Our learned universal actions capture the generic atomic behaviors across diverse robots by exploiting their shared structural features, and enable enhanced cross-domain data utilization and cross-embodiment generalizations by eliminating the notorious heterogeneity. The universal actions can be efficiently translated back to heterogeneous actionable commands by simply adding embodiment-specific details, from which fast adaptation to new robots becomes simple and straightforward. Our 0.5B instantiation of UniAct outperforms 14X larger SOTA embodied foundation models in extensive evaluations on various real-world and simulation robots, showcasing exceptional cross-embodiment control and adaptation capability, highlighting the crucial benefit of adopting universal actions.
