| **[Spatial Hierarchy and Temporal Attention Guided Cross Masking for Self-supervised Skeleton-based Action Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17951v1)** | 2024-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In self-supervised skeleton-based action recognition, the mask reconstruction paradigm is gaining interest in enhancing model refinement and robustness through effective masking. However, previous works primarily relied on a single masking criterion, resulting in the model overfitting specific features and overlooking other effective information. In this paper, we introduce a hierarchy and attention guided cross-masking framework (HA-CM) that applies masking to skeleton sequences from both spatial and temporal perspectives. Specifically, in spatial graphs, we utilize hyperbolic space to maintain joint distinctions and effectively preserve the hierarchical structure of high-dimensional skeletons, employing joint hierarchy as the masking criterion. In temporal flows, we substitute traditional distance metrics with the global attention of joints for masking, addressing the convergence of distances in high-dimensional space and the lack of a global perspective. Additionally, we incorporate cross-contrast loss based on the cross-masking framework into the loss function to enhance the model's learning of instance-level features. HA-CM shows efficiency and universality on three public large-scale datasets, NTU-60, NTU-120, and PKU-MMD. The source code of our HA-CM is available at https://github.com/YinxPeng/HA-CM-main.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages,6 figures,IEEE Trans</p></details> |

| **[Safe Time-Varying Optimization based on Gaussian Processes with Spatio-Temporal Kernel](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18000v1)** | 2024-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring safety is a key aspect in sequential decision making problems, such as robotics or process control. The complexity of the underlying systems often makes finding the optimal decision challenging, especially when the safety-critical system is time-varying. Overcoming the problem of optimizing an unknown time-varying reward subject to unknown time-varying safety constraints, we propose TVSafeOpt, a new algorithm built on Bayesian optimization with a spatio-temporal kernel. The algorithm is capable of safely tracking a time-varying safe region without the need for explicit change detection. Optimality guarantees are also provided for the algorithm when the optimization problem becomes stationary. We show that TVSafeOpt compares favorably against SafeOpt on synthetic data, both regarding safety and optimality. Evaluation on a realistic case study with gas compressors confirms that TVSafeOpt ensures safety when solving time-varying optimization problems with unknown reward and safety functions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |
| **[Dynamic Subframe Splitting and Spatio-Temporal Motion Entangled Sparse Attention for RGB-E Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17560v1)** | 2024-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Event-based bionic camera asynchronously captures dynamic scenes with high temporal resolution and high dynamic range, offering potential for the integration of events and RGB under conditions of illumination degradation and fast motion. Existing RGB-E tracking methods model event characteristics utilising attention mechanism of Transformer before integrating both modalities. Nevertheless, these methods involve aggregating the event stream into a single event frame, lacking the utilisation of the temporal information inherent in the event stream.Moreover, the traditional attention mechanism is well-suited for dense semantic features, while the attention mechanism for sparse event features require revolution. In this paper, we propose a dynamic event subframe splitting strategy to split the event stream into more fine-grained event clusters, aiming to capture spatio-temporal features that contain motion cues. Based on this, we design an event-based sparse attention mechanism to enhance the interaction of event features in temporal and spatial dimensions. The experimental results indicate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on the FE240 and COESOT datasets, providing an effective processing manner for the event data.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 8 figures, conference</p></details> |
| **[SEA-ViT: Sea Surface Currents Forecasting Using Vision Transformer and GRU-Based Spatio-Temporal Covariance Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16313v2)** | 2024-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Forecasting sea surface currents is essential for applications such as maritime navigation, environmental monitoring, and climate analysis, particularly in regions like the Gulf of Thailand and the Andaman Sea. This paper introduces SEA-ViT, an advanced deep learning model that integrates Vision Transformer (ViT) with bidirectional Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) to capture spatio-temporal covariance for predicting sea surface currents (U, V) using high-frequency radar (HF) data. The name SEA-ViT is derived from ``Sea Surface Currents Forecasting using Vision Transformer,'' highlighting the model's emphasis on ocean dynamics and its use of the ViT architecture to enhance forecasting capabilities. SEA-ViT is designed to unravel complex dependencies by leveraging a rich dataset spanning over 30 years and incorporating ENSO indices (El Ni\~no, La Ni\~na, and neutral phases) to address the intricate relationship between geographic coordinates and climatic variations. This development enhances the predictive capabilities for sea surface currents, supporting the efforts of the Geo-Informatics and Space Technology Development Agency (GISTDA) in Thailand's maritime regions. The code and pretrained models are available at \url{https://github.com/kaopanboonyuen/gistda-ai-sea-surface-currents}.</p></details> | 16 pages |

Our approach uses parsimonious parameterisations of multivariate autoregressive count time series models, including possible regression on covariates. We control the number of parameters by specifying spatial neighbourhood structures for possibly huge matrices that take into account spatio-temporal dependencies. This work is motivated by real data applications which call for suitable models. Extensive simulation studies show that our approach yields reliable estimators.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 16 figures and 22 tables</p></details> |
| **[AutoSTF: Decoupled Neural Architecture Search for Cost-Effective Automated Spatio-Temporal Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16586v1)** | 2024-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal forecasting is a critical component of various smart city applications, such as transportation optimization, energy management, and socio-economic analysis. Recently, several automated spatio-temporal forecasting methods have been proposed to automatically search the optimal neural network architecture for capturing complex spatio-temporal dependencies. However, the existing automated approaches suffer from expensive neural architecture search overhead, which hinders their practical use and the further exploration of diverse spatio-temporal operators in a finer granularity. In this paper, we propose AutoSTF, a decoupled automatic neural architecture search framework for cost-effective automated spatio-temporal forecasting. From the efficiency perspective, we first decouple the mixed search space into temporal space and spatial space and respectively devise representation compression and parameter-sharing schemes to mitigate the parameter explosion. The decoupled spatio-temporal search not only expedites the model optimization process but also leaves new room for more effective spatio-temporal dependency modeling. From the effectiveness perspective, we propose a multi-patch transfer module to jointly capture multi-granularity temporal dependencies and extend the spatial search space to enable finer-grained layer-wise spatial dependency search. Extensive experiments on eight datasets demonstrate the superiority of AutoSTF in terms of both accuracy and efficiency. Specifically, our proposed method achieves up to 13.48x speed-up compared to state-of-the-art automatic spatio-temporal forecasting methods while maintaining the best forecasting accuracy.</p></details> | 16 pages, 13 figures |
| **[Automated Spatio-Temporal Weather Modeling for Load Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16326v1)** | 2024-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Electricity is difficult to store, except at prohibitive cost, and therefore the balance between generation and load must be maintained at all times. Electricity is traditionally managed by anticipating demand and intermittent production (wind, solar) and matching flexible production (hydro, nuclear, coal and gas). Accurate forecasting of electricity load and renewable production is therefore essential to ensure grid performance and stability. Both are highly dependent on meteorological variables (temperature, wind, sunshine). These dependencies are complex and difficult to model. On the one hand, spatial variations do not have a uniform impact because population, industry, and wind and solar farms are not evenly distributed across the territory. On the other hand, temporal variations can have delayed effects on load (due to the thermal inertia of buildings). With access to observations from different weather stations and simulated data from meteorological models, we believe that both phenomena can be modeled together. In today's state-of-the-art load forecasting models, the spatio-temporal modeling of the weather is fixed. In this work, we aim to take advantage of the automated representation and spatio-temporal feature extraction capabilities of deep neural networks to improve spatio-temporal weather modeling for load forecasting. We compare our deep learning-based methodology with the state-of-the-art on French national load. This methodology could also be fully adapted to forecasting renewable energy production.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatio-Temporal Motion Retargeting for Quadruped Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11557v2)** | 2024-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work introduces a motion retargeting approach for legged robots, which aims to create motion controllers that imitate the fine behavior of animals. Our approach, namely spatio-temporal motion retargeting (STMR), guides imitation learning procedures by transferring motion from source to target, effectively bridging the morphological disparities by ensuring the feasibility of imitation on the target system. Our STMR method comprises two components: spatial motion retargeting (SMR) and temporal motion retargeting (TMR). On the one hand, SMR tackles motion retargeting at the kinematic level by generating kinematically feasible whole-body motions from keypoint trajectories. On the other hand, TMR aims to retarget motion at the dynamic level by optimizing motion in the temporal domain. We showcase the effectiveness of our method in facilitating Imitation Learning (IL) for complex animal movements through a series of simulation and hardware experiments. In these experiments, our STMR method successfully tailored complex animal motions from various media, including video captured by a hand-held camera, to fit the morphology and physical properties of the target robots. This enabled RL policy training for precise motion tracking, while baseline methods struggled with highly dynamic motion involving flying phases. Moreover, we validated that the control policy can successfully imitate six different motions in two quadruped robots with different dimensions and physical properties in real-world settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>34 pa...</summary><p>34 pages, 7 figures, videos available at https://terry97-guel.github.io/STMR-RL.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[SFDA-rPPG: Source-Free Domain Adaptive Remote Physiological Measurement with Spatio-Temporal Consistency](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12040v1)** | 2024-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Remote Photoplethysmography (rPPG) is a non-contact method that uses facial video to predict changes in blood volume, enabling physiological metrics measurement. Traditional rPPG models often struggle with poor generalization capacity in unseen domains. Current solutions to this problem is to improve its generalization in the target domain through Domain Generalization (DG) or Domain Adaptation (DA). However, both traditional methods require access to both source domain data and target domain data, which cannot be implemented in scenarios with limited access to source data, and another issue is the privacy of accessing source domain data. In this paper, we propose the first Source-free Domain Adaptation benchmark for rPPG measurement (SFDA-rPPG), which overcomes these limitations by enabling effective domain adaptation without access to source domain data. Our framework incorporates a Three-Branch Spatio-Temporal Consistency Network (TSTC-Net) to enhance feature consistency across domains. Furthermore, we propose a new rPPG distribution alignment loss based on the Frequency-domain Wasserstein Distance (FWD), which leverages optimal transport to align power spectrum distributions across domains effectively and further enforces the alignment of the three branches. Extensive cross-domain experiments and ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method in source-free domain adaptation settings. Our findings highlight the significant contribution of the proposed FWD loss for distributional alignment, providing a valuable reference for future research and applications.

| **[EventAug: Multifaceted Spatio-Temporal Data Augmentation Methods for Event-based Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11813v1)** | 2024-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The event camera has demonstrated significant success across a wide range of areas due to its low time latency and high dynamic range. However, the community faces challenges such as data deficiency and limited diversity, often resulting in over-fitting and inadequate feature learning. Notably, the exploration of data augmentation techniques in the event community remains scarce. This work aims to address this gap by introducing a systematic augmentation scheme named EventAug to enrich spatial-temporal diversity. In particular, we first propose Multi-scale Temporal Integration (MSTI) to diversify the motion speed of objects, then introduce Spatial-salient Event Mask (SSEM) and Temporal-salient Event Mask (TSEM) to enrich object variants. Our EventAug can facilitate models learning with richer motion patterns, object variants and local spatio-temporal relations, thus improving model robustness to varied moving speeds, occlusions, and action disruptions. Experiment results show that our augmentation method consistently yields significant improvements across different tasks and backbones (e.g., a 4.87% accuracy gain on DVS128 Gesture). Our code will be publicly available for this community.</p></details> |  |
| **[Modelling Volatility of Spatio-temporal Integer-valued Data with Network Structure and Asymmetry](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01521v2)** | 2024-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes a spatial threshold GARCH-type model for dynamic spatio-temporal integer-valued data with network structure. The proposed model can simplify the parameterization by using network structure in data, and can capture the asymmetric property in dynamic volatility by adopting a threshold structure. The proposed model assumes the conditional distribution is Poisson distribution. Asymptotic theory of maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) for the spatial model is derived when both sample size and network dimension are large. We obtain asymptotic statistical inferences via investigation of the weak dependence of components of the model and application of limit theorems for weakly dependent random fields. Simulation studies and a real data example are presented to support our methodology.</p></details> |  |
| **[STCMOT: Spatio-Temporal Cohesion Learning for UAV-Based Multiple Object Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11234v1)** | 2024-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiple object tracking (MOT) in Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) videos is important for diverse applications in computer vision. Current MOT trackers rely on accurate object detection results and precise matching of target reidentification (ReID). These methods focus on optimizing target spatial attributes while overlooking temporal cues in modelling object relationships, especially for challenging tracking conditions such as object deformation and blurring, etc. To address the above-mentioned issues, we propose a novel Spatio-Temporal Cohesion Multiple Object Tracking framework (STCMOT), which utilizes historical embedding features to model the representation of ReID and detection features in a sequential order. Concretely, a temporal embedding boosting module is introduced to enhance the discriminability of individual embedding based on adjacent frame cooperation. While the trajectory embedding is then propagated by a temporal detection refinement module to mine salient target locations in the temporal field. Extensive experiments on the VisDrone2019 and UAVDT datasets demonstrate our STCMOT sets a new state-of-the-art performance in MOTA and IDF1 metrics.

| **[Spatio-Temporal-Network Point Processes for Modeling Crime Events with Landmarks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10882v1)** | 2024-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-exciting point processes are widely used to model the contagious effects of crime events living within continuous geographic space, using their occurrence time and locations. However, in urban environments, most events are naturally constrained within the city's street network structure, and the contagious effects of crime are governed by such a network geography. Meanwhile, the complex distribution of urban infrastructures also plays an important role in shaping crime patterns across space. We introduce a novel spatio-temporal-network point process framework for crime modeling that integrates these urban environmental characteristics by incorporating self-attention graph neural networks. Our framework incorporates the street network structure as the underlying event space, where crime events can occur at random locations on the network edges. To realistically capture criminal movement patterns, distances between events are measured using street network distances. We then propose a new mark for a crime event by concatenating the event's crime category with the type of its nearby landmark, aiming to capture how the urban design influences the mixing structures of various crime types. A graph attention network architecture is adopted to learn the existence of mark-to-mark interactions. Extensive experiments on crime data from Valencia, Spain, demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in understanding the crime landscape and forecasting crime risks across regions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Spatio-temporal Quantile Forecasting with Curriculum Learning: Lessons Learned](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12709v2)** | 2024-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training models on spatio-temporal (ST) data poses an open problem due to the complicated and diverse nature of the data itself, and it is challenging to ensure the model's performance directly trained on the original ST data. While limiting the variety of training data can make training easier, it can also lead to a lack of knowledge and information for the model, resulting in a decrease in performance. To address this challenge, we presented an innovative paradigm that incorporates three separate forms of curriculum learning specifically targeting from spatial, temporal, and quantile perspectives. Furthermore, our framework incorporates a stacking fusion module to combine diverse information from three types of curriculum learning, resulting in a strong and thorough learning process. We demonstrated the effectiveness of this framework with extensive empirical evaluations, highlighting its better performance in addressing complex ST challenges. We provided thorough ablation studies to investigate the effectiveness of our curriculum and to explain how it contributes to the improvement of learning efficiency on ST data.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accept by sigspatial 2024</p></details> |
| **[Disentangling spatio-temporal knowledge for weakly supervised object detection and segmentation in surgical video](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15794v3)** | 2024-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Weakly supervised video object segmentation (WSVOS) enables the identification of segmentation maps without requiring an extensive training dataset of object masks, relying instead on coarse video labels indicating object presence. Current state-of-the-art methods either require multiple independent stages of processing that employ motion cues or, in the case of end-to-end trainable networks, lack in segmentation accuracy, in part due to the difficulty of learning segmentation maps from videos with transient object presence. This limits the application of WSVOS for semantic annotation of surgical videos where multiple surgical tools frequently move in and out of the field of view, a problem that is more difficult than typically encountered in WSVOS. This paper introduces Video Spatio-Temporal Disentanglement Networks (VDST-Net), a framework to disentangle spatiotemporal information using semi-decoupled knowledge distillation to predict high-quality class activation maps (CAMs). A teacher network designed to resolve temporal conflicts when specifics about object location and timing in the video are not provided works with a student network that integrates information over time by leveraging temporal dependencies. We demonstrate the efficacy of our framework on a public reference dataset and on a more challenging surgical video dataset where objects are, on average, present in less than 60\% of annotated frames. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques and generates superior segmentation masks under video-level weak supervision.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 6 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |

Specifically, we consider the global task as a conjunction of independent and collaborative tasks, defined over the absolute and relative states of agent pairs. Task dependencies in this form are then represented by a task graph, which we assume to be acyclic. From the given task graph, we provide an algorithmic approach to define a distributed sampled-data controller prioritizing the fulfilment of collaborative tasks as the primary objective, while fulfilling independent tasks unless they conflict with collaborative ones. Moreover, communication maintenance among collaborating agents is seamlessly enforced within the proposed control framework. A numerical simulation is provided to showcase the potential of our control framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>Short...</summary><p>Short version of this paper was accepted for the Conference on Decision and Control.

| **[EasyST: A Simple Framework for Spatio-Temporal Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06748v1)** | 2024-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal prediction is a crucial research area in data-driven urban computing, with implications for transportation, public safety, and environmental monitoring. However, scalability and generalization challenges remain significant obstacles. Advanced models often rely on Graph Neural Networks to encode spatial and temporal correlations, but struggle with the increased complexity of large-scale datasets. The recursive GNN-based message passing schemes used in these models hinder their training and deployment in real-life urban sensing scenarios. Moreover, long-spanning large-scale spatio-temporal data introduce distribution shifts, necessitating improved generalization performance. To address these challenges, we propose a simple framework for spatio-temporal prediction - EasyST paradigm. It learns lightweight and robust Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) by effectively distilling knowledge from complex spatio-temporal GNNs. We ensure robust knowledge distillation by integrating the spatio-temporal information bottleneck with teacher-bounded regression loss, filtering out task-irrelevant noise and avoiding erroneous guidance. We further enhance the generalization ability of the student model by incorporating spatial and temporal prompts to provide downstream task contexts. Evaluation on three spatio-temporal datasets for urban computing tasks demonstrates that EasyST surpasses state-of-the-art approaches in terms of efficiency and accuracy. The implementation code is available at: https://github.com/HKUDS/EasyST.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CIKM'2024, full paper</p></details> |
| **[A general reduced-order neural operator for spatio-temporal predictive learning on complex spatial domains](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05508v1)** | 2024-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predictive learning for spatio-temporal processes (PL-STP) on complex spatial domains plays a critical role in various scientific and engineering fields, with its essence being the construction of operators between infinite-dimensional function spaces. This paper focuses on the unequal-domain mappings in PL-STP and categorising them into increase-domain and decrease-domain mapping. Recent advances in deep learning have revealed the great potential of neural operators (NOs) to learn operators directly from observational data. However, existing NOs require input space and output space to be the same domain, which pose challenges in ensuring predictive accuracy and stability for unequal-domain mappings. To this end, this study presents a general reduced-order neural operator named Reduced-Order Neural Operator on Riemannian Manifolds (RO-NORM), which consists of two parts: the unequal-domain encoder/decoder and the same-domain approximator. Motivated by the variable separation in classical modal decomposition, the unequal-domain encoder/decoder uses the pre-computed bases to reformulate the spatio-temporal function as a sum of products between spatial (or temporal) bases and corresponding temporally (or spatially) distributed weight functions, thus the original unequal-domain mapping can be converted into a same-domain mapping. Consequently, the same-domain approximator NORM is applied to model the transformed mapping. The performance of our proposed method has been evaluated on six benchmark cases, including parametric PDEs, engineering and biomedical applications, and compared with four baseline algorithms: DeepONet, POD-DeepONet, PCA-Net, and vanilla NORM. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of RO-NORM in prediction accuracy and training efficiency for PL-STP.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Spatio-Temporal Attention-Based Method for Detecting Student Classroom Behaviors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02523v4)** | 2024-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurately detecting student behavior from classroom videos is beneficial for analyzing their classroom status and improving teaching efficiency. However, low accuracy in student classroom behavior detection is a prevalent issue. To address this issue, we propose a Spatio-Temporal Attention-Based Method for Detecting Student Classroom Behaviors (BDSTA). Firstly, the SlowFast network is used to generate motion and environmental information feature maps from the video. Then, the spatio-temporal attention module is applied to the feature maps, including information aggregation, compression and stimulation processes. Subsequently, attention maps in the time, channel and space dimensions are obtained, and multi-label behavior classification is performed based on these attention maps. To solve the long-tail data problem that exists in student classroom behavior datasets, we use an improved focal loss function to assign more weight to the tail class data during training. Experimental results are conducted on a self-made student classroom behavior dataset named STSCB. Compared with the SlowFast model, the average accuracy of student behavior classification detection improves by 8.94\% using BDSTA.</p></details> |  |
| **[Student Classroom Behavior Detection based on Spatio-Temporal Network and Multi-Model Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16267v4)** | 2024-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Using deep learning methods to detect students' classroom behavior automatically is a promising approach for analyzing their class performance and improving teaching effectiveness. However, the lack of publicly available spatio-temporal datasets on student behavior, as well as the high cost of manually labeling such datasets, pose significant challenges for researchers in this field. To address this issue, we proposed a method for extending the spatio-temporal behavior dataset in Student Classroom Scenarios (SCB-ST-Dataset4) through image dataset. Our SCB-ST-Dataset4 comprises 757265 images with 25810 labels, focusing on 3 behaviors: hand-raising, reading, writing. Our proposed method can rapidly generate spatio-temporal behavior datasets without requiring extra manual labeling. Furthermore, we proposed a Behavior Similarity Index (BSI) to explore the similarity of behaviors. We evaluated the dataset using the YOLOv5, YOLOv7, YOLOv8, and SlowFast algorithms, achieving a mean average precision (map) of up to 82.3%. Last, we fused multiple models to generate student behavior-related data from various perspectives. The experiment further demonstrates the effectiveness of our method. And SCB-ST-Dataset4 provides a robust foundation for future research in student behavior detection, potentially contributing to advancements in this field. The SCB-ST-Dataset4 is available for download at: https://github.com/Whiffe/SCB-dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2310.02522; text overlap with arXiv:2306.03318</p></details> |

Developing techniques to identify and analyze communities in these time-varying graph structures is an important challenge. In this work, we generalize existing spectral clustering algorithms from static to dynamic graphs using canonical correlation analysis (CCA) to capture the temporal evolution of clusters. Based on this extended canonical correlation framework, we define the spatio-temporal graph Laplacian and investigate its spectral properties. We connect these concepts to dynamical systems theory via transfer operators, and illustrate the advantages of our method on benchmark graphs by comparison with existing methods. We show that the spatio-temporal graph Laplacian allows for a clear interpretation of cluster structure evolution over time for directed and undirected graphs.</p></details> |  |

A critical component of disease behavior is the velocity with which disease spreads, defined as the rate of change between time and space. In this paper, we propose a spatio-temporal modeling approach to determine the velocities of infectious disease spread. Our approach assumes that the locations and times of people infected can be considered as a spatio-temporal point pattern that arises as a realization of a spatio-temporal log-Gaussian Cox process. The intensity of this process is estimated using fast Bayesian inference by employing the integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA) and the Stochastic Partial Differential Equations (SPDE) approaches. The velocity is then calculated using finite differences that approximate the derivatives of the intensity function. Finally, the directions and magnitudes of the velocities can be mapped at specific times to examine better the spread of the disease throughout the region. We demonstrate our method by analyzing COVID-19 spread in Cali, Colombia, during the 2020-2021 pandemic.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 46 figures, Journal American Statistican, submitted on 3rd of September</p></details> |
| **[LASPATED: a Library for the Analysis of SPAtio-TEmporal Discrete data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04156v3)** | 2024-09-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We describe methods, tools, and a software library called LASPATED, available on GitHub (at https://github.com/vguigues/) to fit models using spatio-temporal data and space-time discretization. A video tutorial for this library is available on YouTube. We consider two types of methods to estimate a non-homogeneous Poisson process in space and time. The methods approximate the arrival intensity function of the Poisson process by discretizing space and time, and estimating arrival intensity as a function of subregion and time interval. With such methods, it is typical that the dimension of the estimator is large relative to the amount of data, and therefore the performance of the estimator can be improved by using additional data. The first method uses additional data to add a regularization term to the likelihood function for calibrating the intensity of the Poisson process. The second method uses additional data to estimate arrival intensity as a function of covariates. We describe a Python package to perform various types of space and time discretization. We also describe two packages for the calibration of the models, one in Matlab and one in C++. We demonstrate the advantages of our methods compared to basic maximum likelihood estimation with simulated and real data. The experiments with real data calibrate models of the arrival process of emergencies to be handled by the Rio de Janeiro emergency medical service.</p></details> |  |
| **[STAA: Spatio-Temporal Alignment Attention for Short-Term Precipitation Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06732v1)** | 2024-09-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There is a great need to accurately predict short-term precipitation, which has socioeconomic effects such as agriculture and disaster prevention. Recently, the forecasting models have employed multi-source data as the multi-modality input, thus improving the prediction accuracy. However, the prevailing methods usually suffer from the desynchronization of multi-source variables, the insufficient capability of capturing spatio-temporal dependency, and unsatisfactory performance in predicting extreme precipitation events. To fix these problems, we propose a short-term precipitation forecasting model based on spatio-temporal alignment attention, with SATA as the temporal alignment module and STAU as the spatio-temporal feature extractor to filter high-pass features from precipitation signals and capture multi-term temporal dependencies. Based on satellite and ERA5 data from the southwestern region of China, our model achieves improvements of 12.61\% in terms of RMSE, in comparison with the state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Modelling multivariate spatio-temporal data with identifiable variational autoencoders](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04162v1)** | 2024-09-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modelling multivariate spatio-temporal data with complex dependency structures is a challenging task but can be simplified by assuming that the original variables are generated from independent latent components. If these components are found, they can be modelled univariately. Blind source separation aims to recover the latent components by estimating the unmixing transformation based on the observed data only. The current methods for spatio-temporal blind source separation are restricted to linear unmixing, and nonlinear variants have not been implemented. In this paper, we extend identifiable variational autoencoder to the nonlinear nonstationary spatio-temporal blind source separation setting and demonstrate its performance using comprehensive simulation studies. Additionally, we introduce two alternative methods for the latent dimension estimation, which is a crucial task in order to obtain the correct latent representation. Finally, we illustrate the proposed methods using a meteorological application, where we estimate the latent dimension and the latent components, interpret the components, and show how nonstationarity can be accounted and prediction accuracy can be improved by using the proposed nonlinear blind source separation method as a preprocessing method.</p></details> |  |

Designing spatio-temporal forecasting models separately in a task-wise and city-wise manner to forecast demand and supply-demand gap in a ride-hailing system poses a burden for the expanding transportation network companies. Therefore, a multi-task learning architecture is proposed in this study by developing gated ensemble of spatio-temporal mixture of experts network (GESME-Net) with convolutional recurrent neural network (CRNN), convolutional neural network (CNN), and recurrent neural network (RNN) for simultaneously forecasting these spatio-temporal tasks in a city as well as across different cities. Furthermore, a task adaptation layer is integrated with the architecture for learning joint representation in multi-task learning and revealing the contribution of the input features utilized in prediction. The proposed architecture is tested with data from Didi Chuxing for: (i) simultaneously forecasting demand and supply-demand gap in Beijing, and (ii) simultaneously forecasting demand across Chengdu and Xian. In both scenarios, models from our proposed architecture outperformed the single-task and multi-task deep learning benchmarks and ensemble-based machine learning algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2012.08868</p></details> |

Although adopting a surrogate gradient (SG) makes the non-differentiability SNN trainable, achieving comparable accuracy for ANNs and keeping low-power features simultaneously is still tricky. In this paper, we proposed an energy-efficient spike-train level spiking neural network with spatio-temporal conversion, which has low computational cost and high accuracy. In the STCSNN, spatio-temporal conversion blocks (STCBs) are proposed to keep the low power features of SNNs and improve accuracy. However, STCSNN cannot adopt backpropagation algorithms directly due to the non-differentiability nature of spike trains. We proposed a suitable learning rule for STCSNNs by deducing the equivalent gradient of STCB. We evaluate the proposed STCSNN on static and neuromorphic datasets, including Fashion-Mnist, Cifar10, Cifar100, TinyImageNet, and DVS-Cifar10. The experiment results show that our proposed STCSNN outperforms the state-of-the-art accuracy on nearly all datasets, using fewer time steps and being highly energy-efficient.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Neurocomputing on 10 August 2024</p></details> |

It consists of a pyramid structure with a spatial information reuse strategy, a sequential pose initialization module, a gated hierarchical pose refinement module, and a temporal feature propagation module. First, spatial features are encoded using a point feature pyramid, with features reused in successive pose estimations to reduce computational overhead. Second, a sequential pose initialization method is introduced, leveraging the high-frequency sampling characteristic of LiDAR to initialize the LiDAR pose. Then, a gated hierarchical pose refinement mechanism refines poses from coarse to fine by selectively retaining or discarding motion information from different layers based on gate estimations. Finally, temporal feature propagation is proposed to incorporate the historical motion information from point cloud sequences, and address the spatial inconsistency issue when transmitting motion information embedded in point clouds between frames. Experimental results on the KITTI odometry dataset and Argoverse dataset demonstrate that DSLO outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving at least a 15.67\% improvement on RTE and a 12.64\% improvement on RRE, while also achieving a 34.69\% reduction in runtime compared to baseline methods.

However, existing methods encounter difficulties when applied to problems on unstructured grids and irregular domains. Spatial graph neural networks utilize local convolution in a neighborhood to potentially address these challenges, yet they often suffer from issues such as over-smoothing and over-squashing in deep architectures. Conversely, spectral graph neural networks leverage global convolution to capture extensive features and long-range dependencies in domain graphs, albeit at a high computational cost due to Eigenvalue decomposition. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach, referred to as Spatio-Spectral Graph Neural Operator (Sp$^2$GNO) that integrates spatial and spectral GNNs effectively. This framework mitigates the limitations of individual methods and enables the learning of solution operators across arbitrary geometries, thus catering to a wide range of real-world problems. Sp$^2$GNO demonstrates exceptional performance in solving both time-dependent and time-independent partial differential equations on regular and irregular domains. Our approach is validated through comprehensive benchmarks and practical applications drawn from computational mechanics and scientific computing literature.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mending of Spatio-Temporal Dependencies in Block Adjacency Matrix](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02606v2)** | 2024-08-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the realm of applications where data dynamically evolves across spatial and temporal dimensions, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are often complemented by sequence modeling architectures, such as RNNs and transformers, to effectively model temporal changes. These hybrid models typically arrange the spatial and temporal learning components in series. A pioneering effort to jointly model the spatio-temporal dependencies using only GNNs was the introduction of the Block Adjacency Matrix \(\mathbf{A_B}\) \cite{1}, which was constructed by diagonally concatenating adjacency matrices from graphs at different time steps. This approach resulted in a single graph encompassing complete spatio-temporal data; however, the graphs from different time steps remained disconnected, limiting GNN message-passing to spatially connected nodes only. Addressing this critical challenge, we propose a novel end-to-end learning architecture specifically designed to mend the temporal dependencies, resulting in a well-connected graph. Thus, we provide a framework for the learnable representation of spatio-temporal data as graphs. Our methodology demonstrates superior performance on benchmark datasets, such as SurgVisDom and C2D2, surpassing existing state-of-the-art graph models in terms of accuracy. Our model also achieves significantly lower computational complexity, having far fewer parameters than methods reliant on CLIP and 3D CNN architectures.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICONIP 2024</p></details> |

However, these networks often face challenges in training due to the high annotation cost. To address this, unsupervised and weakly-supervised methods have been developed to reduce the dependency on annotations. This work introduces a novel weakly-supervised method called Eigen-cluster VIS that, without requiring any mask annotations, achieves competitive accuracy compared to other VIS approaches. This method is based on two key innovations: a Temporal Eigenvalue Loss (TEL) and a clip-level Quality Cluster Coefficient (QCC). The TEL ensures temporal coherence by leveraging the eigenvalues of the Laplacian matrix derived from graph adjacency matrices. By minimizing the mean absolute error (MAE) between the eigenvalues of adjacent frames, this loss function promotes smooth transitions and stable segmentation boundaries over time, reducing temporal discontinuities and improving overall segmentation quality. The QCC employs the K-means method to ensure the quality of spatio-temporal clusters without relying on ground truth masks. Using the Davies-Bouldin score, the QCC provides an unsupervised measure of feature discrimination, allowing the model to self-evaluate and adapt to varying object distributions, enhancing robustness during the testing phase. These enhancements are computationally efficient and straightforward, offering significant performance gains without additional annotated data. The proposed Eigen-Cluster VIS method is evaluated on the YouTube-VIS 2019/2021 and OVIS datasets, demonstrating that it effectively narrows the performance gap between the fully-supervised and weakly-supervised VIS approaches.

While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) excel at modeling and forecasting spatio-temporal data, they often lack the ability to directly incorporate underlying physical laws. This work presents TG-PhyNN, a novel Temporal Graph Physics-Informed Neural Network framework. TG-PhyNN leverages the power of GNNs for graph-based modeling while simultaneously incorporating physical constraints as a guiding principle during training. This is achieved through a two-step prediction strategy that enables the calculation of physical equation derivatives within the GNN architecture. Our findings demonstrate that TG-PhyNN significantly outperforms traditional forecasting models (e.g., GRU, LSTM, GAT) on real-world spatio-temporal datasets like PedalMe (traffic flow), COVID-19 spread, and Chickenpox outbreaks. These datasets are all governed by well-defined physical principles, which TG-PhyNN effectively exploits to offer more reliable and accurate forecasts in various domains where physical processes govern the dynamics of data. This paves the way for improved forecasting in areas like traffic flow prediction, disease outbreak prediction, and potentially other fields where physics plays a crucial role.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatio-Temporal Context Prompting for Zero-Shot Action Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15996v2)** | 2024-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal action detection encompasses the tasks of localizing and classifying individual actions within a video. Recent works aim to enhance this process by incorporating interaction modeling, which captures the relationship between people and their surrounding context. However, these approaches have primarily focused on fully-supervised learning, and the current limitation lies in the lack of generalization capability to recognize unseen action categories. In this paper, we aim to adapt the pretrained image-language models to detect unseen actions. To this end, we propose a method which can effectively leverage the rich knowledge of visual-language models to perform Person-Context Interaction. Meanwhile, our Context Prompting module will utilize contextual information to prompt labels, thereby enhancing the generation of more representative text features. Moreover, to address the challenge of recognizing distinct actions by multiple people at the same timestamp, we design the Interest Token Spotting mechanism which employs pretrained visual knowledge to find each person's interest context tokens, and then these tokens will be used for prompting to generate text features tailored to each individual. To evaluate the ability to detect unseen actions, we propose a comprehensive benchmark on J-HMDB, UCF101-24, and AVA datasets. The experiments show that our method achieves superior results compared to previous approaches and can be further extended to multi-action videos, bringing it closer to real-world applications.

A reason for this is that learning on dynamic graph data is becoming more relevant, since data from many scientific fields, ranging from mathematics, biology, social sciences, and physics to computer science, is naturally related and inherently dynamic. In addition, TPPs provide a meaningful characterization of event streams and a prediction mechanism for future events. Therefore, (semi-)parameterized Neural TPPs have been introduced whose characterization can be (partially) learned and, thus, enable the representation of more complex phenomena. However, the research on modeling dynamic graphs with TPPs is relatively young, and only a few models for node attribute changes or evolving edges have been proposed yet. To allow for learning on fully dynamic graph streams, i.e., graphs that can change in their structure (addition/deletion of nodes/edge) and in their node/edge attributes, we propose a Marked Neural Spatio-Temporal Point Process (MNSTPP). It leverages a Dynamic Graph Neural Network to learn a Marked TPP that handles attributes and spatial data to model and predict any event in a graph stream.</p></details> |  |

Human-centric VAD, a specialized area within this domain, faces additional complexities, including variations in human behavior, potential biases in data, and substantial privacy concerns related to human subjects. These issues complicate the development of models that are both robust and generalizable. To address these challenges, recent advancements have focused on pose-based VAD, which leverages human pose as a high-level feature to mitigate privacy concerns, reduce appearance biases, and minimize background interference. In this paper, we introduce PoseWatch, a novel transformer-based architecture designed specifically for human-centric pose-based VAD. PoseWatch features an innovative Spatio-Temporal Pose and Relative Pose (ST-PRP) tokenization method that enhances the representation of human motion over time, which is also beneficial for broader human behavior analysis tasks. The architecture's core, a Unified Encoder Twin Decoders (UETD) transformer, significantly improves the detection of anomalous behaviors in video data. Extensive evaluations across multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that PoseWatch consistently outperforms existing methods, establishing a new state-of-the-art in pose-based VAD. This work not only demonstrates the efficacy of PoseWatch but also highlights the potential of integrating Natural Language Processing techniques with computer vision to advance human behavior analysis.</p></details> |  |

Traditional forecasting methods, however, struggle with the irregular traffic time series resulting from adaptive traffic signal controls, presenting challenges in asynchronous spatial dependency, irregular temporal dependency, and predicting variable-length sequences. To this end, we propose an Asynchronous Spatio-tEmporal graph convolutional nEtwoRk (ASeer) tailored for irregular traffic time series forecasting. Specifically, we first propose an Asynchronous Graph Diffusion Network to capture the spatial dependency between asynchronously measured traffic states regulated by adaptive traffic signals. After that, to capture the temporal dependency within irregular traffic state sequences, a personalized time encoding is devised to embed the continuous time signals. Then, we propose a Transformable Time-aware Convolution Network, which adapts meta-filters for time-aware convolution on the sequences with inconsistent temporal flow. Additionally, a Semi-Autoregressive Prediction Network, comprising a state evolution unit and a semi-autoregressive predictor, is designed to predict variable-length traffic sequences effectively and efficiently. Extensive experiments on a newly established benchmark demonstrate the superiority of ASeer compared with twelve competitive baselines across six metrics.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work is published in the research track of KDD 2024</p></details> |

The associated challenges are exacerbated when solutions to these interconnected problems need to simultaneously maximize task performance and respect practical constraints on time and resources. In this work, we formulate a new class of spatio-temporal heterogeneous task allocation problems that formalize these complexities. We then contribute a novel framework, named Quality-Optimized Incremental Task Allocation Graph Search (Q-ITAGS), to solve such problems. Q-ITAGS offers a flexible interleaved framework that i) explicitly models and optimizes the effect of collective capabilities on task performance via learnable trait-quality maps, and ii) respects both resource and spatio-temporal constraints, including a user-specified time budget (i.e., maximum makespan). In addition to algorithmic contributions, we derive theoretical suboptimality bounds in terms of task performance that varies as a function of a single hyperparameter. Detailed experiments involving a simulated emergency response task and a real-world video game dataset reveal that i) Q-ITAGS results in superior team performance compared to a state-of-the-art method, while also respecting complex spatio-temporal and resource constraints, ii) Q-ITAGS efficiently learns trait-quality maps to enable effective trade-off between task performance and resource constraints, and iii) Q-ITAGS' suboptimality bounds consistently hold in practice.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2209.13092</p></details> |

Although various neural networks with intricate architectures have been developed to address this problem, they still face two key challenges: i) Recent advancements in network designs for modeling spatio-temporal correlations are starting to see diminishing returns in performance enhancements. ii) Additionally, most models do not account for the spatio-temporal heterogeneity inherent in traffic data, i.e., traffic distribution varies significantly across different regions and traffic flow patterns fluctuate across various time slots. To tackle these challenges, we introduce the Spatio-Temporal Graph Transformer (STGormer), which effectively integrates attribute and structure information inherent in traffic data for learning spatio-temporal correlations, and a mixture-of-experts module for capturing heterogeneity along spaital and temporal axes. Specifically, we design two straightforward yet effective spatial encoding methods based on the graph structure and integrate time position encoding into the vanilla transformer to capture spatio-temporal traffic patterns. Additionally, a mixture-of-experts enhanced feedforward neural network (FNN) module adaptively assigns suitable expert layers to distinct patterns via a spatio-temporal gating network, further improving overall prediction accuracy. Experiments on real-world traffic datasets demonstrate that STGormer achieves state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  |

The recent advancements in Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) have inspired efforts to reprogram these models for time series forecasting tasks, by leveraging their superior reasoning and generalization capabilities. However, existing approaches fall short in handling complex spatial inter-series dependencies and intrinsic intra-series frequency components, limiting their spatio-temporal forecasting performance. Moreover, the linear mapping of continuous time series to a compressed subset vocabulary in reprogramming constrains the spatio-temporal semantic expressivity of PLMs and may lead to potential information bottleneck. To overcome the above limitations, we propose \textsc{RePST}, a tailored PLM reprogramming framework for spatio-temporal forecasting. The key insight of \textsc{RePST} is to decouple the spatio-temporal dynamics in the frequency domain, allowing better alignment with the PLM text space. Specifically, we first decouple spatio-temporal data in Fourier space and devise a structural diffusion operator to obtain temporal intrinsic and spatial diffusion signals, making the dynamics more comprehensible and predictable for PLMs. To avoid information bottleneck from a limited vocabulary, we further propose a discrete reprogramming strategy that selects relevant discrete textual information from an expanded vocabulary space in a differentiable manner. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets show that our proposed approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art spatio-temporal forecasting models, particularly in data-scarce scenarios.</p></details> |  |

In this study, we focus on an instance of spatio-temporal learning problem--traffic prediction--to demonstrate an advanced deep learning model developed for making accurate and reliable forecast. Despite the significant progress in traffic prediction, limited studies have incorporated both explicit and implicit traffic patterns simultaneously to improve prediction performance. Meanwhile, the variability nature of traffic states necessitates quantifying the uncertainty of model predictions in a statistically principled way; however, extant studies offer no provable guarantee on the statistical validity of confidence intervals in reflecting its actual likelihood of containing the ground truth. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end traffic prediction framework that leverages three primary components to generate accurate and reliable traffic predictions: dynamic causal structure learning for discovering implicit traffic patterns from massive traffic data, causally-aware spatio-temporal multi-graph convolution network (CASTMGCN) for learning spatio-temporal dependencies, and conformal prediction for uncertainty quantification. CASTMGCN fuses several graphs that characterize different important aspects of traffic networks and an auxiliary graph that captures the effect of exogenous factors on the road network. On this basis, a conformal prediction approach tailored to spatio-temporal data is further developed for quantifying the uncertainty in node-wise traffic predictions over varying prediction horizons. Experimental results on two real-world traffic datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms several state-of-the-art models in prediction accuracy; moreover, it generates more efficient prediction regions than other methods while strictly satisfying the statistical validity in coverage.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatio-Temporal Road Traffic Prediction using Real-time Regional Knowledge](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12882v1)** | 2024-08-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For traffic prediction in transportation services such as car-sharing and ride-hailing, mid-term road traffic prediction (within a few hours) is considered essential. However, the existing road-level traffic prediction has mainly studied how significantly micro traffic events propagate to the adjacent roads in terms of short-term prediction. On the other hand, recent attempts have been made to incorporate regional knowledge such as POIs, road characteristics, and real-time social events to help traffic prediction. However, these studies lack in understandings of different modalities of road-level and region-level spatio-temporal correlations and how to combine such knowledge. This paper proposes a novel method that embeds real-time region-level knowledge using POIs, satellite images, and real-time LTE access traces via a regional spatio-temporal module that consists of dynamic convolution and temporal attention, and conducts bipartite spatial transform attention to convert into road-level knowledge. Then the model ingests this embedded knowledge into a road-level attention-based prediction model. Experimental results on real-world road traffic prediction show that our model outperforms the baselines.</p></details> |  |

This discrepancy arises primarily from the high costs associated with the input of existing representation models, which often require street views and mobility data. To address this, we develop a novel, training-free method that leverages large language models (LLMs) and auxiliary map data from OpenStreetMap to derive geolocation representations (LLMGeovec). LLMGeovec can represent the geographic semantics of city, country, and global scales, which acts as a generic enhancer for spatio-temporal learning. Specifically, by direct feature concatenation, we introduce a simple yet effective paradigm for enhancing multiple spatio-temporal tasks including geographic prediction (GP), long-term time series forecasting (LTSF), and graph-based spatio-temporal forecasting (GSTF). LLMGeovec can seamlessly integrate into a wide spectrum of spatio-temporal learning models, providing immediate enhancements. Experimental results demonstrate that LLMGeovec achieves global coverage and significantly boosts the performance of leading GP, LTSF, and GSTF models.</p></details> |  |

Thus, large amounts of video samples are continuously required for traditional data-driven training. However, samples are not always sufficient in real-world scenarios, promoting few-shot action recognition (FSAR) research. We observe that most recent FSAR works build spatio-temporal relation of video samples via temporal alignment after spatial feature extraction, cutting apart spatial and temporal features within samples. They also capture motion information via narrow perspectives between adjacent frames without considering density, leading to insufficient motion information capturing. Therefore, we propose a novel plug-and-play architecture for FSAR called Spatio-tempOral frAme tuPle enhancer (SOAP) in this paper. The model we designed with such architecture refers to SOAP-Net. Temporal connections between different feature channels and spatio-temporal relation of features are considered instead of simple feature extraction. Comprehensive motion information is also captured, using frame tuples with multiple frames containing more motion information than adjacent frames. Combining frame tuples of diverse frame counts further provides a broader perspective. SOAP-Net achieves new state-of-the-art performance across well-known benchmarks such as SthSthV2, Kinetics, UCF101, and HMDB51.

| **[DemMamba: Alignment-free Raw Video Demoireing with Frequency-assisted Spatio-Temporal Mamba](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10679v1)** | 2024-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Moire patterns arise when two similar repetitive patterns interfere, a phenomenon frequently observed during the capture of images or videos on screens. The color, shape, and location of moire patterns may differ across video frames, posing a challenge in learning information from adjacent frames and preserving temporal consistency. Previous video demoireing methods heavily rely on well-designed alignment modules, resulting in substantial computational burdens. Recently, Mamba, an improved version of the State Space Model (SSM), has demonstrated significant potential for modeling long-range dependencies with linear complexity, enabling efficient temporal modeling in video demoireing without requiring a specific alignment module. In this paper, we propose a novel alignment-free Raw video demoireing network with frequency-assisted spatio-temporal Mamba (DemMamba). The Spatial Mamba Block (SMB) and Temporal Mamba Block (TMB) are sequentially arranged to facilitate effective intra- and inter-relationship modeling in Raw videos with moire patterns. Within SMB, an Adaptive Frequency Block (AFB) is introduced to aid demoireing in the frequency domain. For TMB, a Channel Attention Block (CAB) is embedded to further enhance temporal information interactions by exploiting the inter-channel relationships among features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed DemMamba surpasses state-of-the-art approaches by 1.3 dB and delivers a superior visual experience.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Spatio-temporal Prediction Methodology Based on Deep Learning and Real Wi-Fi Measurements](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09423v1)** | 2024-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid development of Wi-Fi technologies in recent years has caused a significant increase in the traffic usage. Hence, knowledge obtained from Wi-Fi network measurements can be helpful for a more efficient network management. In this paper, we propose a methodology to predict future values of some specific network metrics (e.g. traffic load, transmission failures, etc.). These predictions may be useful for improving the network performance. After data collection and preprocessing, the correlation between each target access point (AP) and its neighbouring APs is estimated. According to these correlations, either an only-temporal or a spatio-temporal based prediction is done. To evaluate the proposed methodology, real measurements are collected from 100 APs deployed in different university buildings for 3 months. Deep Learning (DL) methods (i.e. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Simple Recurrent Neural Network (SRNN), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Transformer) are evaluated and compared for both temporal and spatio-temporal based predictions. Moreover, a hybrid prediction methodology is proposed using a spatial processing based on CNN and a temporal prediction based on RNN. The proposed hybrid methodology provides an improvement in the prediction accuracy at expenses of a slight increase in the Training Computational Time (TCT) and negligible in Prediction Computational Time (PCT).</p></details> | 18 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Temporal Reversed Training for Spiking Neural Networks with Generalized Spatio-Temporal Representation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09108v1)** | 2024-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have received widespread attention as an ultra-low energy computing paradigm. Recent studies have focused on improving the feature extraction capability of SNNs, but they suffer from inefficient inference and suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective temporal reversed training (TRT) method to optimize the spatio-temporal performance of SNNs and circumvent these problems. We perturb the input temporal data by temporal reversal, prompting the SNN to produce original-reversed consistent output logits and to learn perturbation-invariant representations. For static data without temporal dimension, we generalize this strategy by exploiting the inherent temporal property of spiking neurons for spike feature temporal reversal. In addition, we utilize the lightweight ``star operation" (element-wise multiplication) to hybridize the original and temporally reversed spike firing rates and expand the implicit dimensions, which serves as spatio-temporal regularization to further enhance the generalization of the SNN. Our method involves only an additional temporal reversal operation and element-wise multiplication during training, thus incurring negligible training overhead and not affecting the inference efficiency at all. Extensive experiments on static/neuromorphic object/action recognition, and 3D point cloud classification tasks demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our method. In particular, with only two timesteps, our method achieves 74.77\% and 90.57\% accuracy on ImageNet and ModelNet40, respectively.</p></details> | 15 pages, 8 figures |

However, existing models often face limitations in generalization, struggling with zero-shot prediction on unseen regions and cities, as well as diminished long-term accuracy. This is primarily due to the inherent challenges in handling the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of traffic data, coupled with the significant distribution shift across time and space. In this work, we aim to unlock new possibilities for building versatile, resilient and adaptive spatio-temporal foundation models for traffic prediction. To achieve this goal, we introduce a novel foundation model, named OpenCity, that can effectively capture and normalize the underlying spatio-temporal patterns from diverse data characteristics, facilitating zero-shot generalization across diverse urban environments. OpenCity integrates the Transformer architecture with graph neural networks to model the complex spatio-temporal dependencies in traffic data. By pre-training OpenCity on large-scale, heterogeneous traffic datasets, we enable the model to learn rich, generalizable representations that can be seamlessly applied to a wide range of traffic forecasting scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that OpenCity exhibits exceptional zero-shot predictive performance. Moreover, OpenCity showcases promising scaling laws, suggesting the potential for developing a truly one-for-all traffic prediction solution that can adapt to new urban contexts with minimal overhead. We made our proposed OpenCity model open-source and it is available at the following link: https://github.com/HKUDS/OpenCity.</p></details> | 12 pages |

The safety risk and urgency of autonomous vehicles in the absence of collision are evaluated. To ensure safety and improve road efficiency, a method of pre-compiling the spatio-temporal trajectory of vehicles is established to eliminate conflicts between vehicles in advance. The calculation method of the safe distance under spatio-temporal conditions is studied, considering vehicle speed differences, vehicle positioning errors, and clock errors. By combining collision acceleration and urgent acceleration, an evaluation model for vehicle conflict risk is constructed. Mainline vehicles that may have conflicts with on-ramp vehicles are identified, and the target gap for on-ramp vehicles is determined. Finally, a cooperative control method is established based on the selected target gap, preparing the vehicle travel path in advance. Taking highway ramp merge as an example, the mainline priority spatio-temporal cooperative control method is proposed and verified through simulation.

In microservices systems, this task encounters the challenge of dynamic and complex spatio-temporal relationships among microservice instances, primarily due to dynamic deployments, diverse call paths, and cascading effects among instances. Current time-series forecasting methods, which focus mainly on intrinsic patterns, are insufficient in environments where spatial relationships are critical. Similarly, spatio-temporal graph approaches often neglect the nature of temporal trend, concentrating mostly on message passing between nodes. Moreover, current research in microservices domain frequently underestimates the importance of network metrics and topological structures in capturing the evolving dynamics of systems. This paper introduces STMformer, a model tailored for forecasting system states in microservices environments, capable of handling multi-node and multivariate time series. Our method leverages dynamic network connection data and topological information to assist in modeling the intricate spatio-temporal relationships within the system. Additionally, we integrate the PatchCrossAttention module to compute the impact of cascading effects globally. We have developed a dataset based on a microservices system and conducted comprehensive experiments with STMformer against leading methods. In both short-term and long-term forecasting tasks, our model consistently achieved a 8.6% reduction in MAE(Mean Absolute Error) and a 2.2% reduction in MSE (Mean Squared Error).

Nonetheless, these methods mainly adopt imagepair appearance matching and face challenges of the intrinsic high quadratic complexity of the attention mechanism, resulting in constrained exploitation of temporal information. Inspired by the recently emerged State Space Model Mamba, renowned for its impressive long sequence modeling capabilities and linear computational complexity, this work innovatively proposes a pure Mamba-based framework (MambaVT) to fully exploit spatio-temporal contextual modeling for robust visible-thermal tracking. Specifically, we devise the long-range cross-frame integration component to globally adapt to target appearance variations, and introduce short-term historical trajectory prompts to predict the subsequent target states based on local temporal location clues. Extensive experiments show the significant potential of vision Mamba for RGB-T tracking, with MambaVT achieving state-of-the-art performance on four mainstream benchmarks while requiring lower computational costs. We aim for this work to serve as a simple yet strong baseline, stimulating future research in this field. The code and pre-trained models will be made available.</p></details> |  |
| **[Advancing Spatio-Temporal Processing in Spiking Neural Networks through Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07517v1)** | 2024-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficient implementations of spiking neural networks on neuromorphic hardware promise orders of magnitude less power consumption than their non-spiking counterparts. The standard neuron model for spike-based computation on such neuromorphic systems has long been the leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neuron. As a promising advancement, a computationally light augmentation of the LIF neuron model with an adaptation mechanism experienced a recent upswing in popularity, caused by demonstrations of its superior performance on spatio-temporal processing tasks. The root of the superiority of these so-called adaptive LIF neurons however, is not well understood. In this article, we thoroughly analyze the dynamical, computational, and learning properties of adaptive LIF neurons and networks thereof. We find that the frequently observed stability problems during training of such networks can be overcome by applying an alternative discretization method that results in provably better stability properties than the commonly used Euler-Forward method. With this discretization, we achieved a new state-of-the-art performance on common event-based benchmark datasets. We also show that the superiority of networks of adaptive LIF neurons extends to the prediction and generation of complex time series. Our further analysis of the computational properties of networks of adaptive LIF neurons shows that they are particularly well suited to exploit the spatio-temporal structure of input sequences. Furthermore, these networks are surprisingly robust to shifts of the mean input strength and input spike rate, even when these shifts were not observed during training. As a consequence, high-performance networks can be obtained without any normalization techniques such as batch normalization or batch-normalization through time.</p></details> |  |

The weak dependence condition for arrays of random fields is proved to be inherited through transformation and infinite shift. This paves a way to prove the consistency and asymptotic normality of maximum likelihood estimation for dynamic spatio-temporal models (i.e. so-called ultra high-dimensional time series models) when the sample size and/or dimension go to infinity. Especially the asymptotic properties of estimation for network autoregression are obtained under reasonable regularity conditions.</p></details> |  |

This compressor comprehensively considers both temporal and spatial information, encompassing many existing specific compressors. We use the average consensus algorithm as a starting point and further studies distributed optimization algorithms, the Prime-Dual algorithm as an example, in both continuous and discrete time forms. We find that under stronger additional assumptions, the spatio-temporal compressor can be directly applied to distributed computing algorithms, while its default form can also be successfully applied through observer-based differential compression methods, ensuring the linear convergence of the algorithm when the objective function is strongly convex. On this basis, we also discuss the acceleration of the algorithm, filter-based compression methods in the literature, and the addition of randomness to the spatio-temporal compressor. Finally, numerical simulations illustrate the generality of the spatio-temporal compressor, compare different compression methods, and verify the algorithm's performance in the convex objective function scenario.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2408.02332</p></details> |
| **[Weakly Supervised Video Anomaly Detection and Localization with Spatio-Temporal Prompts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05905v2)** | 2024-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current weakly supervised video anomaly detection (WSVAD) task aims to achieve frame-level anomalous event detection with only coarse video-level annotations available. Existing works typically involve extracting global features from full-resolution video frames and training frame-level classifiers to detect anomalies in the temporal dimension. However, most anomalous events tend to occur in localized spatial regions rather than the entire video frames, which implies existing frame-level feature based works may be misled by the dominant background information and lack the interpretation of the detected anomalies. To address this dilemma, this paper introduces a novel method called STPrompt that learns spatio-temporal prompt embeddings for weakly supervised video anomaly detection and localization (WSVADL) based on pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs). Our proposed method employs a two-stream network structure, with one stream focusing on the temporal dimension and the other primarily on the spatial dimension. By leveraging the learned knowledge from pre-trained VLMs and incorporating natural motion priors from raw videos, our model learns prompt embeddings that are aligned with spatio-temporal regions of videos (e.g., patches of individual frames) for identify specific local regions of anomalies, enabling accurate video anomaly detection while mitigating the influence of background information. Without relying on detailed spatio-temporal annotations or auxiliary object detection/tracking, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on three public benchmarks for the WSVADL task.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACMMM2024</p></details> |

We benchmark SET against said models on the charged $N$-body problem, a simple physical system with complex dynamics. While existing spatio-temporal graph neural networks focus on sequential modeling, we empirically demonstrate that leveraging underlying domain symmetries yields considerable improvements for modeling dynamical systems on graphs.</p></details> |  |

Considering the spatio-temporal nature of EEG data, one of our frameworks is based on a CNN-BiLSTM model. The other involves a CNN-Transformer architecture which inherently involves the more versatile attention based learning paradigm. In both cases, a special 1D-CNN feature extraction module is used to generate the initial embeddings with 1D convolutions in the time and the EEG channel domains. Considering the EEG signals are noisy, non stationary and the discriminative features are even less clear (than in semantically structured data such as text or image), we also follow a window-based classification followed by majority voting during inference, to yield labels at a signal level. To illustrate how brain patterns correlate with different image classes, we visualize t-SNE plots of the BiLSTM embeddings alongside brain activation maps for the top 10 classes. These visualizations provide insightful revelations into the distinct neural signatures associated with each visual category, showcasing the BiLSTM's capability to capture and represent the discriminative brain activity linked to visual stimuli. We demonstrate the performance of our approach on the updated EEG-Imagenet dataset with positive comparisons with state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper has been submitted at ICPR 2024.

However, existing transformer-based methods primarily use self-attention mechanisms for spatio-temporal modeling, leading to a quadratic complexity, unidirectional modeling of spatio-temporal relationships, and insufficient learning of spatial-temporal correlations. Recently, the Mamba architecture, utilizing the state space model (SSM), has exhibited superior long-range modeling capabilities in a variety of vision tasks with linear complexity. In this paper, we propose PoseMamba, a novel purely SSM-based approach with linear complexity for 3D human pose estimation in monocular video. Specifically, we propose a bidirectional global-local spatio-temporal SSM block that comprehensively models human joint relations within individual frames as well as temporal correlations across frames. Within this bidirectional global-local spatio-temporal SSM block, we introduce a reordering strategy to enhance the local modeling capability of the SSM. This strategy provides a more logical geometric scanning order and integrates it with the global SSM, resulting in a combined global-local spatial scan. We have quantitatively and qualitatively evaluated our approach using two benchmark datasets: Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PoseMamba achieves state-of-the-art performance on both datasets while maintaining a smaller model size and reducing computational costs. The code and models will be released.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatio-Temporal Adaptive Diffusion Models for EEG Super-Resolution in Epilepsy Diagnosis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03089v3)** | 2024-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Electroencephalogram (EEG) technology, particularly high-density EEG (HD EEG) devices, is widely used in fields such as neuroscience. HD EEG devices improve the spatial resolution of EEG by placing more electrodes on the scalp, meeting the requirements of clinical diagnostic applications such as epilepsy focus localization. However, this technique faces challenges such as high acquisition costs and limited usage scenarios. In this paper, spatio-temporal adaptive diffusion models (STADMs) are proposed to pioneer the use of diffusion models for achieving spatial SR reconstruction from low-resolution (LR, 64 channels or fewer) EEG to high-resolution (HR, 256 channels) EEG. Specifically, a spatio-temporal condition module is designed to extract the spatio-temporal features of LR EEG, which then serve as conditional inputs to guide the reverse denoising process of diffusion models. Additionally, a multi-scale Transformer denoising module is constructed to leverage multi-scale convolution blocks and cross-attention-based diffusion Transformer blocks for conditional guidance to generate subject-adaptive SR EEG. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively enhances the spatial resolution of LR EEG and quantitatively outperforms existing methods. Furthermore, STADMs demonstrate their value by applying synthetic SR EEG to classification and source localization tasks of epilepsy patients, indicating their potential to significantly improve the spatial resolution of LR EEG.</p></details> |  |

Yet, these models fall short of quantifying future uncertainties. Recently, many probabilistic methods, especially variants of diffusion models, have been proposed to fill this gap. However, existing diffusion methods typically deal with individual sensors separately when generating future time series, resulting in limited usage of spatial information in the probabilistic learning process. In this work, we propose SpecSTG, a novel spectral diffusion framework, to better leverage spatial dependencies and systematic patterns inherent in traffic data. More specifically, our method generates the Fourier representation of future time series, transforming the learning process into the spectral domain enriched with spatial information. Additionally, our approach incorporates a fast spectral graph convolution designed for Fourier input, alleviating the computational burden associated with existing models. Compared with state-of-the-arts, SpecSTG achieves up to 8% improvements on point estimations and up to 0.78% improvements on quantifying future uncertainties. Furthermore, SpecSTG's training and validation speed is 3.33X of the most efficient existing diffusion method for STG forecasting.

However, acquiring high-resolution MRI typically extends scan time, which can introduce motion artifacts. Super-resolution of MRI therefore emerges as a promising approach to mitigate these challenges. Earlier studies have investigated the use of multiple contrasts for MRI super-resolution (MCSR), whereas majority of them did not fully exploit the rich contrast-invariant structural information. To fully utilize such crucial prior knowledge of multi-contrast MRI, in this work, we propose a novel structure-guided MCSR (SGSR) framework based on a new spatio-frequency co-query attention (CQA) mechanism. Specifically, CQA performs attention on features of multiple contrasts with a shared structural query, which is particularly designed to extract, fuse, and refine the common structures from different contrasts. We further propose a novel frequency-domain CQA module in addition to the spatial domain, to enable more fine-grained structural refinement. Extensive experiments on fastMRI knee data and low-field brain MRI show that SGSR outperforms state-of-the-art MCSR methods with statistical significance.</p></details> | <details><summary>The 1...</summary><p>The 15th International Workshop on Machine Learning in Medical Imaging (MLMI 2024)</p></details> |

The central aim of multi-agent optimization is for a network of agents to collaboratively solve a system-level optimization problem with local objective functions and node-to-node communication by distributed algorithms. The scalability of such algorithms crucially depends on the complexity of the communication messages, and a number of communication compressors for distributed optimization have recently been proposed in the literature. First of all, we introduce a general spatio-temporal compressor characterized by the stability of the resulting dynamical system along the vector field of the compressor. We show that several important distributed optimization compressors such as the greedy sparsifier, the uniform quantizer, and the scalarizer all fall into the category of this spatio-temporal compressor. Next, we propose two distributed prime-dual flows with the spatio-temporal compressors being applied to local node states and local error states, respectively, and prove (exponential) convergence of the node trajectories to the global optimizer for (strongly) convex cost functions. Finally, a few numerical examples are present to illustrate our theoretical results.</p></details> |  |

Most existing studies show satisfying performance under regular scenarios, but most neglected safety-critical scenarios. In this study, a spatio-temporal dual-encoder network named STDA for safety-critical scenarios was developed. Considering the exceptional capabilities of human drivers in terms of situational awareness and comprehending risks, driver attention was incorporated into STDA to facilitate swift identification of the critical regions, which is expected to improve both performance and interpretability. STDA contains four parts: the driver attention prediction module, which predicts driver attention; the fusion module designed to fuse the features between driver attention and raw images; the temporary encoder module used to enhance the capability to interpret dynamic scenes; and the behavior prediction module to predict the behavior. The experiment data are used to train and validate the model. The results show that STDA improves the G-mean from 0.659 to 0.719 when incorporating driver attention and adopting a temporal encoder module. In addition, extensive experimentation has been conducted to validate that the proposed module exhibits robust generalization capabilities and can be seamlessly integrated into other mainstream models.</p></details> |  |

This study, part of the European LAMASUS (Land Management for Sustainability) project, aims to support the EU's climate neutrality target by developing a governance model through collaboration between policymakers, land users, and researchers. We present a methodological synthesis for treating land use data using a Bayesian approach within spatial and spatio-temporal modeling frameworks. The study tackles the challenges of analyzing land use changes, particularly the presence of zero values and computational issues with large datasets. It introduces joint model structures to address zeros and employs sequential inference and consensus methods for Big Data problems. Spatial downscaling models approximate smaller scales from aggregated data, circumventing high-resolution data complications. We explore Beta regression and Compositional Data Analysis (CoDa) for land use data, review relevant spatial and spatio-temporal models, and present strategies for handling zeros.

Existing work either assumes all locations are equipped with sensors or focuses on short-term forecast. This paper studies partial sensing traffic forecast of long-term traffic, assuming sensors only at some locations. The study is important in lowering the infrastructure investment cost in traffic management since deploying sensors at all locations could incur prohibitively high cost. However, the problem is challenging due to the unknown distribution at unsensed locations, the intricate spatio-temporal correlation in long-term forecasting, as well as noise in data and irregularities in traffic patterns (e.g., road closure). We propose a Spatio-Temporal Partial Sensing (STPS) forecast model for long-term traffic prediction, with several novel contributions, including a rank-based embedding technique to capture irregularities and overcome noise, a spatial transfer matrix to overcome the spatial distribution shift from permanently sensed locations to unsensed locations, and a multi-step training process that utilizes all available data to successively refine the model parameters for better accuracy. Extensive experiments on several real-world traffic datasets demonstrate that STPS outperforms the state-of-the-art and achieves superior accuracy in partial sensing long-term forecasting.</p></details> |  |

We use Lipschitz predictors and determine fixed-time and any-time PAC Bayesian bounds in the batch learning setting. Performing causal forecast is a highlight of our methodology as its potential application to data with spatial and temporal short and long-range dependence. We then test the performance of our learning methodology by using linear predictors and data sets simulated from a spatio-temporal Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process.</p></details> |  |

But coarse, heterogeneous aggregations complicate learning and integration for downstream AI/ML systems. In this work, we consider models to disaggregate spatio-temporal data from a low-resolution, irregular partition (e.g., census tract) to a high-resolution, irregular partition (e.g., city block). We propose an overarching model named the Structurally-Aware Recurrent Network (SARN), which integrates structurally-aware spatial attention (SASA) layers into the Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) model. The spatial attention layers capture spatial interactions among regions, while the gated recurrent module captures the temporal dependencies. Each SASA layer calculates both global and structural attention -- global attention facilitates comprehensive interactions between different geographic levels, while structural attention leverages the containment relationship between different geographic levels (e.g., a city block being wholly contained within a census tract) to ensure coherent and consistent results. For scenarios with limited historical training data, we explore transfer learning and show that a model pre-trained on one city variable can be fine-tuned for another city variable using only a few hundred samples. Evaluating these techniques on two mobility datasets, we find that on both datasets, SARN significantly outperforms other neural models (5% and 1%) and typical heuristic methods (40% and 14%), enabling us to generate realistic, high-quality fine-grained data for downstream applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[SpaER: Learning Spatio-temporal Equivariant Representations for Fetal Brain Motion Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20198v3)** | 2024-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we introduce SpaER, a pioneering method for fetal motion tracking that leverages equivariant filters and self-attention mechanisms to effectively learn spatio-temporal representations. Different from conventional approaches that statically estimate fetal brain motions from pairs of images, our method dynamically tracks the rigid movement patterns of the fetal head across temporal and spatial dimensions. Specifically, we first develop an equivariant neural network that efficiently learns rigid motion sequences through low-dimensional spatial representations of images. Subsequently, we learn spatio-temporal representations by incorporating time encoding and self-attention neural network layers. This approach allows for the capture of long-term dependencies of fetal brain motion and addresses alignment errors due to contrast changes and severe motion artifacts. Our model also provides a geometric deformation estimation that properly addresses image distortions among all time frames. To the best of our knowledge, our approach is the first to learn spatial-temporal representations via deep neural networks for fetal motion tracking without data augmentation. We validated our model using real fetal echo-planar images with simulated and real motions. Our method carries significant potential value in accurately measuring, tracking, and correcting fetal motion in fetal MRI sequences.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 3 figures, Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Interventions (MICCAI) Workshop on Perinatal Imaging, Placental and Preterm Image analysis (PIPPI) 2024</p></details> |
| **[STANet: A Novel Spatio-Temporal Aggregation Network for Depression Classification with Small and Unbalanced FMRI Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21323v1)** | 2024-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate diagnosis of depression is crucial for timely implementation of optimal treatments, preventing complications and reducing the risk of suicide. Traditional methods rely on self-report questionnaires and clinical assessment, lacking objective biomarkers. Combining fMRI with artificial intelligence can enhance depression diagnosis by integrating neuroimaging indicators. However, the specificity of fMRI acquisition for depression often results in unbalanced and small datasets, challenging the sensitivity and accuracy of classification models. In this study, we propose the Spatio-Temporal Aggregation Network (STANet) for diagnosing depression by integrating CNN and RNN to capture both temporal and spatial features of brain activity. STANet comprises the following steps:(1) Aggregate spatio-temporal information via ICA. (2) Utilize multi-scale deep convolution to capture detailed features. (3) Balance data using the SMOTE to generate new samples for minority classes. (4) Employ the AFGRU classifier, which combines Fourier transformation with GRU, to capture long-term dependencies, with an adaptive weight assignment mechanism to enhance model generalization. The experimental results demonstrate that STANet achieves superior depression diagnostic performance with 82.38% accuracy and a 90.72% AUC. The STFA module enhances classification by capturing deeper features at multiple scales. The AFGRU classifier, with adaptive weights and stacked GRU, attains higher accuracy and AUC. SMOTE outperforms other oversampling methods. Additionally, spatio-temporal aggregated features achieve better performance compared to using only temporal or spatial features. STANet outperforms traditional or deep learning classifiers, and functional connectivity-based classifiers, as demonstrated by ten-fold cross-validation.</p></details> |  |

These programs are being increasingly asked to provide forest parameter estimates for spatial and temporal extents smaller than their current design and accompanying design-based methods can deliver with desired levels of uncertainty. Many NFI designs and estimation methods focus on status and are not well equipped to provide acceptable estimates for trend and change parameters, especially over small spatial domains and/or short time periods. Fine-scale space-time indexed estimates are critical to a variety of environmental, ecological, and economic monitoring efforts. Estimates for forest carbon status, trend, and change are of particular importance to international initiatives to track carbon dynamics. Model-based small area estimation (SAE) methods for NFI and similar ecological monitoring data typically pursue inference on status within small spatial domains, with few demonstrated methods that account for spatio-temporal dependence needed for trend and change estimation. We propose a spatio-temporal Bayesian model framework that delivers statistically valid estimates with full uncertainty quantification for status, trend, and change. The framework accommodates a variety of space and time dependency structures, and we detail model configurations for different settings. Through analysis of simulated datasets, we compare the relative performance of candidate models and a traditional direct estimator. We then apply candidate models to a large-scale NFI dataset to demonstrate the utility of the proposed framework for providing unique quantification of forest carbon dynamics in the contiguous United States. We also provide computationally efficient algorithms, software, and data to reproduce our results and for benchmarking.</p></details> |  |
| **[SpotFormer: Multi-Scale Spatio-Temporal Transformer for Facial Expression Spotting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20799v1)** | 2024-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Facial expression spotting, identifying periods where facial expressions occur in a video, is a significant yet challenging task in facial expression analysis. The issues of irrelevant facial movements and the challenge of detecting subtle motions in micro-expressions remain unresolved, hindering accurate expression spotting. In this paper, we propose an efficient framework for facial expression spotting. First, we propose a Sliding Window-based Multi-Resolution Optical flow (SW-MRO) feature, which calculates multi-resolution optical flow of the input image sequence within compact sliding windows. The window length is tailored to perceive complete micro-expressions and distinguish between general macro- and micro-expressions. SW-MRO can effectively reveal subtle motions while avoiding severe head movement problems. Second, we propose SpotFormer, a multi-scale spatio-temporal Transformer that simultaneously encodes spatio-temporal relationships of the SW-MRO features for accurate frame-level probability estimation. In SpotFormer, our proposed Facial Local Graph Pooling (FLGP) and convolutional layers are applied for multi-scale spatio-temporal feature extraction. We show the validity of the architecture of SpotFormer by comparing it with several model variants. Third, we introduce supervised contrastive learning into SpotFormer to enhance the discriminability between different types of expressions. Extensive experiments on SAMM-LV and CAS(ME)^2 show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art models, particularly in micro-expression spotting.</p></details> |  |
| **[Orca: Ocean Significant Wave Height Estimation with Spatio-temporally Aware Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20053v1)** | 2024-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Significant wave height (SWH) is a vital metric in marine science, and accurate SWH estimation is crucial for various applications, e.g., marine energy development, fishery, early warning systems for potential risks, etc. Traditional SWH estimation methods that are based on numerical models and physical theories are hindered by computational inefficiencies. Recently, machine learning has emerged as an appealing alternative to improve accuracy and reduce computational time. However, due to limited observational technology and high costs, the scarcity of real-world data restricts the potential of machine learning models. To overcome these limitations, we propose an ocean SWH estimation framework, namely Orca. Specifically, Orca enhances the limited spatio-temporal reasoning abilities of classic LLMs with a novel spatiotemporal aware encoding module. By segmenting the limited buoy observational data temporally, encoding the buoys' locations spatially, and designing prompt templates, Orca capitalizes on the robust generalization ability of LLMs to estimate significant wave height effectively with limited data. Experimental results on the Gulf of Mexico demonstrate that Orca achieves state-of-the-art performance in SWH estimation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Causal Deepsets for Off-policy Evaluation under Spatial or Spatio-temporal Interferences](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17910v1)** | 2024-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Off-policy evaluation (OPE) is widely applied in sectors such as pharmaceuticals and e-commerce to evaluate the efficacy of novel products or policies from offline datasets. This paper introduces a causal deepset framework that relaxes several key structural assumptions, primarily the mean-field assumption, prevalent in existing OPE methodologies that handle spatio-temporal interference. These traditional assumptions frequently prove inadequate in real-world settings, thereby restricting the capability of current OPE methods to effectively address complex interference effects. In response, we advocate for the implementation of the permutation invariance (PI) assumption. This innovative approach enables the data-driven, adaptive learning of the mean-field function, offering a more flexible estimation method beyond conventional averaging. Furthermore, we present novel algorithms that incorporate the PI assumption into OPE and thoroughly examine their theoretical foundations. Our numerical analyses demonstrate that this novel approach yields significantly more precise estimations than existing baseline algorithms, thereby substantially improving the practical applicability and effectiveness of OPE methodologies. A Python implementation of our proposed method is available at https://github.com/BIG-S2/Causal-Deepsets.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods either utilize multi-modal information in video-text pairs or apply global and local alignment techniques to promote alignment precision. However, these methods often fail to fully explore the spatio-temporal relationships among vision tokens within video and across different video-text pairs. In this paper, we propose a novel Spatio-Temporal Graph Transformer module to uniformly learn spatial and temporal contexts for video-language alignment pre-training (dubbed STGT). Specifically, our STGT combines spatio-temporal graph structure information with attention in transformer block, effectively utilizing the spatio-temporal contexts. In this way, we can model the relationships between vision tokens, promoting video-text alignment precision for benefiting downstream tasks. In addition, we propose a self-similarity alignment loss to explore the inherent self-similarity in the video and text. With the initial optimization achieved by contrastive learning, it can further promote the alignment accuracy between video and text. Experimental results on challenging downstream tasks, including video-text retrieval and video question answering, verify the superior performance of our method.</p></details> | under review |

The knowledge tree enables the visualization of hierarchical interrelation within the STKG, while the knowledge net elucidates semantic relationships among knowledge entities. Additionally, the knowledge map displays spatial and temporal distributions via spatial maps and time axes, respectively. Our visualization technology addresses the limitations inherent in single-view approaches and the deficiency of interaction in spatio-temporal perspectives evident in existing visualization methods. Moreover, we have encapsulated this technology within an integrated, open-source platform named GeoViz.

| **[Towards Effective Fusion and Forecasting of Multimodal Spatio-temporal Data for Smart Mobility](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16123v1)** | 2024-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid development of location based services, multimodal spatio-temporal (ST) data including trajectories, transportation modes, traffic flow and social check-ins are being collected for deep learning based methods. These deep learning based methods learn ST correlations to support the downstream tasks in the fields such as smart mobility, smart city and other intelligent transportation systems. Despite their effectiveness, ST data fusion and forecasting methods face practical challenges in real-world scenarios. First, forecasting performance for ST data-insufficient area is inferior, making it necessary to transfer meta knowledge from heterogeneous area to enhance the sparse representations. Second, it is nontrivial to accurately forecast in multi-transportation-mode scenarios due to the fine-grained ST features of similar transportation modes, making it necessary to distinguish and measure the ST correlations to alleviate the influence caused by entangled ST features. At last, partial data modalities (e.g., transportation mode) are lost due to privacy or technical issues in certain scenarios, making it necessary to effectively fuse the multimodal sparse ST features and enrich the ST representations. To tackle these challenges, our research work aim to develop effective fusion and forecasting methods for multimodal ST data in smart mobility scenario. In this paper, we will introduce our recent works that investigates the challenges in terms of various real-world applications and establish the open challenges in this field for future work.</p></details> | 4 pages |

Although Bayesian methods are common in spatio-temporal modeling, standard Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques are usually slow for large datasets such as house price data. To tackle this problem, we propose a divide-and-conquer spatio-temporal modeling approach. This method involves partitioning the data into multiple subsets and applying an appropriate Gaussian process model to each subset in parallel. The results from each subset are then combined using the Wasserstein barycenter technique to obtain the global parameters for the original problem. The proposed methodology allows for multiple observations per spatial and time unit, thereby offering added benefits for practitioners. As a real-life application, we analyze house price data of more than 0.6 million transactions from 983 middle layer super output areas in London over a period of eight years. The methodology provides insightful findings about the effects of various amenities, trend patterns, and the relationship between prices and carbon emissions. Furthermore, as demonstrated through a cross-validation study, it shows good predictive accuracy while balancing computational efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Suppl...</summary><p>Supplementary material is available from the authors upon request</p></details> |

Large space-time datasets call for new numerical methods to efficiently process them. The Stochastic Partial Differential Equation (SPDE) approach has proven to be effective for the estimation and the prediction in a spatial context. We present here the advection-diffusion SPDE with first order derivative in time which defines a large class of nonseparable spatio-temporal models. A Gaussian Markov random field approximation of the solution to the SPDE is built by discretizing the temporal derivative with a finite difference method (implicit Euler) and by solving the spatial SPDE with a finite element method (continuous Galerkin) at each time step. The ''Streamline Diffusion'' stabilization technique is introduced when the advection term dominates the diffusion. Computationally efficient methods are proposed to estimate the parameters of the SPDE and to predict the spatio-temporal field by kriging, as well as to perform conditional simulations. The approach is applied to a solar radiation dataset. Its advantages and limitations are discussed.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Spatio-Temporal Approach with Self-Corrective Causal Inference for Flight Delay Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15185v1)** | 2024-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate flight delay prediction is crucial for the secure and effective operation of the air traffic system. Recent advances in modeling inter-airport relationships present a promising approach for investigating flight delay prediction from the multi-airport scenario. However, the previous prediction works only accounted for the simplistic relationships such as traffic flow or geographical distance, overlooking the intricate interactions among airports and thus proving inadequate. In this paper, we leverage causal inference to precisely model inter-airport relationships and propose a self-corrective spatio-temporal graph neural network (named CausalNet) for flight delay prediction. Specifically, Granger causality inference coupled with a self-correction module is designed to construct causality graphs among airports and dynamically modify them based on the current airport's delays. Additionally, the features of the causality graphs are adaptively extracted and utilized to address the heterogeneity of airports. Extensive experiments are conducted on the real data of top-74 busiest airports in China. The results show that CausalNet is superior to baselines. Ablation studies emphasize the power of the proposed self-correction causality graph and the graph feature extraction module. All of these prove the effectiveness of the proposed methodology.</p></details> |  |

This variability poses a Domain Adaptation (DA) problem, as training and testing data distributions often differ. In this work, we propose Spatio-Temporal Monge Alignment (STMA) to mitigate these variabilities. This Optimal Transport (OT) based method adapts the cross-power spectrum density (cross-PSD) of multivariate signals by mapping them to the Wasserstein barycenter of source domains (multi-source DA). Predictions for new domains can be done with a filtering without the need for retraining a model with source data (test-time DA). We also study and discuss two special cases of the method, Temporal Monge Alignment (TMA) and Spatial Monge Alignment (SMA). Non-asymptotic concentration bounds are derived for the mappings estimation, which reveals a bias-plus-variance error structure with a variance decay rate of $\mathcal{O}(n_\ell^{-1/2})$ with $n_\ell$ the signal length. This theoretical guarantee demonstrates the efficiency of the proposed computational schema. Numerical experiments on multivariate biosignals and image data show that STMA leads to significant and consistent performance gains between datasets acquired with very different settings. Notably, STMA is a pre-processing step complementary to state-of-the-art deep learning methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Higher-order Spatio-temporal Physics-incorporated Graph Neural Network for Multivariate Time Series Imputation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10995v2)** | 2024-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Exploring the missing values is an essential but challenging issue due to the complex latent spatio-temporal correlation and dynamic nature of time series. Owing to the outstanding performance in dealing with structure learning potentials, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are often used to capture such complex spatio-temporal features in multivariate time series. However, these data-driven models often fail to capture the essential spatio-temporal relationships when significant signal corruption occurs. Additionally, calculating the high-order neighbor nodes in these models is of high computational complexity. To address these problems, we propose a novel higher-order spatio-temporal physics-incorporated GNN (HSPGNN). Firstly, the dynamic Laplacian matrix can be obtained by the spatial attention mechanism. Then, the generic inhomogeneous partial differential equation (PDE) of physical dynamic systems is used to construct the dynamic higher-order spatio-temporal GNN to obtain the missing time series values. Moreover, we estimate the missing impact by Normalizing Flows (NF) to evaluate the importance of each node in the graph for better explainability. Experimental results on four benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HSPGNN and the superior performance when combining various order neighbor nodes. Also, graph-like optical flow, dynamic graphs, and missing impact can be obtained naturally by HSPGNN, which provides better dynamic analysis and explanation than traditional data-driven models.

Traditional methods rely on hand-crafted features and machine learning techniques, which often struggle to model the complex dynamics of human motion. Recent deep learning-based methods have achieved success by learning spatio-temporal representations of motion, but these models often overlook the reliability of motion data. Additionally, the temporal and spatial dependencies of skeleton nodes are distinct. The temporal relationship captures motion information over time, while the spatial relationship describes body structure and the relationships between different nodes. In this paper, we propose a novel spatio-temporal branching network using incremental information for HMP, which decouples the learning of temporal-domain and spatial-domain features, extracts more motion information, and achieves complementary cross-domain knowledge learning through knowledge distillation. Our approach effectively reduces noise interference and provides more expressive information for characterizing motion by separately extracting temporal and spatial features. We evaluate our approach on standard HMP benchmarks and outperform state-of-the-art methods in terms of prediction accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>The i...</summary><p>The incremental information of our paper includes the displacement information from the last frame of the historical sequence, derived from the motion information of the first frame in the future sequence and the motion information of the last frame of the historical sequence.

Changes in the size, shape and movement of the chambers can be important markers for cardiac disease and modeling this in relation to clinical demography or disease is therefore of interest. Existing methods for spatio-temporal modeling of the human heart require shape correspondence over time or suffer from large memory requirements, making it difficult to use for complex anatomies. We introduce a novel conditional generative model, where the shape and movement is modeled implicitly in the form of a spatio-temporal neural distance field and conditioned on clinical demography. The model is based on an auto-decoder architecture and aims to disentangle the individual variations from that related to the clinical demography. It is tested on the left atrium (including the left atrial appendage), where it outperforms current state-of-the-art methods for anatomical sequence completion and generates synthetic sequences that realistically mimics the shape and motion of the real left atrium. In practice, this means we can infer functional measurements from a static image, generate synthetic populations with specified demography or disease and investigate how non-imaging clinical data effect the shape and motion of cardiac anatomies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for MICCAI2024</p></details> |

However, estimating incidence or mortality rates associated with rare cancers presents important difficulties and poses new statistical methodological challenges. In this paper, we expand the collection of multivariate spatio-temporal models by introducing adaptable shared spatio-temporal components to enable a comprehensive analysis of both incidence and cancer mortality in rare cancer cases. These models allow the modulation of spatio-temporal effects between incidence and mortality, allowing for changes in their relationship over time. The new models have been implemented in INLA using r-generic constructions. We conduct a simulation study to evaluate the performance of the new spatio-temporal models. Our results show that multivariate spatio-temporal models incorporating a flexible shared spatio-temporal term outperform conventional multivariate spatio-temporal models that include specific spatio-temporal effects for each health outcome. We use these models to analyze incidence and mortality data for pancreatic cancer and leukaemia among males across 142 administrative health care districts of Great Britain over a span of nine biennial periods (2002-2019).</p></details> | 40 pages, 12 figures |

To address this limitation, this paper presents the spatio-temporal GraphFormer framework for 3D human pose estimation in video, which integrates body structure graph-based representations with spatio-temporal information. Specifically, we develop a spatio-temporal criss-cross graph (STG) attention mechanism. This approach is designed to learn the long-range dependencies in data across both time and space, integrating graph information directly into the respective attention layers. Furthermore, we introduce the dual-path modulated hop-wise regular GCN (MHR-GCN) module, which utilizes modulation to optimize parameter usage and employs spatio-temporal hop-wise skip connections to acquire higher-order information. Additionally, this module processes temporal and spatial dimensions independently to learn their respective features while avoiding mutual influence. Finally, we demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in 3D human pose estimation on the Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP datasets.</p></details> |  |

The restoration and enhancement have proven to be highly beneficial. However, there are only a limited number of enhancement methods explicitly designed for videos acquired in low-light conditions. We propose a Spatio-Temporal Aligned SUNet (STA-SUNet) model using a Swin Transformer as a backbone to capture low light video features and exploit their spatio-temporal correlations. The STA-SUNet model is trained on a novel, fully registered dataset (BVI), which comprises dynamic scenes captured under varying light conditions. It is further analysed comparatively against various other models over three test datasets. The model demonstrates superior adaptivity across all datasets, obtaining the highest PSNR and SSIM values. It is particularly effective in extreme low-light conditions, yielding fairly good visualisation results.</p></details> |  |

In this regard, covariance properties with respect to geometric image transformations in the earliest layers of the visual hierarchy are essential for expressing robust image operations, and for formulating invariant visual operations at higher levels. This paper defines and proves a set of joint covariance properties for spatio-temporal receptive fields in terms of spatio-temporal derivative operators applied to spatio-temporally smoothed image data under compositions of spatial scaling transformations, spatial affine transformations, Galilean transformations and temporal scaling transformations. Specifically, the derived relations show how the parameters of the receptive fields need to be transformed, in order to match the output from spatio-temporal receptive fields under composed spatio-temporal image transformations. For this purpose, we also fundamentally extend the notion of scale-normalized derivatives to affine-normalized derivatives, that are computed based on spatial smoothing with affine Gaussian kernels, and analyze the covariance properties of the resulting affine-normalized derivatives for the affine group as well as for important subgroups thereof. We conclude with a geometric analysis, showing how the derived joint covariance properties make it possible to relate or match spatio-temporal receptive field responses, when observing, possibly moving, local surface patches from different views, under locally linearized perspective or projective transformations, as well as when observing different instances of spatio-temporal events, that may occur either faster or slower between different views of similar spatio-temporal events.</p></details> | <details><summary>41 pa...</summary><p>41 pages, 13 figures.

By learning the velocity field through flow-matching, flow-based models tend to produce a straighter sampling trajectory, which is advantageous during the sampling process. However, unlike diffusion models for which fast samplers are well-developed, efficient sampling of flow-based generative models has been rarely explored. In this paper, we propose a framework called FlowTurbo to accelerate the sampling of flow-based models while still enhancing the sampling quality. Our primary observation is that the velocity predictor's outputs in the flow-based models will become stable during the sampling, enabling the estimation of velocity via a lightweight velocity refiner. Additionally, we introduce several techniques including a pseudo corrector and sample-aware compilation to further reduce inference time. Since FlowTurbo does not change the multi-step sampling paradigm, it can be effectively applied for various tasks such as image editing, inpainting, etc. By integrating FlowTurbo into different flow-based models, we obtain an acceleration ratio of 53.1%$\sim$58.3% on class-conditional generation and 29.8%$\sim$38.5% on text-to-image generation. Notably, FlowTurbo reaches an FID of 2.12 on ImageNet with 100 (ms / img) and FID of 3.93 with 38 (ms / img), achieving the real-time image generation and establishing the new state-of-the-art.

Further, we develop a parallelized motion planning algorithm that can exploit the Gaussian map for real-time navigation. The Gaussian map constructed onboard the robot is optimized for both photometric and geometric quality while enabling real-time situational awareness for autonomy. We show through simulation experiments that our method is competitive with approaches that use alternate information gain metrics, while being orders of magnitude faster to compute. In real-world experiments, our algorithm achieves better map quality (10% higher Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and 30% higher geometric reconstruction accuracy) than Gaussian maps constructed by traditional exploration baselines.

| **[Explicit Local Time-Stepping for the Inhomogeneous Wave Equation with Optimal Convergence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18085v1)** | 2024-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Adaptivity and local mesh refinement are crucial for the efficient numerical simulation of wave phenomena in complex geometry. Local mesh refinement, however, can impose a tiny time-step across the entire computational domain when using explicit time integration. By taking smaller time-steps yet only inside locally refined regions, local time-stepping methods overcome the stringent CFL stability restriction imposed on the global time-step by a small fraction of the elements without sacrificing explicitness. In [21], a leapfrog based local time-stepping method was proposed for the inhomogeneous wave equation, which applies standard leapfrog time-marching with a smaller time-step inside the refined region. Here, to remove potential instability at certain time-steps, a stabilized version is proposed which leads to optimal L2-error estimates under a CFL condition independent of the coarse-to-fine mesh ratio. Moreover, a weighted transition is introduced to restore optimal H1-convergence when the source is nonzero across the coarse-to-fine mesh interface. Numerical experiments corroborate the theoretical error estimates and illustrate the usefulness of these improvements.</p></details> |  |
| **[Interval-Constrained Bipartite Matching over Time](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18469v4)** | 2024-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Interval-constrained online bipartite matching problem frequently occurs in medical appointment scheduling: unit-time jobs representing patients arrive online and are assigned to a time slot within their given time interval. We consider a variant of this problem where reassignments are allowed and extend it by a notion of current time, which is decoupled from the job arrival events. As jobs appear, the current point in time gradually advances. Jobs that are assigned to the current time unit become processed, which fixes part of the matching and disables these jobs or slots for reassignments in future steps. We refer to these time-dependent restrictions on reassignments as the over-time property. We show that FirstFit with reassignments according to the shortest augmenting path rule is $\frac{2}{3}$-competitive with respect to the matching cardinality, and that the bound is tight. Interestingly, this bound holds even if the number of reassignments per job is bound by a constant. For the number of reassignments performed by the algorithm, we show that it is in $\Omega(n \log n)$ in the worst case, where $n$ is the number of patients or jobs on the online side. This result is in line with lower bounds for the number of reassignments in online bipartite matching with reassignments, and, similarly to this previous work, we also conjecture that this bound should be tight. Moreover, we show that the algorithm maintaining the earliest-deadline-first order in the schedule yields maximum matchings, but at a cost of $\Omega(n^2)$ reassignments in worst case. Finally, we consider the generalization of the problem in which the set of feasible slots has arbitrary shape. We show that FirstFit retains its competitivity in this case and that no other deterministic algorithm can be more than $\frac{2}{3}$-competitive.</p></details> |  |
| **[Force-Guided Bridge Matching for Full-Atom Time-Coarsened Dynamics of Peptides](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15126v5)** | 2024-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Molecular Dynamics (MD) is crucial in various fields such as materials science, chemistry, and pharmacology to name a few. Conventional MD software struggles with the balance between time cost and prediction accuracy, which restricts its wider application. Recently, data-driven approaches based on deep generative models have been devised for time-coarsened dynamics, which aim at learning dynamics of diverse molecular systems over a long timestep, enjoying both universality and efficiency. Nevertheless, most current methods are designed solely to learn from the data distribution regardless of the underlying Boltzmann distribution, and the physics priors such as energies and forces are constantly overlooked. In this work, we propose a conditional generative model called Force-guided Bridge Matching (FBM), which learns full-atom time-coarsened dynamics and targets the Boltzmann-constrained distribution. With the guidance of our delicately-designed intermediate force field, FBM leverages favourable physics priors into the generation process, giving rise to enhanced simulations. Experiments on two datasets consisting of peptides verify our superiority in terms of comprehensive metrics and demonstrate transferability to unseen systems.</p></details> |  |

The complexity of the underlying systems often makes finding the optimal decision challenging, especially when the safety-critical system is time-varying. Overcoming the problem of optimizing an unknown time-varying reward subject to unknown time-varying safety constraints, we propose TVSafeOpt, a new algorithm built on Bayesian optimization with a spatio-temporal kernel. The algorithm is capable of safely tracking a time-varying safe region without the need for explicit change detection. Optimality guarantees are also provided for the algorithm when the optimization problem becomes stationary. We show that TVSafeOpt compares favorably against SafeOpt on synthetic data, both regarding safety and optimality. Evaluation on a realistic case study with gas compressors confirms that TVSafeOpt ensures safety when solving time-varying optimization problems with unknown reward and safety functions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |
| **[Nonparametric Inference Framework for Time-dependent Epidemic Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17968v1)** | 2024-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Compartmental models, especially the Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) model, have long been used to understand the behaviour of various diseases. Allowing parameters, such as the transmission rate, to be time-dependent functions makes it possible to adjust for and make inferences about changes in the process due to mitigation strategies or evolutionary changes of the infectious agent. In this article, we attempt to build a nonparametric inference framework for stochastic SIR models with time dependent infection rate. The framework includes three main steps: likelihood approximation, parameter estimation and confidence interval construction. The likelihood function of the stochastic SIR model, which is often intractable, can be approximated using methods such as diffusion approximation or tau leaping. The infection rate is modelled by a B-spline basis whose knot location and number of knots are determined by a fast knot placement method followed by a criterion-based model selection procedure. Finally, a point-wise confidence interval is built using a parametric bootstrap procedure. The performance of the framework is observed through various settings for different epidemic patterns. The model is then applied to the Ontario COVID-19 data across multiple waves.</p></details> |  |

While much attention is given to promptly identifying anomalies, a retrospective analysis of these anomalies can significantly enhance our comprehension of the underlying causes of observed undesired behavior. This aspect becomes particularly critical when the monitored system is deployed in a vital environment. In this study, we delve into anomalies within the domain of Bio-Regenerative Life Support Systems (BLSS) for space exploration and analyze anomalies found in telemetry data stemming from the EDEN ISS space greenhouse in Antarctica. We employ time series clustering on anomaly detection results to categorize various types of anomalies in both uni- and multivariate settings. We then assess the effectiveness of these methods in identifying systematic anomalous behavior. Additionally, we illustrate that the anomaly detection methods MDI and DAMP produce complementary results, as previously indicated by research.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, + Supplemental Materials, Published at Machine Learning and Knowledge Discovery in Databases.

| **[Inference-Time Language Model Alignment via Integrated Value Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17819v1)** | 2024-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models are typically fine-tuned to align with human preferences, but tuning large models is computationally intensive and complex. In this work, we introduce $\textit{Integrated Value Guidance}$ (IVG), a method that uses implicit and explicit value functions to guide language model decoding at token and chunk-level respectively, efficiently aligning large language models purely at inference time. This approach circumvents the complexities of direct fine-tuning and outperforms traditional methods. Empirically, we demonstrate the versatility of IVG across various tasks. In controlled sentiment generation and summarization tasks, our method significantly improves the alignment of large models using inference-time guidance from $\texttt{gpt2}$-based value functions. Moreover, in a more challenging instruction-following benchmark AlpacaEval 2.0, we show that both specifically tuned and off-the-shelf value functions greatly improve the length-controlled win rates of large models against $\texttt{gpt-4-turbo}$ (e.g., $19.51\% \rightarrow 26.51\%$ for $\texttt{Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2}$ and $25.58\% \rightarrow 33.75\%$ for $\texttt{Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1}$ with Tulu guidance).</p></details> | EMNLP 2024 Findings |

Most existing radiance-field-based SLAM systems mainly focus on bounded indoor environments, equipped with RGB-D or RGB sensors. However, they are prone to decline when expanding to unbounded scenes or encountering adverse conditions, such as violent motions and changing illumination. In contrast, oriented to general scenarios, our approach additionally tightly fuses LiDAR, IMU, and camera for robust pose estimation and photo-realistic online mapping. To compensate for regions unobserved by the LiDAR, we propose to integrate both the triangulated visual points from images and LiDAR points for initializing 3D Gaussians. In addition, the modeling of the sky and varying camera exposure have been realized for high-quality rendering. Notably, we implement our system purely with C++ and CUDA, and meticulously design a series of strategies to accelerate the online optimization of the Gaussian-based scene representation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms its counterparts while maintaining real-time capability. Impressively, regarding photo-realistic mapping, our method with our estimated poses even surpasses all the compared approaches that utilize privileged ground-truth poses for mapping. Our code will be released on project page https://xingxingzuo.github.io/gaussian_lic.</p></details> |  |
| **[Granger Causality for Mixed Time Series Generalized Linear Models: A Case Study on Multimodal Brain Connectivity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17751v1)** | 2024-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper is motivated by studies in neuroscience experiments to understand interactions between nodes in a brain network using different types of data modalities that capture different distinct facets of brain activity. To assess Granger-causality, we introduce a flexible framework through a general class of models that accommodates mixed types of data (binary, count, continuous, and positive components) formulated in a generalized linear model (GLM) fashion. Statistical inference for causality is performed based on both frequentist and Bayesian approaches, with a focus on the latter. Here, we develop a procedure for conducting inference through the proposed Bayesian mixed time series model. By introducing spike and slab priors for some parameters in the model, our inferential approach guides causality order selection and provides proper uncertainty quantification. The proposed methods are then utilized to study the rat spike train and local field potentials (LFP) data recorded during the olfaction working memory task. The proposed methodology provides critical insights into the causal relationship between the rat spiking activity and LFP spectral power. Specifically, power in the LFP beta band is predictive of spiking activity 300 milliseconds later, providing a novel analytical tool for this area of emerging interest in neuroscience and demonstrating its usefulness and flexibility in the study of causality in general.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper submitted for publication</p></details> |

The data came from both highland and lowland areas, in order to evaluate both the differences due to location, and elevation. The analysis focused on detecting trends at annual and monthly time scales, employing both ordinary least squares, robust S-estimator regression, and Mann-Kendall and Sen's slope methods. Then hierarchical clustering using Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) was applied to the monthly data to analyze the intra-annual pattern similarity of trends within and across the groups. Two different regions of Europe were chosen because of the different climate and temperature trends, namely the Northern UK (smaller trends) and the North-West Italian Alps (larger trends). The main novelty of the work is to show that stations having similar locations and altitudes have similar monthly slopes by quantifying them using DTW and clustering. These results reveal the nonrandomness of different trends along the year and among different parts of Europe, with a modest influence of altitude in wintertime. The findings revealed that group average trends were close to the NOAA values for the areas in Italy and the UK, confirming the validity of analyzing a small number of stations. More interestingly, intra-annual patterns were detected commonly at the stations of each of the groups, and clearly different between them Hierarchical clustering in combination with DTW showed consistent similarity between monthly patterns of means and trends within the group of stations and inconsistent similarity between patterns across groups. Distance correlation matrices also contributes to what is the main result of the paper, which is to clearly show the different temporal patterns in relation to location and (in some months) altitude.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The final version of this paper is in press on International journal of Climatology</p></details> |
| **[Stationarity of Manifold Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17706v1)** | 2024-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In modern interdisciplinary research, manifold time series data have been garnering more attention. A critical question in analyzing such data is ``stationarity'', which reflects the underlying dynamic behavior and is crucial across various fields like cell biology, neuroscience and empirical finance. Yet, there has been an absence of a formal definition of stationarity that is tailored to manifold time series. This work bridges this gap by proposing the first definitions of first-order and second-order stationarity for manifold time series. Additionally, we develop novel statistical procedures to test the stationarity of manifold time series and study their asymptotic properties. Our methods account for the curved nature of manifolds, leading to a more intricate analysis than that in Euclidean space. The effectiveness of our methods is evaluated through numerical simulations and their practical merits are demonstrated through analyzing a cell-type proportion time series dataset from a paper recently published in Cell. The first-order stationarity test result aligns with the biological findings of this paper, while the second-order stationarity test provides numerical support for a critical assumption made therein.</p></details> |  |
| **[PGN: The RNN's New Successor is Effective for Long-Range Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17703v1)** | 2024-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to the recurrent structure of RNN, the long information propagation path poses limitations in capturing long-term dependencies, gradient explosion/vanishing issues, and inefficient sequential execution. Based on this, we propose a novel paradigm called Parallel Gated Network (PGN) as the new successor to RNN. PGN directly captures information from previous time steps through the designed Historical Information Extraction (HIE) layer and leverages gated mechanisms to select and fuse it with the current time step information. This reduces the information propagation path to $\mathcal{O}(1)$, effectively addressing the limitations of RNN. To enhance PGN's performance in long-range time series forecasting tasks, we propose a novel temporal modeling framework called Temporal PGN (TPGN). TPGN incorporates two branches to comprehensively capture the semantic information of time series. One branch utilizes PGN to capture long-term periodic patterns while preserving their local characteristics. The other branch employs patches to capture short-term information and aggregate the global representation of the series. TPGN achieves a theoretical complexity of $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{L})$, ensuring efficiency in its operations. Experimental results on five benchmark datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance and high efficiency of TPGN, further confirming the effectiveness of PGN as the new successor to RNN in long-range time series forecasting. The code is available in this repository: \url{https://github.com/Water2sea/TPGN}.</p></details> |  |
| **[Time and State Dependent Neural Delay Differential Equations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14545v2)** | 2024-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Discontinuities and delayed terms are encountered in the governing equations of a large class of problems ranging from physics and engineering to medicine and economics. These systems cannot be properly modelled and simulated with standard Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE), or data-driven approximations such as Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (NODE). To circumvent this issue, latent variables are typically introduced to solve the dynamics of the system in a higher dimensional space and obtain the solution as a projection to the original space. However, this solution lacks physical interpretability. In contrast, Delay Differential Equations (DDEs), and their data-driven approximated counterparts, naturally appear as good candidates to characterize such systems. In this work we revisit the recently proposed Neural DDE by introducing Neural State-Dependent DDE (SDDDE), a general and flexible framework that can model multiple and state- and time-dependent delays. We show that our method is competitive and outperforms other continuous-class models on a wide variety of delayed dynamical systems.

| **[Archon: An Architecture Search Framework for Inference-Time Techniques](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15254v3)** | 2024-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inference-time techniques are emerging as highly effective tools to increase large language model (LLM) capabilities. However, there is still limited understanding of the best practices for developing systems that combine inference-time techniques with one or more LLMs, with challenges including: (1) effectively allocating inference compute budget, (2) understanding the interactions between different combinations of inference-time techniques and their impact on downstream performance, and 3) efficiently searching over the large space of model choices, inference-time techniques, and their compositions. To address these challenges, we introduce Archon, an automated framework for designing inference-time architectures. Archon defines an extensible design space, encompassing methods such as generation ensembling, multi-sampling, ranking, fusion, critiquing, verification, and unit testing. It then transforms the problem of selecting and combining LLMs and inference-time techniques into a hyperparameter optimization objective. To optimize this objective, we introduce automated Inference-Time Architecture Search (ITAS) algorithms. Given target benchmark(s), an inference compute budget, and available LLMs, ITAS outputs optimized architectures. We evaluate Archon architectures across a wide range of instruction-following and reasoning benchmarks, including MT-Bench, Arena-Hard-Auto, AlpacaEval 2.0, MixEval, MixEval Hard, MATH, and CodeContests. We show that automatically designed inference-time architectures by Archon outperform strong models such as GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet on these benchmarks, achieving an average increase of 15.1 and 11.2 percentage points with all-source models and open-source models, respectively. We make our code and datasets available publicly on Github: https://github.com/ScalingIntelligence/Archon.</p></details> |  |

While early research has explored online teaching, it is important to understand the perspective of instructors who conducted their first online classes during the Covid-19 pandemic. This study focuses on instructors teaching online for the first time, regardless of whether they volunteered. Surveys were conducted when universities transitioned from in-person to online instruction in April 2020, with a follow-up survey after their first online teaching semester. The study investigated instructors' expectations of class success before their first online teaching experience. Using Bayesian modeling, we analyzed how these expectations varied based on instructors' characteristics (self-efficacy in online teaching, technological proficiency, and acceptance of technology) and course attributes (subject area, class size, and instructional design). Results showed that instructors' self-efficacy significantly impacted their expectations of success, while smaller class sizes were associated with lower expectations. Interestingly, factors like prior use of technology platforms and classroom design did not contribute significantly to expectations. The study offers practical recommendations to support online teaching. To improve self-efficacy, instructors should collaborate with colleagues and familiarize themselves with online platforms. Universities should provide workshops or training to enhance teaching skills. In small interactive classes, nonverbal communication should be emphasized, and institutions should establish support teams and feedback mechanisms to ensure quality and effectiveness in online education.</p></details> | 16 pages |

More recently, Mamba, a state space model, has emerged with robust sequence and feature mixing capabilities. However, the suitability of the vanilla Mamba design for time series forecasting remains an open question, particularly due to its inadequate handling of cross-channel dependencies. Capturing cross-channel dependencies is critical in enhancing the performance of multivariate time series prediction. Recent findings show that self-attention excels in capturing cross-channel dependencies, whereas other simpler mechanisms, such as MLP, may degrade model performance. This is counterintuitive, as MLP, being a learnable architecture, should theoretically capture both correlations and irrelevances, potentially leading to neutral or improved performance. Diving into the self-attention mechanism, we attribute the observed degradation in MLP performance to its lack of data dependence and global receptive field, which result in MLP's lack of generalization ability. Based on the above insights, we introduce a refined Mamba variant tailored for time series forecasting. Our proposed model, \textbf{CMamba}, incorporates a modified Mamba (M-Mamba) module for temporal dependencies modeling, a global data-dependent MLP (GDD-MLP) to effectively capture cross-channel dependencies, and a Channel Mixup mechanism to mitigate overfitting. Comprehensive experiments conducted on seven real-world datasets demonstrate the efficacy of our model in improving forecasting performance.</p></details> |  |

This enables our model to analyze complex events, such as unexpected incidents and shifts in social behavior, and continuously refine the selection logic of news and the robustness of the agent's output. By compiling selected news with time series data, we fine-tune the LLaMa2 pre-trained model. The results demonstrate significant improvements in forecasting accuracy and suggest a potential paradigm shift in time series forecasting by effectively harnessing unstructured news data.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted for NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |

| **[A Time Series is Worth Five Experts: Heterogeneous Mixture of Experts for Traffic Flow Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17440v1)** | 2024-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate traffic prediction faces significant challenges, necessitating a deep understanding of both temporal and spatial cues and their complex interactions across multiple variables. Recent advancements in traffic prediction systems are primarily due to the development of complex sequence-centric models. However, existing approaches often embed multiple variables and spatial relationships at each time step, which may hinder effective variable-centric learning, ultimately leading to performance degradation in traditional traffic prediction tasks. To overcome these limitations, we introduce variable-centric and prior knowledge-centric modeling techniques. Specifically, we propose a Heterogeneous Mixture of Experts (TITAN) model for traffic flow prediction. TITAN initially consists of three experts focused on sequence-centric modeling. Then, designed a low-rank adaptive method, TITAN simultaneously enables variable-centric modeling. Furthermore, we supervise the gating process using a prior knowledge-centric modeling strategy to ensure accurate routing. Experiments on two public traffic network datasets, METR-LA and PEMS-BAY, demonstrate that TITAN effectively captures variable-centric dependencies while ensuring accurate routing. Consequently, it achieves improvements in all evaluation metrics, ranging from approximately 4.37\% to 11.53\%, compared to previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) models.

In this work, we present G-Transformer for counterfactual outcome prediction under dynamic and time-varying treatment strategies. Our approach leverages a Transformer architecture to capture complex, long-range dependencies in time-varying covariates while enabling g-computation, a causal inference method for estimating the effects of dynamic treatment regimes. Specifically, we use a Transformer-based encoder architecture to estimate the conditional distribution of relevant covariates given covariate and treatment history at each time point, then produces Monte Carlo estimates of counterfactual outcomes by simulating forward patient trajectories under treatment strategies of interest. We evaluate G-Transformer extensively using two simulated longitudinal datasets from mechanistic models, and a real-world sepsis ICU dataset from MIMIC-IV. G-Transformer outperforms both classical and state-of-the-art counterfactual prediction models in these settings. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first Transformer-based architecture that supports g-computation for counterfactual outcome prediction under dynamic and time-varying treatment strategies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Gaussian Processes for Time Series with Lead-Lag Effects with applications to biology data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07400v2)** | 2024-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Investigating the relationship, particularly the lead-lag effect, between time series is a common question across various disciplines, especially when uncovering biological process. However, analyzing time series presents several challenges. Firstly, due to technical reasons, the time points at which observations are made are not at uniform inintervals. Secondly, some lead-lag effects are transient, necessitating time-lag estimation based on a limited number of time points. Thirdly, external factors also impact these time series, requiring a similarity metric to assess the lead-lag relationship. To counter these issues, we introduce a model grounded in the Gaussian process, affording the flexibility to estimate lead-lag effects for irregular time series. In addition, our method outputs dissimilarity scores, thereby broadening its applications to include tasks such as ranking or clustering multiple pair-wise time series when considering their strength of lead-lag effects with external factors. Crucially, we offer a series of theoretical proofs to substantiate the validity of our proposed kernels and the identifiability of kernel parameters. Our model demonstrates advances in various simulations and real-world applications, particularly in the study of dynamic chromatin interactions, compared to other leading methods.</p></details> |  |

While previous works have attempted to reduce this energy by skipping input patches or pixels and using feedback from the end task to guide the skipping algorithm, the skipping is not performed during the sensor read phase. As a result, these methods can not optimize the front-end sensor energy. Moreover, they may not be suitable for real-time applications due to the long latency of modern CV networks that are deployed in the back-end. To address this challenge, this paper presents a custom-designed reconfigurable CMOS image sensor (CIS) system that improves energy efficiency by selectively skipping uneventful regions or rows within a frame during the sensor's readout phase, and the subsequent analog-to-digital conversion (ADC) phase. A novel masking algorithm intelligently directs the skipping process in real-time, optimizing both the front-end sensor and back-end neural networks for applications including autonomous driving and augmented/virtual reality (AR/VR). Our system can also operate in standard mode without skipping, depending on application needs. We evaluate our hardware-algorithm co-design framework on object detection based on BDD100K and ImageNetVID, and gaze estimation based on OpenEDS, achieving up to 53% reduction in front-end sensor energy while maintaining state-of-the-art (SOTA) accuracy.</p></details> | Under review |
| **[Bi-TTA: Bidirectional Test-Time Adapter for Remote Physiological Measurement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17316v1)** | 2024-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) is gaining prominence for its non-invasive approach to monitoring physiological signals using only cameras. Despite its promise, the adaptability of rPPG models to new, unseen domains is hindered due to the environmental sensitivity of physiological signals. To address this, we pioneer the Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) in rPPG, enabling the adaptation of pre-trained models to the target domain during inference, sidestepping the need for annotations or source data due to privacy considerations. Particularly, utilizing only the user's face video stream as the accessible target domain data, the rPPG model is adjusted by tuning on each single instance it encounters. However, 1) TTA algorithms are designed predominantly for classification tasks, ill-suited in regression tasks such as rPPG due to inadequate supervision. 2) Tuning pre-trained models in a single-instance manner introduces variability and instability, posing challenges to effectively filtering domain-relevant from domain-irrelevant features while simultaneously preserving the learned information. To overcome these challenges, we present Bi-TTA, a novel expert knowledge-based Bidirectional Test-Time Adapter framework. Specifically, leveraging two expert-knowledge priors for providing self-supervision, our Bi-TTA primarily comprises two modules: a prospective adaptation (PA) module using sharpness-aware minimization to eliminate domain-irrelevant noise, enhancing the stability and efficacy during the adaptation process, and a retrospective stabilization (RS) module to dynamically reinforce crucial learned model parameters, averting performance degradation caused by overfitting or catastrophic forgetting. To this end, we established a large-scale benchmark for rPPG tasks under TTA protocol. The experimental results demonstrate the significant superiority of our approach over the state-of-the-art.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://bi-tta.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[Building Real-time Awareness of Out-of-distribution in Trajectory Prediction for Autonomous Vehicles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17277v1)** | 2024-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction describes the motions of surrounding moving obstacles for an autonomous vehicle; it plays a crucial role in enabling timely decision-making, such as collision avoidance and trajectory replanning. Accurate trajectory planning is the key to reliable vehicle deployments in open-world environment, where unstructured obstacles bring in uncertainties that are impossible to fully capture by training data. For traditional machine learning tasks, such uncertainties are often addressed reasonably well via methods such as continual learning. On the one hand, naively applying those methods to trajectory prediction can result in continuous data collection and frequent model updates, which can be resource-intensive. On the other hand, the predicted trajectories can be far away from the true trajectories, leading to unsafe decision-making. In this paper, we aim to establish real-time awareness of out-of-distribution in trajectory prediction for autonomous vehicles. We focus on the challenging and practically relevant setting where the out-of-distribution is deceptive, that is, the one not easily detectable by human intuition. Drawing on the well-established techniques of sequential analysis, we build real-time awareness of out-of-distribution by monitoring prediction errors using the quickest change point detection (QCD). Our solutions are lightweight and can handle the occurrence of out-of-distribution at any time during trajectory prediction inference. Experimental results on multiple real-world datasets using a benchmark trajectory prediction model demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing accuracy with an adaptive discretization for the non-local integro-partial differential equations involving initial time singularities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08009v4)** | 2024-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work aims to construct an efficient and highly accurate numerical method to address the time singularity at $t=0$ involved in a class of time-fractional parabolic integro-partial differential equations in one and two dimensions. The $L2$-$1_\sigma$ scheme is used to discretize the time-fractional operator, whereas a modified version of the composite trapezoidal approximation is employed to discretize the Volterra operator. Subsequently, it helps to convert the proposed model into a second-order BVP in a semi-discrete form. The multi-dimensional Haar wavelets are then used for grid adaptation and efficient computations for the 2D problem, whereas the standard second-order approximations are employed to approximate the spatial derivatives for the 1D case. The stability analysis is carried out on an adaptive mesh in time. The convergence analysis leads to $O(N^{-2}+M^{-2})$ accurate solution in the space-time domain for the 1D problem having time singularity based on the $L^\infty$ norm for a suitable choice of the grading parameter. Furthermore, it provides $O(N^{-2}+M^{-3})$ accurate solution for the 2D problem having unbounded time derivative at $t=0$. The analysis also highlights a higher order accuracy for a sufficiently smooth solution resides in $C^3(\overline{\Omega}_t)$ even if the mesh is discretized uniformly. The truncation error estimates for the time-fractional operator, integral operator, and spatial derivatives are presented. Numerous tests are performed on several examples in support of the theoretical analysis. The advancement of the proposed methodology is demonstrated through the application of the time-fractional Fokker-Planck equation and the fractional-order viscoelastic dynamics having weakly singular kernels. It also confirms the superiority of the proposed method compared with existing approaches available in the literature.</p></details> | 28 pages, 10 figures |

| **[Collision-free time-optimal path parameterization for multi-robot teams](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17079v1)** | 2024-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Coordinating the motion of multiple robots in cluttered environments remains a computationally challenging task. We study the problem of minimizing the execution time of a set of geometric paths by a team of robots with state-dependent actuation constraints. We propose a Time-Optimal Path Parameterization (TOPP) algorithm for multiple car-like agents, where the modulation of the timing of every robot along its assigned path is employed to ensure collision avoidance and dynamic feasibility. This is achieved through the use of a priority queue to determine the order of trajectory execution for each robot while taking into account all possible collisions with higher priority robots in a spatiotemporal graph. We show a 10-20% reduction in makespan against existing state-of-the-art methods and validate our approach through simulations and hardware experiments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Using LLM for Real-Time Transcription and Summarization of Doctor-Patient Interactions into ePuskesmas in Indonesia](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17054v1)** | 2024-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One of the key issues contributing to inefficiency in Puskesmas is the time-consuming nature of doctor-patient interactions. Doctors need to conduct thorough consultations, which include diagnosing the patient's condition, providing treatment advice, and transcribing detailed notes into medical records. In regions with diverse linguistic backgrounds, doctors often have to ask clarifying questions, further prolonging the process. While diagnosing is essential, transcription and summarization can often be automated using AI to improve time efficiency and help doctors enhance care quality and enable early diagnosis and intervention. This paper proposes a solution using a localized large language model (LLM) to transcribe, translate, and summarize doctor-patient conversations. We utilize the Whisper model for transcription and GPT-3 to summarize them into the ePuskemas medical records format. This system is implemented as an add-on to an existing web browser extension, allowing doctors to fill out patient forms while talking. By leveraging this solution for real-time transcription, translation, and summarization, doctors can improve the turnaround time for patient care while enhancing the quality of records, which become more detailed and insightful for future visits. This innovation addresses challenges like overcrowded facilities and the administrative burden on healthcare providers in Indonesia. We believe this solution will help doctors save time, provide better care, and produce more accurate medical records, representing a significant step toward modernizing healthcare and ensuring patients receive timely, high-quality care, even in resource-constrained settings.</p></details> |  |

Traditional static and dynamic entanglement distribution methods often result in high entanglement drop rates and reduced end-to-end throughput. We introduce a novel framework that leverages the dynamic nature of LEO satellite networks to enhance entanglement distribution efficiency. Employing a space-time graph model to represent the network's temporal evolution, we propose an entanglement distribution strategy based on path utility, incorporating pointing errors, non-ideal link transmittance for intersatellite links, and atmospheric effects for downlinks. Our approach demonstrates superior performance in reducing entanglement drop rates and improving throughput compared to conventional methods. This study advances the field of quantum communication in satellite networks, offering resilient and efficient entanglement distribution strategies that support practical applications such as distributed computing, quantum multipartite cryptography, and distributed quantum sensing. The findings underscore the potential of integrating dynamic satellite networks with quantum technologies to create a reliable and secure quantum internet.</p></details> |  |

Automated data driven metrics can alleviate these difficulties, as demonstrated by existing machine learning instrument tracking models in minimally invasive surgery. However, these models have been tested on limited datasets of laparoscopic surgery, with a focus on isolated tasks and robotic surgery. In this paper, a new public dataset is introduced, focusing on simulated surgery, using the nasal phase of endoscopic pituitary surgery as an exemplar. Simulated surgery allows for a realistic yet repeatable environment, meaning the insights gained from automated assessment can be used by novice surgeons to hone their skills on the simulator before moving to real surgery. PRINTNet (Pituitary Real-time INstrument Tracking Network) has been created as a baseline model for this automated assessment. Consisting of DeepLabV3 for classification and segmentation; StrongSORT for tracking; and the NVIDIA Holoscan SDK for real-time performance, PRINTNet achieved 71.9% Multiple Object Tracking Precision running at 22 Frames Per Second. Using this tracking output, a Multilayer Perceptron achieved 87% accuracy in predicting surgical skill level (novice or expert), with the "ratio of total procedure time to instrument visible time" correlated with higher surgical skill. This therefore demonstrates the feasibility of automated surgical skill assessment in simulated endoscopic pituitary surgery. The new publicly available dataset can be found here: https://doi.org/10.5522/04/26511049.</p></details> | 7 pages, 6 figures |
| **[A random measure approach to reinforcement learning in continuous time](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17200v1)** | 2024-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a random measure approach for modeling exploration, i.e., the execution of measure-valued controls, in continuous-time reinforcement learning (RL) with controlled diffusion and jumps. First, we consider the case when sampling the randomized control in continuous time takes place on a discrete-time grid and reformulate the resulting stochastic differential equation (SDE) as an equation driven by suitable random measures. The construction of these random measures makes use of the Brownian motion and the Poisson random measure (which are the sources of noise in the original model dynamics) as well as the additional random variables, which are sampled on the grid for the control execution. Then, we prove a limit theorem for these random measures as the mesh-size of the sampling grid goes to zero, which leads to the grid-sampling limit SDE that is jointly driven by white noise random measures and a Poisson random measure. We also argue that the grid-sampling limit SDE can substitute the exploratory SDE and the sample SDE of the recent continuous-time RL literature, i.e., it can be applied for the theoretical analysis of exploratory control problems and for the derivation of learning algorithms.</p></details> | 33 pages |
| **[Identification of Additive Continuous-time Systems in Open and Closed loop](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01263v2)** | 2024-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When identifying electrical, mechanical, or biological systems, parametric continuous-time identification methods can lead to interpretable and parsimonious models when the model structure aligns with the physical properties of the system. Traditional linear system identification may not consider the most parsimonious model when relying solely on unfactored transfer functions, which typically result from standard direct approaches. This paper presents a novel identification method that delivers additive models for both open and closed-loop setups. The estimators that are derived are shown to be generically consistent, and can admit the identification of marginally stable additive systems. Numerical simulations show the efficacy of the proposed approach, and its performance in identifying a modal representation of a flexible beam is verified using experimental data.</p></details> | 15 pages, 6 figures |

This necessitates not only the parsing of temporal information within questions but also the identification and understanding of time-evolving facts to generate accurate answers. However, current large language models still have limited sensitivity to temporal information and their inadequate temporal reasoning capabilities.In this paper, we propose a novel framework that enhances temporal awareness and reasoning through Temporal Information-Aware Embedding and Granular Contrastive Reinforcement Learning. Experimental results on four TSQA datasets demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms existing LLMs in TSQA tasks, marking a step forward in bridging the performance gap between machine and human temporal understanding and reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by EMNLP 2024 Findings</p></details> |

Inspired by the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem, KANs replace traditional linear weights with spline-parametrized univariate functions, allowing them to learn activation patterns dynamically. We demonstrate that KANs outperforms conventional Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) in a real-world satellite traffic forecasting task, providing more accurate results with considerably fewer number of learnable parameters. We also provide an ablation study of KAN-specific parameters impact on performance. The proposed approach opens new avenues for adaptive forecasting models, emphasizing the potential of KANs as a powerful tool in predictive analytics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimal starting point for time series forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16843v1)** | 2024-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances on time series forecasting mainly focus on improving the forecasting models themselves. However, managing the length of the input data can also significantly enhance prediction performance. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach called Optimal Starting Point Time Series Forecast (OSP-TSP) to capture the intrinsic characteristics of time series data. By adjusting the sequence length via leveraging the XGBoost and LightGBM models, the proposed approach can determine optimal starting point (OSP) of the time series and thus enhance the prediction performances. The performances of the OSP-TSP approach are then evaluated across various frequencies on the M4 dataset and other real-world datasets. Empirical results indicate that predictions based on the OSP-TSP approach consistently outperform those using the complete dataset. Moreover, recognizing the necessity of sufficient data to effectively train models for OSP identification, we further propose targeted solutions to address the issue of data insufficiency.</p></details> |  |

Building upon foundational work originally solving differential equations for fields depending on coordinates [J. Comput. Phys. 378, 686 (2019)], we adapt the scheme to a context where the coordinates are treated as functions. This modification enables us to efficiently solve equations of motion for a particle in an external field. Our scheme is particularly useful for explicitly time-independent and periodic fields. We apply this approach to successfully solve the equations of motion for a mass particle placed in a central force field and a charged particle in a periodic electric field.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 4 figures, published in the International Conference on Scientific Computing and Machine Learning, see http://scml.jp</p></details> |

In TD graph, each edge is characterized by a time-dependent arrival time and a score function. TD-CPO aims to determine a loopless path $s$--$d$ departing from $s$ at time $t$ and arriving at $d$ on or before $t+\mathcal{B}$ while maximizing the score. TD-CPO has applications in urban navigation. TD-CPO is a variant of the Arc Orienteering Problem (AOP) known to be NP-hard in nature. The key computational challenge of TD-CPO is that we need to find the "longest path" in terms of score within the given budget constraint in a TD graph. Current works prune down the search space very aggressively. Thus, despite having low execution time, these algorithms often produce low-quality solutions. In contrast, our proposed approach $\mathcal{SCOPE}$ efficiently solves TD-CPO by exploiting road networks' spatial and temporal properties. The inherent computational structure of $\mathcal{SCOPE}$ enables trivial parallelization for improved performance. Our experiments indicate that $\mathcal{SCOPE}$ produces superior quality solutions (nearly $2x$) compared to the state-of-the-art algorithm while having comparable running times. Furthermore, $\mathcal{SCOPE}$ exhibits almost linear speedup as the number of CPUs (cores) increases (up to 24 CPUs).</p></details> | 10pages 17 figures |

However, few studies have achieved time-optimal motion planning for multi-drone systems, particularly during highly agile maneuvers or in dynamic scenarios. This paper presents a decentralized policy network for time-optimal multi-drone flight using multi-agent reinforcement learning. To strike a balance between flight efficiency and collision avoidance, we introduce a soft collision penalty inspired by optimization-based methods. By customizing PPO in a centralized training, decentralized execution (CTDE) fashion, we unlock higher efficiency and stability in training, while ensuring lightweight implementation. Extensive simulations show that, despite slight performance trade-offs compared to single-drone systems, our multi-drone approach maintains near-time-optimal performance with low collision rates. Real-world experiments validate our method, with two quadrotors using the same network as simulation achieving a maximum speed of 13.65 m/s and a maximum body rate of 13.4 rad/s in a 5.5 m * 5.5 m * 2.0 m space across various tracks, relying entirely on onboard computation.</p></details> | 7 pages, 6 figures |
| **[TSBP: Improving Object Detection in Histology Images via Test-time Self-guided Bounding-box Propagation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16678v1)** | 2024-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A global threshold (e.g., 0.5) is often applied to determine which bounding boxes should be included in the final results for an object detection task. A higher threshold reduces false positives but may result in missing a significant portion of true positives. A lower threshold can increase detection recall but may also result in more false positives. Because of this, using a preset global threshold (e.g., 0.5) applied to all the bounding box candidates may lead to suboptimal solutions. In this paper, we propose a Test-time Self-guided Bounding-box Propagation (TSBP) method, leveraging Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) to enhance object detection in histology images. TSBP utilizes bounding boxes with high confidence to influence those with low confidence, leveraging visual similarities between them. This propagation mechanism enables bounding boxes to be selected in a controllable, explainable, and robust manner, which surpasses the effectiveness of using simple thresholds and uncertainty calibration methods. Importantly, TSBP does not necessitate additional labeled samples for model training or parameter estimation, unlike calibration methods. We conduct experiments on gland detection and cell detection tasks in histology images. The results show that our proposed TSBP significantly improves detection outcomes when working in conjunction with state-of-the-art deep learning-based detection networks. Compared to other methods such as uncertainty calibration, TSBP yields more robust and accurate object detection predictions while using no additional labeled samples.

This study conducts a meticulous comparison between Quantum Long Short-Term Memory (QLSTM) and classical Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models for solar power production forecasting. The primary objective is to evaluate the potential advantages of QLSTMs, leveraging their exponential representational capabilities, in capturing the intricate spatiotemporal patterns inherent in renewable energy data. Through controlled experiments on real-world photovoltaic datasets, our findings reveal promising improvements offered by QLSTMs, including accelerated training convergence and substantially reduced test loss within the initial epoch compared to classical LSTMs. These empirical results demonstrate QLSTM's potential to swiftly assimilate complex time series relationships, enabled by quantum phenomena like superposition. However, realizing QLSTM's full capabilities necessitates further research into model validation across diverse conditions, systematic hyperparameter optimization, hardware noise resilience, and applications to correlated renewable forecasting problems. With continued progress, quantum machine learning can offer a paradigm shift in renewable energy time series prediction, potentially ushering in an era of unprecedented accuracy and reliability in solar power forecasting worldwide. This pioneering work provides initial evidence substantiating quantum advantages over classical LSTM models while acknowledging present limitations. Through rigorous benchmarking grounded in real-world data, our study illustrates a promising trajectory for quantum learning in renewable forecasting.</p></details> | 21 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Decentralized Federated Learning with Gradient Tracking over Time-Varying Directed Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17189v1)** | 2024-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate the problem of agent-to-agent interaction in decentralized (federated) learning over time-varying directed graphs, and, in doing so, propose a consensus-based algorithm called DSGTm-TV. The proposed algorithm incorporates gradient tracking and heavy-ball momentum to distributively optimize a global objective function, while preserving local data privacy. Under DSGTm-TV, agents will update local model parameters and gradient estimates using information exchange with neighboring agents enabled through row- and column-stochastic mixing matrices, which we show guarantee both consensus and optimality. Our analysis establishes that DSGTm-TV exhibits linear convergence to the exact global optimum when exact gradient information is available, and converges in expectation to a neighborhood of the global optimum when employing stochastic gradients. Moreover, in contrast to existing methods, DSGTm-TV preserves convergence for networks with uncoordinated stepsizes and momentum parameters, for which we provide explicit bounds. These results enable agents to operate in a fully decentralized manner, independently optimizing their local hyper-parameters. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach via comparisons with state-of-the-art baselines on real-world image classification and natural language processing tasks.</p></details> |  |

In this study, we propose a method to systematically generate domain-independent descriptive texts from time-series data. We identify two distinct approaches for creating pairs of time-series data and descriptive texts: the forward approach and the backward approach. By implementing the novel backward approach, we create the Temporal Automated Captions for Observations (TACO) dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that a contrastive learning based model trained using the TACO dataset is capable of generating descriptive texts for time-series data in novel domains.</p></details> |  |

This work extends the LWFR scheme to solve conservation laws on curvilinear meshes with adaptive mesh refinement (AMR). The scheme uses a subcell based blending limiter to perform shock capturing and exploits the same subcell structure to obtain admissibility preservation on curvilinear meshes. It is proven that the proposed extension of LWFR scheme to curvilinear grids preserves constant solution (free stream preservation) under the standard metric identities. For curvilinear meshes, linear Fourier stability analysis cannot be used to obtain an optimal CFL number. Thus, an embedded-error based time step computation method is proposed for LWFR method which reduces fine-tuning process required to select a stable CFL number using the wave speed based time step computation. The developments are tested on compressible Euler's equations, validating the blending limiter, admissibility preservation, AMR algorithm, curvilinear meshes and error based time stepping.</p></details> |  |

Modeling Continuous-Time Dynamics of Cascades for Information Popularity Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16623v1)** | 2024-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Information popularity prediction is important yet challenging in various domains, including viral marketing and news recommendations. The key to accurately predicting information popularity lies in subtly modeling the underlying temporal information diffusion process behind observed events of an information cascade, such as the retweets of a tweet. To this end, most existing methods either adopt recurrent networks to capture the temporal dynamics from the first to the last observed event or develop a statistical model based on self-exciting point processes to make predictions. However, information diffusion is intrinsically a complex continuous-time process with irregularly observed discrete events, which is oversimplified using recurrent networks as they fail to capture the irregular time intervals between events, or using self-exciting point processes as they lack flexibility to capture the complex diffusion process. Against this background, we propose ConCat, modeling the Continuous-time dynamics of Cascades for information popularity prediction. On the one hand, it leverages neural Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) to model irregular events of a cascade in continuous time based on the cascade graph and sequential event information. On the other hand, it considers cascade events as neural temporal point processes (TPPs) parameterized by a conditional intensity function which can also benefit the popularity prediction task. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate ConCat on three real-world datasets. Results show that ConCat achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines, yielding a 2.3%-33.2% improvement over the best-performing baselines across the three datasets.</p></details> |  |

However, calibrating stereo vision systems that incorporate both event and frame-based cameras remains a significant challenge. In this letter, we present EF-Calib, a spatiotemporal calibration framework for event- and frame-based cameras using continuous-time trajectories. A novel calibration pattern applicable to both camera types and the corresponding event recognition algorithm is proposed. Leveraging the asynchronous nature of events, a derivable piece-wise B-spline to represent camera pose continuously is introduced, enabling calibration for intrinsic parameters, extrinsic parameters, and time offset, with analytical Jacobians provided. Various experiments are carried out to evaluate the calibration performance of EF-Calib, including calibration experiments for intrinsic parameters, extrinsic parameters, and time offset. Experimental results show that EF-Calib achieves the most accurate intrinsic parameters compared to current SOTA, the close accuracy of the extrinsic parameters compared to the frame-based results, and accurate time offset estimation. EF-Calib provides a convenient and accurate toolbox for calibrating the system that fuses events and frames.

Despite the advancements in deep learning methods for TSF, their capacity to predict long-term series remains constrained. This limitation arises from the failure to account for both intra- and inter-variable variations meanwhile. To mitigate this challenge, we introduce the Fi$^2$VBlock, which leverages a \textbf{F}requency domain perspective to capture \textbf{i}ntra- and \textbf{i}nter-variable \textbf{V}ariations. After transforming into the frequency domain via the Frequency Transform Module, the Frequency Cross Attention between the real and imaginary parts is designed to obtain enhanced frequency representations and capture intra-variable variations. Furthermore, Inception blocks are employed to integrate information, thus capturing correlations across different variables. Our backbone network, Fi$^2$VTS, employs a residual architecture by concatenating multiple Fi$^2$VBlocks, thereby preventing degradation issues. Theoretically, we demonstrate that Fi$^2$VTS achieves a substantial reduction in both time and memory complexity, decreasing from $\mathcal{O}(L^2)$ to $\mathcal{O}(L)$ per Fi$^2$VBlock computation. Empirical evaluations on three benchmark datasets reveal that Fi$^2$VTS delivers an overall relative Mean Squared Error (MSE) reduction of 30\% and an overall relative Mean Absolute Error (MAE) reduction of 22\% when compared to the latest state-of-the-art methods. The implementation code is accessible at \url{https://github.com/HITshenrj/Fi2VTS}.</p></details> |  |

The proposed method uses a baseline TV optimizer with a prediction model, designed for the gradient dynamics to exploit the underlying structure of the temporal correlation. Inspired by $\mathcal{L}_{1}$ adaptive control, the proposed method augments an adaptive update law to estimate and compensate for the uncertainty from the inaccurate prediction in the online implementation. The proposed method provides the performance bounds of the error in the optimization variables and cost function, allowing efficient and reliable optimization for uncertain TV problems.</p></details> | 8 pages, 3 figures |

| **[EMIT- Event-Based Masked Auto Encoding for Irregular Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16554v1)** | 2024-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Irregular time series, where data points are recorded at uneven intervals, are prevalent in healthcare settings, such as emergency wards where vital signs and laboratory results are captured at varying times. This variability, which reflects critical fluctuations in patient health, is essential for informed clinical decision-making. Existing self-supervised learning research on irregular time series often relies on generic pretext tasks like forecasting, which may not fully utilise the signal provided by irregular time series. There is a significant need for specialised pretext tasks designed for the characteristics of irregular time series to enhance model performance and robustness, especially in scenarios with limited data availability. This paper proposes a novel pretraining framework, EMIT, an event-based masking for irregular time series. EMIT focuses on masking-based reconstruction in the latent space, selecting masking points based on the rate of change in the data. This method preserves the natural variability and timing of measurements while enhancing the model's ability to process irregular intervals without losing essential information. Extensive experiments on the MIMIC-III and PhysioNet Challenge datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our event-based masking strategy. The code has been released at https://github.com/hrishi-ds/EMIT .</p></details> |  |

However, taking notes while watching a video requires significant time and effort. To address this, we propose a novel interactive system, NoTeeline, for taking real-time, personalized notes. NoTeeline lets users quickly jot down keypoints (micronotes), which are automatically expanded into full-fledged notes that capture the content of the user's micronotes and are consistent with the user's writing style. In a within-subjects study (N=12), we found that NoTeeline helps users create high-quality notes that capture the essence of their micronotes with a higher factual correctness (93.2%) while accurately reflecting their writing style. While using NoTeeline, participants experienced significantly reduced mental effort, captured satisfactory notes while writing 47% less text, and completed notetaking with 43.9% less time compared to a manual notetaking baseline.</p></details> | <details><summary>Early...</summary><p>Early Draft.

Generally, artificial neural network based MPPT algorithms use basic neural network architectures and inputs which do not represent the ambient conditions in a comprehensive manner. In this article, the ambient conditions of a location are represented through a comprehensive set of environmental features. Furthermore, the inclusion of time based features in the input data is considered to model cyclic patterns temporally within the atmospheric conditions leading to robust modeling of the MPPT algorithm. A transformer based deep learning architecture is trained as a time series prediction model using multidimensional time series input features. The model is trained on a dataset containing typical meteorological year data points of ambient weather conditions from 50 locations. The attention mechanism in the transformer modules allows the model to learn temporal patterns in the data efficiently. The proposed model achieves a 0.47% mean average percentage error of prediction on non zero operating voltage points in a test dataset consisting of data collected over a period of 200 consecutive hours resulting in the average power efficiency of 99.54% and peak power efficiency of 99.98%. The proposed model is validated through real time simulations. The proposed model performs power point tracking in a robust, dynamic, and nonlatent manner, over a wide range of atmospheric conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published June 2022, in Energy Science and Engineering, Volume10, Issue9, Pages 3397-3410</p></details> |

While a parametric prior is specified for the linear model coefficients, the autocovariance structure of the time series is modeled nonparametrically using a Bernstein-Gamma process prior for the spectral density function, the Fourier transform of the autocovariance function. When updating this joint prior with Whittle's likelihood, a Bernstein-von-Mises result is established for the linear model coefficients showing the asymptotic equivalence of the corresponding estimators to those obtained from frequentist pseudo-maximum-likelihood estimation under the Whittle likelihood. Local asymptotic normality of the likelihood is shown, demonstrating that the marginal posterior distribution of the linear model coefficients shrinks at parametric rate towards the true value, and that the conditional posterior distribution of the spectral density contracts in the sup-norm, even in the case of a partially misspecified linear model.</p></details> |  |
| **[TiM4Rec: An Efficient Sequential Recommendation Model Based on Time-Aware Structured State Space Duality Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16182v1)** | 2024-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sequential recommendation represents a pivotal branch of recommendation systems, centered around dynamically analyzing the sequential dependencies between user preferences and their interactive behaviors. Despite the Transformer architecture-based models achieving commendable performance within this domain, their quadratic computational complexity relative to the sequence dimension impedes efficient modeling. In response, the innovative Mamba architecture, characterized by linear computational complexity, has emerged. Mamba4Rec further pioneers the application of Mamba in sequential recommendation. Nonetheless, Mamba 1's hardware-aware algorithm struggles to efficiently leverage modern matrix computational units, which lead to the proposal of the improved State Space Duality (SSD), also known as Mamba 2. While the SSD4Rec successfully adapts the SSD architecture for sequential recommendation, showing promising results in high-dimensional contexts, it suffers significant performance drops in low-dimensional scenarios crucial for pure ID sequential recommendation tasks. Addressing this challenge, we propose a novel sequential recommendation backbone model, TiM4Rec, which ameliorates the low-dimensional performance loss of the SSD architecture while preserving its computational efficiency. Drawing inspiration from TiSASRec, we develop a time-aware enhancement method tailored for the linear computation demands of the SSD architecture, thereby enhancing its adaptability and achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in both low and high-dimensional modeling. The code for our model is publicly accessible at https://github.com/AlwaysFHao/TiM4Rec.</p></details> |  |
| **[Real-time Planning of Minimum-time Trajectories for Agile UAV Flight](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16074v1)** | 2024-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We address the challenge of real-time planning of minimum-time trajectories over multiple waypoints, onboard multirotor UAVs. Previous works demonstrated that achieving a truly time-optimal trajectory is computationally too demanding to enable frequent replanning during agile flight, especially on less powerful flight computers. Our approach overcomes this stumbling block by utilizing a point-mass model with a novel iterative thrust decomposition algorithm, enabling the UAV to use all of its collective thrust, something previous point-mass approaches could not achieve. The approach enables gravity and drag modeling integration, significantly reducing tracking errors in high-speed trajectories, which is proven through an ablation study. When combined with a new multi-waypoint optimization algorithm, which uses a gradient-based method to converge to optimal velocities in waypoints, the proposed method generates minimum-time multi-waypoint trajectories within milliseconds. The proposed approach, which we provide as open-source package, is validated both in simulation and in real-world, using Nonlinear Model Predictive Control. With accelerations of up to 3.5g and speeds over 100 km/h, trajectories generated by the proposed method yield similar or even smaller tracking errors than the trajectories generated for a full multirotor model.</p></details> |  |
| **[Time Evidence Fusion Network: Multi-source View in Long-Term Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06419v3)** | 2024-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In practical scenarios, time series forecasting necessitates not only accuracy but also efficiency. Consequently, the exploration of model architectures remains a perennially trending topic in research. To address these challenges, we propose a novel backbone architecture named Time Evidence Fusion Network (TEFN) from the perspective of information fusion. Specifically, we introduce the Basic Probability Assignment (BPA) Module based on evidence theory to capture the uncertainty of multivariate time series data from both channel and time dimensions. Additionally, we develop a novel multi-source information fusion method to effectively integrate the two distinct dimensions from BPA output, leading to improved forecasting accuracy. Lastly, we conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate that TEFN achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods while maintaining significantly lower complexity and reduced training time. Also, our experiments show that TEFN exhibits high robustness, with minimal error fluctuations during hyperparameter selection. Furthermore, due to the fact that BPA is derived from fuzzy theory, TEFN offers a high degree of interpretability. Therefore, the proposed TEFN balances accuracy, efficiency, stability, and interpretability, making it a desirable solution for time series forecasting.</p></details> |  |
| **[Time-MoE: Billion-Scale Time Series Foundation Models with Mixture of Experts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16040v1)** | 2024-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning for time series forecasting has seen significant advancements over the past decades. However, despite the success of large-scale pre-training in language and vision domains, pre-trained time series models remain limited in scale and operate at a high cost, hindering the development of larger capable forecasting models in real-world applications. In response, we introduce Time-MoE, a scalable and unified architecture designed to pre-train larger, more capable forecasting foundation models while reducing inference costs. By leveraging a sparse mixture-of-experts (MoE) design, Time-MoE enhances computational efficiency by activating only a subset of networks for each prediction, reducing computational load while maintaining high model capacity. This allows Time-MoE to scale effectively without a corresponding increase in inference costs. Time-MoE comprises a family of decoder-only transformer models that operate in an auto-regressive manner and support flexible forecasting horizons with varying input context lengths. We pre-trained these models on our newly introduced large-scale data Time-300B, which spans over 9 domains and encompassing over 300 billion time points. For the first time, we scaled a time series foundation model up to 2.4 billion parameters, achieving significantly improved forecasting precision. Our results validate the applicability of scaling laws for training tokens and model size in the context of time series forecasting. Compared to dense models with the same number of activated parameters or equivalent computation budgets, our models consistently outperform them by large margin. These advancements position Time-MoE as a state-of-the-art solution for tackling real-world time series forecasting challenges with superior capability, efficiency, and flexibility.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 10 figures, 13 tables</p></details> |

Effective explainable AI techniques are crucial to bridging the gap between model predictions and user understanding. This paper presents a framework - TSFeatLIME, extending TSLIME, tailored specifically for explaining univariate time series forecasting. TSFeatLIME integrates an auxiliary feature into the surrogate model and considers the pairwise Euclidean distances between the queried time series and the generated samples to improve the fidelity of the surrogate models. However, the usefulness of such explanations for human beings remains an open question. We address this by conducting a user study with 160 participants through two interactive interfaces, aiming to measure how individuals from different backgrounds can simulate or predict model output changes in the treatment group and control group. Our results show that the surrogate model under the TSFeatLIME framework is able to better simulate the behaviour of the black-box considering distance, without sacrificing accuracy. In addition, the user study suggests that the explanations were significantly more effective for participants without a computer science background.</p></details> |  |

We also demonstrate associative recall under noisy conditions. In these experiments, the required synaptic weights are computed offline, to satisfy a template that encourages temporal stability.</p></details> |  |

Data-driven science is rapidly growing, especially in X-ray methodologies, where advanced light sources and detection technologies accumulate vast amounts of data that exceed meticulous human inspection capabilities. Despite the increasing demands, the full application of machine learning has been hindered by the need for data-specific optimizations. In this study, we introduce a new deep-learning-based phase retrieval method for imperfect diffraction data. This method provides robust phase retrieval for simulated data and performs well on weak-signal single-pulse diffraction data from X-ray free-electron lasers. Moreover, the method significantly reduces data processing time, facilitating real-time image reconstructions that are crucial for high-repetition-rate data acquisition. Thus, this approach offers a reliable solution to the phase problem and is expected to be widely adopted across various research areas.</p></details> |  |

We present WIAE-GPF, a Weak Innovation AutoEncoder-based Generative Probabilistic Forecasting architecture that generates future samples of multivariate time series. Unlike traditional black-box models, WIAE-GPF offers interpretability through the Wiener-Kallianpur innovation representation for nonparametric time series, making it a nonparametric generalization of the Wiener/Kalman filter-based forecasting. A novel learning algorithm with structural convergence guarantees is proposed, ensuring that, under ideal training conditions, the generated forecast samples match the ground truth conditional probability distribution. Extensive tests using publicly available data from U.S. independent system operators under various point and probabilistic forecasting metrics demonstrate that WIAE-GPF consistently outperforms classical methods and cutting-edge machine learning techniques.</p></details> |  |

The complexity of the underlying systems often makes finding the optimal decision challenging, especially when the safety-critical system is time-varying. Overcoming the problem of optimizing an unknown time-varying reward subject to unknown time-varying safety constraints, we propose TVSafeOpt, a new algorithm built on Bayesian optimization with a spatio-temporal kernel. The algorithm is capable of safely tracking a time-varying safe region without the need for explicit change detection. Optimality guarantees are also provided for the algorithm when the optimization problem becomes stationary. We show that TVSafeOpt compares favorably against SafeOpt on synthetic data, both regarding safety and optimality. Evaluation on a realistic case study with gas compressors confirms that TVSafeOpt ensures safety when solving time-varying optimization problems with unknown reward and safety functions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |

However, previous works primarily relied on a single masking criterion, resulting in the model overfitting specific features and overlooking other effective information. In this paper, we introduce a hierarchy and attention guided cross-masking framework (HA-CM) that applies masking to skeleton sequences from both spatial and temporal perspectives. Specifically, in spatial graphs, we utilize hyperbolic space to maintain joint distinctions and effectively preserve the hierarchical structure of high-dimensional skeletons, employing joint hierarchy as the masking criterion. In temporal flows, we substitute traditional distance metrics with the global attention of joints for masking, addressing the convergence of distances in high-dimensional space and the lack of a global perspective. Additionally, we incorporate cross-contrast loss based on the cross-masking framework into the loss function to enhance the model's learning of instance-level features. HA-CM shows efficiency and universality on three public large-scale datasets, NTU-60, NTU-120, and PKU-MMD.

Recent studies on collaborative perception mostly utilize CNNs or Transformers to learn feature representation and fusion in the spatial dimension, which struggle to handle long-range spatial-temporal features under limited computing and communication resources. Holistically modeling the dependencies over extensive spatial areas and extended temporal frames is crucial to enhancing feature quality. To this end, we propose a resource efficient cross-agent spatial-temporal collaborative state space model (SSM), named CollaMamba. Initially, we construct a foundational backbone network based on spatial SSM. This backbone adeptly captures positional causal dependencies from both single-agent and cross-agent views, yielding compact and comprehensive intermediate features while maintaining linear complexity. Furthermore, we devise a history-aware feature boosting module based on temporal SSM, extracting contextual cues from extended historical frames to refine vague features while preserving low overhead. Extensive experiments across several datasets demonstrate that CollaMamba outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving higher model accuracy while reducing computational and communication overhead by up to 71.9% and 1/64, respectively. This work pioneers the exploration of the Mamba's potential in collaborative perception.

This work focuses on temporal hierarchies, such as aggregating monthly time series data to annual data. We explore the impact of various forecast reconciliation methods on temporally aggregated ARIMA models, thereby bridging the fields of hierarchical forecast reconciliation and temporal aggregation both theoretically and experimentally. Our paper is the first to theoretically examine the effects of temporal hierarchical forecast reconciliation, demonstrating that the optimal method aligns with a bottom-up aggregation approach. To assess the practical implications and performance of the reconciled forecasts, we conduct a series of simulation studies, confirming that the findings extend to more complex models. This result helps explain the strong performance of the bottom-up approach observed in many prior studies. Finally, we apply our methods to real data examples, where we observe similar results.</p></details> |  |

Previous methods usually quantize the entire body pose into one code, which not only faces the difficulty in encoding all joints within one vector but also loses the spatial relationship between different joints. Differently, in this work we quantize each individual joint into one vector, which i) simplifies the quantization process as the complexity associated with a single joint is markedly lower than that of the entire pose; ii) maintains a spatial-temporal structure that preserves both the spatial relationships among joints and the temporal movement patterns; iii) yields a 2D token map, which enables the application of various 2D operations widely used in 2D images. Grounded in the 2D motion quantization, we build a spatial-temporal modeling framework, where 2D joint VQVAE, temporal-spatial 2D masking technique, and spatial-temporal 2D attention are proposed to take advantage of spatial-temporal signals among the 2D tokens.

This paper aims at developing a recurrent version of stochastic configuration networks (RSCNs) for problem solving, where we have no underlying assumption on the dynamic orders of the input variables. Given a collection of historical data, we first build an initial RSCN model in the light of a supervisory mechanism, followed by an online update of the output weights by using a projection algorithm. Some theoretical results are established, including the echo state property, the universal approximation property of RSCNs for both the offline and online learnings, and the convergence of the output weights. The proposed RSCN model is remarkably distinguished from the well-known echo state networks (ESNs) in terms of the way of assigning the input random weight matrix and a special structure of the random feedback matrix. A comprehensive comparison study among the long short-term memory (LSTM) network, the original ESN, and several state-of-the-art ESN methods such as the simple cycle reservoir (SCR), the polynomial ESN (PESN), the leaky-integrator ESN (LIESN) and RSCN is carried out. Numerical results clearly indicate that the proposed RSCN performs favourably over all of the datasets.</p></details> |  |

Existing RGB-E tracking methods model event characteristics utilising attention mechanism of Transformer before integrating both modalities. Nevertheless, these methods involve aggregating the event stream into a single event frame, lacking the utilisation of the temporal information inherent in the event stream.Moreover, the traditional attention mechanism is well-suited for dense semantic features, while the attention mechanism for sparse event features require revolution. In this paper, we propose a dynamic event subframe splitting strategy to split the event stream into more fine-grained event clusters, aiming to capture spatio-temporal features that contain motion cues. Based on this, we design an event-based sparse attention mechanism to enhance the interaction of event features in temporal and spatial dimensions. The experimental results indicate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on the FE240 and COESOT datasets, providing an effective processing manner for the event data.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 8 figures, conference</p></details> |

After training with this framework, the learned model can improve long-step prediction accuracy significantly given the past trajectories and the context information. The accuracy and effectiveness of the approach are evaluated by comparing the predicted trajectories with the ground truth. The results indicate that the proposed method has outperformed the state-of-the-art predicting methods on a terminal airspace flight trajectory dataset.

To this end, we introduce Walker, the first self-supervised tracker that learns from videos with sparse bounding box annotations, and no tracking labels. First, we design a quasi-dense temporal object appearance graph, and propose a novel multi-positive contrastive objective to optimize random walks on the graph and learn instance similarities. Then, we introduce an algorithm to enforce mutually-exclusive connective properties across instances in the graph, optimizing the learned topology for MOT. At inference time, we propose to associate detected instances to tracklets based on the max-likelihood transition state under motion-constrained bi-directional walks. Walker is the first self-supervised tracker to achieve competitive performance on MOT17, DanceTrack, and BDD100K. Remarkably, our proposal outperforms the previous self-supervised trackers even when drastically reducing the annotation requirements by up to 400x.</p></details> | ECCV 2024 |

| **[Path-adaptive Spatio-Temporal State Space Model for Event-based Recognition with Arbitrary Duration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16953v1)** | 2024-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Event cameras are bio-inspired sensors that capture the intensity changes asynchronously and output event streams with distinct advantages, such as high temporal resolution. To exploit event cameras for object/action recognition, existing methods predominantly sample and aggregate events in a second-level duration at every fixed temporal interval (or frequency). However, they often face difficulties in capturing the spatiotemporal relationships for longer, e.g., minute-level, events and generalizing across varying temporal frequencies. To fill the gap, we present a novel framework, dubbed PAST-SSM, exhibiting superior capacity in recognizing events with arbitrary duration (e.g., 0.1s to 4.5s) and generalizing to varying inference frequencies. Our key insight is to learn the spatiotemporal relationships from the encoded event features via the state space model (SSM) -- whose linear complexity makes it ideal for modeling high temporal resolution events with longer sequences. To achieve this goal, we first propose a Path-Adaptive Event Aggregation and Scan (PEAS) module to encode events of varying duration into features with fixed dimensions by adaptively scanning and selecting aggregated event frames. On top of PEAS, we introduce a novel Multi-faceted Selection Guiding (MSG) loss to minimize the randomness and redundancy of the encoded features. This subtly enhances the model generalization across different inference frequencies. Lastly, the SSM is employed to better learn the spatiotemporal properties from the encoded features. Moreover, we build a minute-level event-based recognition dataset, named ArDVS100, with arbitrary duration for the benefit of the community. Extensive experiments prove that our method outperforms prior arts by +3.45%, +0.38% and +8.31% on the DVS Action, SeAct and HARDVS datasets, respectively.</p></details> | First version |

This necessitates not only the parsing of temporal information within questions but also the identification and understanding of time-evolving facts to generate accurate answers. However, current large language models still have limited sensitivity to temporal information and their inadequate temporal reasoning capabilities.In this paper, we propose a novel framework that enhances temporal awareness and reasoning through Temporal Information-Aware Embedding and Granular Contrastive Reinforcement Learning. Experimental results on four TSQA datasets demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms existing LLMs in TSQA tasks, marking a step forward in bridging the performance gap between machine and human temporal understanding and reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by EMNLP 2024 Findings</p></details> |

This paper introduces CVT-Occ, a novel approach that leverages temporal fusion through the geometric correspondence of voxels over time to improve the accuracy of 3D occupancy predictions. By sampling points along the line of sight of each voxel and integrating the features of these points from historical frames, we construct a cost volume feature map that refines current volume features for improved prediction outcomes. Our method takes advantage of parallax cues from historical observations and employs a data-driven approach to learn the cost volume. We validate the effectiveness of CVT-Occ through rigorous experiments on the Occ3D-Waymo dataset, where it outperforms state-of-the-art methods in 3D occupancy prediction with minimal additional computational cost.

The aerial agent needs to not only understand tactically evolving maneuvers of fighter jets from a long-term perspective but also react to rapidly changing aerodynamics of aircraft from a short-term viewpoint. In this paper, we introduce TempFuser, a novel long short-term temporal fusion transformer architecture that can learn agile, tactical, and acrobatic flight maneuvers in complex dogfight problems. Our approach integrates two distinct temporal transition embeddings into a transformer-based network to comprehensively capture both the long-term tactics and short-term agility of aerial agents. By incorporating these perspectives, our policy network generates end-to-end flight commands that secure dominant positions over the long term and effectively outmaneuver agile opponents. After training in a high-fidelity flight simulator, our model successfully learns to execute strategic maneuvers, outperforming baseline policy models against various types of opponent aircraft. Notably, our model exhibits human-like acrobatic maneuvers even when facing adversaries with superior specifications, all without relying on prior knowledge. Moreover, it demonstrates robust pursuit performance in challenging supersonic and low-altitude situations.

| **[AutoSTF: Decoupled Neural Architecture Search for Cost-Effective Automated Spatio-Temporal Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16586v1)** | 2024-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal forecasting is a critical component of various smart city applications, such as transportation optimization, energy management, and socio-economic analysis. Recently, several automated spatio-temporal forecasting methods have been proposed to automatically search the optimal neural network architecture for capturing complex spatio-temporal dependencies. However, the existing automated approaches suffer from expensive neural architecture search overhead, which hinders their practical use and the further exploration of diverse spatio-temporal operators in a finer granularity. In this paper, we propose AutoSTF, a decoupled automatic neural architecture search framework for cost-effective automated spatio-temporal forecasting. From the efficiency perspective, we first decouple the mixed search space into temporal space and spatial space and respectively devise representation compression and parameter-sharing schemes to mitigate the parameter explosion. The decoupled spatio-temporal search not only expedites the model optimization process but also leaves new room for more effective spatio-temporal dependency modeling. From the effectiveness perspective, we propose a multi-patch transfer module to jointly capture multi-granularity temporal dependencies and extend the spatial search space to enable finer-grained layer-wise spatial dependency search. Extensive experiments on eight datasets demonstrate the superiority of AutoSTF in terms of both accuracy and efficiency. Specifically, our proposed method achieves up to 13.48x speed-up compared to state-of-the-art automatic spatio-temporal forecasting methods while maintaining the best forecasting accuracy.</p></details> | 16 pages, 13 figures |
| **[Graph Pruning Based Spatial and Temporal Graph Convolutional Network with Transfer Learning for Traffic Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16532v1)** | 2024-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the process of urbanization and the rapid growth of population, the issue of traffic congestion has become an increasingly critical concern. Intelligent transportation systems heavily rely on real-time and precise prediction algorithms to address this problem. While Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) methods in deep learning have demonstrated high accuracy in predicting road conditions when sufficient data is available, forecasting in road networks with limited data remains a challenging task. This study proposed a novel Spatial-temporal Convolutional Network (TL-GPSTGN) based on graph pruning and transfer learning framework to tackle this issue. Firstly, the essential structure and information of the graph are extracted by analyzing the correlation and information entropy of the road network structure and feature data. By utilizing graph pruning techniques, the adjacency matrix of the graph and the input feature data are processed, resulting in a significant improvement in the model's migration performance. Subsequently, the well-characterized data are inputted into the spatial-temporal graph convolutional network to capture the spatial-temporal relationships and make predictions regarding the road conditions. Furthermore, this study conducts comprehensive testing and validation of the TL-GPSTGN method on real datasets, comparing its prediction performance against other commonly used models under identical conditions. The results demonstrate the exceptional predictive accuracy of TL-GPSTGN on a single dataset, as well as its robust migration performance across different datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, accepted by ICIAAI2023, withdrawn from proceedings</p></details> |
| **[Glitch in Time: Exploiting Temporal Misalignment of IMU For Eavesdropping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16438v1)** | 2024-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increasing use of voice assistants and related applications has raised significant concerns about the security of Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) in smartphones. These devices are vulnerable to acoustic eavesdropping attacks, jeopardizing user privacy. In response, Google imposed a rate limit of 200 Hz on permission-free access to IMUs, aiming to neutralize such side-channel attacks. Our research introduces a novel exploit, STAG, which circumvents these protections. It induces a temporal misalignment between the gyroscope and accelerometer, cleverly combining their data to resample at higher rates and reviving the potential for eavesdropping attacks previously curtailed by Google's security enhancements. Compared to prior methods, STAG achieves an 83.4% reduction in word error rate, highlighting its effectiveness in exploiting IMU data under restricted access and emphasizing the persistent security risks associated with these sensors.</p></details> |  |
| **[Knowledge Distillation on Spatial-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network for Traffic Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11798v4)** | 2024-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficient real-time traffic prediction is crucial for reducing transportation time. To predict traffic conditions, we employ a spatio-temporal graph neural network (ST-GNN) to model our real-time traffic data as temporal graphs. Despite its capabilities, it often encounters challenges in delivering efficient real-time predictions for real-world traffic data. Recognizing the significance of timely prediction due to the dynamic nature of real-time data, we employ knowledge distillation (KD) as a solution to enhance the execution time of ST-GNNs for traffic prediction. In this paper, We introduce a cost function designed to train a network with fewer parameters (the student) using distilled data from a complex network (the teacher) while maintaining its accuracy close to that of the teacher. We use knowledge distillation, incorporating spatial-temporal correlations from the teacher network to enable the student to learn the complex patterns perceived by the teacher. However, a challenge arises in determining the student network architecture rather than considering it inadvertently. To address this challenge, we propose an algorithm that utilizes the cost function to calculate pruning scores, addressing small network architecture search issues, and jointly fine-tunes the network resulting from each pruning stage using KD. Ultimately, we evaluate our proposed ideas on two real-world datasets, PeMSD7 and PeMSD8. The results indicate that our method can maintain the student's accuracy close to that of the teacher, even with the retention of only 3% of network parameters.</p></details> |  |
| **[Flow to Rare Events: An Application of Normalizing Flow in Temporal Importance Sampling for Automated Vehicle Validation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07320v2)** | 2024-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated Vehicle (AV) validation based on simulated testing requires unbiased evaluation and high efficiency. One effective solution is to increase the exposure to risky rare events while reweighting the probability measure. However, characterizing the distribution of risky events is particularly challenging due to the paucity of samples and the temporality of continuous scenario variables. To solve it, we devise a method to represent, generate, and reweight the distribution of risky rare events. We decompose the temporal evolution of continuous variables into distribution components based on conditional probability. By introducing the Risk Indicator Function, the distribution of risky rare events is theoretically precipitated out of naturalistic driving distribution. This targeted distribution is practically generated via Normalizing Flow, which achieves exact and tractable probability evaluation of intricate distribution. The rare event distribution is then demonstrated as the advantageous Importance Sampling distribution. We also promote the technique of temporal Importance Sampling. The combined method, named as TrimFlow, is executed to estimate the collision rate of Car-following scenarios as a tentative practice. The results showed that sampling background vehicle maneuvers from rare event distribution could evolve testing scenarios to hazardous states. TrimFlow reduced 86.1% of tests compared to generating testing scenarios according to their exposure in the naturalistic driving environment. In addition, the TrimFlow method is not limited to one specific type of functional scenario.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatial-Temporal Mixture-of-Graph-Experts for Multi-Type Crime Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15764v1)** | 2024-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As various types of crime continue to threaten public safety and economic development, predicting the occurrence of multiple types of crimes becomes increasingly vital for effective prevention measures. Although extensive efforts have been made, most of them overlook the heterogeneity of different crime categories and fail to address the issue of imbalanced spatial distribution. In this work, we propose a Spatial-Temporal Mixture-of-Graph-Experts (ST-MoGE) framework for collective multiple-type crime prediction. To enhance the model's ability to identify diverse spatial-temporal dependencies and mitigate potential conflicts caused by spatial-temporal heterogeneity of different crime categories, we introduce an attentive-gated Mixture-of-Graph-Experts (MGEs) module to capture the distinctive and shared crime patterns of each crime category. Then, we propose Cross-Expert Contrastive Learning(CECL) to update the MGEs and force each expert to focus on specific pattern modeling, thereby reducing blending and redundancy. Furthermore, to address the issue of imbalanced spatial distribution, we propose a Hierarchical Adaptive Loss Re-weighting (HALR) approach to eliminate biases and insufficient learning of data-scarce regions. To evaluate the effectiveness of our methods, we conduct comprehensive experiments on two real-world crime datasets and compare our results with twelve advanced baselines. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Double-Path Adaptive-correlation Spatial-Temporal Inverted Transformer for Stock Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15662v1)** | 2024-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial-temporal graph neural networks (STGNNs) have achieved significant success in various time series forecasting tasks. However, due to the lack of explicit and fixed spatial relationships in stock prediction tasks, many STGNNs fail to perform effectively in this domain. While some STGNNs learn spatial relationships from time series, they often lack comprehensiveness. Research indicates that modeling time series using feature changes as tokens reveals entirely different information compared to using time steps as tokens. To more comprehensively extract dynamic spatial information from stock data, we propose a Double-Path Adaptive-correlation Spatial-Temporal Inverted Transformer (DPA-STIFormer). DPA-STIFormer models each node via continuous changes in features as tokens and introduces a Double Direction Self-adaptation Fusion mechanism. This mechanism decomposes node encoding into temporal and feature representations, simultaneously extracting different spatial correlations from a double path approach, and proposes a Double-path gating mechanism to fuse these two types of correlation information. Experiments conducted on four stock market datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art results, validating the model's superior capability in uncovering latent temporal-correlation patterns.</p></details> |  |
| **[Critical Node Detection in Temporal Social Networks, Based on Global and Semi-local Centrality Measures](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15142v1)** | 2024-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Nodes that play strategic roles in networks are called critical or influential nodes. For example, in an epidemic, we can control the infection spread by isolating critical nodes; in marketing, we can use certain nodes as the initial spreaders aiming to reach the largest part of the network, or they can be selected for removal in targeted attacks to maximise the fragmentation of the network. In this study, we focus on critical node detection in temporal networks. We propose three new measures to identify the critical nodes in temporal networks: the temporal supracycle ratio, temporal semi-local integration, and temporal semi-local centrality. We analyse the performance of these measures based on their effect on the SIR epidemic model in three scenarios: isolating the influential nodes when an epidemic happens, using the influential nodes as seeds of the epidemic, or removing them to analyse the robustness of the network. We compare the results with existing centrality measures, particularly temporal betweenness, temporal centrality, and temporal degree deviation. The results show that the introduced measures help identify influential nodes more accurately. The proposed methods can be used to detect nodes that need to be isolated to reduce the spread of an epidemic or as initial nodes to speedup dissemination of information.</p></details> | <details><summary>Comme...</summary><p>Comments and criticisms are welcomed</p></details> |

Electricity is traditionally managed by anticipating demand and intermittent production (wind, solar) and matching flexible production (hydro, nuclear, coal and gas). Accurate forecasting of electricity load and renewable production is therefore essential to ensure grid performance and stability. Both are highly dependent on meteorological variables (temperature, wind, sunshine). These dependencies are complex and difficult to model. On the one hand, spatial variations do not have a uniform impact because population, industry, and wind and solar farms are not evenly distributed across the territory. On the other hand, temporal variations can have delayed effects on load (due to the thermal inertia of buildings). With access to observations from different weather stations and simulated data from meteorological models, we believe that both phenomena can be modeled together. In today's state-of-the-art load forecasting models, the spatio-temporal modeling of the weather is fixed. In this work, we aim to take advantage of the automated representation and spatio-temporal feature extraction capabilities of deep neural networks to improve spatio-temporal weather modeling for load forecasting. We compare our deep learning-based methodology with the state-of-the-art on French national load. This methodology could also be fully adapted to forecasting renewable energy production.</p></details> |  |
| **[Video-to-Audio Generation with Fine-grained Temporal Semantics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14709v1)** | 2024-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With recent advances of AIGC, video generation have gained a surge of research interest in both academia and industry (e.g., Sora). However, it remains a challenge to produce temporally aligned audio to synchronize the generated video, considering the complicated semantic information included in the latter. In this work, inspired by the recent success of text-to-audio (TTA) generation, we first investigate the video-to-audio (VTA) generation framework based on latent diffusion model (LDM). Similar to latest pioneering exploration in VTA, our preliminary results also show great potentials of LDM in VTA task, but it still suffers from sub-optimal temporal alignment. To this end, we propose to enhance the temporal alignment of VTA with frame-level semantic information. With the recently popular grounding segment anything model (Grounding SAM), we can extract the fine-grained semantics in video frames to enable VTA to produce better-aligned audio signal. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our system on both objective and subjective evaluation metrics, which shows both better audio quality and fine-grained temporal alignment.</p></details> |  |

This work extends traditional prediction approaches by focusing on four-dimensional (4D) CSI, which includes predictions over time, bandwidth, and antenna (TX and RX) space. Such a comprehensive framework is essential for addressing the dynamic nature of mobility environments within intelligent transportation systems, necessitating the capture of both temporal and spatial dependencies across diverse domains. To address this complexity, we propose a novel context-conditioned spatiotemporal predictive learning method. This method leverages causal convolutional long short-term memory (CA-ConvLSTM) to effectively capture dependencies within 4D CSI data, and incorporates context-conditioned attention mechanisms to enhance the efficiency of spatiotemporal memory updates. Additionally, we introduce an adaptive meta-learning scheme tailored for recurrent networks to mitigate the issue of accumulative prediction errors. We validate the proposed method through empirical studies conducted across three different geometric configurations and mobility scenarios. Our results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art predictive models, achieving superior performance across various geometries. Moreover, we show that the meta-learning framework significantly enhances the performance of recurrent-based predictive models in highly challenging cross-geometry settings, thus highlighting its robustness and adaptability.</p></details> |  |

Our approach, namely spatio-temporal motion retargeting (STMR), guides imitation learning procedures by transferring motion from source to target, effectively bridging the morphological disparities by ensuring the feasibility of imitation on the target system. Our STMR method comprises two components: spatial motion retargeting (SMR) and temporal motion retargeting (TMR). On the one hand, SMR tackles motion retargeting at the kinematic level by generating kinematically feasible whole-body motions from keypoint trajectories. On the other hand, TMR aims to retarget motion at the dynamic level by optimizing motion in the temporal domain. We showcase the effectiveness of our method in facilitating Imitation Learning (IL) for complex animal movements through a series of simulation and hardware experiments. In these experiments, our STMR method successfully tailored complex animal motions from various media, including video captured by a hand-held camera, to fit the morphology and physical properties of the target robots. This enabled RL policy training for precise motion tracking, while baseline methods struggled with highly dynamic motion involving flying phases. Moreover, we validated that the control policy can successfully imitate six different motions in two quadruped robots with different dimensions and physical properties in real-world settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>34 pa...</summary><p>34 pages, 7 figures, videos available at https://terry97-guel.github.io/STMR-RL.github.io/</p></details> |

Current RVOS methods typically use vision and language models pretrained independently as backbones. As images and texts are mapped to uncoupled feature spaces, they face the arduous task of learning Vision-Language (VL) relation modeling from scratch. Witnessing the success of Vision-Language Pretrained (VLP) models, we propose to learn relation modeling for RVOS based on their aligned VL feature space. Nevertheless, transferring VLP models to RVOS is a deceptively challenging task due to the substantial gap between the pretraining task (static image/region-level prediction) and the RVOS task (dynamic pixel-level prediction). To address this transfer challenge, we introduce a framework named VLP-RVOS which harnesses VLP models for RVOS through temporal-aware adaptation. We first propose a temporal-aware prompt-tuning method, which not only adapts pretrained representations for pixel-level prediction but also empowers the vision encoder to model temporal contexts. We further customize a cube-frame attention mechanism for robust spatial-temporal reasoning. Besides, we propose to perform multi-stage VL relation modeling while and after feature extraction for comprehensive VL understanding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method performs favorably against state-of-the-art algorithms and exhibits strong generalization abilities.</p></details> |  |

However, current benchmarks cannot faithfully reflect the temporal understanding abilities of video-language models (VidLMs) due to the existence of static visual shortcuts. To remedy this issue, we present VITATECS, a diagnostic VIdeo-Text dAtaset for the evaluation of TEmporal Concept underStanding. Specifically, we first introduce a fine-grained taxonomy of temporal concepts in natural language in order to diagnose the capability of VidLMs to comprehend different temporal aspects. Furthermore, to disentangle the correlation between static and temporal information, we generate counterfactual video descriptions that differ from the original one only in the specified temporal aspect. We employ a semi-automatic data collection framework using large language models and human-in-the-loop annotation to obtain high-quality counterfactual descriptions efficiently. Evaluation of representative video-language understanding models confirms their deficiency in temporal understanding, revealing the need for greater emphasis on the temporal elements in video-language research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ECCV 2024. 19 pages, 3 figures, 8 tables.

Our method combines these models in the reverse diffusion process, where the LIDM enhances image quality and the LVDM ensures temporal consistency. This unique combination allows us to effectively handle the complex spatio-temporal dynamics in video generation. Our results demonstrate quantitative and qualitative improvements in producing realistic and coherent videos.</p></details> |  |
| **[Temporally Consistent Factuality Probing for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14065v1)** | 2024-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The prolific use of Large Language Models (LLMs) as an alternate knowledge base requires them to be factually consistent, necessitating both correctness and consistency traits for paraphrased queries. Recently, significant attempts have been made to benchmark datasets and metrics to evaluate LLMs for these traits. However, structural simplicity (subject-relation-object) and contemporary association in their query formulation limit the broader definition of factuality and consistency. In this study, we introduce TeCFaP, a novel Temporally Consistent Factuality Probe task to expand the consistent factuality probe in the temporal dimension. To this end, we propose TEMP-COFAC, a high-quality dataset of prefix-style English query paraphrases. Subsequently, we extend the definitions of existing metrics to represent consistent factuality across temporal dimension. We experiment with a diverse set of LLMs and find most of them performing poorly on TeCFaP. Next, we propose a novel solution CoTSeLF (Consistent-Time-Sensitive Learning Framework) combining multi-task instruction tuning (MT-IT) with consistent-time-sensitive reinforcement learning (CTSRL) to improve temporally consistent factuality in LLMs. Our experiments demonstrate the efficacy of CoTSeLF over several baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatiotemporal Forecasting of Traffic Flow using Wavelet-based Temporal Attention](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04440v2)** | 2024-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatiotemporal forecasting of traffic flow data represents a typical problem in the field of machine learning, impacting urban traffic management systems. In general, spatiotemporal forecasting problems involve complex interactions, nonlinearities, and long-range dependencies due to the interwoven nature of the temporal and spatial dimensions. Due to this, traditional statistical and machine learning methods cannot adequately handle the temporal and spatial dependencies in these complex traffic flow datasets. A prevalent approach in the field combines graph convolutional networks and multi-head attention mechanisms for spatiotemporal processing. This paper proposes a wavelet-based temporal attention model, namely a wavelet-based dynamic spatiotemporal aware graph neural network (W-DSTAGNN), for tackling the traffic forecasting problem. Wavelet decomposition can help by decomposing the signal into components that can be analyzed independently, reducing the impact of non-stationarity and handling long-range dependencies of traffic flow datasets. Benchmark experiments using three popularly used statistical metrics confirm that our proposal efficiently captures spatiotemporal correlations and outperforms ten state-of-the-art models (including both temporal and spatiotemporal benchmarks) on three publicly available traffic datasets. Our proposed ensemble method can better handle dynamic temporal and spatial dependencies and make reliable long-term forecasts. In addition to point forecasts, our proposed model can generate interval forecasts that significantly enhance probabilistic forecasting for traffic datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Temporal Sequencing of Documents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02578v3)** | 2024-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We outline an unsupervised method for temporal rank ordering of sets of historical documents, namely American State of the Union Addresses and DEEDS, a corpus of medieval English property transfer documents. Our method relies upon effectively capturing the gradual change in word usage via a bandwidth estimate for the non-parametric Generalized Linear Models (Fan, Heckman, and Wand, 1995). The number of possible rank orders needed to search through for cost functions related to the bandwidth can be quite large, even for a small set of documents. We tackle this problem of combinatorial optimization using the Simulated Annealing algorithm, which allows us to obtain the optimal document temporal orders. Our rank ordering method significantly improved the temporal sequencing of both corpora compared to a randomly sequenced baseline. This unsupervised approach should enable the temporal ordering of undated document sets.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing methods are limited to highway or highly simplified intersection scenarios due to the intricacy and diversity of traffic scenarios. In response, we propose Traffic Scenario Logic (TSL), which is a spatial-temporal logic designed for modeling and reasoning of urban pedestrian-free traffic scenarios. TSL provides a formal representation of the urban road network that can be derived from OpenDRIVE, i.e., the de facto industry standard of high-definition maps for autonomous driving, enabling the representation of a broad range of traffic scenarios without discretization approximations. We implemented the reasoning of TSL using Telingo, i.e., a solver for temporal programs based on the Answer Set Programming, and tested it on different urban road layouts. Demonstrations show the effectiveness of TSL in test scenario generation and its potential value in areas like decision-making and control verification of autonomous driving. The code for TSL reasoning is opened.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages of main text, 19 pages of technical appendix</p></details> |

People interacting with the robot may want to ask questions like where something happened, when it occurred, or how long ago it took place, which would require the robot to reason over a long history of their deployment. To address this problem, we introduce a Retrieval-augmented Memory for Embodied Robots, or ReMEmbR, a system designed for long-horizon video question answering for robot navigation. To evaluate ReMEmbR, we introduce the NaVQA dataset where we annotate spatial, temporal, and descriptive questions to long-horizon robot navigation videos. ReMEmbR employs a structured approach involving a memory building and a querying phase, leveraging temporal information, spatial information, and images to efficiently handle continuously growing robot histories. Our experiments demonstrate that ReMEmbR outperforms LLM and VLM baselines, allowing ReMEmbR to achieve effective long-horizon reasoning with low latency. Additionally, we deploy ReMEmbR on a robot and show that our approach can handle diverse queries. The dataset, code, videos, and other material can be found at the following link: https://nvidia-ai-iot.github.io/remembr</p></details> |  |

In this application, users have requirements on the execution of appliance tasks, pay for energy according to dynamic energy tariffs, have access to high-capacity battery storage, and are able to sell energy to the grid. The concurrent scheduling of devices makes this a multi-effector planning problem, while the dynamic tariffs yield costs that are non-stationary (alternatively, costs that are stationary but depend on exogenous events). These characteristics are such that the planning problems are generally not supported by existing PDDL-based planners, so we instead design a custom domain-dependent planner that scales to reasonable appliance numbers and time horizons. We conduct a controlled user study with 128 participants using an online crowd-sourcing platform based on two user stories. Our results indicate that users provided with contrastive questions and explanations have higher levels of satisfaction, tend to gain improved understanding, and rate the helpfulness more favourably with the recommended AI schedule compared to those without access to these features.</p></details> |  |

Although changes across time are taken into account when assessing images in clinical practice, most existing deep learning methods treat scans from different timepoints separately. Among studies utilizing longitudinal images, a simple channel-wise concatenation is the primary albeit suboptimal method employed to integrate timepoints. We introduce a novel approach that explicitly incorporates temporal differences between baseline and follow-up scans through a unique architectural inductive bias called Difference Weighting Block. It merges features from two timepoints, emphasizing changes between scans. We achieve superior scores in lesion segmentation (Dice Score, Hausdorff distance) as well as lesion detection (lesion-level $F_1$ score) as compared to state-of-the-art longitudinal and single timepoint models across two datasets. Our code is made publicly available at www.github.com/MIC-DKFZ/Longitudinal-Difference-Weighting.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at MICCAI 2024 LDTM</p></details> |

To address these issues, we propose a novel approach that more accurately reflects human cognition. This paper introduces HERMES: temporal-coHERent long-forM understanding with Episodes and Semantics, a model that simulates episodic memory accumulation to capture action sequences and reinforces them with semantic knowledge dispersed throughout the video. Our work makes two key contributions: First, we develop an Episodic COmpressor (ECO) that efficiently aggregates crucial representations from micro to semi-macro levels, overcoming the challenge of long-range dependencies. Second, we propose a Semantics ReTRiever (SeTR) that enhances these aggregated representations with semantic information by focusing on the broader context, dramatically reducing feature dimensionality while preserving relevant macro-level information. This addresses the issues of redundancy and lack of high-level concept extraction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HERMES achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple long-video understanding benchmarks in both zero-shot and fully-supervised settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is an improved and expanded version of our EVAL-FoMo Workshop at ECCV'24 (v1 of this paper).

| **[Inductive Spatial Temporal Prediction Under Data Drift with Informative Graph Neural Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13253v1)** | 2024-09-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inductive spatial temporal prediction can generalize historical data to predict unseen data, crucial for highly dynamic scenarios (e.g., traffic systems, stock markets). However, external events (e.g., urban structural growth, market crash) and emerging new entities (e.g., locations, stocks) can undermine prediction accuracy by inducing data drift over time. Most existing studies extract invariant patterns to counter data drift but ignore pattern diversity, exhibiting poor generalization to unseen entities. To address this issue, we design an Informative Graph Neural Network (INF-GNN) to distill diversified invariant patterns and improve prediction accuracy under data drift. Firstly, we build an informative subgraph with a uniquely designed metric, Relation Importance (RI), that can effectively select stable entities and distinct spatial relationships. This subgraph further generalizes new entities' data via neighbors merging. Secondly, we propose an informative temporal memory buffer to help the model emphasize valuable timestamps extracted using influence functions within time intervals. This memory buffer allows INF-GNN to discern influential temporal patterns. Finally, RI loss optimization is designed for pattern consolidation. Extensive experiments on real-world dataset under substantial data drift demonstrate that INF-GNN significantly outperforms existing alternatives.</p></details> |  |
| **[Oryx MLLM: On-Demand Spatial-Temporal Understanding at Arbitrary Resolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12961v1)** | 2024-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual data comes in various forms, ranging from small icons of just a few pixels to long videos spanning hours. Existing multi-modal LLMs usually standardize these diverse visual inputs to a fixed resolution for visual encoders and yield similar numbers of tokens for LLMs. This approach is non-optimal for multimodal understanding and inefficient for processing inputs with long and short visual contents. To solve the problem, we propose Oryx, a unified multimodal architecture for the spatial-temporal understanding of images, videos, and multi-view 3D scenes. Oryx offers an on-demand solution to seamlessly and efficiently process visual inputs with arbitrary spatial sizes and temporal lengths through two core innovations: 1) a pre-trained OryxViT model that can encode images at any resolution into LLM-friendly visual representations; 2) a dynamic compressor module that supports 1x to 16x compression on visual tokens by request. These design features enable Oryx to accommodate extremely long visual contexts, such as videos, with lower resolution and high compression while maintaining high recognition precision for tasks like document understanding with native resolution and no compression. Beyond the architectural improvements, enhanced data curation and specialized training on long-context retrieval and spatial-aware data help Oryx achieve strong capabilities in image, video, and 3D multimodal understanding simultaneously. Our work is open-sourced at https://github.com/Oryx-mllm/Oryx.</p></details> |  |
| **[Finite time analysis of temporal difference learning with linear function approximation: Tail averaging and regularisation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.05918v3)** | 2024-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the finite-time behaviour of the popular temporal difference (TD) learning algorithm when combined with tail-averaging. We derive finite time bounds on the parameter error of the tail-averaged TD iterate under a step-size choice that does not require information about the eigenvalues of the matrix underlying the projected TD fixed point. Our analysis shows that tail-averaged TD converges at the optimal $O\left(1/t\right)$ rate, both in expectation and with high probability. In addition, our bounds exhibit a sharper rate of decay for the initial error (bias), which is an improvement over averaging all iterates. We also propose and analyse a variant of TD that incorporates regularisation. From analysis, we conclude that the regularised version of TD is useful for problems with ill-conditioned features.</p></details> |  |

Until recent years, numerous models had been proposed, ranging from classical algorithms like Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) to deep learning models such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transformers. However, these models have shown limitations in areas such as generalizability, contextuality and scalability when it comes to effectively extracting the complex spatial-temporal information inherent in electroencephalography (EEG) signals. To address these limitations, we introduce Spatial-Temporal Mamba Network (STMambaNet), an innovative model leveraging the Mamba state space architecture, which excels in processing extended sequences with linear scalability. By incorporating spatial and temporal Mamba encoders, STMambaNet effectively captures the intricate dynamics in both space and time, significantly enhancing the decoding performance of EEG signals for MI classification. Experimental results on BCI Competition IV 2a and 2b datasets demonstrate STMambaNet's superiority over existing models, establishing it as a powerful tool for advancing MI-based BCIs and improving real-world BCI systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages,3 figures, accepted conference:ADMA2024</p></details> |

By embedding more modalities into end-to-end networks, the system's understanding of both static and dynamic aspects of the driving environment is enhanced, thereby improving the safety of autonomous driving. In this paper, we introduce METDrive, an end-to-end system that leverages temporal guidance from the embedded time series features of ego states, including rotation angles, steering, throttle signals, and waypoint vectors. The geometric features derived from perception sensor data and the time series features of ego state data jointly guide the waypoint prediction with the proposed temporal guidance loss function. We evaluated METDrive on the CARLA leaderboard's Longest6 benchmark, achieving a driving score of 70%, a route completion score of 94%, and an infraction score of 0.78.</p></details> |  |
| **[Forbidden Patterns in Temporal Graphs Resulting from Encounters in a Corridor](http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.07666v2)** | 2024-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we study temporal graphs arising from mobility models, where vertices correspond to agents moving in space and edges appear each time two agents meet. We propose a rather natural one-dimensional model. If each pair of agents meets exactly once, we get a simple temporal clique where the edges are ordered according to meeting times. In order to characterize which temporal cliques can be obtained as such `mobility graphs', we introduce the notion of forbidden patterns in temporal graphs. Furthermore, using a classical result in combinatorics, we count the number of such mobility cliques for a given number of agents, and show that not every temporal clique resulting from the 1D model can be realized with agents moving with different constant speeds. For the analogous circular problem, where agents are moving along a circle, we provide a characterization via circular forbidden patterns. Our characterization in terms of forbidden patterns can be extended to the case where each edge appears at most once. We also study the problem where pairs of agents are allowed to cross each other several times, using an approach from automata theory. We observe that in this case, there is no finite set of forbidden patterns that characterize such temporal graphs and nevertheless give a linear-time algorithm to recognize temporal graphs arising from this model.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hybrid Ensemble Deep Graph Temporal Clustering for Spatiotemporal Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12590v1)** | 2024-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Classifying subsets based on spatial and temporal features is crucial to the analysis of spatiotemporal data given the inherent spatial and temporal variability. Since no single clustering algorithm ensures optimal results, researchers have increasingly explored the effectiveness of ensemble approaches. Ensemble clustering has attracted much attention due to increased diversity, better generalization, and overall improved clustering performance. While ensemble clustering may yield promising results on simple datasets, it has not been fully explored on complex multivariate spatiotemporal data. For our contribution to this field, we propose a novel hybrid ensemble deep graph temporal clustering (HEDGTC) method for multivariate spatiotemporal data. HEDGTC integrates homogeneous and heterogeneous ensemble methods and adopts a dual consensus approach to address noise and misclassification from traditional clustering. It further applies a graph attention autoencoder network to improve clustering performance and stability. When evaluated on three real-world multivariate spatiotemporal data, HEDGTC outperforms state-of-the-art ensemble clustering models by showing improved performance and stability with consistent results. This indicates that HEDGTC can effectively capture implicit temporal patterns in complex spatiotemporal data.</p></details> | 10 pages |

Despite the tremendous advantages, neural networks are susceptible to adversarial attacks. To improve the reliability of NIDS, many research has been conducted and plenty of solutions have been proposed. However, the existing solutions rarely consider the adversarial attacks against recurrent neural networks (RNN) with time steps, which would greatly affect the application of NIDS in real world. Therefore, we first propose a novel RNN adversarial attack model based on feature reconstruction called \textbf{T}emporal adversarial \textbf{E}xamples \textbf{A}ttack \textbf{M}odel \textbf{(TEAM)}, which applied to time series data and reveals the potential connection between adversarial and time steps in RNN. That is, the past adversarial examples within the same time steps can trigger further attacks on current or future original examples. Moreover, TEAM leverages Time Dilation (TD) to effectively mitigates the effect of temporal among adversarial examples within the same time steps. Experimental results show that in most attack categories, TEAM improves the misjudgment rate of NIDS on both black and white boxes, making the misjudgment rate reach more than 96.68%. Meanwhile, the maximum increase in the misjudgment rate of the NIDS for subsequent original samples exceeds 95.57%.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose FoME (Foundation Model for EEG), a novel approach using adaptive temporal-lateral attention scaling to address above-mentioned challenges. FoME is pre-trained on a diverse 1.7TB dataset of scalp and intracranial EEG recordings, comprising 745M parameters trained for 1,096k steps. Our model introduces two key innovations: a time-frequency fusion embedding technique and an adaptive time-lateral attention scaling (ATLAS) mechanism. These components synergistically capture complex temporal and spectral EEG dynamics, enabling FoME to adapt to varying patterns across diverse data streams and facilitate robust multi-channel modeling. Evaluations across four downstream tasks demonstrate FoME's superior performance in classification and forecasting applications, consistently achieving state-of-the-art results. To conclude, FoME establishes a new paradigm for EEG analysis, offering a versatile foundation that advances brain-computer interfaces, clinical diagnostics, and cognitive research across neuroscience and related fields.

| **[TempBEV: Improving Learned BEV Encoders with Combined Image and BEV Space Temporal Aggregation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11803v2)** | 2024-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous driving requires an accurate representation of the environment. A strategy toward high accuracy is to fuse data from several sensors. Learned Bird's-Eye View (BEV) encoders can achieve this by mapping data from individual sensors into one joint latent space. For cost-efficient camera-only systems, this provides an effective mechanism to fuse data from multiple cameras with different views. Accuracy can further be improved by aggregating sensor information over time. This is especially important in monocular camera systems to account for the lack of explicit depth and velocity measurements. Thereby, the effectiveness of developed BEV encoders crucially depends on the operators used to aggregate temporal information and on the used latent representation spaces. We analyze BEV encoders proposed in the literature and compare their effectiveness, quantifying the effects of aggregation operators and latent representations. While most existing approaches aggregate temporal information either in image or in BEV latent space, our analyses and performance comparisons suggest that these latent representations exhibit complementary strengths. Therefore, we develop a novel temporal BEV encoder, TempBEV, which integrates aggregated temporal information from both latent spaces. We consider subsequent image frames as stereo through time and leverage methods from optical flow estimation for temporal stereo encoding. Empirical evaluation on the NuScenes dataset shows a significant improvement by TempBEV over the baseline for 3D object detection and BEV segmentation. The ablation uncovers a strong synergy of joint temporal aggregation in the image and BEV latent space. These results indicate the overall effectiveness of our approach and make a strong case for aggregating temporal information in both image and BEV latent spaces.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for 2024 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS 2024)</p></details> |

While recent time-domain deep neural network (DNN)-based declippers have outperformed traditional handcrafted and spectrogram-based DNN approaches, they still struggle with low-SDR inputs. To address this, we incorporate a transformer-based architecture that operates in the time-frequency (TF) domain. The TF-transformer architecture has demonstrated remarkable performance in the speech enhancement task for low-SDR signals but cannot be optimal for the time-domain artifact like clipping. To overcome the limitations of spectrogram-based DNNs, we design an extra convolutional block that directly extracts temporal features from time-domain waveforms. The joint analysis of complex spectrogram and learned temporal features allows the model to improve performance on both high- and low-SDR inputs. Our approach also preserves the unclipped portions of the speech signal during processing, preventing degradation typically seen when only spectral information is used. In evaluations on the VoiceBank-DEMAND and DNS challenge datasets, the proposed model consistently outperformed state-of-the-art (SOTA) declipping models across various metrics, demonstrating its robustness and generalizability.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 2 figures, submitted to ICASSP 2024</p></details> |
| **[Almost Sure Convergence of Linear Temporal Difference Learning with Arbitrary Features](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12135v1)** | 2024-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal difference (TD) learning with linear function approximation, abbreviated as linear TD, is a classic and powerful prediction algorithm in reinforcement learning. While it is well understood that linear TD converges almost surely to a unique point, this convergence traditionally requires the assumption that the features used by the approximator are linearly independent. However, this linear independence assumption does not hold in many practical scenarios. This work is the first to establish the almost sure convergence of linear TD without requiring linearly independent features. In fact, we do not make any assumptions on the features. We prove that the approximated value function converges to a unique point and the weight iterates converge to a set. We also establish a notion of local stability of the weight iterates. Importantly, we do not need to introduce any other additional assumptions and do not need to make any modification to the linear TD algorithm. Key to our analysis is a novel characterization of bounded invariant sets of the mean ODE of linear TD.</p></details> | 30 pages, 0 figures |

However, acquiring diverse food items under varying conditions and generalizing to unseen food presents unique challenges. Existing methods that rely on surface-level geometric information (e.g., bounding box and pose) derived from visual cues (e.g., color, shape, and texture) often lacks adaptability and robustness, especially when foods share similar physical properties but differ in visual appearance. We employ imitation learning (IL) to learn a policy for food acquisition. Existing methods employ IL or Reinforcement Learning (RL) to learn a policy based on off-the-shelf image encoders such as ResNet-50. However, such representations are not robust and struggle to generalize across diverse acquisition scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach, IMRL (Integrated Multi-Dimensional Representation Learning), which integrates visual, physical, temporal, and geometric representations to enhance the robustness and generalizability of IL for food acquisition. Our approach captures food types and physical properties (e.g., solid, semi-solid, granular, liquid, and mixture), models temporal dynamics of acquisition actions, and introduces geometric information to determine optimal scooping points and assess bowl fullness. IMRL enables IL to adaptively adjust scooping strategies based on context, improving the robot's capability to handle diverse food acquisition scenarios. Experiments on a real robot demonstrate our approach's robustness and adaptability across various foods and bowl configurations, including zero-shot generalization to unseen settings. Our approach achieves improvement up to $35\%$ in success rate compared with the best-performing baseline.</p></details> |  |

However, present methodology relies on algorithms that separate document and word representations. This prevents the creation of a meaningful embedding space where changes in word usage and documents can be directly analyzed in a temporal context. This paper proposes an expansion of the compass-aligned temporal Word2Vec methodology into dynamic topic modeling. Such a method allows for the direct comparison of word and document embeddings across time in dynamic topics. This enables the creation of visualizations that incorporate temporal word embeddings within the context of documents into topic visualizations. In experiments against the current state-of-the-art, our proposed method demonstrates overall competitive performance in topic relevancy and diversity across temporal datasets of varying size. Simultaneously, it provides insightful visualizations focused on temporal word embeddings while maintaining the insights provided by global topic evolution, advancing our understanding of how topics evolve over time.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 9 figures, conference paper</p></details> |

Traditional rPPG models often struggle with poor generalization capacity in unseen domains. Current solutions to this problem is to improve its generalization in the target domain through Domain Generalization (DG) or Domain Adaptation (DA). However, both traditional methods require access to both source domain data and target domain data, which cannot be implemented in scenarios with limited access to source data, and another issue is the privacy of accessing source domain data. In this paper, we propose the first Source-free Domain Adaptation benchmark for rPPG measurement (SFDA-rPPG), which overcomes these limitations by enabling effective domain adaptation without access to source domain data. Our framework incorporates a Three-Branch Spatio-Temporal Consistency Network (TSTC-Net) to enhance feature consistency across domains. Furthermore, we propose a new rPPG distribution alignment loss based on the Frequency-domain Wasserstein Distance (FWD), which leverages optimal transport to align power spectrum distributions across domains effectively and further enforces the alignment of the three branches. Extensive cross-domain experiments and ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method in source-free domain adaptation settings. Our findings highlight the significant contribution of the proposed FWD loss for distributional alignment, providing a valuable reference for future research and applications.

Previous deep learning based rPPG measurement are primarily based on CNNs and Transformers. However, the limited receptive fields of CNNs restrict their ability to capture long-range spatio-temporal dependencies, while Transformers also struggle with modeling long video sequences with high complexity. Recently, the state space models (SSMs) represented by Mamba are known for their impressive performance on capturing long-range dependencies from long sequences. In this paper, we propose the PhysMamba, a Mamba-based framework, to efficiently represent long-range physiological dependencies from facial videos. Specifically, we introduce the Temporal Difference Mamba block to first enhance local dynamic differences and further model the long-range spatio-temporal context. Moreover, a dual-stream SlowFast architecture is utilized to fuse the multi-scale temporal features.

| **[Location based Probabilistic Load Forecasting of EV Charging Sites: Deep Transfer Learning with Multi-Quantile Temporal Convolutional Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11862v1)** | 2024-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Electrification of vehicles is a potential way of reducing fossil fuel usage and thus lessening environmental pollution. Electric Vehicles (EVs) of various types for different transport modes (including air, water, and land) are evolving. Moreover, different EV user groups (commuters, commercial or domestic users, drivers) may use different charging infrastructures (public, private, home, and workplace) at various times. Therefore, usage patterns and energy demand are very stochastic. Characterizing and forecasting the charging demand of these diverse EV usage profiles is essential in preventing power outages. Previously developed data-driven load models are limited to specific use cases and locations. None of these models are simultaneously adaptive enough to transfer knowledge of day-ahead forecasting among EV charging sites of diverse locations, trained with limited data, and cost-effective. This article presents a location-based load forecasting of EV charging sites using a deep Multi-Quantile Temporal Convolutional Network (MQ-TCN) to overcome the limitations of earlier models. We conducted our experiments on data from four charging sites, namely Caltech, JPL, Office-1, and NREL, which have diverse EV user types like students, full-time and part-time employees, random visitors, etc. With a Prediction Interval Coverage Probability (PICP) score of 93.62\%, our proposed deep MQ-TCN model exhibited a remarkable 28.93\% improvement over the XGBoost model for a day-ahead load forecasting at the JPL charging site. By transferring knowledge with the inductive Transfer Learning (TL) approach, the MQ-TCN model achieved a 96.88\% PICP score for the load forecasting task at the NREL site using only two weeks of data.</p></details> | 11 pages, 10 figures |

Alongside the widely used U-Net architecture, transformer-based models such as the Diffusion Transformer (DiT) have also gained attention. However, current DiT speech models treat Mel spectrograms as general images, which overlooks the specific acoustic properties of speech. To address these limitations, we propose a method called Directional Patch Interaction for Text-to-Speech (DPI-TTS), which builds on DiT and achieves fast training without compromising accuracy. Notably, DPI-TTS employs a low-to-high frequency, frame-by-frame progressive inference approach that aligns more closely with acoustic properties, enhancing the naturalness of the generated speech. Additionally, we introduce a fine-grained style temporal modeling method that further improves speaker style similarity. Experimental results demonstrate that our method increases the training speed by nearly 2 times and significantly outperforms the baseline models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ICASSP2025</p></details> |
| **[Retrofitting Temporal Graph Neural Networks with Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05477v3)** | 2024-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal graph neural networks (TGNNs) outperform regular GNNs by incorporating time information into graph-based operations. However, TGNNs adopt specialized models (e.g., TGN, TGAT, and APAN ) and require tailored training frameworks (e.g., TGL and ETC). In this paper, we propose TF-TGN, which uses Transformer decoder as the backbone model for TGNN to enjoy Transformer's codebase for efficient training. In particular, Transformer achieves tremendous success for language modeling, and thus the community developed high-performance kernels (e.g., flash-attention and memory-efficient attention) and efficient distributed training schemes (e.g., PyTorch FSDP, DeepSpeed, and Megatron-LM). We observe that TGNN resembles language modeling, i.e., the message aggregation operation between chronologically occurring nodes and their temporal neighbors in TGNNs can be structured as sequence modeling. Beside this similarity, we also incorporate a series of algorithm designs including suffix infilling, temporal graph attention with self-loop, and causal masking self-attention to make TF-TGN work. During training, existing systems are slow in transforming the graph topology and conducting graph sampling. As such, we propose methods to parallelize the CSR format conversion and graph sampling. We also adapt Transformer codebase to train TF-TGN efficiently with multiple GPUs. We experiment with 9 graphs and compare with 2 state-of-the-art TGNN training frameworks. The results show that TF-TGN can accelerate training by over 2.20 while providing comparable or even superior accuracy to existing SOTA TGNNs. TF-TGN is available at https://github.com/qianghuangwhu/TF-TGN.</p></details> | <details><summary>confe...</summary><p>conference Under review</p></details> |

However, the community faces challenges such as data deficiency and limited diversity, often resulting in over-fitting and inadequate feature learning. Notably, the exploration of data augmentation techniques in the event community remains scarce. This work aims to address this gap by introducing a systematic augmentation scheme named EventAug to enrich spatial-temporal diversity. In particular, we first propose Multi-scale Temporal Integration (MSTI) to diversify the motion speed of objects, then introduce Spatial-salient Event Mask (SSEM) and Temporal-salient Event Mask (TSEM) to enrich object variants. Our EventAug can facilitate models learning with richer motion patterns, object variants and local spatio-temporal relations, thus improving model robustness to varied moving speeds, occlusions, and action disruptions. Experiment results show that our augmentation method consistently yields significant improvements across different tasks and backbones (e.g., a 4.87% accuracy gain on DVS128 Gesture). Our code will be publicly available for this community.</p></details> |  |

By combining text classification and dynamic social network analysis, we uncover mechanisms driving community formation and evolution, revealing the influence of real-world events. We introduced fourteen key elements based on social science theories to evaluate social media dynamics, validating our framework through a case study of Twitter data during major U.S. events in 2020. Our analysis centers on discrimination discourse, identifying sexism, racism, xenophobia, ableism, homophobia, and religious intolerance as main fragments. Results demonstrate rapid community emergence and dissolution cycles representative of discourse fragments. We reveal how real-world circumstances impact discourse dominance and how social media contributes to echo chamber formation and societal polarization. Our comprehensive approach provides insights into discourse fragmentation, opinion dynamics, and structural aspects of online communities, offering a methodology for understanding the complex interplay between online interactions and societal trends.</p></details> |  |

The proposed model can simplify the parameterization by using network structure in data, and can capture the asymmetric property in dynamic volatility by adopting a threshold structure. The proposed model assumes the conditional distribution is Poisson distribution. Asymptotic theory of maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) for the spatial model is derived when both sample size and network dimension are large. We obtain asymptotic statistical inferences via investigation of the weak dependence of components of the model and application of limit theorems for weakly dependent random fields. Simulation studies and a real data example are presented to support our methodology.</p></details> |  |
| **[SEDMamba: Enhancing Selective State Space Modelling with Bottleneck Mechanism and Fine-to-Coarse Temporal Fusion for Efficient Error Detection in Robot-Assisted Surgery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15920v3)** | 2024-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated detection of surgical errors can improve robotic-assisted surgery. Despite promising progress, existing methods still face challenges in capturing rich temporal context to establish long-term dependencies while maintaining computational efficiency. In this paper, we propose a novel hierarchical model named SEDMamba, which incorporates the selective state space model (SSM) into surgical error detection, facilitating efficient long sequence modelling with linear complexity. SEDMamba enhances selective SSM with a bottleneck mechanism and fine-to-coarse temporal fusion (FCTF) to detect and temporally localize surgical errors in long videos. The bottleneck mechanism compresses and restores features within their spatial dimension, thereby reducing computational complexity. FCTF utilizes multiple dilated 1D convolutional layers to merge temporal information across diverse scale ranges, accommodating errors of varying duration. Our work also contributes the first-of-its-kind, frame-level, in-vivo surgical error dataset to support error detection in real surgical cases. Specifically, we deploy the clinically validated observational clinical human reliability assessment tool (OCHRA) to annotate the errors during suturing tasks in an open-source radical prostatectomy dataset (SAR-RARP50). Experimental results demonstrate that our SEDMamba outperforms state-of-the-art methods with at least 1.82% AUC and 3.80% AP performance gains with significantly reduced computational complexity. The corresponding error annotations, code and models will be released at https://github.com/wzjialang/SEDMamba.</p></details> | 8 pages |

Understanding environmental dynamics is challenging, not only due to the complexities of modeling pair-wise spatial and temporal interactions but also the diverse influence of group-wise interactions. To decode the comprehensive pair-wise and group-wise interactions in crowded scenarios, we introduce Hyper-STTN, a Hypergraph-based Spatial-Temporal Transformer Network for crowd trajectory prediction. In Hyper-STTN, crowded group-wise correlations are constructed using a set of multi-scale hypergraphs with varying group sizes, captured through random-walk robability-based hypergraph spectral convolution. Additionally, a spatial-temporal transformer is adapted to capture pedestrians' pair-wise latent interactions in spatial-temporal dimensions. These heterogeneous group-wise and pair-wise are then fused and aligned though a multimodal transformer network. Hyper-STTN outperformes other state-of-the-art baselines and ablation models on 5 real-world pedestrian motion datasets.</p></details> |  |

Load imbalance is one performance issue that can prejudice parallel applications from exploiting the computational power of these platforms. Ondes3D is a scientific application for seismic wave simulation used to assess the geological impact of earthquakes. Its parallelism relies on applying a regular domain decomposition in the geological domain provided and distributing each sub-domain to MPI ranks. Previous works investigate the significant spatial and temporal imbalance in Ondes3D and suggest new parallelization and load balancing techniques to minimize them. However, none explored its execution on different architectures. Our paper evaluates the performance of Ondes3D for two earthquake scenarios on eight different multicore architectures, including Intel, AMD, and ARM processors. We measure the load distribution per MPI rank, evaluate the temporal load imbalance, and compare the execution of the application's kernels. Our results show that the temporal load imbalance in Ondes3D depends on the architecture chosen, with some platforms minimizing such imbalance more effectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>The 2...</summary><p>The 2020 International Conference on High Performance Computing and Simulation (HPCS 2020)</p></details> |

However, the challenge of acquiring paired videos for dynamic scenes hampers the practical deployment of deep video denoising techniques. In contrast, this obstacle is less pronounced in image denoising, where paired data is more readily available. Thus, a well-trained image denoiser could serve as a reliable spatial prior for video denoising. In this paper, we propose a novel unsupervised video denoising framework, named ``Temporal As a Plugin'' (TAP), which integrates tunable temporal modules into a pre-trained image denoiser. By incorporating temporal modules, our method can harness temporal information across noisy frames, complementing its power of spatial denoising. Furthermore, we introduce a progressive fine-tuning strategy that refines each temporal module using the generated pseudo clean video frames, progressively enhancing the network's denoising performance. Compared to other unsupervised video denoising methods, our framework demonstrates superior performance on both sRGB and raw video denoising datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[STCMOT: Spatio-Temporal Cohesion Learning for UAV-Based Multiple Object Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11234v1)** | 2024-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiple object tracking (MOT) in Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) videos is important for diverse applications in computer vision. Current MOT trackers rely on accurate object detection results and precise matching of target reidentification (ReID). These methods focus on optimizing target spatial attributes while overlooking temporal cues in modelling object relationships, especially for challenging tracking conditions such as object deformation and blurring, etc. To address the above-mentioned issues, we propose a novel Spatio-Temporal Cohesion Multiple Object Tracking framework (STCMOT), which utilizes historical embedding features to model the representation of ReID and detection features in a sequential order. Concretely, a temporal embedding boosting module is introduced to enhance the discriminability of individual embedding based on adjacent frame cooperation. While the trajectory embedding is then propagated by a temporal detection refinement module to mine salient target locations in the temporal field. Extensive experiments on the VisDrone2019 and UAVDT datasets demonstrate our STCMOT sets a new state-of-the-art performance in MOTA and IDF1 metrics.

This paper presents a registry-based, multi-layer and temporal network of the entire Danish population in the years 2008-2021 (roughly 7.2 mill. individuals). Our network maps the relationships formed through family, households, neighborhoods, colleagues and classmates. We outline key properties of this multiplex network, introducing both an individual-focused perspective as well as a bipartite representation. We show how to aggregate and combine the layers, and how to efficiently compute network measures such as shortest paths in large administrative networks. Our analysis reveals how past connections reappear later in other layers, that the number of relationships aggregated over time reflects the position in the income distribution, and that we can recover canonical shortest path length distributions when appropriately weighting connections. Along with the network data, we release a Python package that uses the bipartite network representation for efficient analysis.</p></details> |  |

This critical issue, rooted in the inherent complexity of both DNNs and underlying spatio-temporal patterns in the graph, calls for innovative solutions. While interpretability concerns in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) mirror those of DNNs, to the best of our knowledge, no notable work has addressed the interpretability of temporal GNNs using a combination of Information Bottleneck (IB) principles and prototype-based methods. Our research introduces a novel approach that uniquely integrates these techniques to enhance the interpretability of temporal graph regression models. The key contributions of our work are threefold: We introduce the \underline{G}raph \underline{IN}terpretability in \underline{T}emporal \underline{R}egression task using \underline{I}nformation bottleneck and \underline{P}rototype (GINTRIP) framework, the first combined application of IB and prototype-based methods for interpretable temporal graph tasks. We derive a novel theoretical bound on mutual information (MI), extending the applicability of IB principles to graph regression tasks. We incorporate an unsupervised auxiliary classification head, fostering multi-task learning and diverse concept representation, which enhances the model bottleneck's interpretability. Our model is evaluated on real-world traffic datasets, outperforming existing methods in both forecasting accuracy and interpretability-related metrics.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication.

| **[A Joint Spectro-Temporal Relational Thinking Based Acoustic Modeling Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15357v1)** | 2024-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Relational thinking refers to the inherent ability of humans to form mental impressions about relations between sensory signals and prior knowledge, and subsequently incorporate them into their model of their world. Despite the crucial role relational thinking plays in human understanding of speech, it has yet to be leveraged in any artificial speech recognition systems. Recently, there have been some attempts to correct this oversight, but these have been limited to coarse utterance-level models that operate exclusively in the time domain. In an attempt to narrow the gap between artificial systems and human abilities, this paper presents a novel spectro-temporal relational thinking based acoustic modeling framework. Specifically, it first generates numerous probabilistic graphs to model the relationships among speech segments across both time and frequency domains. The relational information rooted in every pair of nodes within these graphs is then aggregated and embedded into latent representations that can be utilized by downstream tasks. Models built upon this framework outperform state-of-the-art systems with a 7.82\% improvement in phoneme recognition tasks over the TIMIT dataset. In-depth analyses further reveal that our proposed relational thinking modeling mainly improves the model's ability to recognize vowels, which are the most likely to be confused by phoneme recognizers.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatio-Temporal-Network Point Processes for Modeling Crime Events with Landmarks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10882v1)** | 2024-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-exciting point processes are widely used to model the contagious effects of crime events living within continuous geographic space, using their occurrence time and locations. However, in urban environments, most events are naturally constrained within the city's street network structure, and the contagious effects of crime are governed by such a network geography. Meanwhile, the complex distribution of urban infrastructures also plays an important role in shaping crime patterns across space. We introduce a novel spatio-temporal-network point process framework for crime modeling that integrates these urban environmental characteristics by incorporating self-attention graph neural networks. Our framework incorporates the street network structure as the underlying event space, where crime events can occur at random locations on the network edges. To realistically capture criminal movement patterns, distances between events are measured using street network distances. We then propose a new mark for a crime event by concatenating the event's crime category with the type of its nearby landmark, aiming to capture how the urban design influences the mixing structures of various crime types. A graph attention network architecture is adopted to learn the existence of mark-to-mark interactions. Extensive experiments on crime data from Valencia, Spain, demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in understanding the crime landscape and forecasting crime risks across regions.</p></details> |  |

Safety verification is now an imminent task prior to the large-scale deployment of such convoluted models. For safety-critical tasks in navigation, it becomes imperative to perform a verification procedure on the trajectories proposed by the planning algorithm prior to deployment. Signal Temporal Logic (STL) constraints can dictate the safety requirements for an AV. A combination of STL constraints is called a specification. A key difference between STL and other logic constraints is that STL allows us to work on continuous signals. We verify the satisfaction of the STL specifications by calculating the robustness value for each signal within the specification. Higher robustness values indicate a safer system. Model Predictive Control (MPC) is one of the most widely used methods to control the navigation of an AV, with an underlying set of state and input constraints. Our research aims to formulate and test an MPC controller, with STL specifications as constraints, that can safely navigate an AV. The primary goal of the cost function is to minimize the control inputs. STL constraints will act as an additional layer of constraints that would change based on the scenario and task on hand. We propose using sTaliro, a MATLAB-based robustness calculator for STL specifications, formulated in a receding horizon control fashion for an AV navigation task. It inputs a simplified AV state space model and a set of STL specifications, for which it constructs a closed-loop controller. We test out our controller for different test cases/scenarios and verify the safe navigation of our AV model.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 3 figures, SAE WCX 2023 Conference</p></details> |

While limiting the variety of training data can make training easier, it can also lead to a lack of knowledge and information for the model, resulting in a decrease in performance. To address this challenge, we presented an innovative paradigm that incorporates three separate forms of curriculum learning specifically targeting from spatial, temporal, and quantile perspectives. Furthermore, our framework incorporates a stacking fusion module to combine diverse information from three types of curriculum learning, resulting in a strong and thorough learning process. We demonstrated the effectiveness of this framework with extensive empirical evaluations, highlighting its better performance in addressing complex ST challenges. We provided thorough ablation studies to investigate the effectiveness of our curriculum and to explain how it contributes to the improvement of learning efficiency on ST data.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accept by sigspatial 2024</p></details> |

The diffusion model, recognized for its superior quality and robust generalization, has been explored for this task. However, establishing a robust correspondence between temporal audio cues and corresponding spatial facial expressions with diffusion models remains a significant challenge in talking head generation. To bridge this gap, we present DreamHead, a hierarchical diffusion framework that learns spatial-temporal correspondences in talking head synthesis without compromising the model's intrinsic quality and adaptability.~DreamHead learns to predict dense facial landmarks from audios as intermediate signals to model the spatial and temporal correspondences.~Specifically, a first hierarchy of audio-to-landmark diffusion is first designed to predict temporally smooth and accurate landmark sequences given audio sequence signals. Then, a second hierarchy of landmark-to-image diffusion is further proposed to produce spatially consistent facial portrait videos, by modeling spatial correspondences between the dense facial landmark and appearance. Extensive experiments show that proposed DreamHead can effectively learn spatial-temporal consistency with the designed hierarchical diffusion and produce high-fidelity audio-driven talking head videos for multiple identities.</p></details> |  |

By decomposing the dynamics into deterministic and error components, we construct a probabilistic reachable tube (PRT) as the Cartesian product of reachable sets of the individual error systems driven by disturbances lying in confidence regions (CRs) with a fixed probability. By bounding the PRT probability with the specification probability, we tighten all state constraints induced by the STL specification by solving tractable optimization problems over segments of the PRT, and relax the underlying stochastic problem with a deterministic one. This approach reduces conservatism compared to tightening guided by the STL structure. Additionally, we propose a recursively feasible algorithm to attack the resulting problem by decomposing it into agent-level subproblems, which are solved iteratively according to a scheduling policy. We demonstrate our method on a ten-agent system, where existing approaches are impractical.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for presentation to CDC24</p></details> |

This paper proposes a novel risk metric to facilitate the driving task specified by linear temporal logic (LTL) by balancing the risk brought up by different uncertain events. Such a balance is achieved by discounting the costs of these uncertain events according to their timing and severity, thereby reflecting a human-like awareness of risk. We have established a connection between this risk metric and the occupation measure, a fundamental concept in stochastic reachability problems, such that a risk-aware control synthesis problem under LTL specifications is formulated for autonomous vehicles using occupation measures. As a result, the synthesized policy achieves balanced decisions across different types of risks with associated costs, showcasing advantageous versatility and generalizability. The effectiveness and scalability of the proposed approach are validated by three typical traffic scenarios in Carla simulator.</p></details> |  |

The analysis of micro-expressions generally involves two main tasks: spotting micro-expression intervals in long videos and recognizing the emotions associated with these intervals. Previous deep learning methods have primarily relied on classification networks utilizing sliding windows. However, fixed window sizes and window-level hard classification introduce numerous constraints. Additionally, these methods have not fully exploited the potential of complementary pathways for spotting and recognition. In this paper, we present a novel temporal state transition architecture grounded in the state space model, which replaces conventional window-level classification with video-level regression. Furthermore, by leveraging the inherent connections between spotting and recognition tasks, we propose a synergistic strategy that enhances overall analysis performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance. The codes and pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/zizheng-guo/ME-TST.</p></details> |  |
| **[Triadic Temporal Exponential Random Graph Models (TTERGM)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.16229v2)** | 2024-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal exponential random graph models (TERGM) are powerful statistical models that can be used to infer the temporal pattern of edge formation and elimination in complex networks (e.g., social networks). TERGMs can also be used in a generative capacity to predict longitudinal time series data in these evolving graphs. However, parameter estimation within this framework fails to capture many real-world properties of social networks, including: triadic relationships, small world characteristics, and social learning theories which could be used to constrain the probabilistic estimation of dyadic covariates. Here, we propose triadic temporal exponential random graph models (TTERGM) to fill this void, which includes these hierarchical network relationships within the graph model. We represent social network learning theory as an additional probability distribution that optimizes Markov chains in the graph vector space. The new parameters are then approximated via Monte Carlo maximum likelihood estimation. We show that our TTERGM model achieves improved fidelity and more accurate predictions compared to several benchmark methods on GitHub network data.</p></details> |  |
| **[LACOSTE: Exploiting stereo and temporal contexts for surgical instrument segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09360v1)** | 2024-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Surgical instrument segmentation is instrumental to minimally invasive surgeries and related applications. Most previous methods formulate this task as single-frame-based instance segmentation while ignoring the natural temporal and stereo attributes of a surgical video. As a result, these methods are less robust against the appearance variation through temporal motion and view change. In this work, we propose a novel LACOSTE model that exploits Location-Agnostic COntexts in Stereo and TEmporal images for improved surgical instrument segmentation. Leveraging a query-based segmentation model as core, we design three performance-enhancing modules. Firstly, we design a disparity-guided feature propagation module to enhance depth-aware features explicitly. To generalize well for even only a monocular video, we apply a pseudo stereo scheme to generate complementary right images. Secondly, we propose a stereo-temporal set classifier, which aggregates stereo-temporal contexts in a universal way for making a consolidated prediction and mitigates transient failures. Finally, we propose a location-agnostic classifier to decouple the location bias from mask prediction and enhance the feature semantics. We extensively validate our approach on three public surgical video datasets, including two benchmarks from EndoVis Challenges and one real radical prostatectomy surgery dataset GraSP. Experimental results demonstrate the promising performances of our method, which consistently achieves comparable or favorable results with previous state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint submitted to Medical Image Analysis</p></details> |

In practical environments with noise-corrupted audio, the role of video information becomes crucial. However, prior works have primarily focused on enhancing audio features in AVSR, overlooking the importance of video features. In this study, we strengthen the video features by learning three temporal dynamics in video data: context order, playback direction, and the speed of video frames. Cross-modal attention modules are introduced to enrich video features with audio information so that speech variability can be taken into account when training on the video temporal dynamics. Based on our approach, we achieve the state-of-the-art performance on the LRS2 and LRS3 AVSR benchmarks for the noise-dominant settings. Our approach excels in scenarios especially for babble and speech noise, indicating the ability to distinguish the speech signal that should be recognized from lip movements in the video modality. We support the validity of our methodology by offering the ablation experiments for the temporal dynamics losses and the cross-modal attention architecture design.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at SLT 2024 Main Conference</p></details> |

We present Capability-Augmenting Tasks (CATs), which encode how agents can augment their capabilities based on interactions with other teammates. Our framework integrates CAT into the semantics of Metric Temporal Logic (MTL), which defines individual spatio-temporal tasks for all agents. A centralized Mixed-Integer Program (MIP) is used to synthesize trajectories for all agents. We compare the expressivity of our approach to a baseline of Capability Temporal Logic Plus (CaTL+).

Integrating Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) with enhanced MEC networks can leverage the high mobility of UAVs to flexibly adjust network topology, further expanding the applicability of MEC. However, in highly dynamic and complex real-world environments, it is crucial to balance task offloading effectiveness with algorithm performance. This paper investigates a multi-UAV communication network equipped with edge computing nodes to assist terminal users in task computation. Our goal is to reduce the task processing delay for users through the joint optimization of discrete computation modes, continuous 3D trajectories, and resource assignment. To address the challenges posed by the mixed action space, we propose a Multi-UAV Edge Computing Resource Scheduling (MUECRS) algorithm, which comprises two key components: 1) trajectory optimization, and 2) computation mode and resource management. Experimental results demonstrate our method effectively designs the 3D flight trajectories of UAVs, enabling rapid terminal coverage. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm achieves efficient resource deployment and scheduling, outperforming comparative algorithms by at least 16.7%, demonstrating superior adaptability and robustness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generative Modeling of Molecular Dynamics Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17808v1)** | 2024-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Molecular dynamics (MD) is a powerful technique for studying microscopic phenomena, but its computational cost has driven significant interest in the development of deep learning-based surrogate models. We introduce generative modeling of molecular trajectories as a paradigm for learning flexible multi-task surrogate models of MD from data. By conditioning on appropriately chosen frames of the trajectory, we show such generative models can be adapted to diverse tasks such as forward simulation, transition path sampling, and trajectory upsampling. By alternatively conditioning on part of the molecular system and inpainting the rest, we also demonstrate the first steps towards dynamics-conditioned molecular design. We validate the full set of these capabilities on tetrapeptide simulations and show that our model can produce reasonable ensembles of protein monomers. Altogether, our work illustrates how generative modeling can unlock value from MD data towards diverse downstream tasks that are not straightforward to address with existing methods or even MD itself.

Current state-of-the-art motion prediction methods rely on High Definition (HD) maps for capturing the surrounding context of the ego vehicle. Such systems lack scalability in real-world deployment as HD maps are expensive to produce and update in real-time. To overcome this issue, we propose Context Aware Scene Prediction Transformer (CASPFormer), which can perform multi-modal motion prediction from rasterized Bird-Eye-View (BEV) images. Our system can be integrated with any upstream perception module that is capable of generating BEV images. Moreover, CASPFormer directly decodes vectorized trajectories without any postprocessing. Trajectories are decoded recurrently using deformable attention, as it is computationally efficient and provides the network with the ability to focus its attention on the important spatial locations of the BEV images. In addition, we also address the issue of mode collapse for generating multiple scene-consistent trajectories by incorporating learnable mode queries. We evaluate our model on the nuScenes dataset and show that it reaches state-of-the-art across multiple metrics</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under Review at ICPR 2024, Kolkata</p></details> |
| **[Computation Pre-Offloading for MEC-Enabled Vehicular Networks via Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17681v1)** | 2024-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Task offloading is of paramount importance to efficiently orchestrate vehicular wireless networks, necessitating the availability of information regarding the current network status and computational resources. However, due to the mobility of the vehicles and the limited computational resources for performing task offloading in near-real-time, such schemes may require high latency, thus, become even infeasible. To address this issue, in this paper, we present a Trajectory Prediction-based Pre-offloading Decision (TPPD) algorithm for analyzing the historical trajectories of vehicles to predict their future coordinates, thereby allowing for computational resource allocation in advance. We first utilize the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network model to predict each vehicle's movement trajectory. Then, based on the task requirements and the predicted trajectories, we devise a dynamic resource allocation algorithm using a Double Deep Q-Network (DDQN) that enables the edge server to minimize task processing delay, while ensuring effective utilization of the available computational resources. Our simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach, showcasing that, as compared with traditional real-time task offloading strategies, the proposed TPPD algorithm significantly reduces task processing delay while improving resource utilization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Data-efficient Trajectory Prediction via Coreset Selection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17385v1)** | 2024-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern vehicles are equipped with multiple information-collection devices such as sensors and cameras, continuously generating a large volume of raw data. Accurately predicting the trajectories of neighboring vehicles is a vital component in understanding the complex driving environment. Yet, training trajectory prediction models is challenging in two ways. Processing the large-scale data is computation-intensive. Moreover, easy-medium driving scenarios often overwhelmingly dominate the dataset, leaving challenging driving scenarios such as dense traffic under-represented. For example, in the Argoverse motion prediction dataset, there are very few instances with $\ge 50$ agents, while scenarios with $10 \thicksim 20$ agents are far more common. In this paper, to mitigate data redundancy in the over-represented driving scenarios and to reduce the bias rooted in the data scarcity of complex ones, we propose a novel data-efficient training method based on coreset selection. This method strategically selects a small but representative subset of data while balancing the proportions of different scenario difficulties. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to introduce a method capable of effectively condensing large-scale trajectory dataset, while achieving a state-of-the-art compression ratio. Notably, even when using only 50% of the Argoverse dataset, the model can be trained with little to no decline in performance. Moreover, the selected coreset maintains excellent generalization ability.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose a data-driven learning framework, that leverages the predictive and feature extraction capabilities of the mixture models and seq2seq-based neural networks while addressing prevalent challenges caused by error propagation and dimensionality reduction. After training with this framework, the learned model can improve long-step prediction accuracy significantly given the past trajectories and the context information. The accuracy and effectiveness of the approach are evaluated by comparing the predicted trajectories with the ground truth. The results indicate that the proposed method has outperformed the state-of-the-art predicting methods on a terminal airspace flight trajectory dataset. The trajectories generated by the proposed method have a higher temporal resolution(1 timestep per second vs 0.1 timestep per second) and are closer to the ground truth.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to AIAA-JAIS</p></details> |
| **[Building Real-time Awareness of Out-of-distribution in Trajectory Prediction for Autonomous Vehicles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17277v1)** | 2024-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction describes the motions of surrounding moving obstacles for an autonomous vehicle; it plays a crucial role in enabling timely decision-making, such as collision avoidance and trajectory replanning. Accurate trajectory planning is the key to reliable vehicle deployments in open-world environment, where unstructured obstacles bring in uncertainties that are impossible to fully capture by training data. For traditional machine learning tasks, such uncertainties are often addressed reasonably well via methods such as continual learning. On the one hand, naively applying those methods to trajectory prediction can result in continuous data collection and frequent model updates, which can be resource-intensive. On the other hand, the predicted trajectories can be far away from the true trajectories, leading to unsafe decision-making. In this paper, we aim to establish real-time awareness of out-of-distribution in trajectory prediction for autonomous vehicles. We focus on the challenging and practically relevant setting where the out-of-distribution is deceptive, that is, the one not easily detectable by human intuition. Drawing on the well-established techniques of sequential analysis, we build real-time awareness of out-of-distribution by monitoring prediction errors using the quickest change point detection (QCD). Our solutions are lightweight and can handle the occurrence of out-of-distribution at any time during trajectory prediction inference. Experimental results on multiple real-world datasets using a benchmark trajectory prediction model demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[TFT-multi: simultaneous forecasting of vital sign trajectories in the ICU](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15586v2)** | 2024-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory forecasting in healthcare data has been an important area of research in precision care and clinical integration for computational methods. In recent years, generative AI models have demonstrated promising results in capturing short and long range dependencies in time series data. While these models have also been applied in healthcare, most of them only predict one value at a time, which is unrealistic in a clinical setting where multiple measures are taken at once. In this work, we extend the framework temporal fusion transformer (TFT), a multi-horizon time series prediction tool, and propose TFT-multi, an end-to-end framework that can predict multiple vital trajectories simultaneously. We apply TFT-multi to forecast 5 vital signs recorded in the intensive care unit: blood pressure, pulse, SpO2, temperature and respiratory rate. We hypothesize that by jointly predicting these measures, which are often correlated with one another, we can make more accurate predictions, especially in variables with large missingness. We validate our model on the public MIMIC dataset and an independent institutional dataset, and demonstrate that this approach outperforms state-of-the-art univariate prediction tools including the original TFT and Prophet, as well as vector regression modeling for multivariate prediction. Furthermore, we perform a study case analysis by applying our pipeline to forecast blood pressure changes in response to actual and hypothetical pressor administration.</p></details> |  |
| **[Let's Make a Splan: Risk-Aware Trajectory Optimization in a Normalized Gaussian Splat](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16915v1)** | 2024-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural Radiance Fields and Gaussian Splatting have transformed the field of computer vision by enabling photo-realistic representation of complex scenes. Despite this success, they have seen only limited use in real-world robotics tasks such as trajectory optimization. Two key factors have contributed to this limited success. First, it is challenging to reason about collisions in radiance models. Second, it is difficult to perform inference of radiance models fast enough for real-time trajectory synthesis. This paper addresses these challenges by proposing SPLANNING, a risk-aware trajectory optimizer that operates in a Gaussian Splatting model. This paper first derives a method for rigorously upper-bounding the probability of collision between a robot and a radiance field. Second, this paper introduces a normalized reformulation of Gaussian Splatting that enables the efficient computation of the collision bound in a Gaussian Splat. Third, a method is presented to optimize trajectories while avoiding collisions with a scene represented by a Gaussian Splat. Experiments demonstrate that SPLANNING outperforms state-of-the-art methods in generating collision-free trajectories in highly cluttered environments. The proposed system is also tested on a real-world robot manipulator.

| **[Historical Trajectory Assisted Zeroth-Order Federated Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15955v2)** | 2024-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated learning is a distributed learning framework which enables clients to train models individually and to upload their model updates for aggregation. The local training process heavily relies on distributed gradient descent techniques. In the situation where gradient information is not available, the gradients need to be estimated from zeroth-order information, which typically involves computing finite-differences along isotropic random directions. This method suffers from high estimation errors, as the geometric features of the objective landscape may be overlooked during the isotropic sampling. In this work, we propose a non-isotropic sampling method to improve the gradient estimation procedure. Gradients in our method are estimated in a subspace spanned by historical trajectories of solutions, aiming to encourage the exploration of promising regions and hence improve the convergence. We implement this method in zeroth-order federated settings, and show that the convergence rate aligns with existing ones while introducing no significant overheads in communication or local computation. The effectiveness of our proposal is verified on several numerical experiments in comparison to several commonly-used zeroth-order federated optimization algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages with theoretical proof</p></details> |
| **[Goal-based Neural Physics Vehicle Trajectory Prediction Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15182v2)** | 2024-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vehicle trajectory prediction plays a vital role in intelligent transportation systems and autonomous driving, as it significantly affects vehicle behavior planning and control, thereby influencing traffic safety and efficiency. Numerous studies have been conducted to predict short-term vehicle trajectories in the immediate future. However, long-term trajectory prediction remains a major challenge due to accumulated errors and uncertainties. Additionally, balancing accuracy with interpretability in the prediction is another challenging issue in predicting vehicle trajectory. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a Goal-based Neural Physics Vehicle Trajectory Prediction Model (GNP). The GNP model simplifies vehicle trajectory prediction into a two-stage process: determining the vehicle's goal and then choosing the appropriate trajectory to reach this goal. The GNP model contains two sub-modules to achieve this process. The first sub-module employs a multi-head attention mechanism to accurately predict goals. The second sub-module integrates a deep learning model with a physics-based social force model to progressively predict the complete trajectory using the generated goals. The GNP demonstrates state-of-the-art long-term prediction accuracy compared to four baseline models. We provide interpretable visualization results to highlight the multi-modality and inherent nature of our neural physics framework. Additionally, ablation studies are performed to validate the effectiveness of our key designs.</p></details> |  |

However, calibrating stereo vision systems that incorporate both event and frame-based cameras remains a significant challenge. In this letter, we present EF-Calib, a spatiotemporal calibration framework for event- and frame-based cameras using continuous-time trajectories. A novel calibration pattern applicable to both camera types and the corresponding event recognition algorithm is proposed. Leveraging the asynchronous nature of events, a derivable piece-wise B-spline to represent camera pose continuously is introduced, enabling calibration for intrinsic parameters, extrinsic parameters, and time offset, with analytical Jacobians provided. Various experiments are carried out to evaluate the calibration performance of EF-Calib, including calibration experiments for intrinsic parameters, extrinsic parameters, and time offset. Experimental results show that EF-Calib achieves the most accurate intrinsic parameters compared to current SOTA, the close accuracy of the extrinsic parameters compared to the frame-based results, and accurate time offset estimation. EF-Calib provides a convenient and accurate toolbox for calibrating the system that fuses events and frames.

Recent score distillation methods distill a heavy teacher model into a student generator to achieve one-step generation, which is optimized by calculating the difference between the two score functions on the samples generated by the student model. However, there is a score mismatch issue in the early stage of the distillation process, because existing methods mainly focus on using the endpoint of pre-trained diffusion models as teacher models, overlooking the importance of the convergence trajectory between the student generator and the teacher model. To address this issue, we extend the score distillation process by introducing the entire convergence trajectory of teacher models and propose Distribution Backtracking Distillation (DisBack). DisBask is composed of two stages: Degradation Recording and Distribution Backtracking. Degradation Recording is designed to obtain the convergence trajectory of the teacher model, which records the degradation path from the trained teacher model to the untrained initial student generator. The degradation path implicitly represents the teacher model's intermediate distributions, and its reverse can be viewed as the convergence trajectory from the student generator to the teacher model. Then Distribution Backtracking trains a student generator to backtrack the intermediate distributions along the path to approximate the convergence trajectory of teacher models. Extensive experiments show that DisBack achieves faster and better convergence than the existing distillation method and accomplishes comparable generation performance, with FID score of 1.38 on ImageNet 64x64 dataset. Notably, DisBack is easy to implement and can be generalized to existing distillation methods to boost performance. Our code is publicly available on https://github.com/SYZhang0805/DisBack.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://github.com/SYZhang0805/DisBack</p></details> |
| **[Surrogate Modeling of Trajectory Map-matching in Urban Road Networks using Transformer Sequence-to-Sequence Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12460v2)** | 2024-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-scale geolocation telematics data acquired from connected vehicles has the potential to significantly enhance mobility infrastructures and operational systems within smart cities. To effectively utilize this data, it is essential to accurately match the geolocation data to the road segments. However, this matching is often not trivial due to the low sampling rate and errors exacerbated by multipath effects in urban environments. Traditionally, statistical modeling techniques such as Hidden-Markov models incorporating domain knowledge into the matching process have been extensively used for map-matching tasks. However, rule-based map-matching tasks are noise-sensitive and inefficient in processing large-scale trajectory data. Deep learning techniques directly learn the relationship between observed data and road networks from the data, often without the need for hand-crafted rules or domain knowledge. This renders them an efficient approach for map-matching large-scale datasets and more robust to the noise. This paper introduces a deep-learning model, specifically the transformer-based encoder-decoder model, to perform as a surrogate for offline map-matching algorithms. The encoder-decoder architecture initially encodes the series of noisy GPS points into a representation that automatically captures autoregressive behavior and spatial correlations between GPS points. Subsequently, the decoder associates data points with the road network features and thus transforms these representations into a sequence of road segments. The model is trained and evaluated using GPS traces collected in Manhattan, New York. Achieving an accuracy of 75%, transformer-based encoder-decoder models extensively employed in natural language processing presented a promising performance for translating noisy GPS data to the navigated routes in urban road networks.</p></details> | 15 pages, 10 figures |

However, it is challenging for aircraft to sustain efficient air-ground communication in urban circumstances. Without continuous air-ground communication, aircraft may experience course deviation and safety accidents. To address these problems, a reconfigurable intelligent surface(RIS)-aided trajectory optimization scheme is proposed enabling efficient air-ground communication and safe aviation in UAM with a layered airspace structure. This paper first devises a dual-plane RIS communication scheme for layered airspace. It fully engages the omnidirectional and directional signal attributes to reduce the transmission delay of the air-ground communication. Based on the dual-plane RIS configuration, we jointly develop the intra- and inter-layer trajectory scheme to optimize communication and safe aviation. In the intra-layer trajectory optimization, we propose a dual-time-scale flight scheme to improve communication capacity and horizontal flight safety. Meanwhile, we propose a safe layer-switching method to ensure collision avoidance during vertical flight in the inter-layer trajectory optimization. The communication load of the proposed scheme can be improved 40% and the time of safe separation restoration can be lessened 66% compared with the benchmarks in the layered airspace.</p></details> | 15 pages, 13 figures |
| **[Real-time Planning of Minimum-time Trajectories for Agile UAV Flight](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16074v1)** | 2024-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We address the challenge of real-time planning of minimum-time trajectories over multiple waypoints, onboard multirotor UAVs. Previous works demonstrated that achieving a truly time-optimal trajectory is computationally too demanding to enable frequent replanning during agile flight, especially on less powerful flight computers. Our approach overcomes this stumbling block by utilizing a point-mass model with a novel iterative thrust decomposition algorithm, enabling the UAV to use all of its collective thrust, something previous point-mass approaches could not achieve. The approach enables gravity and drag modeling integration, significantly reducing tracking errors in high-speed trajectories, which is proven through an ablation study. When combined with a new multi-waypoint optimization algorithm, which uses a gradient-based method to converge to optimal velocities in waypoints, the proposed method generates minimum-time multi-waypoint trajectories within milliseconds. The proposed approach, which we provide as open-source package, is validated both in simulation and in real-world, using Nonlinear Model Predictive Control. With accelerations of up to 3.5g and speeds over 100 km/h, trajectories generated by the proposed method yield similar or even smaller tracking errors than the trajectories generated for a full multirotor model.</p></details> |  |

In complex traffic scenarios, there are two significant issues with the current autonomous driving system: the cognitive uncertainty of prediction and the lack of risk awareness, which limit the further development of autonomous driving. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel trajectory prediction model that incorporates insights and principles from driving behavior, ethical decision-making, and risk assessment. Based on joint prediction, our model consists of interaction, intention, and risk assessment modules. The dynamic variation of interaction between vehicles can be comprehensively captured at each timestamp in the interaction module. Based on interaction information, our model considers primary intentions for vehicles to enhance the diversity of trajectory generation. The optimization of predicted trajectories follows the advanced risk-aware decision-making principles. Experimental results are evaluated on the DeepAccident dataset; our approach shows its remarkable prediction performance on normal and accident scenarios and outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms by at least 28.9\% and 26.5\%, respectively. The proposed model improves the proficiency and adaptability of trajectory prediction in complex traffic scenarios.

| **[Enhancing Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction with Crowd Trip Information](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15224v1)** | 2024-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pedestrian trajectory prediction is essential for various applications in active traffic management, urban planning, traffic control, crowd management, and autonomous driving, aiming to enhance traffic safety and efficiency. Accurately predicting pedestrian trajectories requires a deep understanding of individual behaviors, social interactions, and road environments. Existing studies have developed various models to capture the influence of social interactions and road conditions on pedestrian trajectories. However, these approaches are limited by the lack of a comprehensive view of social interactions and road environments. To address these limitations and enhance the accuracy of pedestrian trajectory prediction, we propose a novel approach incorporating trip information as a new modality into pedestrian trajectory models. We propose RNTransformer, a generic model that utilizes crowd trip information to capture global information on social interactions. We incorporated RNTransformer with various socially aware local pedestrian trajectory prediction models to demonstrate its performance. Specifically, by leveraging a pre-trained RNTransformer when training different pedestrian trajectory prediction models, we observed improvements in performance metrics: a 1.3/2.2% enhancement in ADE/FDE on Social-LSTM, a 6.5/28.4% improvement on Social-STGCNN, and an 8.6/4.3% improvement on S-Implicit. Evaluation results demonstrate that RNTransformer significantly enhances the accuracy of various pedestrian trajectory prediction models across multiple datasets. Further investigation reveals that the RNTransformer effectively guides local models to more accurate directions due to the consideration of global information. By exploring crowd behavior within the road network, our approach shows great promise in improving pedestrian safety through accurate trajectory predictions.</p></details> |  |
| **[SocialCircle+: Learning the Angle-based Conditioned Interaction Representation for Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14984v1)** | 2024-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction is a crucial aspect of understanding human behaviors. Researchers have made efforts to represent socially interactive behaviors among pedestrians and utilize various networks to enhance prediction capability. Unfortunately, they still face challenges not only in fully explaining and measuring how these interactive behaviors work to modify trajectories but also in modeling pedestrians' preferences to plan or participate in social interactions in response to the changeable physical environments as extra conditions. This manuscript mainly focuses on the above explainability and conditionality requirements for trajectory prediction networks. Inspired by marine animals perceiving other companions and the environment underwater by echolocation, this work constructs an angle-based conditioned social interaction representation SocialCircle+ to represent the socially interactive context and its corresponding conditions. It employs a social branch and a conditional branch to describe how pedestrians are positioned in prediction scenes socially and physically in angle-based-cyclic-sequence forms. Then, adaptive fusion is applied to fuse the above conditional clues onto the social ones to learn the final interaction representation. Experiments demonstrate the superiority of SocialCircle+ with different trajectory prediction backbones. Moreover, counterfactual interventions have been made to simultaneously verify the modeling capacity of causalities among interactive variables and the conditioning capability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Demystifying Trajectory Recovery From Ash: An Open-Source Evaluation and Enhancement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14645v1)** | 2024-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Once analysed, location trajectories can provide valuable insights beneficial to various applications. However, such data is also highly sensitive, rendering them susceptible to privacy risks in the event of mismanagement, for example, revealing an individual's identity, home address, or political affiliations. Hence, ensuring that privacy is preserved for this data is a priority. One commonly taken measure to mitigate this concern is aggregation. Previous work by Xu et al. shows that trajectories are still recoverable from anonymised and aggregated datasets. However, the study lacks implementation details, obfuscating the mechanisms of the attack. Additionally, the attack was evaluated on commercial non-public datasets, rendering the results and subsequent claims unverifiable. This study reimplements the trajectory recovery attack from scratch and evaluates it on two open-source datasets, detailing the preprocessing steps and implementation. Results confirm that privacy leakage still exists despite common anonymisation and aggregation methods but also indicate that the initial accuracy claims may have been overly ambitious. We release all code as open-source to ensure the results are entirely reproducible and, therefore, verifiable. Moreover, we propose a stronger attack by designing a series of enhancements to the baseline attack. These enhancements yield higher accuracies by up to 16%, providing an improved benchmark for future research in trajectory recovery methods. Our improvements also enable online execution of the attack, allowing partial attacks on larger datasets previously considered unprocessable, thereby furthering the extent of privacy leakage.

Chronic wound treatment is currently a manual process, and we envision a future where robotics and automation will aid in this treatment to reduce cost and improve patient care. In this work, we present the development of the first robotic system for wound dressing removal which is reported to be the worst aspect of living with chronic wounds. Our method leverages differentiable physics-based simulation to perform gradient-based Model Predictive Control (MPC) for optimized trajectory planning. By integrating fracture mechanics of adhesion, we are able to model the peeling effect inherent to dressing adhesion. The system is further guided by carefully designed objective functions that promote both efficient and safe control, reducing the risk of tissue damage. We validated the efficacy of our approach through a series of experiments conducted on both synthetic skin phantoms and real human subjects. Our results demonstrate the system's ability to achieve precise and safe dressing removal trajectories, offering a promising solution for automating this essential healthcare procedure.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ICRA 2025</p></details> |
| **[Addressing and Visualizing Misalignments in Human Task-Solving Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14191v1)** | 2024-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The effectiveness of AI model training hinges on the quality of the trajectory data used, particularly in aligning the model's decision with human intentions. However, in the human task-solving trajectories, we observe significant misalignments between human intentions and the recorded trajectories, which can undermine AI model training. This paper addresses the challenges of these misalignments by proposing a visualization tool and a heuristic algorithm designed to detect and categorize discrepancies in trajectory data. Although the heuristic algorithm requires a set of predefined human intentions to function, which we currently cannot extract, the visualization tool offers valuable insights into the nature of these misalignments. We expect that eliminating these misalignments could significantly improve the utility of trajectory data for AI model training. We also propose that future work should focus on developing methods, such as Topic Modeling, to accurately extract human intentions from trajectory data, thereby enhancing the alignment between user actions and AI learning processes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Single-Trajectory Distributionally Robust Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.11721v2)** | 2024-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To mitigate the limitation that the classical reinforcement learning (RL) framework heavily relies on identical training and test environments, Distributionally Robust RL (DRRL) has been proposed to enhance performance across a range of environments, possibly including unknown test environments. As a price for robustness gain, DRRL involves optimizing over a set of distributions, which is inherently more challenging than optimizing over a fixed distribution in the non-robust case. Existing DRRL algorithms are either model-based or fail to learn from a single sample trajectory. In this paper, we design a first fully model-free DRRL algorithm, called distributionally robust Q-learning with single trajectory (DRQ). We delicately design a multi-timescale framework to fully utilize each incrementally arriving sample and directly learn the optimal distributionally robust policy without modelling the environment, thus the algorithm can be trained along a single trajectory in a model-free fashion. Despite the algorithm's complexity, we provide asymptotic convergence guarantees by generalizing classical stochastic approximation tools. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate the superior robustness and sample complexity of our proposed algorithm, compared to non-robust methods and other robust RL algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>First...</summary><p>First two authors contribute equally</p></details> |
| **[Integrated Decision Making and Trajectory Planning for Autonomous Driving Under Multimodal Uncertainties: A Bayesian Game Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13993v1)** | 2024-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modeling the interaction between traffic agents is a key issue in designing safe and non-conservative maneuvers in autonomous driving. This problem can be challenging when multi-modality and behavioral uncertainties are engaged. Existing methods either fail to plan interactively or consider unimodal behaviors that could lead to catastrophic results. In this paper, we introduce an integrated decision-making and trajectory planning framework based on Bayesian game (i.e., game of incomplete information). Human decisions inherently exhibit discrete characteristics and therefore are modeled as types of players in the game. A general solver based on no-regret learning is introduced to obtain a corresponding Bayesian Coarse Correlated Equilibrium, which captures the interaction between traffic agents in the multimodal context. With the attained equilibrium, decision-making and trajectory planning are performed simultaneously, and the resulting interactive strategy is shown to be optimal over the expectation of rivals' driving intentions. Closed-loop simulations on different traffic scenarios are performed to illustrate the generalizability and the effectiveness of the proposed framework.</p></details> |  |
| **[Chauhan Weighted Trajectory Analysis of combined efficacy and safety outcomes for risk-benefit analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13946v1)** | 2024-09-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Analyzing and effectively communicating the efficacy and toxicity of treatment is the basis of risk benefit analysis (RBA). More efficient and objective tools are needed. We apply Chauhan Weighted Trajectory Analysis (CWTA) to perform RBA with superior objectivity, power, and clarity. We used CWTA to perform 1000-fold simulations of RCTs using ordinal endpoints for both treatment efficacy and toxicity. RCTs were simulated with 1:1 allocation at defined sample sizes and hazard ratios. We studied the simplest case of 3 levels each of toxicity and efficacy and the general case of the advanced cancer trial, with efficacy graded by five RECIST 1.1 health statuses and toxicity by the six-point CTCAE scale (6 x 5 matrix). The latter model was applied to a real-world dose escalation phase I trial in advanced cancer. Simulations in both the 3 x 3 and the 6 x 5 advanced cancer matrix confirmed that drugs with both superior efficacy and toxicity profiles synergize for greater statistical power with CWTA-RBA. The CWTA-RBA 6 x 5 matrix reduced sample size requirements over CWTA efficacy-only analysis. Application to the dose finding phase I clinical trial provided objective, statistically significant validation for the selected dose. CWTA-RBA, by incorporating both drug efficacy and toxicity, provides a single test statistic and plot that analyzes and effectively communicates therapeutic risks and benefits. CWTA-RBA requires fewer patients than CWTA efficacy-only analysis when the experimental drug is both more effective and less toxic. CWTA-RBA facilitates the objective and efficient assessment of new therapies throughout the drug development pathway. Furthermore, several advantages over competing tests in communicating risk-benefit will assist regulatory review, clinical adoption, and understanding of therapeutic risks and benefits by clinicians and patients alike.</p></details> |  |
| **[CUQDS: Conformal Uncertainty Quantification under Distribution Shift for Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12100v2)** | 2024-09-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction models that can infer both finite future trajectories and their associated uncertainties of the target vehicles in an online setting (e.g., real-world application scenarios) is crucial for ensuring the safe and robust navigation and path planning of autonomous vehicle motion. However, the majority of existing trajectory prediction models have neither considered reducing the uncertainty as one objective during the training stage nor provided reliable uncertainty quantification during inference stage under potential distribution shift. Therefore, in this paper, we propose the Conformal Uncertainty Quantification under Distribution Shift framework, CUQDS, to quantify the uncertainty of the predicted trajectories of existing trajectory prediction models under potential data distribution shift, while considering improving the prediction accuracy of the models and reducing the estimated uncertainty during the training stage. Specifically, CUQDS includes 1) a learning-based Gaussian process regression module that models the output distribution of the base model (any existing trajectory prediction or time series forecasting neural networks) and reduces the estimated uncertainty by additional loss term, and 2) a statistical-based Conformal P control module to calibrate the estimated uncertainty from the Gaussian process regression module in an online setting under potential distribution shift between training and testing data.</p></details> | 9 pages, 2 figures |

The joint angles, the tool orientations and the manufacturing time-sequences are optimized simultaneously on input trajectories with large numbers of waypoints to improve the kinematic smoothness while incorporating the manufacturing constraints. Differently, existing methods always determine them in a decoupled manner. To deal with the large number of waypoints on a toolpath, we propose a decomposition based numerical scheme to optimize the trajectory in an out-of-core manner which can also run in parallel to improve the efficiency. Simulations and physical experiments have been conducted to demonstrate the performance of our method in examples of robot-assisted additive manufacturing.</p></details> |  |
| **[Revisiting Synthetic Human Trajectories: Imitative Generation and Benchmarks Beyond Datasaurus](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13790v1)** | 2024-09-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human trajectory data, which plays a crucial role in various applications such as crowd management and epidemic prevention, is challenging to obtain due to practical constraints and privacy concerns. In this context, synthetic human trajectory data is generated to simulate as close as possible to real-world human trajectories, often under summary statistics and distributional similarities. However, the complexity of human mobility patterns is oversimplified by these similarities (a.k.a. ``Datasaurus''), resulting in intrinsic biases in both generative model design and benchmarks of the generated trajectories. Against this background, we propose MIRAGE, a huMan-Imitative tRAjectory GenErative model designed as a neural Temporal Point Process integrating an Exploration and Preferential Return model. It imitates the human decision-making process in trajectory generation, rather than fitting any specific statistical distributions as traditional methods do, thus avoiding the Datasaurus issue. Moreover, we also propose a comprehensive task-based evaluation protocol beyond Datasaurus to systematically benchmark trajectory generative models on four typical downstream tasks, integrating multiple techniques and evaluation metrics for each task, to comprehensively assess the ultimate utility of the generated trajectories. We conduct a thorough evaluation of MIRAGE on three real-world user trajectory datasets against a sizeable collection of baselines. Results show that compared to the best baselines, MIRAGE-generated trajectory data not only achieves the best statistical and distributional similarities with 59.0-71.5% improvement, but also yields the best performance in the task-based evaluation with 10.9-33.4% improvement.</p></details> |  |
| **[TISIS : Trajectory Indexing for SImilarity Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11301v2)** | 2024-09-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Social media platforms enable users to share diverse types of information, including geolocation data that captures their movement patterns. Such geolocation data can be leveraged to reconstruct the trajectory of a user's visited Points of Interest (POIs). A key requirement in numerous applications is the ability to measure the similarity between such trajectories, as this facilitates the retrieval of trajectories that are similar to a given reference trajectory. This is the main focus of our work. Existing methods predominantly rely on applying a similarity function to each candidate trajectory to identify those that are sufficiently similar. However, this approach becomes computationally expensive when dealing with large-scale datasets. To mitigate this challenge, we propose TISIS, an efficient method that uses trajectory indexing to quickly find similar trajectories that share common POIs in the same order. Furthermore, to account for scenarios where POIs in trajectories may not exactly match but are contextually similar, we introduce TISIS*, a variant of TISIS that incorporates POI embeddings. This extension allows for more comprehensive retrieval of similar trajectories by considering semantic similarities between POIs, beyond mere exact matches. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly outperforms a baseline method based on the well-known Longest Common SubSequence (LCSS) algorithm, yielding substantial performance improvements across various real-world datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Velocity Field: An Informative Traveling Cost Representation for Trajectory Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13282v1)** | 2024-09-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory planning involves generating a series of space points to be followed in the near future. However, due to the complex and uncertain nature of the driving environment, it is impractical for autonomous vehicles~(AVs) to exhaustively design planning rules for optimizing future trajectories. To address this issue, we propose a local map representation method called Velocity Field. This approach provides heading and velocity priors for trajectory planning tasks, simplifying the planning process in complex urban driving. The heading and velocity priors can be learned from demonstrations of human drivers using our proposed loss. Additionally, we developed an iterative sampling-based planner to train and compare the differences between local map representations. We investigated local map representation forms for planning performance on a real-world dataset. Compared to learned rasterized cost maps, our method demonstrated greater reliability and computational efficiency.</p></details> | ROBIO 2023 |

However, dynamic MRI faces a major challenge: long acquisition times needed to achieve high spatial and temporal resolution. This leads to higher costs, patient discomfort, motion artifacts, and lower image quality. Compressed Sensing (CS) addresses this problem by acquiring a reduced amount of MR data in the Fourier domain, based on a chosen sampling pattern, and reconstructing the full image from this partial data. While various deep learning methods have been developed to optimize these sampling patterns and improve reconstruction, they often struggle with slow optimization and inference times or are limited to specific temporal dimensions used during training. In this work, we introduce a novel deep-compressed sensing approach that uses 3D window attention and flexible, temporally extendable acquisition trajectories. Our method significantly reduces both training and inference times compared to existing approaches, while also adapting to different temporal dimensions during inference without requiring additional training. Tests with real data show that our approach outperforms current state-of-theart techniques. The code for reproducing all experiments will be made available upon acceptance of the paper.</p></details> |  |
| **[Probabilistically Robust Trajectory Planning of Multiple Aerial Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12718v1)** | 2024-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current research on robust trajectory planning for autonomous agents aims to mitigate uncertainties arising from disturbances and modeling errors while ensuring guaranteed safety. Existing methods primarily utilize stochastic optimal control techniques with chance constraints to maintain a minimum distance among agents with a guaranteed probability. However, these approaches face challenges, such as the use of simplifying assumptions that result in linear system models or Gaussian disturbances, which limit their practicality in complex realistic scenarios. To address these limitations, this work introduces a novel probabilistically robust distributed controller enabling autonomous agents to plan safe trajectories, even under non-Gaussian uncertainty and nonlinear systems. Leveraging exact uncertainty propagation techniques based on mixed-trigonometric-polynomial moment propagation, this method transforms non-Gaussian chance constraints into deterministic ones, seamlessly integrating them into a distributed model predictive control framework solvable with standard optimization tools. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of this technique, highlighting its ability to consistently handle various types of uncertainty, ensuring robust and accurate path planning in complex scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>18th ...</summary><p>18th International Conference on Control, Automation, Robotics and Vision (ICARCV 2024)</p></details> |

Arguably, the maritime domain lags behind, as ships operate on many more degrees of freedom (thus, a much larger search space): there is less physical infrastructure, and rules are less consistent and constraining than what is found on roads. The problem is further complicated by the inevitable co-existence of autonomous and human-operated ships: the latter may take unpredictable decisions, which require adjustments on the autonomous ones. Finally, the problem is inherently decentralised, there is no central authority, and communication means can be very diverse in terms of communication distance and performance, mandating special care on which information is shared and how. In this work, we elaborate on the challenges of trajectory prediction and adaptation for mixed autonomous and human-operated ships, and we propose initial ideas on potential approaches to address them.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to SISSY 2024</p></details> |

As opposed to the standard method of uniformly sampling control inputs (which lead to biased samples of the configuration space), C-Uniform trajectories are generated by control actions which lead to uniform sampling of the configuration space. After presenting an intuitive closed-form solution to generate C-Uniform trajectories for the 1D random-walker, we present a network-flow based optimization method to precompute C-Uniform trajectories for general robot systems. We apply the notion of C-Uniformity to the design of Model Predictive Path Integral controllers. Through simulation experiments, we show that using C-Uniform trajectories significantly improves the performance of MPPI-style controllers, achieving up to 40% coverage performance gain compared to the best baseline. We demonstrate the practical applicability of our method with an implementation on a 1/10th scale racer.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory Anomaly Detection with Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15366v1)** | 2024-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a novel approach for trajectory anomaly detection using an autoregressive causal-attention model, termed LM-TAD. This method leverages the similarities between language statements and trajectories, both of which consist of ordered elements requiring coherence through external rules and contextual variations. By treating trajectories as sequences of tokens, our model learns the probability distributions over trajectories, enabling the identification of anomalous locations with high precision. We incorporate user-specific tokens to account for individual behavior patterns, enhancing anomaly detection tailored to user context. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of LM-TAD on both synthetic and real-world datasets. In particular, the model outperforms existing methods on the Pattern of Life (PoL) dataset by detecting user-contextual anomalies and achieves competitive results on the Porto taxi dataset, highlighting its adaptability and robustness. Additionally, we introduce the use of perplexity and surprisal rate metrics for detecting outliers and pinpointing specific anomalous locations within trajectories. The LM-TAD framework supports various trajectory representations, including GPS coordinates, staypoints, and activity types, proving its versatility in handling diverse trajectory data. Moreover, our approach is well-suited for online trajectory anomaly detection, significantly reducing computational latency by caching key-value states of the attention mechanism, thereby avoiding repeated computations.</p></details> |  |

This paper presents a novel trajectory-guided approach, the Patch Intensity Convergence (PIC) technique, which generates high-fidelity bounding boxes for UAV detection without manual labeling. This technique forms the foundation of UAVDB, a dedicated database designed specifically for UAV detection. Unlike datasets that often focus on large UAVs or simple backgrounds, UAVDB utilizes high-resolution RGB video to capture UAVs at various scales, from hundreds of pixels to near-single-digit sizes. This extensive scale variation enables robust evaluation of detection algorithms under diverse conditions. Using the PIC technique, bounding boxes can be efficiently generated from trajectory or position data. We benchmark UAVDB using state-of-the-art (SOTA) YOLO series detectors, providing a comprehensive performance analysis. Our results demonstrate UAVDB's potential as a critical resource for advancing UAV detection, particularly in high-resolution and long-distance tracking scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

However, this task is generally nontrivial due to the inherent stochasticity of human motion, which naturally requires the predictor to generate multi-modal prediction. Previous works leverage various generative methods, such as GAN and VAE, for pedestrian trajectory prediction. Nevertheless, these methods may suffer from mode collapse and relatively low-quality results. The denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) has recently been applied to trajectory prediction due to its simple training process and powerful reconstruction ability. However, current diffusion-based methods do not fully utilize input information and usually require many denoising iterations that lead to a long inference time or an additional network for initialization. To address these challenges and facilitate the use of diffusion models in multi-modal trajectory prediction, we propose GDTS, a novel Goal-Guided Diffusion Model with Tree Sampling for multi-modal trajectory prediction. Considering the "goal-driven" characteristics of human motion, GDTS leverages goal estimation to guide the generation of the diffusion network. A two-stage tree sampling algorithm is presented, which leverages common features to reduce the inference time and improve accuracy for multi-modal prediction. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed framework achieves comparable state-of-the-art performance with real-time inference speed in public datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ICRA 2025</p></details> |

In the existing literatures, All-Wheel-Steering (AWS) robots, incorporating modes such as rotation-free translation maneuvers, in-situ rotational maneuvers, and proportional steering, exhibit inefficient performance due to time-consuming mode switches. This inefficiency arises from wheel rotation constraints and inter-wheel cooperation requirements. The direct application of a holonomic moving strategy can lead to significant slip angles or even structural failure. Additionally, the limited steering range of AWS wheeled robots exacerbates non-linearity characteristics, thereby complicating control processes. To address these challenges, we developed a novel planning method termed Constrained AWS (C-AWS), which integrates second-order discrete search with predictive control techniques. Experimental results demonstrate that our method adeptly generates feasible and smooth trajectories for C-AWS while adhering to steering angle constraints.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by iROS 2024</p></details> |

Understanding environmental dynamics is challenging, not only due to the complexities of modeling pair-wise spatial and temporal interactions but also the diverse influence of group-wise interactions. To decode the comprehensive pair-wise and group-wise interactions in crowded scenarios, we introduce Hyper-STTN, a Hypergraph-based Spatial-Temporal Transformer Network for crowd trajectory prediction. In Hyper-STTN, crowded group-wise correlations are constructed using a set of multi-scale hypergraphs with varying group sizes, captured through random-walk robability-based hypergraph spectral convolution. Additionally, a spatial-temporal transformer is adapted to capture pedestrians' pair-wise latent interactions in spatial-temporal dimensions. These heterogeneous group-wise and pair-wise are then fused and aligned though a multimodal transformer network. Hyper-STTN outperformes other state-of-the-art baselines and ablation models on 5 real-world pedestrian motion datasets.</p></details> |  |

In particular, reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise in the synthesis of controllers for systems with complex dynamics and modest online compute budgets. However, the poor sample efficiency of RL and the challenges of reward design make training slow and sometimes unstable, especially for high-dimensional systems. In this work, we leverage the inherent Lie group symmetries of robotic systems with a floating base to mitigate these challenges when learning tracking controllers. We model a general tracking problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) that captures the evolution of both the physical and reference states. Next, we prove that symmetry in the underlying dynamics and running costs leads to an MDP homomorphism, a mapping that allows a policy trained on a lower-dimensional "quotient" MDP to be lifted to an optimal tracking controller for the original system. We compare this symmetry-informed approach to an unstructured baseline, using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to learn tracking controllers for three systems: the Particle (a forced point mass), the Astrobee (a fullyactuated space robot), and the Quadrotor (an underactuated system). Results show that a symmetry-aware approach both accelerates training and reduces tracking error after the same number of training steps.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The first three authors contributed equally to this work</p></details> |

Pseudo-labeling approaches to semi-supervised learning adopt a teacher-student framework in which machine-generated pseudo-labels on a large unlabeled dataset are used in combination with a small manually-labeled dataset for training. In this work, we address the problem of improving pseudo-label quality through leveraging long-term temporal information captured in driving scenes. More specifically, we leverage pre-trained motion-forecasting models to generate object trajectories on pseudo-labeled data to further enhance the student model training. Our approach improves pseudo-label quality in two distinct manners: first, we suppress false positive pseudo-labels through establishing consistency across multiple frames of motion forecasting outputs. Second, we compensate for false negative detections by directly inserting predicted object tracks into the pseudo-labeled scene. Experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, improving the performance of standard semi-supervised approaches in a variety of settings.</p></details> |  |

However, the nonlinear optimization solvers required remain too slow for use on relatively resource-constrained flight-grade computers. In this work, we turn towards amortized optimization, a learning-based technique for accelerating optimization run times, and present TOAST: Trajectory Optimization with Merit Function Warm Starts. Offline, using data collected from a simulation, we train a neural network to learn a mapping to the full primal and dual solutions given the problem parameters. Crucially, we build upon recent results from decision-focused learning and present a set of decision-focused loss functions using the notion of merit functions for optimization problems. We show that training networks with such constraint-informed losses can better encode the structure of the trajectory optimization problem and jointly learn to reconstruct the primal-dual solution while yielding improved constraint satisfaction. Through numerical experiments on a Lunar rover problem and a 3-degrees-of-freedom Mars powered descent guidance problem, we demonstrate that TOAST outperforms benchmark approaches in terms of both computation times and network prediction constraint satisfaction.</p></details> |  |

However, predictive modeling of such data remains challenging due to high dimensionality, irregular sampling, and data sparsity. To address these issues, we propose ImageFlowNet, a novel model designed to forecast disease trajectories from initial images while preserving spatial details. ImageFlowNet first learns multiscale joint representation spaces across patients and time points, then optimizes deterministic or stochastic flow fields within these spaces using a position-parameterized neural ODE/SDE framework. The model leverages a UNet architecture to create robust multiscale representations and mitigates data scarcity by combining knowledge from all patients. We provide theoretical insights that support our formulation of ODEs, and motivate our regularizations involving high-level visual features, latent space organization, and trajectory smoothness. We validate ImageFlowNet on three longitudinal medical image datasets depicting progression in geographic atrophy, multiple sclerosis, and glioblastoma, demonstrating its ability to effectively forecast disease progression and outperform existing methods. Our contributions include the development of ImageFlowNet, its theoretical underpinnings, and empirical validation on real-world datasets.

This formulation provides a new framework for analyzing and designing feedback control laws. We show that any stable closed-loop system can be expressed in this form with appropriate values for the step size and value matrices. Furthermore, we show that this parameterization of the closed-loop system is equivalent to a linear quadratic regulator for appropriately chosen weighting matrices. We also show that trajectories can be shaped using this approach to achieve a desired closed-loop behavior.</p></details> |  |
| **[Marginal Structural Modeling of Representative Treatment Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04933v2)** | 2024-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Marginal structural models (MSMs) are widely used in observational studies to estimate the causal effect of time-varying treatments. Despite its popularity, limited attention has been paid to summarizing the treatment history in the outcome model, which proves particularly challenging when individuals' treatment trajectories exhibit complex patterns over time. Commonly used metrics such as the average treatment level fail to adequately capture the treatment history, hindering causal interpretation. For scenarios where treatment histories exhibit distinct temporal patterns, we develop a new approach to parameterize the outcome model.

| **[Maneuver Decision-Making with Trajectory Streams Prediction for Autonomous Vehicles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10165v1)** | 2024-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Decision-making, motion planning, and trajectory prediction are crucial in autonomous driving systems. By accurately forecasting the movements of other road users, the decision-making capabilities of the autonomous system can be enhanced, making it more effective in responding to dynamic and unpredictable environments and more adaptive to diverse road scenarios. This paper presents the FFStreams++ approach for decision-making and motion planning of different maneuvers, including unprotected left turn, overtaking, and keep-lane. FFStreams++ is a combination of sampling-based and search-based approaches, where iteratively new sampled trajectories for different maneuvers are generated and optimized, and afterward, a heuristic search planner is called, searching for an optimal plan. We model the autonomous diving system in the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) and search for the optimal plan using a heuristic Fast-Forward planner. In this approach, the initial state of the problem is modified iteratively through streams, which will generate maneuver-specific trajectory candidates, increasing the iterating level until an optimal plan is found. FFStreams++ integrates a query-connected network model for predicting possible future trajectories for each surrounding obstacle along with their probabilities. The proposed approach was tested on the CommonRoad simulation framework. We use a collection of randomly generated driving scenarios for overtaking and unprotected left turns at intersections to evaluate the FFStreams++ planner. The test results confirmed that the proposed approach can effectively execute various maneuvers to ensure safety and reduce the risk of collisions with nearby traffic agents.</p></details> | 17 pages, 8 figures |
| **[From a Single Trajectory to Safety Controller Synthesis of Discrete-Time Nonlinear Polynomial Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10026v1)** | 2024-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work is concerned with developing a data-driven approach for learning control barrier certificates (CBCs) and associated safety controllers for discrete-time nonlinear polynomial systems with unknown mathematical models, guaranteeing system safety over an infinite time horizon. The proposed approach leverages measured data acquired through an input-output observation, referred to as a single trajectory, collected over a specified time horizon. By fulfilling a certain rank condition, which ensures the unknown system is persistently excited by the collected data, we design a CBC and its corresponding safety controller directly from the finite-length observed data, without explicitly identifying the unknown dynamical system. This is achieved through proposing a data-based sum-of-squares optimization (SOS) program to systematically design CBCs and their safety controllers. We validate our data-driven approach over two physical case studies including a jet engine and a Lorenz system, demonstrating the efficacy of our proposed method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Model Predictive Planning: Trajectory Planning in Obstruction-Dense Environments for Low-Agility Aircraft](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16024v2)** | 2024-09-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present Model Predictive Planning (MPP), a trajectory planner for low-agility vehicles such as a fixed-wing aircraft to navigate obstacle-laden environments. MPP consists of (1) a multi-path planning procedure that identifies candidate paths, (2) a raytracing procedure that generates linear constraints around these paths to enforce obstacle avoidance, and (3) a convex quadratic program that finds a feasible trajectory within these constraints if one exists. Low-agility aircraft cannot track arbitrary paths, so refining a given path into a trajectory that respects the vehicle's limited maneuverability and avoids obstacles often leads to an infeasible optimization problem. The critical feature of MPP is that it efficiently considers multiple candidate paths during the refinement process, thereby greatly increasing the chance of finding a feasible and trackable trajectory. We demonstrate the effectiveness of MPP on a longitudinal aircraft model.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Entry Generalized Search Trees for Indexing Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05327v2)** | 2024-09-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The idea of generalized indices is one of the success stories of database systems research. It has found its way to implementation in common database systems. GiST (Generalized Search Tree) and SP-GiST (Space-Partitioned Generalized Search Tree) are two widely-used generalized indices that are typically used for multidimensional data. Currently, the generalized indices GiST and SP-GiST represent one database object using one index entry, e.g., a bounding box for each spatio-temporal object. However, when dealing with complex objects, e.g., moving object trajectories, a single entry per object is inadequate for creating efficient indices. Previous research has highlighted that splitting trajectories into multiple bounding boxes prior to indexing can enhance query performance as it leads to a higher index filter. In this paper, we introduce MGiST and MSP-GiST, the multi-entry generalized search tree counterparts of GiST and SP-GiST, respectively, that are designed to enable the partitioning of objects into multiple entries during insertion. The methods for decomposing a complex object into multiple sub-objects differ from one data type to another, and may depend on some domain-specific parameters. Thus, MGiST and MSP-GiST are designed to allow for pluggable modules that aid in optimizing the split of an object into multiple sub-objects. We demonstrate the usefulness of MGiST and MSP-GiST using a trajectory indexing scenario, where we realize several trajectory indexes using MGiST and MSP-GiST and instantiate these search trees with trajectory-specific splitting algorithms. We create and test the performance of several multi-entry versions of widely-used spatial index structures, e.g., R-Tree, Quad-Tree, and KD-Tree. We conduct evaluations using both synthetic and real-world data, and observe up to an order of magnitude enhancement in performance of point, range, and KNN queries.</p></details> |  |

Existing cross-domain policy transfer methods mostly aim at learning domain correspondences or corrections to facilitate policy learning, which requires learning domain/task-specific model components, representations, or policies that are inflexible or not fully reusable to accommodate arbitrary domains and tasks. These issues make us wonder: can we directly bridge the domain gap at the data (trajectory) level, instead of devising complicated, domain-specific policy transfer models? In this study, we propose a Cross-Domain Trajectory EDiting (xTED) framework with a new diffusion transformer model (Decision Diffusion Transformer, DDiT) that captures the trajectory distribution from the target dataset as a prior. The proposed diffusion transformer backbone captures the intricate dependencies among state, action, and reward sequences, as well as the transition dynamics within the target data trajectories. With the above pre-trained diffusion prior, source data trajectories with domain gaps can be transformed into edited trajectories that closely resemble the target data distribution through the diffusion-based editing process, which implicitly corrects the underlying domain gaps, enhancing the state realism and dynamics reliability in source trajectory data, while enabling flexible choices of downstream policy learning methods. Despite its simplicity, xTED demonstrates superior performance against other baselines in extensive simulation and real-robot experiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>xTED ...</summary><p>xTED offers a novel, generic, flexible, simple and effective paradigm that casts cross-domain policy adaptation as a data pre-processing problem</p></details> |

One of the main reasons is the computationally long planning times that come with a large state space. Trajectory optimisation algorithms have proved their utility in a wide variety of tasks, but, like most methods struggle scaling to the high dimensional systems ubiquitous to non-prehensile manipulation in clutter as well as deformable object manipulation. We reason that, during manipulation, different degrees of freedom will become more or less important to the task over time as the system evolves. We leverage this idea to reduce the number of degrees of freedom considered in a trajectory optimisation problem, to reduce planning times. This idea is particularly relevant in the context of model predictive control (MPC) where the cost landscape of the optimisation problem is constantly evolving. We provide simulation results under asynchronous MPC and show our methods are capable of achieving better overall performance due to the decreased policy lag whilst still being able to optimise trajectories effectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 4 figures, accepted to WAFR 2024</p></details> |
| **[Universal Trajectory Optimization Framework for Differential-Driven Robot Class](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07924v1)** | 2024-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Differential-driven robots are widely used in various scenarios thanks to their straightforward principle, from household service robots to disaster response field robots. There are several different types of deriving mechanisms considering the real-world applications, including two-wheeled, four-wheeled skid-steering, tracked robots, etc. The differences in the driving mechanism usually require specific kinematic modeling when precise controlling is desired. Furthermore, the nonholonomic dynamics and possible lateral slip lead to different degrees of difficulty in getting feasible and high-quality trajectories. Therefore, a comprehensive trajectory optimization framework to compute trajectories efficiently for various kinds of differential-driven robots is highly desirable. In this paper, we propose a universal trajectory optimization framework that can be applied to differential-driven robot class, enabling the generation of high-quality trajectories within a restricted computational timeframe. We introduce a novel trajectory representation based on polynomial parameterization of motion states or their integrals, such as angular and linear velocities, that inherently matching robots' motion to the control principle for differential-driven robot class. The trajectory optimization problem is formulated to minimize complexity while prioritizing safety and operational efficiency. We then build a full-stack autonomous planning and control system to show the feasibility and robustness. We conduct extensive simulations and real-world testing in crowded environments with three kinds of differential-driven robots to validate the effectiveness of our approach. We will release our method as an open-source package.</p></details> | 15 pages, 15 figures |

However, their black-box nature poses significant challenges to closed-loop stability guarantees and performance analysis. In this paper, we introduce a structured DNN-based controller for the trajectory tracking control of Lagrangian systems using backing techniques. By properly designing neural network structures, the proposed controller can ensure closed-loop stability for any compatible neural network parameters. In addition, improved control performance can be achieved by further optimizing neural network parameters. Besides, we provide explicit upper bounds on tracking errors in terms of controller parameters, which allows us to achieve the desired tracking performance by properly selecting the controller parameters. Furthermore, when system models are unknown, we propose an improved Lagrangian neural network (LNN) structure to learn the system dynamics and design the controller. We show that in the presence of model approximation errors and external disturbances, the closed-loop stability and tracking control performance can still be guaranteed. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated through simulations.</p></details> |  |

Interpretability tools could enable users to understand and evaluate possible flaws in learned reward functions. We propose Counterfactual Trajectory Explanations (CTEs) to interpret reward functions in reinforcement learning by contrasting an original with a counterfactual partial trajectory and the rewards they each receive. We derive six quality criteria for CTEs and propose a novel Monte-Carlo-based algorithm for generating CTEs that optimises these quality criteria. Finally, we measure how informative the generated explanations are to a proxy-human model by training it on CTEs. CTEs are demonstrably informative for the proxy-human model, increasing the similarity between its predictions and the reward function on unseen trajectories. Further, it learns to accurately judge differences in rewards between trajectories and generalises to out-of-distribution examples. Although CTEs do not lead to a perfect understanding of the reward, our method, and more generally the adaptation of XAI methods, are presented as a fruitful approach for interpreting learned reward functions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diff-RNTraj: A Structure-aware Diffusion Model for Road Network-constrained Trajectory Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07369v2)** | 2024-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory data is essential for various applications as it records the movement of vehicles. However, publicly available trajectory datasets remain limited in scale due to privacy concerns, which hinders the development of trajectory data mining and trajectory-based applications. To address this issue, some methods for generating synthetic trajectories have been proposed to expand the scale of the dataset. However, all existing methods generate trajectories in the geographical coordinate system, which poses two limitations for their utilization in practical applications: 1) the inability to ensure that the generated trajectories are constrained on the road. 2) the lack of road-related information. In this paper, we propose a new problem to meet the practical application need, \emph{i.e.}, road network-constrained trajectory (RNTraj) generation, which can directly generate trajectories on the road network with road-related information. RNTraj is a hybrid type of data, in which each point is represented by a discrete road segment and a continuous moving rate. To generate RNTraj, we design a diffusion model called Diff-RNTraj. This model can effectively handle the hybrid RNTraj using a continuous diffusion framework by incorporating a pre-training strategy to embed hybrid RNTraj into continuous representations. During the sampling stage, a RNTraj decoder is designed to map the continuous representation generated by the diffusion model back to the hybrid RNTraj format. Furthermore, Diff-RNTraj introduces a novel loss function to enhance the spatial validity of the generated trajectories. Extensive experiments conducted on two real-world trajectory datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted as a regular paper at IEEE TKDE</p></details> |

While much progress has been made in the last two decades, network inference remains an open problem. For systems observed at steady state, limited insights are available since temporal information is unavailable and thus causal information is lost. Two common avenues for gaining causal insights into system behaviour are to leverage temporal dynamics in the form of trajectories, and to apply interventions such as knock-out perturbations. We propose an approach for leveraging both dynamical and perturbational single cell data to jointly learn cellular trajectories and power network inference. Our approach is motivated by min-entropy estimation for stochastic dynamics and can infer directed and signed networks from time-stamped single cell snapshots.</p></details> | 14 pages, 6 figures |

Several existing deep generative solutions propose learning from real trajectories to generate synthetic ones. Despite the progress, most of them suffer from training stability issues and scale poorly with growing data size. More importantly, they generally lack control mechanisms to steer the generated trajectories based on spatiotemporal constraints such as fixing specific visits. To address such limitations, we formally define the controlled trajectory generation problem with spatiotemporal constraints and propose Geo-Llama. This novel LLM-inspired framework enforces explicit visit constraints in a contextually coherent way. It fine-tunes pre-trained LLMs on trajectories with a visit-wise permutation strategy where each visit corresponds to a time and location. This enables the model to capture the spatiotemporal patterns regardless of visit orders and allows flexible and in-context constraint integration through prompts during generation. Extensive experiments on real-world and synthetic datasets validate the effectiveness of Geo-Llama, demonstrating its versatility and robustness in handling a broad range of constraints to generate more realistic trajectories compared to existing methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[What's Wrong with the Absolute Trajectory Error?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.05376v5)** | 2024-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One of the limitations of the commonly used Absolute Trajectory Error (ATE) is that it is highly sensitive to outliers. As a result, in the presence of just a few outliers, it often fails to reflect the varying accuracy as the inlier trajectory error or the number of outliers varies. In this work, we propose an alternative error metric for evaluating the accuracy of the reconstructed camera trajectory. Our metric, named Discernible Trajectory Error (DTE), is computed in five steps: (1) Shift the ground-truth and estimated trajectories such that both of their geometric medians are located at the origin. (2) Rotate the estimated trajectory such that it minimizes the sum of geodesic distances between the corresponding camera orientations. (3) Scale the estimated trajectory such that the median distance of the cameras to their geometric median is the same as that of the ground truth. (4) Compute, winsorize and normalize the distances between the corresponding cameras. (5) Obtain the DTE by taking the average of the mean and the root-mean-square (RMS) of the resulting distances. This metric is an attractive alternative to the ATE, in that it is capable of discerning the varying trajectory accuracy as the inlier trajectory error or the number of outliers varies. Using the similar idea, we also propose a novel rotation error metric, named Discernible Rotation Error (DRE), which has similar advantages to the DTE. Furthermore, we propose a simple yet effective method for calibrating the camera-to-marker rotation, which is needed for the computation of our metrics. Our methods are verified through extensive simulations.</p></details> | <details><summary>The m...</summary><p>The main part of this manuscript (except the part on DRE) has been accepted to ECCV 2024 Workshop HALF-CENTURY OF STRUCTURE-FROM-MOTION (50SFM)</p></details> |

However, these methods do not model constraints crucial to ensure safety of the learned skill. Moreover, even when explicitly modelling constraints, they rely on the assumption of a known cost function, which limits their practical usability for task with unknown cost. In this work we propose a two-step optimization process that allow to estimate cost and constraints by decoupling the learning of cost functions from the identification of unknown constraints within the demonstrated trajectories. Initially, we identify the cost function by isolating the effect of constraints on parts of the demonstrations. Subsequently, a constraint leaning method is used to identify the unknown constraints. Our approach is validated both on simulated trajectories and a real robotic manipulation task. Our experiments show the impact that incorrect cost estimation has on the learned constraints and illustrate how the proposed method is able to infer unknown constraints, such as obstacles, from demonstrated trajectories without any initial knowledge of the cost.</p></details> | <details><summary>(Acce...</summary><p>(Accepted/In press) 2024 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)</p></details> |
| **[Almost Global Trajectory Tracking for Quadrotors Using Thrust Direction Control on $\mathcal{S}^2$](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05702v1)** | 2024-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many of the existing works on quadrotor control address the trajectory tracking problem by employing a cascade design in which the translational and rotational dynamics are stabilized by two separate controllers. The stability of the cascade is often proved by employing trajectory-based arguments, most notably, integral input-to-state stability. In this paper, we follow a different route and present a control law ensuring that a composite function constructed from the translational and rotational tracking errors is a Lyapunov function for the closed-loop cascade. In particular, starting from a generic control law for the double integrator, we develop a suitable attitude control extension, by leveraging a backstepping-like procedure. Using this construction, we provide an almost global stability certificate. The proposed design employs the unit sphere $\mathcal{S}^2$ to describe the rotational degrees of freedom required for position control. This enables a simpler controller tuning and an improved tracking performance with respect to previous global solutions. The new design is demonstrated via numerical simulations and on real-world experiments.</p></details> |  |

Recently, two important approaches have gained recognition. While one leverages via-points to adapt skills locally by modulating demonstrated trajectories, another relies on so-called task-parameterized models that encode movements with respect to different coordinate systems, using a product of probabilities for generalization. While the former are well-suited to precise, local modulations, the latter aim at generalizing over large regions of the workspace and often involve multiple objects. Addressing the quality of generalization by leveraging both approaches simultaneously has received little attention. In this work, we propose an interactive imitation learning framework that simultaneously leverages local and global modulations of trajectory distributions. Building on the kernelized movement primitives (KMP) framework, we introduce novel mechanisms for skill modulation from direct human corrective feedback. Our approach particularly exploits the concept of via-points to incrementally and interactively 1) improve the model accuracy locally, 2) add new objects to the task during execution and 3) extend the skill into regions where demonstrations were not provided. We evaluate our method on a bearing ring-loading task using a torque-controlled, 7-DoF, DLR SARA robot.</p></details> | 21 pages, 16 figures |

Parallel prioritized planning offers approximately consistent computation time regardless of the number of vehicles but struggles to guarantee collision-free trajectories. Conversely, sequential prioritized planning can guarantee collision-freeness but results in increased computation time as the number of sequentially computing vehicles, which we term computation levels, grows. This number is determined by the directed coupling graph resulted from the coupling and prioritization of vehicles. In this work, we guarantee safe trajectories in parallel planning through reachability analysis. Although these trajectories are collision-free, they tend to be conservative. We address this by planning with a subset of vehicles in sequence. We formulate the problem of selecting this subset as a graph partitioning problem that allows us to independently set computation levels. Our simulations demonstrate a reduction in computation levels by approximately 64% compared to sequential prioritized planning while maintaining the solution quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 4 figures.

In fact, sound source localization and separation are interconnected problems, that is, sound source localization facilitates sound separation while sound separation contributes to more precise source localization. This paper proposes a method utilizing the mutual facilitation mechanism between sound source localization and separation for moving sources. Initially, sound separation is conducted using rough preliminary sound source tracking results. Sound source tracking is then performed on the separated signals thus the tracking results can become more precise. The precise trajectory can further enhances the separation performance. This mutual facilitation process can be performed over several iterations. Simulation experiments conducted under reverberation conditions and with moving sound sources demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve more accurate separation based on more precise tracking results.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages,7 figures,submitted to IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio, Speech and Language Processing(TASLP)</p></details> |

However, current systems fall short of matching human-level of intelligence in terms of adapting to novel tools. Prior works based on affordance often make strong assumptions about the environments and cannot scale to more complex, contact-rich tasks. In this work, we tackle this challenge and explore how agents can learn to use previously unseen tools to manipulate deformable objects. We propose to learn a generative model of the tool-use trajectories as a sequence of tool point clouds, which generalizes to different tool shapes. Given any novel tool, we first generate a tool-use trajectory and then optimize the sequence of tool poses to align with the generated trajectory. We train a single model on four different challenging deformable object manipulation tasks, using demonstration data from only one tool per task. The model generalizes to various novel tools, significantly outperforming baselines. We further test our trained policy in the real world with unseen tools, where it achieves the performance comparable to human.

Conventional methods of optimizing the spray gun trajectory based on simulated thickness can only qualitatively reflect the color distribution, and can not simulate the color effect of spray painting at the pixel level. Therefore, it is not possible to accurately control the area covered by the color and the gradation of the edges of the area, and it is also difficult to deal with the situation where multiple colors of paint are sprayed in combination. To solve the above problems, this paper is inspired by the Kubelka-Munk model and combines the 3D machine vision method and artificial neural network to propose a spray painting color effect prediction method. The method is enabled to predict the execution effect of the spray gun trajectory with pixel-level accuracy from the dimension of the surface color of the workpiece after spray painting. On this basis, the method can be used to replace the traditional thickness simulation method to establish the objective function of the spray gun trajectory optimization problem, and thus solve the difficult problem of spray gun trajectory optimization for multi-color paint combination spraying. In this paper, the mathematical model of the spray painting color effect prediction problem is first determined through the analysis of the Kubelka-Munk paint film color rendering model, and at the same time, the spray painting color effect dataset is established with the help of the depth camera and point cloud processing algorithm.

It is crucial to control the sensor pose to maintain optimal distance and relative orientation to the surface. It is also important to ensure uniform profile distribution throughout the scanning process. This paper presents a novel Reinforcement Learning (RL) based approach to optimize robot inspection trajectories for profilometric sensors. Building upon the Boustrophedon scanning method, our technique dynamically adjusts the sensor position and tilt to maintain optimal orientation and distance from the surface, while also ensuring a consistent profile distance for uniform and high-quality scanning. Utilizing a simulated environment based on the CAD model of the part, we replicate real-world scanning conditions, including sensor noise and surface irregularities. This simulation-based approach enables offline trajectory planning based on CAD models. Key contributions include the modeling of the state space, action space, and reward function, specifically designed for inspection applications using profilometric sensors. We use Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm to efficiently train the RL agent, demonstrating its capability to optimize inspection trajectories with profilometric sensors. To validate our approach, we conducted several experiments where a model trained on a specific training piece was tested on various parts in simulation. Also, we conducted a real-world experiment by executing the optimized trajectory, generated offline from a CAD model, to inspect a part using a UR3e robotic arm model.</p></details> |  |
| **[Model Predictive Online Trajectory Planning for Adaptive Battery Discharging in Fuel Cell Vehicle](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03201v1)** | 2024-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents an online trajectory planning approach for optimal coordination of Fuel Cell (FC) and battery in plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle (HEV). One of the main challenges in energy management of plug-in HEV is generating State-of-Charge (SOC) reference curves by optimally depleting battery under high uncertainties in driving scenarios. Recent studies have begun to explore the potential of utilizing partial trip information for optimal SOC trajectory planning, but dynamic responses of the FC system are not taken into account. On the other hand, research focusing on dynamic operation of FC systems often focuses on air flow management, and battery has been treated only partially. Our aim is to fill this gap by designing an online trajectory planner for dynamic coordination of FC and battery systems that works with a high-level SOC planner in a hierarchical manner. We propose an iterative LQR based online trajectory planning method where the amount of electricity dischargeable at each driving segment can be explicitly and adaptively specified by the high-level planner. Numerical results are provided as a proof of concept example to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[MADiff: Motion-Aware Mamba Diffusion Models for Hand Trajectory Prediction on Egocentric Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02638v1)** | 2024-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding human intentions and actions through egocentric videos is important on the path to embodied artificial intelligence. As a branch of egocentric vision techniques, hand trajectory prediction plays a vital role in comprehending human motion patterns, benefiting downstream tasks in extended reality and robot manipulation. However, capturing high-level human intentions consistent with reasonable temporal causality is challenging when only egocentric videos are available. This difficulty is exacerbated under camera egomotion interference and the absence of affordance labels to explicitly guide the optimization of hand waypoint distribution. In this work, we propose a novel hand trajectory prediction method dubbed MADiff, which forecasts future hand waypoints with diffusion models. The devised denoising operation in the latent space is achieved by our proposed motion-aware Mamba, where the camera wearer's egomotion is integrated to achieve motion-driven selective scan (MDSS). To discern the relationship between hands and scenarios without explicit affordance supervision, we leverage a foundation model that fuses visual and language features to capture high-level semantics from video clips. Comprehensive experiments conducted on five public datasets with the existing and our proposed new evaluation metrics demonstrate that MADiff predicts comparably reasonable hand trajectories compared to the state-of-the-art baselines, and achieves real-time performance. We will release our code and pretrained models of MADiff at the project page: https://irmvlab.github.io/madiff.github.io.</p></details> |  |

Although traditional equations and Machine Learning (ML) models using clinical and laboratory data can estimate eGFR, accurately predicting future eGFR levels remains a significant challenge for nephrologists and ML researchers. Recent advances demonstrate that Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) can serve as robust foundation models for diverse applications. This study investigates the potential of LMMs to predict future eGFR levels with a dataset consisting of laboratory and clinical values from 50 patients. By integrating various prompting techniques and ensembles of LMMs, our findings suggest that these models, when combined with precise prompts and visual representations of eGFR trajectories, offer predictive performance comparable to existing ML models. This research extends the application of foundation models and suggests avenues for future studies to harness these models in addressing complex medical forecasting challenges.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This preprint version includes corrections of typographical errors related to numerical values in Table 2, which were present in the version published at the BDH workshop in MIPR 2024.

| **[Joint Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction through Posterior Sampling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00237v2)** | 2024-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Joint pedestrian trajectory prediction has long grappled with the inherent unpredictability of human behaviors. Recent investigations employing variants of conditional diffusion models in trajectory prediction have exhibited notable success. Nevertheless, the heavy dependence on accurate historical data results in their vulnerability to noise disturbances and data incompleteness. To improve the robustness and reliability, we introduce the Guided Full Trajectory Diffuser (GFTD), a novel diffusion model framework that captures the joint full (historical and future) trajectory distribution. By learning from the full trajectory, GFTD can recover the noisy and missing data, hence improving the robustness. In addition, GFTD can adapt to data imperfections without additional training requirements, leveraging posterior sampling for reliable prediction and controllable generation. Our approach not only simplifies the prediction process but also enhances generalizability in scenarios with noise and incomplete inputs. Through rigorous experimental evaluation, GFTD exhibits superior performance in both trajectory prediction and controllable generation.</p></details> |  |

While promising approaches exist, they are often not publicly available, revolve around pedestrian datasets excluding traffic-related information, or resemble architectures that are either not real-time capable or robust. To address these limitations, we first introduce a dedicated benchmark based on Argoverse 2, specifically targeting pedestrians in urban settings. Following this, we present Snapshot, a modular, feed-forward neural network that outperforms the current state of the art while utilizing significantly less information. Despite its agent-centric encoding scheme, Snapshot demonstrates scalability, real-time performance, and robustness to varying motion histories. Moreover, by integrating Snapshot into a modular autonomous driving software stack, we showcase its real-world applicability</p></details> | 8 Pages, 9 Figures |

One fundamental difficulty stands in the evolution of the trajectory that becomes more and more uncertain and unpredictable as the time horizon grows, subsequently increasing the complexity of the problem. To overcome this issue, in this paper, we propose Di-Long, a new method that employs the distillation of a short-term trajectory model forecaster that guides a student network for long-term trajectory prediction during the training process. Given a total sequence length that comprehends the allowed observation for the student network and the complementary target sequence, we let the student and the teacher solve two different related tasks defined over the same full trajectory: the student observes a short sequence and predicts a long trajectory, whereas the teacher observes a longer sequence and predicts the remaining short target trajectory. The teacher's task is less uncertain, and we use its accurate predictions to guide the student through our knowledge distillation framework, reducing long-term future uncertainty. Our experiments show that our proposed Di-Long method is effective for long-term forecasting and achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Intersection Drone Dataset (inD) and the Stanford Drone Dataset (SDD).</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IROS 2024</p></details> |

| **[Fast and Certifiable Trajectory Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05846v3)** | 2024-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose semidefinite trajectory optimization (STROM), a framework that computes fast and certifiably optimal solutions for nonconvex trajectory optimization problems defined by polynomial objectives and constraints. STROM employs sparse second-order Lasserre's hierarchy to generate semidefinite program (SDP) relaxations of trajectory optimization. Different from existing tools (e.g., YALMIP and SOSTOOLS in Matlab), STROM generates chain-like multiple-block SDPs with only positive semidefinite (PSD) variables. Moreover, STROM does so two orders of magnitude faster. Underpinning STROM is cuADMM, the first ADMM-based SDP solver implemented in CUDA and runs in GPUs (with C/C++ extension). cuADMM builds upon the symmetric Gauss-Seidel ADMM algorithm and leverages GPU parallelization to speedup solving sparse linear systems and projecting onto PSD cones. In five trajectory optimization problems (inverted pendulum, cart-pole, vehicle landing, flying robot, and car back-in), cuADMM computes optimal trajectories (with certified suboptimality below 1%) in minutes (when other solvers take hours or run out of memory) and seconds (when others take minutes). Further, when warmstarted by data-driven initialization in the inverted pendulum problem, cuADMM delivers real-time performance: providing certifiably optimal trajectories in 0.66 seconds despite the SDP has 49,500 variables and 47,351 constraints.</p></details> |  |

Integrating Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) with enhanced MEC networks can leverage the high mobility of UAVs to flexibly adjust network topology, further expanding the applicability of MEC. However, in highly dynamic and complex real-world environments, it is crucial to balance task offloading effectiveness with algorithm performance. This paper investigates a multi-UAV communication network equipped with edge computing nodes to assist terminal users in task computation. Our goal is to reduce the task processing delay for users through the joint optimization of discrete computation modes, continuous 3D trajectories, and resource assignment. To address the challenges posed by the mixed action space, we propose a Multi-UAV Edge Computing Resource Scheduling (MUECRS) algorithm, which comprises two key components: 1) trajectory optimization, and 2) computation mode and resource management. Experimental results demonstrate our method effectively designs the 3D flight trajectories of UAVs, enabling rapid terminal coverage. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm achieves efficient resource deployment and scheduling, outperforming comparative algorithms by at least 16.7%, demonstrating superior adaptability and robustness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generative Modeling of Molecular Dynamics Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17808v1)** | 2024-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Molecular dynamics (MD) is a powerful technique for studying microscopic phenomena, but its computational cost has driven significant interest in the development of deep learning-based surrogate models. We introduce generative modeling of molecular trajectories as a paradigm for learning flexible multi-task surrogate models of MD from data. By conditioning on appropriately chosen frames of the trajectory, we show such generative models can be adapted to diverse tasks such as forward simulation, transition path sampling, and trajectory upsampling. By alternatively conditioning on part of the molecular system and inpainting the rest, we also demonstrate the first steps towards dynamics-conditioned molecular design. We validate the full set of these capabilities on tetrapeptide simulations and show that our model can produce reasonable ensembles of protein monomers. Altogether, our work illustrates how generative modeling can unlock value from MD data towards diverse downstream tasks that are not straightforward to address with existing methods or even MD itself.

Current state-of-the-art motion prediction methods rely on High Definition (HD) maps for capturing the surrounding context of the ego vehicle. Such systems lack scalability in real-world deployment as HD maps are expensive to produce and update in real-time. To overcome this issue, we propose Context Aware Scene Prediction Transformer (CASPFormer), which can perform multi-modal motion prediction from rasterized Bird-Eye-View (BEV) images. Our system can be integrated with any upstream perception module that is capable of generating BEV images. Moreover, CASPFormer directly decodes vectorized trajectories without any postprocessing. Trajectories are decoded recurrently using deformable attention, as it is computationally efficient and provides the network with the ability to focus its attention on the important spatial locations of the BEV images. In addition, we also address the issue of mode collapse for generating multiple scene-consistent trajectories by incorporating learnable mode queries. We evaluate our model on the nuScenes dataset and show that it reaches state-of-the-art across multiple metrics</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under Review at ICPR 2024, Kolkata</p></details> |

However, due to the mobility of the vehicles and the limited computational resources for performing task offloading in near-real-time, such schemes may require high latency, thus, become even infeasible. To address this issue, in this paper, we present a Trajectory Prediction-based Pre-offloading Decision (TPPD) algorithm for analyzing the historical trajectories of vehicles to predict their future coordinates, thereby allowing for computational resource allocation in advance. We first utilize the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network model to predict each vehicle's movement trajectory. Then, based on the task requirements and the predicted trajectories, we devise a dynamic resource allocation algorithm using a Double Deep Q-Network (DDQN) that enables the edge server to minimize task processing delay, while ensuring effective utilization of the available computational resources. Our simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach, showcasing that, as compared with traditional real-time task offloading strategies, the proposed TPPD algorithm significantly reduces task processing delay while improving resource utilization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Data-efficient Trajectory Prediction via Coreset Selection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17385v1)** | 2024-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern vehicles are equipped with multiple information-collection devices such as sensors and cameras, continuously generating a large volume of raw data. Accurately predicting the trajectories of neighboring vehicles is a vital component in understanding the complex driving environment. Yet, training trajectory prediction models is challenging in two ways. Processing the large-scale data is computation-intensive. Moreover, easy-medium driving scenarios often overwhelmingly dominate the dataset, leaving challenging driving scenarios such as dense traffic under-represented. For example, in the Argoverse motion prediction dataset, there are very few instances with $\ge 50$ agents, while scenarios with $10 \thicksim 20$ agents are far more common. In this paper, to mitigate data redundancy in the over-represented driving scenarios and to reduce the bias rooted in the data scarcity of complex ones, we propose a novel data-efficient training method based on coreset selection. This method strategically selects a small but representative subset of data while balancing the proportions of different scenario difficulties. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to introduce a method capable of effectively condensing large-scale trajectory dataset, while achieving a state-of-the-art compression ratio. Notably, even when using only 50% of the Argoverse dataset, the model can be trained with little to no decline in performance. Moreover, the selected coreset maintains excellent generalization ability.</p></details> |  |

The accuracy and effectiveness of the approach are evaluated by comparing the predicted trajectories with the ground truth. The results indicate that the proposed method has outperformed the state-of-the-art predicting methods on a terminal airspace flight trajectory dataset.

Accurate trajectory planning is the key to reliable vehicle deployments in open-world environment, where unstructured obstacles bring in uncertainties that are impossible to fully capture by training data. For traditional machine learning tasks, such uncertainties are often addressed reasonably well via methods such as continual learning. On the one hand, naively applying those methods to trajectory prediction can result in continuous data collection and frequent model updates, which can be resource-intensive. On the other hand, the predicted trajectories can be far away from the true trajectories, leading to unsafe decision-making. In this paper, we aim to establish real-time awareness of out-of-distribution in trajectory prediction for autonomous vehicles. We focus on the challenging and practically relevant setting where the out-of-distribution is deceptive, that is, the one not easily detectable by human intuition. Drawing on the well-established techniques of sequential analysis, we build real-time awareness of out-of-distribution by monitoring prediction errors using the quickest change point detection (QCD). Our solutions are lightweight and can handle the occurrence of out-of-distribution at any time during trajectory prediction inference. Experimental results on multiple real-world datasets using a benchmark trajectory prediction model demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[TFT-multi: simultaneous forecasting of vital sign trajectories in the ICU](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15586v2)** | 2024-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory forecasting in healthcare data has been an important area of research in precision care and clinical integration for computational methods. In recent years, generative AI models have demonstrated promising results in capturing short and long range dependencies in time series data. While these models have also been applied in healthcare, most of them only predict one value at a time, which is unrealistic in a clinical setting where multiple measures are taken at once. In this work, we extend the framework temporal fusion transformer (TFT), a multi-horizon time series prediction tool, and propose TFT-multi, an end-to-end framework that can predict multiple vital trajectories simultaneously. We apply TFT-multi to forecast 5 vital signs recorded in the intensive care unit: blood pressure, pulse, SpO2, temperature and respiratory rate. We hypothesize that by jointly predicting these measures, which are often correlated with one another, we can make more accurate predictions, especially in variables with large missingness. We validate our model on the public MIMIC dataset and an independent institutional dataset, and demonstrate that this approach outperforms state-of-the-art univariate prediction tools including the original TFT and Prophet, as well as vector regression modeling for multivariate prediction. Furthermore, we perform a study case analysis by applying our pipeline to forecast blood pressure changes in response to actual and hypothetical pressor administration.</p></details> |  |

Despite this success, they have seen only limited use in real-world robotics tasks such as trajectory optimization. Two key factors have contributed to this limited success. First, it is challenging to reason about collisions in radiance models. Second, it is difficult to perform inference of radiance models fast enough for real-time trajectory synthesis. This paper addresses these challenges by proposing SPLANNING, a risk-aware trajectory optimizer that operates in a Gaussian Splatting model. This paper first derives a method for rigorously upper-bounding the probability of collision between a robot and a radiance field. Second, this paper introduces a normalized reformulation of Gaussian Splatting that enables the efficient computation of the collision bound in a Gaussian Splat. Third, a method is presented to optimize trajectories while avoiding collisions with a scene represented by a Gaussian Splat. Experiments demonstrate that SPLANNING outperforms state-of-the-art methods in generating collision-free trajectories in highly cluttered environments.

| **[Historical Trajectory Assisted Zeroth-Order Federated Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15955v2)** | 2024-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated learning is a distributed learning framework which enables clients to train models individually and to upload their model updates for aggregation. The local training process heavily relies on distributed gradient descent techniques. In the situation where gradient information is not available, the gradients need to be estimated from zeroth-order information, which typically involves computing finite-differences along isotropic random directions. This method suffers from high estimation errors, as the geometric features of the objective landscape may be overlooked during the isotropic sampling. In this work, we propose a non-isotropic sampling method to improve the gradient estimation procedure. Gradients in our method are estimated in a subspace spanned by historical trajectories of solutions, aiming to encourage the exploration of promising regions and hence improve the convergence. We implement this method in zeroth-order federated settings, and show that the convergence rate aligns with existing ones while introducing no significant overheads in communication or local computation. The effectiveness of our proposal is verified on several numerical experiments in comparison to several commonly-used zeroth-order federated optimization algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages with theoretical proof</p></details> |

Numerous studies have been conducted to predict short-term vehicle trajectories in the immediate future. However, long-term trajectory prediction remains a major challenge due to accumulated errors and uncertainties. Additionally, balancing accuracy with interpretability in the prediction is another challenging issue in predicting vehicle trajectory. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a Goal-based Neural Physics Vehicle Trajectory Prediction Model (GNP). The GNP model simplifies vehicle trajectory prediction into a two-stage process: determining the vehicle's goal and then choosing the appropriate trajectory to reach this goal. The GNP model contains two sub-modules to achieve this process. The first sub-module employs a multi-head attention mechanism to accurately predict goals. The second sub-module integrates a deep learning model with a physics-based social force model to progressively predict the complete trajectory using the generated goals. The GNP demonstrates state-of-the-art long-term prediction accuracy compared to four baseline models. We provide interpretable visualization results to highlight the multi-modality and inherent nature of our neural physics framework. Additionally, ablation studies are performed to validate the effectiveness of our key designs.</p></details> |  |

However, calibrating stereo vision systems that incorporate both event and frame-based cameras remains a significant challenge. In this letter, we present EF-Calib, a spatiotemporal calibration framework for event- and frame-based cameras using continuous-time trajectories. A novel calibration pattern applicable to both camera types and the corresponding event recognition algorithm is proposed. Leveraging the asynchronous nature of events, a derivable piece-wise B-spline to represent camera pose continuously is introduced, enabling calibration for intrinsic parameters, extrinsic parameters, and time offset, with analytical Jacobians provided. Various experiments are carried out to evaluate the calibration performance of EF-Calib, including calibration experiments for intrinsic parameters, extrinsic parameters, and time offset. Experimental results show that EF-Calib achieves the most accurate intrinsic parameters compared to current SOTA, the close accuracy of the extrinsic parameters compared to the frame-based results, and accurate time offset estimation. EF-Calib provides a convenient and accurate toolbox for calibrating the system that fuses events and frames.

Recent score distillation methods distill a heavy teacher model into a student generator to achieve one-step generation, which is optimized by calculating the difference between the two score functions on the samples generated by the student model. However, there is a score mismatch issue in the early stage of the distillation process, because existing methods mainly focus on using the endpoint of pre-trained diffusion models as teacher models, overlooking the importance of the convergence trajectory between the student generator and the teacher model. To address this issue, we extend the score distillation process by introducing the entire convergence trajectory of teacher models and propose Distribution Backtracking Distillation (DisBack). DisBask is composed of two stages: Degradation Recording and Distribution Backtracking. Degradation Recording is designed to obtain the convergence trajectory of the teacher model, which records the degradation path from the trained teacher model to the untrained initial student generator. The degradation path implicitly represents the teacher model's intermediate distributions, and its reverse can be viewed as the convergence trajectory from the student generator to the teacher model. Then Distribution Backtracking trains a student generator to backtrack the intermediate distributions along the path to approximate the convergence trajectory of teacher models. Extensive experiments show that DisBack achieves faster and better convergence than the existing distillation method and accomplishes comparable generation performance, with FID score of 1.38 on ImageNet 64x64 dataset. Notably, DisBack is easy to implement and can be generalized to existing distillation methods to boost performance. Our code is publicly available on https://github.com/SYZhang0805/DisBack.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://github.com/SYZhang0805/DisBack</p></details> |

To effectively utilize this data, it is essential to accurately match the geolocation data to the road segments. However, this matching is often not trivial due to the low sampling rate and errors exacerbated by multipath effects in urban environments. Traditionally, statistical modeling techniques such as Hidden-Markov models incorporating domain knowledge into the matching process have been extensively used for map-matching tasks. However, rule-based map-matching tasks are noise-sensitive and inefficient in processing large-scale trajectory data. Deep learning techniques directly learn the relationship between observed data and road networks from the data, often without the need for hand-crafted rules or domain knowledge. This renders them an efficient approach for map-matching large-scale datasets and more robust to the noise. This paper introduces a deep-learning model, specifically the transformer-based encoder-decoder model, to perform as a surrogate for offline map-matching algorithms. The encoder-decoder architecture initially encodes the series of noisy GPS points into a representation that automatically captures autoregressive behavior and spatial correlations between GPS points. Subsequently, the decoder associates data points with the road network features and thus transforms these representations into a sequence of road segments. The model is trained and evaluated using GPS traces collected in Manhattan, New York. Achieving an accuracy of 75%, transformer-based encoder-decoder models extensively employed in natural language processing presented a promising performance for translating noisy GPS data to the navigated routes in urban road networks.</p></details> | 15 pages, 10 figures |

However, it is challenging for aircraft to sustain efficient air-ground communication in urban circumstances. Without continuous air-ground communication, aircraft may experience course deviation and safety accidents. To address these problems, a reconfigurable intelligent surface(RIS)-aided trajectory optimization scheme is proposed enabling efficient air-ground communication and safe aviation in UAM with a layered airspace structure. This paper first devises a dual-plane RIS communication scheme for layered airspace. It fully engages the omnidirectional and directional signal attributes to reduce the transmission delay of the air-ground communication. Based on the dual-plane RIS configuration, we jointly develop the intra- and inter-layer trajectory scheme to optimize communication and safe aviation. In the intra-layer trajectory optimization, we propose a dual-time-scale flight scheme to improve communication capacity and horizontal flight safety. Meanwhile, we propose a safe layer-switching method to ensure collision avoidance during vertical flight in the inter-layer trajectory optimization.

Previous works demonstrated that achieving a truly time-optimal trajectory is computationally too demanding to enable frequent replanning during agile flight, especially on less powerful flight computers. Our approach overcomes this stumbling block by utilizing a point-mass model with a novel iterative thrust decomposition algorithm, enabling the UAV to use all of its collective thrust, something previous point-mass approaches could not achieve. The approach enables gravity and drag modeling integration, significantly reducing tracking errors in high-speed trajectories, which is proven through an ablation study. When combined with a new multi-waypoint optimization algorithm, which uses a gradient-based method to converge to optimal velocities in waypoints, the proposed method generates minimum-time multi-waypoint trajectories within milliseconds. The proposed approach, which we provide as open-source package, is validated both in simulation and in real-world, using Nonlinear Model Predictive Control. With accelerations of up to 3.5g and speeds over 100 km/h, trajectories generated by the proposed method yield similar or even smaller tracking errors than the trajectories generated for a full multirotor model.</p></details> |  |

| **[Intention-based and Risk-Aware Trajectory Prediction for Autonomous Driving in Complex Traffic Scenarios](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15821v1)** | 2024-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurately predicting the trajectory of surrounding vehicles is a critical challenge for autonomous vehicles. In complex traffic scenarios, there are two significant issues with the current autonomous driving system: the cognitive uncertainty of prediction and the lack of risk awareness, which limit the further development of autonomous driving. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel trajectory prediction model that incorporates insights and principles from driving behavior, ethical decision-making, and risk assessment. Based on joint prediction, our model consists of interaction, intention, and risk assessment modules. The dynamic variation of interaction between vehicles can be comprehensively captured at each timestamp in the interaction module. Based on interaction information, our model considers primary intentions for vehicles to enhance the diversity of trajectory generation. The optimization of predicted trajectories follows the advanced risk-aware decision-making principles. Experimental results are evaluated on the DeepAccident dataset; our approach shows its remarkable prediction performance on normal and accident scenarios and outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms by at least 28.9\% and 26.5\%, respectively. The proposed model improves the proficiency and adaptability of trajectory prediction in complex traffic scenarios. The code for the proposed model is available at https://sites.google.com/view/ir-prediction.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction with Crowd Trip Information](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15224v1)** | 2024-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pedestrian trajectory prediction is essential for various applications in active traffic management, urban planning, traffic control, crowd management, and autonomous driving, aiming to enhance traffic safety and efficiency. Accurately predicting pedestrian trajectories requires a deep understanding of individual behaviors, social interactions, and road environments. Existing studies have developed various models to capture the influence of social interactions and road conditions on pedestrian trajectories. However, these approaches are limited by the lack of a comprehensive view of social interactions and road environments. To address these limitations and enhance the accuracy of pedestrian trajectory prediction, we propose a novel approach incorporating trip information as a new modality into pedestrian trajectory models. We propose RNTransformer, a generic model that utilizes crowd trip information to capture global information on social interactions. We incorporated RNTransformer with various socially aware local pedestrian trajectory prediction models to demonstrate its performance. Specifically, by leveraging a pre-trained RNTransformer when training different pedestrian trajectory prediction models, we observed improvements in performance metrics: a 1.3/2.2% enhancement in ADE/FDE on Social-LSTM, a 6.5/28.4% improvement on Social-STGCNN, and an 8.6/4.3% improvement on S-Implicit. Evaluation results demonstrate that RNTransformer significantly enhances the accuracy of various pedestrian trajectory prediction models across multiple datasets. Further investigation reveals that the RNTransformer effectively guides local models to more accurate directions due to the consideration of global information. By exploring crowd behavior within the road network, our approach shows great promise in improving pedestrian safety through accurate trajectory predictions.</p></details> |  |
| **[SocialCircle+: Learning the Angle-based Conditioned Interaction Representation for Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14984v1)** | 2024-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction is a crucial aspect of understanding human behaviors. Researchers have made efforts to represent socially interactive behaviors among pedestrians and utilize various networks to enhance prediction capability. Unfortunately, they still face challenges not only in fully explaining and measuring how these interactive behaviors work to modify trajectories but also in modeling pedestrians' preferences to plan or participate in social interactions in response to the changeable physical environments as extra conditions. This manuscript mainly focuses on the above explainability and conditionality requirements for trajectory prediction networks. Inspired by marine animals perceiving other companions and the environment underwater by echolocation, this work constructs an angle-based conditioned social interaction representation SocialCircle+ to represent the socially interactive context and its corresponding conditions. It employs a social branch and a conditional branch to describe how pedestrians are positioned in prediction scenes socially and physically in angle-based-cyclic-sequence forms. Then, adaptive fusion is applied to fuse the above conditional clues onto the social ones to learn the final interaction representation. Experiments demonstrate the superiority of SocialCircle+ with different trajectory prediction backbones. Moreover, counterfactual interventions have been made to simultaneously verify the modeling capacity of causalities among interactive variables and the conditioning capability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Demystifying Trajectory Recovery From Ash: An Open-Source Evaluation and Enhancement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14645v1)** | 2024-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Once analysed, location trajectories can provide valuable insights beneficial to various applications. However, such data is also highly sensitive, rendering them susceptible to privacy risks in the event of mismanagement, for example, revealing an individual's identity, home address, or political affiliations. Hence, ensuring that privacy is preserved for this data is a priority. One commonly taken measure to mitigate this concern is aggregation. Previous work by Xu et al. shows that trajectories are still recoverable from anonymised and aggregated datasets. However, the study lacks implementation details, obfuscating the mechanisms of the attack. Additionally, the attack was evaluated on commercial non-public datasets, rendering the results and subsequent claims unverifiable. This study reimplements the trajectory recovery attack from scratch and evaluates it on two open-source datasets, detailing the preprocessing steps and implementation. Results confirm that privacy leakage still exists despite common anonymisation and aggregation methods but also indicate that the initial accuracy claims may have been overly ambitious. We release all code as open-source to ensure the results are entirely reproducible and, therefore, verifiable. Moreover, we propose a stronger attack by designing a series of enhancements to the baseline attack. These enhancements yield higher accuracies by up to 16%, providing an improved benchmark for future research in trajectory recovery methods. Our improvements also enable online execution of the attack, allowing partial attacks on larger datasets previously considered unprocessable, thereby furthering the extent of privacy leakage. The findings emphasise the importance of using strong privacy-preserving mechanisms when releasing aggregated mobility data and not solely relying on aggregation as a means of anonymisation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 17th International Conference on Security of Information and Networks (SIN'24).

Chronic wound treatment is currently a manual process, and we envision a future where robotics and automation will aid in this treatment to reduce cost and improve patient care. In this work, we present the development of the first robotic system for wound dressing removal which is reported to be the worst aspect of living with chronic wounds. Our method leverages differentiable physics-based simulation to perform gradient-based Model Predictive Control (MPC) for optimized trajectory planning. By integrating fracture mechanics of adhesion, we are able to model the peeling effect inherent to dressing adhesion. The system is further guided by carefully designed objective functions that promote both efficient and safe control, reducing the risk of tissue damage. We validated the efficacy of our approach through a series of experiments conducted on both synthetic skin phantoms and real human subjects. Our results demonstrate the system's ability to achieve precise and safe dressing removal trajectories, offering a promising solution for automating this essential healthcare procedure.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ICRA 2025</p></details> |

However, in the human task-solving trajectories, we observe significant misalignments between human intentions and the recorded trajectories, which can undermine AI model training. This paper addresses the challenges of these misalignments by proposing a visualization tool and a heuristic algorithm designed to detect and categorize discrepancies in trajectory data. Although the heuristic algorithm requires a set of predefined human intentions to function, which we currently cannot extract, the visualization tool offers valuable insights into the nature of these misalignments. We expect that eliminating these misalignments could significantly improve the utility of trajectory data for AI model training. We also propose that future work should focus on developing methods, such as Topic Modeling, to accurately extract human intentions from trajectory data, thereby enhancing the alignment between user actions and AI learning processes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Single-Trajectory Distributionally Robust Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.11721v2)** | 2024-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To mitigate the limitation that the classical reinforcement learning (RL) framework heavily relies on identical training and test environments, Distributionally Robust RL (DRRL) has been proposed to enhance performance across a range of environments, possibly including unknown test environments. As a price for robustness gain, DRRL involves optimizing over a set of distributions, which is inherently more challenging than optimizing over a fixed distribution in the non-robust case. Existing DRRL algorithms are either model-based or fail to learn from a single sample trajectory. In this paper, we design a first fully model-free DRRL algorithm, called distributionally robust Q-learning with single trajectory (DRQ). We delicately design a multi-timescale framework to fully utilize each incrementally arriving sample and directly learn the optimal distributionally robust policy without modelling the environment, thus the algorithm can be trained along a single trajectory in a model-free fashion. Despite the algorithm's complexity, we provide asymptotic convergence guarantees by generalizing classical stochastic approximation tools. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate the superior robustness and sample complexity of our proposed algorithm, compared to non-robust methods and other robust RL algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>First...</summary><p>First two authors contribute equally</p></details> |
| **[Integrated Decision Making and Trajectory Planning for Autonomous Driving Under Multimodal Uncertainties: A Bayesian Game Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13993v1)** | 2024-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modeling the interaction between traffic agents is a key issue in designing safe and non-conservative maneuvers in autonomous driving. This problem can be challenging when multi-modality and behavioral uncertainties are engaged. Existing methods either fail to plan interactively or consider unimodal behaviors that could lead to catastrophic results. In this paper, we introduce an integrated decision-making and trajectory planning framework based on Bayesian game (i.e., game of incomplete information). Human decisions inherently exhibit discrete characteristics and therefore are modeled as types of players in the game. A general solver based on no-regret learning is introduced to obtain a corresponding Bayesian Coarse Correlated Equilibrium, which captures the interaction between traffic agents in the multimodal context. With the attained equilibrium, decision-making and trajectory planning are performed simultaneously, and the resulting interactive strategy is shown to be optimal over the expectation of rivals' driving intentions. Closed-loop simulations on different traffic scenarios are performed to illustrate the generalizability and the effectiveness of the proposed framework.</p></details> |  |
| **[Chauhan Weighted Trajectory Analysis of combined efficacy and safety outcomes for risk-benefit analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13946v1)** | 2024-09-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Analyzing and effectively communicating the efficacy and toxicity of treatment is the basis of risk benefit analysis (RBA). More efficient and objective tools are needed. We apply Chauhan Weighted Trajectory Analysis (CWTA) to perform RBA with superior objectivity, power, and clarity. We used CWTA to perform 1000-fold simulations of RCTs using ordinal endpoints for both treatment efficacy and toxicity. RCTs were simulated with 1:1 allocation at defined sample sizes and hazard ratios. We studied the simplest case of 3 levels each of toxicity and efficacy and the general case of the advanced cancer trial, with efficacy graded by five RECIST 1.1 health statuses and toxicity by the six-point CTCAE scale (6 x 5 matrix). The latter model was applied to a real-world dose escalation phase I trial in advanced cancer. Simulations in both the 3 x 3 and the 6 x 5 advanced cancer matrix confirmed that drugs with both superior efficacy and toxicity profiles synergize for greater statistical power with CWTA-RBA. The CWTA-RBA 6 x 5 matrix reduced sample size requirements over CWTA efficacy-only analysis. Application to the dose finding phase I clinical trial provided objective, statistically significant validation for the selected dose. CWTA-RBA, by incorporating both drug efficacy and toxicity, provides a single test statistic and plot that analyzes and effectively communicates therapeutic risks and benefits. CWTA-RBA requires fewer patients than CWTA efficacy-only analysis when the experimental drug is both more effective and less toxic. CWTA-RBA facilitates the objective and efficient assessment of new therapies throughout the drug development pathway. Furthermore, several advantages over competing tests in communicating risk-benefit will assist regulatory review, clinical adoption, and understanding of therapeutic risks and benefits by clinicians and patients alike.</p></details> |  |

However, the majority of existing trajectory prediction models have neither considered reducing the uncertainty as one objective during the training stage nor provided reliable uncertainty quantification during inference stage under potential distribution shift. Therefore, in this paper, we propose the Conformal Uncertainty Quantification under Distribution Shift framework, CUQDS, to quantify the uncertainty of the predicted trajectories of existing trajectory prediction models under potential data distribution shift, while considering improving the prediction accuracy of the models and reducing the estimated uncertainty during the training stage. Specifically, CUQDS includes 1) a learning-based Gaussian process regression module that models the output distribution of the base model (any existing trajectory prediction or time series forecasting neural networks) and reduces the estimated uncertainty by additional loss term, and 2) a statistical-based Conformal P control module to calibrate the estimated uncertainty from the Gaussian process regression module in an online setting under potential distribution shift between training and testing data.</p></details> | 9 pages, 2 figures |

The joint angles, the tool orientations and the manufacturing time-sequences are optimized simultaneously on input trajectories with large numbers of waypoints to improve the kinematic smoothness while incorporating the manufacturing constraints. Differently, existing methods always determine them in a decoupled manner. To deal with the large number of waypoints on a toolpath, we propose a decomposition based numerical scheme to optimize the trajectory in an out-of-core manner which can also run in parallel to improve the efficiency. Simulations and physical experiments have been conducted to demonstrate the performance of our method in examples of robot-assisted additive manufacturing.</p></details> |  |
| **[Revisiting Synthetic Human Trajectories: Imitative Generation and Benchmarks Beyond Datasaurus](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13790v1)** | 2024-09-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human trajectory data, which plays a crucial role in various applications such as crowd management and epidemic prevention, is challenging to obtain due to practical constraints and privacy concerns. In this context, synthetic human trajectory data is generated to simulate as close as possible to real-world human trajectories, often under summary statistics and distributional similarities. However, the complexity of human mobility patterns is oversimplified by these similarities (a.k.a. ``Datasaurus''), resulting in intrinsic biases in both generative model design and benchmarks of the generated trajectories. Against this background, we propose MIRAGE, a huMan-Imitative tRAjectory GenErative model designed as a neural Temporal Point Process integrating an Exploration and Preferential Return model. It imitates the human decision-making process in trajectory generation, rather than fitting any specific statistical distributions as traditional methods do, thus avoiding the Datasaurus issue. Moreover, we also propose a comprehensive task-based evaluation protocol beyond Datasaurus to systematically benchmark trajectory generative models on four typical downstream tasks, integrating multiple techniques and evaluation metrics for each task, to comprehensively assess the ultimate utility of the generated trajectories. We conduct a thorough evaluation of MIRAGE on three real-world user trajectory datasets against a sizeable collection of baselines. Results show that compared to the best baselines, MIRAGE-generated trajectory data not only achieves the best statistical and distributional similarities with 59.0-71.5% improvement, but also yields the best performance in the task-based evaluation with 10.9-33.4% improvement.</p></details> |  |
| **[TISIS : Trajectory Indexing for SImilarity Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11301v2)** | 2024-09-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Social media platforms enable users to share diverse types of information, including geolocation data that captures their movement patterns. Such geolocation data can be leveraged to reconstruct the trajectory of a user's visited Points of Interest (POIs). A key requirement in numerous applications is the ability to measure the similarity between such trajectories, as this facilitates the retrieval of trajectories that are similar to a given reference trajectory. This is the main focus of our work. Existing methods predominantly rely on applying a similarity function to each candidate trajectory to identify those that are sufficiently similar. However, this approach becomes computationally expensive when dealing with large-scale datasets. To mitigate this challenge, we propose TISIS, an efficient method that uses trajectory indexing to quickly find similar trajectories that share common POIs in the same order. Furthermore, to account for scenarios where POIs in trajectories may not exactly match but are contextually similar, we introduce TISIS*, a variant of TISIS that incorporates POI embeddings. This extension allows for more comprehensive retrieval of similar trajectories by considering semantic similarities between POIs, beyond mere exact matches. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly outperforms a baseline method based on the well-known Longest Common SubSequence (LCSS) algorithm, yielding substantial performance improvements across various real-world datasets.</p></details> |  |

However, due to the complex and uncertain nature of the driving environment, it is impractical for autonomous vehicles~(AVs) to exhaustively design planning rules for optimizing future trajectories. To address this issue, we propose a local map representation method called Velocity Field. This approach provides heading and velocity priors for trajectory planning tasks, simplifying the planning process in complex urban driving. The heading and velocity priors can be learned from demonstrations of human drivers using our proposed loss. Additionally, we developed an iterative sampling-based planner to train and compare the differences between local map representations. We investigated local map representation forms for planning performance on a real-world dataset. Compared to learned rasterized cost maps, our method demonstrated greater reliability and computational efficiency.</p></details> | ROBIO 2023 |

However, dynamic MRI faces a major challenge: long acquisition times needed to achieve high spatial and temporal resolution. This leads to higher costs, patient discomfort, motion artifacts, and lower image quality. Compressed Sensing (CS) addresses this problem by acquiring a reduced amount of MR data in the Fourier domain, based on a chosen sampling pattern, and reconstructing the full image from this partial data. While various deep learning methods have been developed to optimize these sampling patterns and improve reconstruction, they often struggle with slow optimization and inference times or are limited to specific temporal dimensions used during training. In this work, we introduce a novel deep-compressed sensing approach that uses 3D window attention and flexible, temporally extendable acquisition trajectories. Our method significantly reduces both training and inference times compared to existing approaches, while also adapting to different temporal dimensions during inference without requiring additional training. Tests with real data show that our approach outperforms current state-of-theart techniques. The code for reproducing all experiments will be made available upon acceptance of the paper.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods primarily utilize stochastic optimal control techniques with chance constraints to maintain a minimum distance among agents with a guaranteed probability. However, these approaches face challenges, such as the use of simplifying assumptions that result in linear system models or Gaussian disturbances, which limit their practicality in complex realistic scenarios. To address these limitations, this work introduces a novel probabilistically robust distributed controller enabling autonomous agents to plan safe trajectories, even under non-Gaussian uncertainty and nonlinear systems. Leveraging exact uncertainty propagation techniques based on mixed-trigonometric-polynomial moment propagation, this method transforms non-Gaussian chance constraints into deterministic ones, seamlessly integrating them into a distributed model predictive control framework solvable with standard optimization tools. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of this technique, highlighting its ability to consistently handle various types of uncertainty, ensuring robust and accurate path planning in complex scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>18th ...</summary><p>18th International Conference on Control, Automation, Robotics and Vision (ICARCV 2024)</p></details> |

Arguably, the maritime domain lags behind, as ships operate on many more degrees of freedom (thus, a much larger search space): there is less physical infrastructure, and rules are less consistent and constraining than what is found on roads. The problem is further complicated by the inevitable co-existence of autonomous and human-operated ships: the latter may take unpredictable decisions, which require adjustments on the autonomous ones. Finally, the problem is inherently decentralised, there is no central authority, and communication means can be very diverse in terms of communication distance and performance, mandating special care on which information is shared and how. In this work, we elaborate on the challenges of trajectory prediction and adaptation for mixed autonomous and human-operated ships, and we propose initial ideas on potential approaches to address them.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to SISSY 2024</p></details> |

As opposed to the standard method of uniformly sampling control inputs (which lead to biased samples of the configuration space), C-Uniform trajectories are generated by control actions which lead to uniform sampling of the configuration space. After presenting an intuitive closed-form solution to generate C-Uniform trajectories for the 1D random-walker, we present a network-flow based optimization method to precompute C-Uniform trajectories for general robot systems. We apply the notion of C-Uniformity to the design of Model Predictive Path Integral controllers. Through simulation experiments, we show that using C-Uniform trajectories significantly improves the performance of MPPI-style controllers, achieving up to 40% coverage performance gain compared to the best baseline. We demonstrate the practical applicability of our method with an implementation on a 1/10th scale racer.</p></details> |  |

This method leverages the similarities between language statements and trajectories, both of which consist of ordered elements requiring coherence through external rules and contextual variations. By treating trajectories as sequences of tokens, our model learns the probability distributions over trajectories, enabling the identification of anomalous locations with high precision. We incorporate user-specific tokens to account for individual behavior patterns, enhancing anomaly detection tailored to user context. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of LM-TAD on both synthetic and real-world datasets. In particular, the model outperforms existing methods on the Pattern of Life (PoL) dataset by detecting user-contextual anomalies and achieves competitive results on the Porto taxi dataset, highlighting its adaptability and robustness. Additionally, we introduce the use of perplexity and surprisal rate metrics for detecting outliers and pinpointing specific anomalous locations within trajectories. The LM-TAD framework supports various trajectory representations, including GPS coordinates, staypoints, and activity types, proving its versatility in handling diverse trajectory data. Moreover, our approach is well-suited for online trajectory anomaly detection, significantly reducing computational latency by caching key-value states of the attention mechanism, thereby avoiding repeated computations.</p></details> |  |

However, this task is generally nontrivial due to the inherent stochasticity of human motion, which naturally requires the predictor to generate multi-modal prediction. Previous works leverage various generative methods, such as GAN and VAE, for pedestrian trajectory prediction. Nevertheless, these methods may suffer from mode collapse and relatively low-quality results. The denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) has recently been applied to trajectory prediction due to its simple training process and powerful reconstruction ability. However, current diffusion-based methods do not fully utilize input information and usually require many denoising iterations that lead to a long inference time or an additional network for initialization. To address these challenges and facilitate the use of diffusion models in multi-modal trajectory prediction, we propose GDTS, a novel Goal-Guided Diffusion Model with Tree Sampling for multi-modal trajectory prediction. Considering the "goal-driven" characteristics of human motion, GDTS leverages goal estimation to guide the generation of the diffusion network. A two-stage tree sampling algorithm is presented, which leverages common features to reduce the inference time and improve accuracy for multi-modal prediction. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed framework achieves comparable state-of-the-art performance with real-time inference speed in public datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ICRA 2025</p></details> |

In the existing literatures, All-Wheel-Steering (AWS) robots, incorporating modes such as rotation-free translation maneuvers, in-situ rotational maneuvers, and proportional steering, exhibit inefficient performance due to time-consuming mode switches. This inefficiency arises from wheel rotation constraints and inter-wheel cooperation requirements. The direct application of a holonomic moving strategy can lead to significant slip angles or even structural failure. Additionally, the limited steering range of AWS wheeled robots exacerbates non-linearity characteristics, thereby complicating control processes. To address these challenges, we developed a novel planning method termed Constrained AWS (C-AWS), which integrates second-order discrete search with predictive control techniques. Experimental results demonstrate that our method adeptly generates feasible and smooth trajectories for C-AWS while adhering to steering angle constraints.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by iROS 2024</p></details> |

Understanding environmental dynamics is challenging, not only due to the complexities of modeling pair-wise spatial and temporal interactions but also the diverse influence of group-wise interactions. To decode the comprehensive pair-wise and group-wise interactions in crowded scenarios, we introduce Hyper-STTN, a Hypergraph-based Spatial-Temporal Transformer Network for crowd trajectory prediction. In Hyper-STTN, crowded group-wise correlations are constructed using a set of multi-scale hypergraphs with varying group sizes, captured through random-walk robability-based hypergraph spectral convolution. Additionally, a spatial-temporal transformer is adapted to capture pedestrians' pair-wise latent interactions in spatial-temporal dimensions. These heterogeneous group-wise and pair-wise are then fused and aligned though a multimodal transformer network. Hyper-STTN outperformes other state-of-the-art baselines and ablation models on 5 real-world pedestrian motion datasets.</p></details> |  |

In particular, reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise in the synthesis of controllers for systems with complex dynamics and modest online compute budgets. However, the poor sample efficiency of RL and the challenges of reward design make training slow and sometimes unstable, especially for high-dimensional systems. In this work, we leverage the inherent Lie group symmetries of robotic systems with a floating base to mitigate these challenges when learning tracking controllers. We model a general tracking problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) that captures the evolution of both the physical and reference states. Next, we prove that symmetry in the underlying dynamics and running costs leads to an MDP homomorphism, a mapping that allows a policy trained on a lower-dimensional "quotient" MDP to be lifted to an optimal tracking controller for the original system. We compare this symmetry-informed approach to an unstructured baseline, using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to learn tracking controllers for three systems: the Particle (a forced point mass), the Astrobee (a fullyactuated space robot), and the Quadrotor (an underactuated system). Results show that a symmetry-aware approach both accelerates training and reduces tracking error after the same number of training steps.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The first three authors contributed equally to this work</p></details> |

Pseudo-labeling approaches to semi-supervised learning adopt a teacher-student framework in which machine-generated pseudo-labels on a large unlabeled dataset are used in combination with a small manually-labeled dataset for training. In this work, we address the problem of improving pseudo-label quality through leveraging long-term temporal information captured in driving scenes. More specifically, we leverage pre-trained motion-forecasting models to generate object trajectories on pseudo-labeled data to further enhance the student model training. Our approach improves pseudo-label quality in two distinct manners: first, we suppress false positive pseudo-labels through establishing consistency across multiple frames of motion forecasting outputs. Second, we compensate for false negative detections by directly inserting predicted object tracks into the pseudo-labeled scene. Experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, improving the performance of standard semi-supervised approaches in a variety of settings.</p></details> |  |

However, the nonlinear optimization solvers required remain too slow for use on relatively resource-constrained flight-grade computers. In this work, we turn towards amortized optimization, a learning-based technique for accelerating optimization run times, and present TOAST: Trajectory Optimization with Merit Function Warm Starts. Offline, using data collected from a simulation, we train a neural network to learn a mapping to the full primal and dual solutions given the problem parameters. Crucially, we build upon recent results from decision-focused learning and present a set of decision-focused loss functions using the notion of merit functions for optimization problems. We show that training networks with such constraint-informed losses can better encode the structure of the trajectory optimization problem and jointly learn to reconstruct the primal-dual solution while yielding improved constraint satisfaction. Through numerical experiments on a Lunar rover problem and a 3-degrees-of-freedom Mars powered descent guidance problem, we demonstrate that TOAST outperforms benchmark approaches in terms of both computation times and network prediction constraint satisfaction.</p></details> |  |

However, predictive modeling of such data remains challenging due to high dimensionality, irregular sampling, and data sparsity. To address these issues, we propose ImageFlowNet, a novel model designed to forecast disease trajectories from initial images while preserving spatial details. ImageFlowNet first learns multiscale joint representation spaces across patients and time points, then optimizes deterministic or stochastic flow fields within these spaces using a position-parameterized neural ODE/SDE framework. The model leverages a UNet architecture to create robust multiscale representations and mitigates data scarcity by combining knowledge from all patients. We provide theoretical insights that support our formulation of ODEs, and motivate our regularizations involving high-level visual features, latent space organization, and trajectory smoothness. We validate ImageFlowNet on three longitudinal medical image datasets depicting progression in geographic atrophy, multiple sclerosis, and glioblastoma, demonstrating its ability to effectively forecast disease progression and outperform existing methods. Our contributions include the development of ImageFlowNet, its theoretical underpinnings, and empirical validation on real-world datasets.

This formulation provides a new framework for analyzing and designing feedback control laws. We show that any stable closed-loop system can be expressed in this form with appropriate values for the step size and value matrices. Furthermore, we show that this parameterization of the closed-loop system is equivalent to a linear quadratic regulator for appropriately chosen weighting matrices. We also show that trajectories can be shaped using this approach to achieve a desired closed-loop behavior.</p></details> |  |

Despite its popularity, limited attention has been paid to summarizing the treatment history in the outcome model, which proves particularly challenging when individuals' treatment trajectories exhibit complex patterns over time. Commonly used metrics such as the average treatment level fail to adequately capture the treatment history, hindering causal interpretation. For scenarios where treatment histories exhibit distinct temporal patterns, we develop a new approach to parameterize the outcome model. We apply latent growth curve analysis to identify representative treatment trajectories from the observed data and use the posterior probability of latent class membership to summarize the different treatment trajectories. We demonstrate its use in parameterizing the MSMs, which facilitates the interpretations of the results. We apply the method to analyze data from an existing cohort of lung transplant recipients to estimate the effect of Tacrolimus concentrations on the risk of incident chronic kidney disease.</p></details> | <details><summary>We ha...</summary><p>We have discovered that the core idea of our paper overlaps with a previously published work.

By accurately forecasting the movements of other road users, the decision-making capabilities of the autonomous system can be enhanced, making it more effective in responding to dynamic and unpredictable environments and more adaptive to diverse road scenarios. This paper presents the FFStreams++ approach for decision-making and motion planning of different maneuvers, including unprotected left turn, overtaking, and keep-lane. FFStreams++ is a combination of sampling-based and search-based approaches, where iteratively new sampled trajectories for different maneuvers are generated and optimized, and afterward, a heuristic search planner is called, searching for an optimal plan. We model the autonomous diving system in the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) and search for the optimal plan using a heuristic Fast-Forward planner. In this approach, the initial state of the problem is modified iteratively through streams, which will generate maneuver-specific trajectory candidates, increasing the iterating level until an optimal plan is found. FFStreams++ integrates a query-connected network model for predicting possible future trajectories for each surrounding obstacle along with their probabilities. The proposed approach was tested on the CommonRoad simulation framework. We use a collection of randomly generated driving scenarios for overtaking and unprotected left turns at intersections to evaluate the FFStreams++ planner. The test results confirmed that the proposed approach can effectively execute various maneuvers to ensure safety and reduce the risk of collisions with nearby traffic agents.</p></details> | 17 pages, 8 figures |

The proposed approach leverages measured data acquired through an input-output observation, referred to as a single trajectory, collected over a specified time horizon. By fulfilling a certain rank condition, which ensures the unknown system is persistently excited by the collected data, we design a CBC and its corresponding safety controller directly from the finite-length observed data, without explicitly identifying the unknown dynamical system. This is achieved through proposing a data-based sum-of-squares optimization (SOS) program to systematically design CBCs and their safety controllers. We validate our data-driven approach over two physical case studies including a jet engine and a Lorenz system, demonstrating the efficacy of our proposed method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Model Predictive Planning: Trajectory Planning in Obstruction-Dense Environments for Low-Agility Aircraft](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16024v2)** | 2024-09-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present Model Predictive Planning (MPP), a trajectory planner for low-agility vehicles such as a fixed-wing aircraft to navigate obstacle-laden environments. MPP consists of (1) a multi-path planning procedure that identifies candidate paths, (2) a raytracing procedure that generates linear constraints around these paths to enforce obstacle avoidance, and (3) a convex quadratic program that finds a feasible trajectory within these constraints if one exists. Low-agility aircraft cannot track arbitrary paths, so refining a given path into a trajectory that respects the vehicle's limited maneuverability and avoids obstacles often leads to an infeasible optimization problem. The critical feature of MPP is that it efficiently considers multiple candidate paths during the refinement process, thereby greatly increasing the chance of finding a feasible and trackable trajectory. We demonstrate the effectiveness of MPP on a longitudinal aircraft model.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Entry Generalized Search Trees for Indexing Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05327v2)** | 2024-09-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The idea of generalized indices is one of the success stories of database systems research. It has found its way to implementation in common database systems. GiST (Generalized Search Tree) and SP-GiST (Space-Partitioned Generalized Search Tree) are two widely-used generalized indices that are typically used for multidimensional data. Currently, the generalized indices GiST and SP-GiST represent one database object using one index entry, e.g., a bounding box for each spatio-temporal object. However, when dealing with complex objects, e.g., moving object trajectories, a single entry per object is inadequate for creating efficient indices. Previous research has highlighted that splitting trajectories into multiple bounding boxes prior to indexing can enhance query performance as it leads to a higher index filter. In this paper, we introduce MGiST and MSP-GiST, the multi-entry generalized search tree counterparts of GiST and SP-GiST, respectively, that are designed to enable the partitioning of objects into multiple entries during insertion. The methods for decomposing a complex object into multiple sub-objects differ from one data type to another, and may depend on some domain-specific parameters. Thus, MGiST and MSP-GiST are designed to allow for pluggable modules that aid in optimizing the split of an object into multiple sub-objects. We demonstrate the usefulness of MGiST and MSP-GiST using a trajectory indexing scenario, where we realize several trajectory indexes using MGiST and MSP-GiST and instantiate these search trees with trajectory-specific splitting algorithms. We create and test the performance of several multi-entry versions of widely-used spatial index structures, e.g., R-Tree, Quad-Tree, and KD-Tree. We conduct evaluations using both synthetic and real-world data, and observe up to an order of magnitude enhancement in performance of point, range, and KNN queries.</p></details> |  |

Existing cross-domain policy transfer methods mostly aim at learning domain correspondences or corrections to facilitate policy learning, which requires learning domain/task-specific model components, representations, or policies that are inflexible or not fully reusable to accommodate arbitrary domains and tasks. These issues make us wonder: can we directly bridge the domain gap at the data (trajectory) level, instead of devising complicated, domain-specific policy transfer models? In this study, we propose a Cross-Domain Trajectory EDiting (xTED) framework with a new diffusion transformer model (Decision Diffusion Transformer, DDiT) that captures the trajectory distribution from the target dataset as a prior. The proposed diffusion transformer backbone captures the intricate dependencies among state, action, and reward sequences, as well as the transition dynamics within the target data trajectories. With the above pre-trained diffusion prior, source data trajectories with domain gaps can be transformed into edited trajectories that closely resemble the target data distribution through the diffusion-based editing process, which implicitly corrects the underlying domain gaps, enhancing the state realism and dynamics reliability in source trajectory data, while enabling flexible choices of downstream policy learning methods. Despite its simplicity, xTED demonstrates superior performance against other baselines in extensive simulation and real-robot experiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>xTED ...</summary><p>xTED offers a novel, generic, flexible, simple and effective paradigm that casts cross-domain policy adaptation as a data pre-processing problem</p></details> |

One of the main reasons is the computationally long planning times that come with a large state space. Trajectory optimisation algorithms have proved their utility in a wide variety of tasks, but, like most methods struggle scaling to the high dimensional systems ubiquitous to non-prehensile manipulation in clutter as well as deformable object manipulation. We reason that, during manipulation, different degrees of freedom will become more or less important to the task over time as the system evolves. We leverage this idea to reduce the number of degrees of freedom considered in a trajectory optimisation problem, to reduce planning times. This idea is particularly relevant in the context of model predictive control (MPC) where the cost landscape of the optimisation problem is constantly evolving. We provide simulation results under asynchronous MPC and show our methods are capable of achieving better overall performance due to the decreased policy lag whilst still being able to optimise trajectories effectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 4 figures, accepted to WAFR 2024</p></details> |

There are several different types of deriving mechanisms considering the real-world applications, including two-wheeled, four-wheeled skid-steering, tracked robots, etc. The differences in the driving mechanism usually require specific kinematic modeling when precise controlling is desired. Furthermore, the nonholonomic dynamics and possible lateral slip lead to different degrees of difficulty in getting feasible and high-quality trajectories. Therefore, a comprehensive trajectory optimization framework to compute trajectories efficiently for various kinds of differential-driven robots is highly desirable. In this paper, we propose a universal trajectory optimization framework that can be applied to differential-driven robot class, enabling the generation of high-quality trajectories within a restricted computational timeframe. We introduce a novel trajectory representation based on polynomial parameterization of motion states or their integrals, such as angular and linear velocities, that inherently matching robots' motion to the control principle for differential-driven robot class. The trajectory optimization problem is formulated to minimize complexity while prioritizing safety and operational efficiency. We then build a full-stack autonomous planning and control system to show the feasibility and robustness. We conduct extensive simulations and real-world testing in crowded environments with three kinds of differential-driven robots to validate the effectiveness of our approach. We will release our method as an open-source package.</p></details> | 15 pages, 15 figures |

However, their black-box nature poses significant challenges to closed-loop stability guarantees and performance analysis. In this paper, we introduce a structured DNN-based controller for the trajectory tracking control of Lagrangian systems using backing techniques. By properly designing neural network structures, the proposed controller can ensure closed-loop stability for any compatible neural network parameters. In addition, improved control performance can be achieved by further optimizing neural network parameters. Besides, we provide explicit upper bounds on tracking errors in terms of controller parameters, which allows us to achieve the desired tracking performance by properly selecting the controller parameters. Furthermore, when system models are unknown, we propose an improved Lagrangian neural network (LNN) structure to learn the system dynamics and design the controller. We show that in the presence of model approximation errors and external disturbances, the closed-loop stability and tracking control performance can still be guaranteed. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated through simulations.</p></details> |  |

Interpretability tools could enable users to understand and evaluate possible flaws in learned reward functions. We propose Counterfactual Trajectory Explanations (CTEs) to interpret reward functions in reinforcement learning by contrasting an original with a counterfactual partial trajectory and the rewards they each receive. We derive six quality criteria for CTEs and propose a novel Monte-Carlo-based algorithm for generating CTEs that optimises these quality criteria. Finally, we measure how informative the generated explanations are to a proxy-human model by training it on CTEs. CTEs are demonstrably informative for the proxy-human model, increasing the similarity between its predictions and the reward function on unseen trajectories. Further, it learns to accurately judge differences in rewards between trajectories and generalises to out-of-distribution examples. Although CTEs do not lead to a perfect understanding of the reward, our method, and more generally the adaptation of XAI methods, are presented as a fruitful approach for interpreting learned reward functions.</p></details> |  |

However, publicly available trajectory datasets remain limited in scale due to privacy concerns, which hinders the development of trajectory data mining and trajectory-based applications. To address this issue, some methods for generating synthetic trajectories have been proposed to expand the scale of the dataset. However, all existing methods generate trajectories in the geographical coordinate system, which poses two limitations for their utilization in practical applications: 1) the inability to ensure that the generated trajectories are constrained on the road. 2) the lack of road-related information. In this paper, we propose a new problem to meet the practical application need, \emph{i.e.}, road network-constrained trajectory (RNTraj) generation, which can directly generate trajectories on the road network with road-related information. RNTraj is a hybrid type of data, in which each point is represented by a discrete road segment and a continuous moving rate. To generate RNTraj, we design a diffusion model called Diff-RNTraj. This model can effectively handle the hybrid RNTraj using a continuous diffusion framework by incorporating a pre-training strategy to embed hybrid RNTraj into continuous representations. During the sampling stage, a RNTraj decoder is designed to map the continuous representation generated by the diffusion model back to the hybrid RNTraj format. Furthermore, Diff-RNTraj introduces a novel loss function to enhance the spatial validity of the generated trajectories. Extensive experiments conducted on two real-world trajectory datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted as a regular paper at IEEE TKDE</p></details> |

While much progress has been made in the last two decades, network inference remains an open problem. For systems observed at steady state, limited insights are available since temporal information is unavailable and thus causal information is lost. Two common avenues for gaining causal insights into system behaviour are to leverage temporal dynamics in the form of trajectories, and to apply interventions such as knock-out perturbations. We propose an approach for leveraging both dynamical and perturbational single cell data to jointly learn cellular trajectories and power network inference. Our approach is motivated by min-entropy estimation for stochastic dynamics and can infer directed and signed networks from time-stamped single cell snapshots.</p></details> | 14 pages, 6 figures |

Several existing deep generative solutions propose learning from real trajectories to generate synthetic ones. Despite the progress, most of them suffer from training stability issues and scale poorly with growing data size. More importantly, they generally lack control mechanisms to steer the generated trajectories based on spatiotemporal constraints such as fixing specific visits. To address such limitations, we formally define the controlled trajectory generation problem with spatiotemporal constraints and propose Geo-Llama. This novel LLM-inspired framework enforces explicit visit constraints in a contextually coherent way. It fine-tunes pre-trained LLMs on trajectories with a visit-wise permutation strategy where each visit corresponds to a time and location. This enables the model to capture the spatiotemporal patterns regardless of visit orders and allows flexible and in-context constraint integration through prompts during generation. Extensive experiments on real-world and synthetic datasets validate the effectiveness of Geo-Llama, demonstrating its versatility and robustness in handling a broad range of constraints to generate more realistic trajectories compared to existing methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[What's Wrong with the Absolute Trajectory Error?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.05376v5)** | 2024-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One of the limitations of the commonly used Absolute Trajectory Error (ATE) is that it is highly sensitive to outliers. As a result, in the presence of just a few outliers, it often fails to reflect the varying accuracy as the inlier trajectory error or the number of outliers varies. In this work, we propose an alternative error metric for evaluating the accuracy of the reconstructed camera trajectory. Our metric, named Discernible Trajectory Error (DTE), is computed in five steps: (1) Shift the ground-truth and estimated trajectories such that both of their geometric medians are located at the origin. (2) Rotate the estimated trajectory such that it minimizes the sum of geodesic distances between the corresponding camera orientations. (3) Scale the estimated trajectory such that the median distance of the cameras to their geometric median is the same as that of the ground truth. (4) Compute, winsorize and normalize the distances between the corresponding cameras. (5) Obtain the DTE by taking the average of the mean and the root-mean-square (RMS) of the resulting distances. This metric is an attractive alternative to the ATE, in that it is capable of discerning the varying trajectory accuracy as the inlier trajectory error or the number of outliers varies. Using the similar idea, we also propose a novel rotation error metric, named Discernible Rotation Error (DRE), which has similar advantages to the DTE. Furthermore, we propose a simple yet effective method for calibrating the camera-to-marker rotation, which is needed for the computation of our metrics. Our methods are verified through extensive simulations.</p></details> | <details><summary>The m...</summary><p>The main part of this manuscript (except the part on DRE) has been accepted to ECCV 2024 Workshop HALF-CENTURY OF STRUCTURE-FROM-MOTION (50SFM)</p></details> |

However, these methods do not model constraints crucial to ensure safety of the learned skill. Moreover, even when explicitly modelling constraints, they rely on the assumption of a known cost function, which limits their practical usability for task with unknown cost. In this work we propose a two-step optimization process that allow to estimate cost and constraints by decoupling the learning of cost functions from the identification of unknown constraints within the demonstrated trajectories. Initially, we identify the cost function by isolating the effect of constraints on parts of the demonstrations. Subsequently, a constraint leaning method is used to identify the unknown constraints. Our approach is validated both on simulated trajectories and a real robotic manipulation task. Our experiments show the impact that incorrect cost estimation has on the learned constraints and illustrate how the proposed method is able to infer unknown constraints, such as obstacles, from demonstrated trajectories without any initial knowledge of the cost.</p></details> | <details><summary>(Acce...</summary><p>(Accepted/In press) 2024 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)</p></details> |
| **[Almost Global Trajectory Tracking for Quadrotors Using Thrust Direction Control on $\mathcal{S}^2$](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05702v1)** | 2024-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many of the existing works on quadrotor control address the trajectory tracking problem by employing a cascade design in which the translational and rotational dynamics are stabilized by two separate controllers. The stability of the cascade is often proved by employing trajectory-based arguments, most notably, integral input-to-state stability. In this paper, we follow a different route and present a control law ensuring that a composite function constructed from the translational and rotational tracking errors is a Lyapunov function for the closed-loop cascade. In particular, starting from a generic control law for the double integrator, we develop a suitable attitude control extension, by leveraging a backstepping-like procedure. Using this construction, we provide an almost global stability certificate. The proposed design employs the unit sphere $\mathcal{S}^2$ to describe the rotational degrees of freedom required for position control. This enables a simpler controller tuning and an improved tracking performance with respect to previous global solutions. The new design is demonstrated via numerical simulations and on real-world experiments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Interactive incremental learning of generalizable skills with local trajectory modulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05655v1)** | 2024-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The problem of generalization in learning from demonstration (LfD) has received considerable attention over the years, particularly within the context of movement primitives, where a number of approaches have emerged. Recently, two important approaches have gained recognition. While one leverages via-points to adapt skills locally by modulating demonstrated trajectories, another relies on so-called task-parameterized models that encode movements with respect to different coordinate systems, using a product of probabilities for generalization. While the former are well-suited to precise, local modulations, the latter aim at generalizing over large regions of the workspace and often involve multiple objects. Addressing the quality of generalization by leveraging both approaches simultaneously has received little attention. In this work, we propose an interactive imitation learning framework that simultaneously leverages local and global modulations of trajectory distributions. Building on the kernelized movement primitives (KMP) framework, we introduce novel mechanisms for skill modulation from direct human corrective feedback. Our approach particularly exploits the concept of via-points to incrementally and interactively 1) improve the model accuracy locally, 2) add new objects to the task during execution and 3) extend the skill into regions where demonstrations were not provided. We evaluate our method on a bearing ring-loading task using a torque-controlled, 7-DoF, DLR SARA robot.</p></details> | 21 pages, 16 figures |

However, they do not involve explicit reasoning like classic robotics workflow, nor planning with horizons, leading strategies implicit and myopic. In this paper, we introduce our trajectory planning method that uses Behavioral Cloning (BC) for path-tracking and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) bootstrapped by BC for static obstacle nudging. It outputs lateral offset values to adjust the given reference trajectory, and performs modified path for different controllers. Our experimental results show that the algorithm can do path-tracking that mimics the expert performance, and avoiding collision to fixed obstacles by trial and errors. This method makes a good attempt at planning with learning-based methods in trajectory planning problems of autonomous driving.</p></details> | 6 pages, 7 figures |

Parallel prioritized planning offers approximately consistent computation time regardless of the number of vehicles but struggles to guarantee collision-free trajectories. Conversely, sequential prioritized planning can guarantee collision-freeness but results in increased computation time as the number of sequentially computing vehicles, which we term computation levels, grows. This number is determined by the directed coupling graph resulted from the coupling and prioritization of vehicles. In this work, we guarantee safe trajectories in parallel planning through reachability analysis. Although these trajectories are collision-free, they tend to be conservative. We address this by planning with a subset of vehicles in sequence. We formulate the problem of selecting this subset as a graph partitioning problem that allows us to independently set computation levels. Our simulations demonstrate a reduction in computation levels by approximately 64% compared to sequential prioritized planning while maintaining the solution quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 4 figures.

| **[Leveraging Moving Sound Source Trajectories for Universal Sound Separation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04843v1)** | 2024-09-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing methods utilizing spatial information for sound source separation require prior knowledge of the direction of arrival (DOA) of the source or utilize estimated but imprecise localization results, which impairs the separation performance, especially when the sound sources are moving. In fact, sound source localization and separation are interconnected problems, that is, sound source localization facilitates sound separation while sound separation contributes to more precise source localization. This paper proposes a method utilizing the mutual facilitation mechanism between sound source localization and separation for moving sources. Initially, sound separation is conducted using rough preliminary sound source tracking results. Sound source tracking is then performed on the separated signals thus the tracking results can become more precise. The precise trajectory can further enhances the separation performance. This mutual facilitation process can be performed over several iterations. Simulation experiments conducted under reverberation conditions and with moving sound sources demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve more accurate separation based on more precise tracking results.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages,7 figures,submitted to IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio, Speech and Language Processing(TASLP)</p></details> |
| **[Learning Generalizable Tool-use Skills through Trajectory Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00156v5)** | 2024-09-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous systems that efficiently utilize tools can assist humans in completing many common tasks such as cooking and cleaning. However, current systems fall short of matching human-level of intelligence in terms of adapting to novel tools. Prior works based on affordance often make strong assumptions about the environments and cannot scale to more complex, contact-rich tasks. In this work, we tackle this challenge and explore how agents can learn to use previously unseen tools to manipulate deformable objects. We propose to learn a generative model of the tool-use trajectories as a sequence of tool point clouds, which generalizes to different tool shapes. Given any novel tool, we first generate a tool-use trajectory and then optimize the sequence of tool poses to align with the generated trajectory. We train a single model on four different challenging deformable object manipulation tasks, using demonstration data from only one tool per task. The model generalizes to various novel tools, significantly outperforming baselines. We further test our trained policy in the real world with unseen tools, where it achieves the performance comparable to human.

Conventional methods of optimizing the spray gun trajectory based on simulated thickness can only qualitatively reflect the color distribution, and can not simulate the color effect of spray painting at the pixel level. Therefore, it is not possible to accurately control the area covered by the color and the gradation of the edges of the area, and it is also difficult to deal with the situation where multiple colors of paint are sprayed in combination. To solve the above problems, this paper is inspired by the Kubelka-Munk model and combines the 3D machine vision method and artificial neural network to propose a spray painting color effect prediction method. The method is enabled to predict the execution effect of the spray gun trajectory with pixel-level accuracy from the dimension of the surface color of the workpiece after spray painting. On this basis, the method can be used to replace the traditional thickness simulation method to establish the objective function of the spray gun trajectory optimization problem, and thus solve the difficult problem of spray gun trajectory optimization for multi-color paint combination spraying. In this paper, the mathematical model of the spray painting color effect prediction problem is first determined through the analysis of the Kubelka-Munk paint film color rendering model, and at the same time, the spray painting color effect dataset is established with the help of the depth camera and point cloud processing algorithm. After that, the multilayer perceptron model was improved with the help of gating and residual structure and was used for the color prediction task. To verify ...</p></details> |  |
| **[Reinforcement Learning Approach to Optimizing Profilometric Sensor Trajectories for Surface Inspection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03429v1)** | 2024-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-precision surface defect detection in manufacturing is essential for ensuring quality control. Laser triangulation profilometric sensors are key to this process, providing detailed and accurate surface measurements over a line. To achieve a complete and precise surface scan, accurate relative motion between the sensor and the workpiece is required. It is crucial to control the sensor pose to maintain optimal distance and relative orientation to the surface. It is also important to ensure uniform profile distribution throughout the scanning process. This paper presents a novel Reinforcement Learning (RL) based approach to optimize robot inspection trajectories for profilometric sensors. Building upon the Boustrophedon scanning method, our technique dynamically adjusts the sensor position and tilt to maintain optimal orientation and distance from the surface, while also ensuring a consistent profile distance for uniform and high-quality scanning. Utilizing a simulated environment based on the CAD model of the part, we replicate real-world scanning conditions, including sensor noise and surface irregularities. This simulation-based approach enables offline trajectory planning based on CAD models. Key contributions include the modeling of the state space, action space, and reward function, specifically designed for inspection applications using profilometric sensors. We use Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm to efficiently train the RL agent, demonstrating its capability to optimize inspection trajectories with profilometric sensors. To validate our approach, we conducted several experiments where a model trained on a specific training piece was tested on various parts in simulation. Also, we conducted a real-world experiment by executing the optimized trajectory, generated offline from a CAD model, to inspect a part using a UR3e robotic arm model.</p></details> |  |
| **[Model Predictive Online Trajectory Planning for Adaptive Battery Discharging in Fuel Cell Vehicle](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03201v1)** | 2024-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents an online trajectory planning approach for optimal coordination of Fuel Cell (FC) and battery in plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle (HEV). One of the main challenges in energy management of plug-in HEV is generating State-of-Charge (SOC) reference curves by optimally depleting battery under high uncertainties in driving scenarios. Recent studies have begun to explore the potential of utilizing partial trip information for optimal SOC trajectory planning, but dynamic responses of the FC system are not taken into account. On the other hand, research focusing on dynamic operation of FC systems often focuses on air flow management, and battery has been treated only partially. Our aim is to fill this gap by designing an online trajectory planner for dynamic coordination of FC and battery systems that works with a high-level SOC planner in a hierarchical manner. We propose an iterative LQR based online trajectory planning method where the amount of electricity dischargeable at each driving segment can be explicitly and adaptively specified by the high-level planner. Numerical results are provided as a proof of concept example to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[MADiff: Motion-Aware Mamba Diffusion Models for Hand Trajectory Prediction on Egocentric Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02638v1)** | 2024-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding human intentions and actions through egocentric videos is important on the path to embodied artificial intelligence. As a branch of egocentric vision techniques, hand trajectory prediction plays a vital role in comprehending human motion patterns, benefiting downstream tasks in extended reality and robot manipulation. However, capturing high-level human intentions consistent with reasonable temporal causality is challenging when only egocentric videos are available. This difficulty is exacerbated under camera egomotion interference and the absence of affordance labels to explicitly guide the optimization of hand waypoint distribution. In this work, we propose a novel hand trajectory prediction method dubbed MADiff, which forecasts future hand waypoints with diffusion models. The devised denoising operation in the latent space is achieved by our proposed motion-aware Mamba, where the camera wearer's egomotion is integrated to achieve motion-driven selective scan (MDSS). To discern the relationship between hands and scenarios without explicit affordance supervision, we leverage a foundation model that fuses visual and language features to capture high-level semantics from video clips. Comprehensive experiments conducted on five public datasets with the existing and our proposed new evaluation metrics demonstrate that MADiff predicts comparably reasonable hand trajectories compared to the state-of-the-art baselines, and achieves real-time performance. We will release our code and pretrained models of MADiff at the project page: https://irmvlab.github.io/madiff.github.io.</p></details> |  |

Although traditional equations and Machine Learning (ML) models using clinical and laboratory data can estimate eGFR, accurately predicting future eGFR levels remains a significant challenge for nephrologists and ML researchers. Recent advances demonstrate that Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) can serve as robust foundation models for diverse applications. This study investigates the potential of LMMs to predict future eGFR levels with a dataset consisting of laboratory and clinical values from 50 patients. By integrating various prompting techniques and ensembles of LMMs, our findings suggest that these models, when combined with precise prompts and visual representations of eGFR trajectories, offer predictive performance comparable to existing ML models. This research extends the application of foundation models and suggests avenues for future studies to harness these models in addressing complex medical forecasting challenges.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This preprint version includes corrections of typographical errors related to numerical values in Table 2, which were present in the version published at the BDH workshop in MIPR 2024.

| **[Joint Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction through Posterior Sampling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00237v2)** | 2024-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Joint pedestrian trajectory prediction has long grappled with the inherent unpredictability of human behaviors. Recent investigations employing variants of conditional diffusion models in trajectory prediction have exhibited notable success. Nevertheless, the heavy dependence on accurate historical data results in their vulnerability to noise disturbances and data incompleteness. To improve the robustness and reliability, we introduce the Guided Full Trajectory Diffuser (GFTD), a novel diffusion model framework that captures the joint full (historical and future) trajectory distribution. By learning from the full trajectory, GFTD can recover the noisy and missing data, hence improving the robustness. In addition, GFTD can adapt to data imperfections without additional training requirements, leveraging posterior sampling for reliable prediction and controllable generation. Our approach not only simplifies the prediction process but also enhances generalizability in scenarios with noise and incomplete inputs. Through rigorous experimental evaluation, GFTD exhibits superior performance in both trajectory prediction and controllable generation.</p></details> |  |

While promising approaches exist, they are often not publicly available, revolve around pedestrian datasets excluding traffic-related information, or resemble architectures that are either not real-time capable or robust. To address these limitations, we first introduce a dedicated benchmark based on Argoverse 2, specifically targeting pedestrians in urban settings. Following this, we present Snapshot, a modular, feed-forward neural network that outperforms the current state of the art while utilizing significantly less information. Despite its agent-centric encoding scheme, Snapshot demonstrates scalability, real-time performance, and robustness to varying motion histories. Moreover, by integrating Snapshot into a modular autonomous driving software stack, we showcase its real-world applicability</p></details> | 8 Pages, 9 Figures |

One fundamental difficulty stands in the evolution of the trajectory that becomes more and more uncertain and unpredictable as the time horizon grows, subsequently increasing the complexity of the problem. To overcome this issue, in this paper, we propose Di-Long, a new method that employs the distillation of a short-term trajectory model forecaster that guides a student network for long-term trajectory prediction during the training process. Given a total sequence length that comprehends the allowed observation for the student network and the complementary target sequence, we let the student and the teacher solve two different related tasks defined over the same full trajectory: the student observes a short sequence and predicts a long trajectory, whereas the teacher observes a longer sequence and predicts the remaining short target trajectory. The teacher's task is less uncertain, and we use its accurate predictions to guide the student through our knowledge distillation framework, reducing long-term future uncertainty. Our experiments show that our proposed Di-Long method is effective for long-term forecasting and achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Intersection Drone Dataset (inD) and the Stanford Drone Dataset (SDD).</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IROS 2024</p></details> |

| **[Fast and Certifiable Trajectory Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05846v3)** | 2024-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose semidefinite trajectory optimization (STROM), a framework that computes fast and certifiably optimal solutions for nonconvex trajectory optimization problems defined by polynomial objectives and constraints. STROM employs sparse second-order Lasserre's hierarchy to generate semidefinite program (SDP) relaxations of trajectory optimization. Different from existing tools (e.g., YALMIP and SOSTOOLS in Matlab), STROM generates chain-like multiple-block SDPs with only positive semidefinite (PSD) variables. Moreover, STROM does so two orders of magnitude faster. Underpinning STROM is cuADMM, the first ADMM-based SDP solver implemented in CUDA and runs in GPUs (with C/C++ extension). cuADMM builds upon the symmetric Gauss-Seidel ADMM algorithm and leverages GPU parallelization to speedup solving sparse linear systems and projecting onto PSD cones. In five trajectory optimization problems (inverted pendulum, cart-pole, vehicle landing, flying robot, and car back-in), cuADMM computes optimal trajectories (with certified suboptimality below 1%) in minutes (when other solvers take hours or run out of memory) and seconds (when others take minutes). Further, when warmstarted by data-driven initialization in the inverted pendulum problem, cuADMM delivers real-time performance: providing certifiably optimal trajectories in 0.66 seconds despite the SDP has 49,500 variables and 47,351 constraints.</p></details> |  |

| **[UDC: A Unified Neural Divide-and-Conquer Framework for Large-Scale Combinatorial Optimization Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00312v2)** | 2024-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Single-stage neural combinatorial optimization solvers have achieved near-optimal results on various small-scale combinatorial optimization (CO) problems without needing expert knowledge. However, these solvers exhibit significant performance degradation when applied to large-scale CO problems. Recently, two-stage neural methods with divide-and-conquer strategies have shown efficiency in addressing large-scale CO problems. Nevertheless, the performance of these methods highly relies on problem-specific heuristics in either the divide or the conquer procedure, which limits their applicability to general CO problems. Moreover, these methods employ separate training schemes and ignore the interdependencies between the dividing and conquering strategies, which often leads to sub-optimal solutions. To tackle these drawbacks, this article develops a unified neural divide-and-conquer framework (i.e., UDC) for solving general large-scale CO problems. UDC offers a Divide-Conquer-Reunion (DCR) training method to eliminate the negative impact of a sub-optimal dividing policy. Employing a high-efficiency Graph Neural Network (GNN) for global instance dividing and a fixed-length sub-path solver for conquering divided sub-problems, the proposed UDC framework demonstrates extensive applicability, achieving superior performance in 10 representative large-scale CO problems. The code is available at https://github.com/CIAM-Group/NCO_code/tree/main/single_objective/UDC-Large-scale-CO-master.</p></details> |  |

We hypothesise that the current practices of fine-tuning and evaluating these models may not perfectly align with this objective owing to a heavy reliance on translation, which cannot cover language-specific knowledge but can introduce translation defects. It remains unknown whether the nature of the instruction data has an impact on the model output; conversely, it is questionable whether translated test sets can capture such nuances. Due to the often coupled practices of using translated data in both stages, such imperfections could have been overlooked. This work investigates these issues using controlled native or translated data during the instruction tuning and evaluation stages. We show that native or generation benchmarks reveal a notable difference between native and translated instruction data especially when model performance is high, whereas other types of test sets cannot. The comparison between round-trip and single-pass translations reflects the importance of knowledge from language-native resources. Finally, we demonstrate that regularization is beneficial to bridging this gap on structured but not generative tasks.</p></details> | EMNLP 2024 |

They must also take into account dynamic social contexts and ensure respect and comfort for others in shared spaces, which poses significant challenges for perception and planning. In this paper, we present a group-based social navigation framework GSON to enable mobile robots to perceive and exploit the social group of their surroundings by leveling the visual reasoning capability of the Large Multimodal Model (LMM). For perception, we apply visual prompting techniques to zero-shot extract the social relationship among pedestrians and combine the result with a robust pedestrian detection and tracking pipeline to alleviate the problem of low inference speed of the LMM. Given the perception result, the planning system is designed to avoid disrupting the current social structure. We adopt a social structure-based mid-level planner as a bridge between global path planning and local motion planning to preserve the global context and reactive response. The proposed method is validated on real-world mobile robot navigation tasks involving complex social structure understanding and reasoning. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the system in these scenarios compared with several baselines.</p></details> |  |

User interface icons are essential for navigation and interaction and often lack meaningful alt-text, creating barriers to effective use. Traditional deep learning approaches for generating alt-text require extensive datasets and struggle with the diversity and imbalance of icon types. More recent Vision Language Models (VLMs) require complete UI screens, which can be impractical during the iterative phases of app development. To address these issues, we introduce a novel method using Large Language Models (LLMs) to autonomously generate informative alt-text for mobile UI icons with partial UI data. By incorporating icon context, that include class, resource ID, bounds, OCR-detected text, and contextual information from parent and sibling nodes, we fine-tune an off-the-shelf LLM on a small dataset of approximately 1.4k icons, yielding IconDesc. In an empirical evaluation and a user study IconDesc demonstrates significant improvements in generating relevant alt-text. This ability makes IconDesc an invaluable tool for developers, aiding in the rapid iteration and enhancement of UI accessibility.</p></details> |  |

However, previous methods exhibit deficiencies in general referencing and grounding capabilities for intricate scene comprehension. In this paper, we introduce the use of object identifiers and object-centric representations to interact with scenes at the object level. Specifically, we decompose the input 3D scene into a set of object proposals, each assigned a unique identifier token, which enables efficient object referencing and grounding during user-assistant interactions. Given the scarcity of scene-language data, we model the scene embeddings as a sequence of explicit object-level embeddings, derived from semantic-rich 2D or 3D representations. By employing object identifiers, we transform diverse 3D scene-language tasks into a unified question-answering format, facilitating joint training without the need for additional task-specific heads. With minimal fine-tuning on all downstream tasks, our model significantly outperforms existing methods on benchmarks including ScanRefer, Multi3DRefer, Scan2Cap, ScanQA, and SQA3D.</p></details> |  |

Previous works have shown that subtask decomposition within the model's context (chain of thought), is beneficial for solving such tasks. In this work, we point a limitation of LLMs' ability to perform several sub-tasks within the same context window - an in-context hardness of composition, pointing to an advantage for distributing a decomposed problem in a multi-agent system of LLMs. The hardness of composition is quantified by a generation complexity metric, i.e., the number of LLM generations required to sample at least one correct solution. We find a gap between the generation complexity of solving a compositional problem within the same context relative to distributing it among multiple agents, that increases exponentially with the solution's length. We prove our results theoretically and demonstrate them empirically.</p></details> |  |

Large language models offer the intelligence to make them more flexible and easier to use. However, LLMs' application in industrial settings is underexplored. This paper introduces a framework for integrating LLMs to achieve end-to-end control of industrial automation systems. At the core of the framework are an agent system designed for industrial tasks, a structured prompting method, and an event-driven information modeling mechanism that provides real-time data for LLM inference. The framework supplies LLMs with real-time events on different context semantic levels, allowing them to interpret the information, generate production plans, and control operations on the automation system. It also supports structured dataset creation for fine-tuning on this downstream application of LLMs. Our contribution includes a formal system design, proof-of-concept implementation, and a method for generating task-specific datasets for LLM fine-tuning and testing. This approach enables a more adaptive automation system that can respond to spontaneous events, while allowing easier operation and configuration through natural language for more intuitive human-machine interaction.

Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) show remarkable effectiveness in processing multimodal information. In this study, we introduce an LLM-based approach for reconstructing visual-semantic information from fMRI signals elicited by video stimuli. Specifically, we employ fine-tuning techniques on an fMRI encoder equipped with adaptors to transform brain responses into latent representations aligned with the video stimuli. Subsequently, these representations are mapped to textual modality by LLM. In particular, we integrate self-supervised domain adaptation methods to enhance the alignment between visual-semantic information and brain responses. Our proposed method achieves good results using various quantitative semantic metrics, while yielding similarity with ground-truth information.</p></details> | ECCV2024 Workshop |

However, in real-time and interactive applications involving mobile robots, particularly drones, the sequential token generation process inherent to LLMs introduces substantial latency, i.e. response time, in control plan generation. In this paper, we present a system called ChatFly that tackles this problem using a combination of a novel programming language called MiniSpec and its runtime to reduce the plan generation time and drone response time. That is, instead of asking an LLM to write a program (robotic plan) in the popular but verbose Python, ChatFly gets it to do it in MiniSpec specially designed for token efficiency and stream interpretation. Using a set of challenging drone tasks, we show that design choices made by ChatFly can reduce up to 62% response time and provide a more consistent user experience, enabling responsive and intelligent LLM-based drone control with efficient completion.</p></details> |  |

However, existing benchmarks primarily focus on general code generation without considering API-oriented code generation, i.e., generating code that invokes APIs from specific libraries. Given the growing demand for API-oriented code generation, there is a pressing need for a systematic and automated approach to evaluate LLM on API-oriented code generation. To address this gap, we propose AutoAPIEval, a lightweight and automated framework designed to evaluate the capabilities of LLMs in API-oriented code generation. Our framework works with any library that provides API documentation and focuses on two unit tasks: API recommendation and code example generation, along with four metrics to evaluate the generated APIs and code examples, such as the proportion of incorrect API recommendations for Task 1, and the proportion of code examples where no specific API is invoked and uncompilable/unexecutable code examples for Task 2. In addition, we conducted a case study on three LLMs (ChatGPT, MagiCoder, and DeepSeek Coder) and Java Runtime Environment 8 to demonstrate the framework's effectiveness. Our findings reveal substantial variability in LLM performance across tasks, with ChatGPT adhering better to instructions, while sharing similar effectiveness in code example generation with its counterparts (i.e., MagiCoder and DeekSeek Coder). We also identify key factors associated with code quality, such as API popularity and model confidence, and build classifiers that achieve high accuracy in detecting incorrect API recommendations and erroneous code examples. Retrieval-augmented generation enhances the quality of code generated by LLMs, though its effectiveness varies across different LLMs.</p></details> |  |

Focusing on Moroccan Arabic, also known as Darija, we construct our instruction dataset by consolidating existing Darija language resources, creating novel datasets both manually and synthetically, and translating English instructions with stringent quality control. Atlas-Chat-9B and 2B models, fine-tuned on the dataset, exhibit superior ability in following Darija instructions and performing standard NLP tasks. Notably, our models outperform both state-of-the-art and Arabic-specialized LLMs like LLaMa, Jais, and AceGPT, e.g., achieving a 13% performance boost over a larger 13B model on DarijaMMLU, in our newly introduced evaluation suite for Darija covering both discriminative and generative tasks. Furthermore, we perform an experimental analysis of various fine-tuning strategies and base model choices to determine optimal configurations. All our resources are publicly accessible, and we believe our work offers comprehensive design methodologies of instruction-tuning for low-resource language variants, which are often neglected in favor of data-rich languages by contemporary LLMs.</p></details> |  |

The vehicle Re-ID task faces an important challenge, which is the high similarity between different vehicles. Existing methods use additional detection or segmentation models to extract differentiated local features. However, these methods either rely on additional annotations or greatly increase the computational cost. Using attention mechanism to capture global and local features is crucial to solve the challenge of high similarity between classes in vehicle Re-ID tasks. In this paper, we propose LKA-ReID with large kernel attention. Specifically, the large kernel attention (LKA) utilizes the advantages of self-attention and also benefits from the advantages of convolution, which can extract the global and local features of the vehicle more comprehensively. We also introduce hybrid channel attention (HCA) combines channel attention with spatial information, so that the model can better focus on channels and feature regions, and ignore background and other disturbing information. Experiments on VeRi-776 dataset demonstrated the effectiveness of LKA-ReID, with mAP reaches 86.65% and Rank-1 reaches 98.03%.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper is under consideration at 2025 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing (ICASSP 2025)</p></details> |

This success of LLMs has also motivated their use in graph-related tasks. Among others, recent work has explored whether LLMs can solve graph problems such as counting the number of connected components of a graph or computing the shortest path distance between two nodes. Although LLMs possess preliminary graph reasoning abilities, they might still struggle to solve some seemingly simple problems. In this paper, we investigate whether prompting via pseudo-code instructions can improve the performance of LLMs in solving graph problems. Our experiments demonstrate that using pseudo-code instructions generally improves the performance of all considered LLMs. The graphs, pseudo-code prompts, and evaluation code are publicly available.</p></details> |  |

Most methods combine convolution and Transformer to model long-distance dependencies to estimate depth accurately. However, Transformer treats 2D image features as 1D sequences, and positional encoding somewhat mitigates the loss of spatial information between different feature blocks, tending to overlook channel features, which limit the performance of depth estimation. In this paper, we propose a self-supervised monocular depth estimation network to get finer details. Specifically, we propose a decoder based on large kernel attention, which can model long-distance dependencies without compromising the two-dimension structure of features while maintaining feature channel adaptivity. In addition, we introduce a up-sampling module to accurately recover the fine details in the depth map. Our method achieves competitive results on the KITTI dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper is under consideration at 2025 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing (ICASSP 2025)</p></details> |

To facilitate continual pre-training, we compile the MaLA corpus, a comprehensive multilingual dataset enriched with curated datasets across diverse domains. Leveraging this corpus, we conduct extensive continual pre-training of the Llama 2 7B model, resulting in EMMA-500, which demonstrates robust performance across a wide collection of benchmarks, including a comprehensive set of multilingual tasks and PolyWrite, an open-ended generation benchmark developed in this study. Our results highlight the effectiveness of continual pre-training in expanding large language models' language capacity, particularly for underrepresented languages, demonstrating significant gains in cross-lingual transfer, task generalization, and language adaptability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Arbitrary Precision Acceleration for Large Language Models on GPU Tensor Cores](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17870v1)** | 2024-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have been widely applied but face challenges in efficient inference. While quantization methods reduce computational demands, ultra-low bit quantization with arbitrary precision is hindered by limited GPU Tensor Core support and inefficient memory management, leading to suboptimal acceleration. To address these challenges, we propose a comprehensive acceleration scheme for arbitrary precision LLMs. At its core, we introduce a novel bipolar-INT data format that facilitates parallel computing and supports symmetric quantization, effectively reducing data redundancy. Building on this, we implement an arbitrary precision matrix multiplication scheme that decomposes and recovers matrices at the bit level, enabling flexible precision while maximizing GPU Tensor Core utilization. Furthermore, we develop an efficient matrix preprocessing method that optimizes data layout for subsequent computations. Finally, we design a data recovery-oriented memory management system that strategically utilizes fast shared memory, significantly enhancing kernel execution speed and minimizing memory access latency. Experimental results demonstrate our approach's effectiveness, with up to 13\times speedup in matrix multiplication compared to NVIDIA's CUTLASS. When integrated into LLMs, we achieve up to 6.7\times inference acceleration. These improvements significantly enhance LLM inference efficiency, enabling broader and more responsive applications of LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[BeanCounter: A low-toxicity, large-scale, and open dataset of business-oriented text](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17827v1)** | 2024-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many of the recent breakthroughs in language modeling have resulted from scaling effectively the same model architecture to larger datasets. In this vein, recent work has highlighted performance gains from increasing training dataset size and quality, suggesting a need for novel sources of large-scale datasets. In this work, we introduce BeanCounter, a public dataset consisting of more than 159B tokens extracted from businesses' disclosures. We show that this data is indeed novel: less than 0.1% of BeanCounter appears in Common Crawl-based datasets and it is an order of magnitude larger than datasets relying on similar sources. Given the data's provenance, we hypothesize that BeanCounter is comparatively more factual and less toxic than web-based datasets. Exploring this hypothesis, we find that many demographic identities occur with similar prevalence in BeanCounter but with significantly less toxic context relative to other datasets. To demonstrate the utility of BeanCounter, we evaluate and compare two LLMs continually pre-trained on BeanCounter with their base models. We find an 18-33% reduction in toxic generation and improved performance within the finance domain for the continually pretrained models. Collectively, our work suggests that BeanCounter is a novel source of low-toxicity and high-quality domain-specific data with sufficient scale to train multi-billion parameter LLMs.</p></details> |  |

This has led to lawsuits against tech companies accused of using protected content without permission. Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) aim to detect whether specific documents were used in a given LLM pretraining, but their effectiveness is undermined by biases such as time-shifts and n-gram overlaps. This paper addresses the evaluation of MIAs on LLMs with partially inferable training sets, under the ex-post hypothesis, which acknowledges inherent distributional biases between members and non-members datasets. We propose and validate algorithms to create ``non-biased'' and ``non-classifiable'' datasets for fairer MIA assessment. Experiments using the Gutenberg dataset on OpenLamma and Pythia show that neutralizing known biases alone is insufficient. Our methods produce non-biased ex-post datasets with AUC-ROC scores comparable to those previously obtained on genuinely random datasets, validating our approach. Globally, MIAs yield results close to random, with only one being effective on both random and our datasets, but its performance decreases when bias is removed.</p></details> |  |

We present an algorithmic method to compute the $2$-domination number of the Cartesian product of a path with small order and any cycle, involving the $(\min,+)$ matrix product. We establish some theoretical results that provide the algorithms necessary to compute that parameter, and the main challenge to run such algorithms comes from the large size of the matrices used, which makes it necessary to improve the techniques to handle these objects. We analyze the performance of the algorithms on modern multicore CPUs and on GPUs and we show the advantages over the sequential implementation. The use of these platforms allows us to compute the $2$-domination number of cylinders such that their paths have at most $12$ vertices.</p></details> |  |

While recent developments in Large Multimodal Models have demonstrated remarkable abilities in visual reasoning and mathematical tasks, there is little work on investigating whether these models can effectively interpret visual elements for code generation. To this end, we present MMCode, the first multi-modal coding dataset for evaluating algorithmic problem-solving skills in visually rich contexts. MMCode contains 3,548 questions and 6,620 images collected from real-world programming challenges harvested from 10 code competition websites, presenting significant challenges due to the extreme demand for reasoning abilities. Our experiment results show that current state-of-the-art models struggle to solve these problems. The results highlight the lack of powerful vision-code models, and we hope MMCode can serve as an inspiration for future works in this domain. The data and code are publicly available at https://github.com/likaixin2000/MMCode.</p></details> | EMNLP 2024 |

The weight $f(G)$ of a Roman dominating function of $G$ is the sum of the weights of all vertices of $G$, that is, $f(G)=\sum_{u\in V(G)}f(u)$. The Roman domination number $\gamma_R(G)$ is the minimum weight of a Roman dominating function of $G$. In this paper we propose algorithms to compute this parameter involving the $(\min,+)$ powers of large matrices with high computational requirements and the GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) allows us to accelerate such operations. Specific routines have been developed to efficiently compute the $(\min ,+)$ product on GPU architecture, taking advantage of its computational power. These algorithms allow us to compute the Roman domination number of cylindrical graphs $P_m\Box C_n$ i.e., the Cartesian product of a path and a cycle, in cases $m=7,8,9$, $ n\geq 3$ and $m\geq $10$, n\equiv 0\pmod 5$. Moreover, we provide a lower bound for the remaining cases $m\geq 10, n\not\equiv 0\pmod 5$.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can Large Language Models Faithfully Express Their Intrinsic Uncertainty in Words?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16908v2)** | 2024-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We posit that large language models (LLMs) should be capable of expressing their intrinsic uncertainty in natural language. For example, if the LLM is equally likely to output two contradicting answers to the same question, then its generated response should reflect this uncertainty by hedging its answer (e.g., "I'm not sure, but I think..."). We formalize faithful response uncertainty based on the gap between the model's intrinsic confidence in the assertions it makes and the decisiveness by which they are conveyed. This example-level metric reliably indicates whether the model reflects its uncertainty, as it penalizes both excessive and insufficient hedging. We evaluate a variety of aligned LLMs at faithfully communicating uncertainty on several knowledge-intensive question answering tasks. Our results provide strong evidence that modern LLMs are poor at faithfully conveying their uncertainty, and that better alignment is necessary to improve their trustworthiness.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in EMNLP 2024 (main conference)</p></details> |

To effectively instruct an MLLM, in addition to conventional language expressions, the practice of referring to objects by painting with brushes on images has emerged as a prevalent tool (referred to as "referring visual prompts") due to its efficacy in aligning the user's intention with specific image regions. To accommodate the most common referring visual prompts, namely points, boxes, and masks, existing approaches initially utilize specialized feature encoding modules to capture the semantics of the highlighted areas indicated by these prompts. Subsequently, these encoded region features are adapted to MLLMs through fine-tuning on a meticulously curated multimodal instruction dataset. However, such designs suffer from redundancy in architecture. Moreover, they face challenges in effectively generalizing when encountering a diverse range of arbitrary referring visual prompts in real-life scenarios. To address the above issues, we propose EAGLE, a novel MLLM that empowers comprehension of arbitrary referring visual prompts with less training efforts than existing approaches. Specifically, our EAGLE maintains the innate format of the referring visual prompts as colored patches rendered on the given image for conducting the instruction tuning. Our approach embeds referring visual prompts as spatial concepts conveying specific spatial areas comprehensible to the MLLM, with the semantic comprehension of these regions originating from the MLLM itself. Besides, we also propose a Geometry-Agnostic Learning paradigm (GAL) to further disentangle the MLLM's region-level comprehension with the specific formats of referring visual prompts. Extensive experiments are conducted to prove the effectiveness of our proposed method.</p></details> |  |

However, this so-called In-Context Learning ( ICL ) ability is very sensitive to the presenting context, and often dozens of demonstrations are needed. In this work, we investigate if we can reduce the shot number while still maintaining a competitive performance. We present SeCoKD, a self-Knowledge Distillation ( KD ) training framework that aligns the student model with a heavily prompted variation, thereby increasing the utilization of a single demonstration. We experiment with the SeCoKD across three LLMs and six benchmarks focusing mainly on reasoning tasks. Results show that our method outperforms the base model and Supervised Fine-tuning ( SFT ), especially in zero-shot and one-shot settings by 30% and 10%, respectively. Moreover, SeCoKD brings little negative artifacts when evaluated on new tasks, which is more robust than Supervised Fine-tuning.</p></details> | preprint |

The excessive private information on mobile screens necessitates small, on-device models to power these assistants. However, there is a lack of a comprehensive and large-scale mobile screen dataset with high diversity to train and enhance these models. To efficiently construct such a dataset, we utilize an LLM-enhanced automatic app traversal tool to minimize human intervention. We then employ two SoC clusters to provide high-fidelity mobile environments, including more than 200 Android instances to parallelize app interactions. By utilizing the system to collect mobile screens over 81,600 device-hours, we introduce MobileViews, the largest mobile screen dataset, which includes over 600K screenshot-view hierarchy pairs from more than 20K modern Android apps. We demonstrate the effectiveness of MobileViews by training SOTA multimodal LLMs that power mobile screen assistants on it and the Rico dataset, which was introduced seven years ago. Evaluation results on mobile screen tasks show that the scale and quality of mobile screens in MobileViews demonstrate significant advantages over Rico in augmenting mobile screen assistants.</p></details> | <details><summary>Datas...</summary><p>Dataset: https://huggingface.co/datasets/mllmTeam/MobileViews</p></details> |

There is an increasing need for a fast, cost-effective, and comprehensive method to evaluate the performance and detect and compare many companies' strategy changes efficiently. We propose a novel data-driven approach that leverages large language models (LLMs) to systematically analyze and rate the performance of companies based on their SEC 10-K filings. These filings, which provide detailed annual reports on a company's financial performance and strategic direction, serve as a rich source of data for evaluating various aspects of corporate health, including confidence, environmental sustainability, innovation, and workforce management. We also introduce an automated system for extracting and preprocessing 10-K filings. This system accurately identifies and segments the required sections as outlined by the SEC, while also isolating key textual content that contains critical information about the company. This curated data is then fed into Cohere's Command-R+ LLM to generate quantitative ratings across various performance metrics. These ratings are subsequently processed and visualized to provide actionable insights. The proposed scheme is then implemented on an interactive GUI as a no-code solution for running the data pipeline and creating the visualizations. The application showcases the rating results and provides year-on-year comparisons of company performance.</p></details> | 10 pages, 7 figures |

With the advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs), researchers have proposed an increasing number of LLM-based software testing techniques, particularly in the area of test case generation. Despite the growing interest, limited efforts have been made to thoroughly evaluate the actual capabilities of LLMs in this task. In this paper, we introduce TestBench, a benchmark for class-level LLM-based test case generation. We construct a dataset of 108 Java programs from 9 real-world, large-scale projects on GitHub, each representing a different thematic domain. We then design three distinct types of prompts based on context descriptions, including self-contained context, full context, and simple context. Besides, we propose a fine-grained evaluation framework that considers five aspects of test cases: syntactic correctness, compilation correctness, test correctness, code coverage rate, and defect detection rate. Furthermore, we propose a heuristic algorithm to repair erroneous test cases generated by LLMs. We evaluate CodeLlama-13b, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4 on the TestBench, and our experimental results indicate that larger models demonstrate a greater ability to effectively utilize contextual information, thus generating higher-quality test cases. Smaller models may struggle with the noise introduced by the extensive information contained within the full context. However, when using the simplified version, namely the simple context, which is derived from the full context via abstract syntax tree analysis, the performance of these models improves significantly. Our analysis highlights the current progress and pinpoints future directions to further enhance the effectiveness of models by handling contextual information for test case generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bivariate DeepKriging for Large-scale Spatial Interpolation of Wind Fields](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08038v2)** | 2024-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High spatial resolution wind data are essential for a wide range of applications in climate, oceanographic and meteorological studies. Large-scale spatial interpolation or downscaling of bivariate wind fields having velocity in two dimensions is a challenging task because wind data tend to be non-Gaussian with high spatial variability and heterogeneity. In spatial statistics, cokriging is commonly used for predicting bivariate spatial fields. However, the cokriging predictor is not optimal except for Gaussian processes. Additionally, cokriging is computationally prohibitive for large datasets. In this paper, we propose a method, called bivariate DeepKriging, which is a spatially dependent deep neural network (DNN) with an embedding layer constructed by spatial radial basis functions for bivariate spatial data prediction. We then develop a distribution-free uncertainty quantification method based on bootstrap and ensemble DNN. Our proposed approach outperforms the traditional cokriging predictor with commonly used covariance functions, such as the linear model of co-regionalization and flexible bivariate Mat\'ern covariance. We demonstrate the computational efficiency and scalability of the proposed DNN model, with computations that are, on average, 20 times faster than those of conventional techniques. We apply the bivariate DeepKriging method to the wind data over the Middle East region at 506,771 locations. The prediction performance of the proposed method is superior over the cokriging predictors and dramatically reduces computation time.</p></details> |  |
| **[Logic-of-Thought: Injecting Logic into Contexts for Full Reasoning in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17539v1)** | 2024-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various tasks but their performance in complex logical reasoning tasks remains unsatisfactory. Although some prompting methods, such as Chain-of-Thought, can improve the reasoning ability of LLMs to some extent, they suffer from an unfaithful issue where derived conclusions may not align with the generated reasoning chain. To address this issue, some studies employ the approach of propositional logic to further enhance logical reasoning abilities of LLMs. However, the potential omissions in the extraction of logical expressions in these methods can cause information loss in the logical reasoning process, thereby generating incorrect results. To this end, we propose Logic-of-Thought (LoT) prompting which employs propositional logic to generate expanded logical information from input context, and utilizes the generated logical information as an additional augmentation to the input prompts, thereby enhancing the capability of logical reasoning. The LoT is orthogonal to existing prompting methods and can be seamlessly integrated with them. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LoT boosts the performance of various prompting methods with a striking margin across five logical reasoning tasks. In particular, the LoT enhances Chain-of-Thought's performance on the ReClor dataset by +4.35%; moreover, it improves Chain-of-Thought with Self-Consistency's performance on LogiQA by +5%; additionally, it boosts performance of Tree-of-Thoughts on ProofWriter dataset by +8%.</p></details> | 20 pages |

Pre-training data typically combines information from multiple domains. To maximize performance when integrating data from various domains, determining the optimal data proportion is essential. However, state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs rarely disclose details about their pre-training data, making it difficult for researchers to identify ideal data proportions. In this paper, we introduce a new topic, \textit{data proportion detection}, which enables the automatic estimation of pre-training data proportions by analyzing the generated outputs of LLMs. We provide rigorous theoretical proofs, practical algorithms, and preliminary experimental results for data proportion detection. Based on these findings, we offer valuable insights into the challenges and future directions for effective data proportion detection and data management.</p></details> |  |

Given the availability of various services like online shopping, ride-sharing, food delivery, and professional services on commercial platforms, recommendation systems in these platforms are required to make CTR predictions across multiple domains rather than just a single domain. However, multi-domain click-through rate (MDCTR) prediction remains a challenging task in online recommendation due to the complex mutual influence between domains. Traditional MDCTR models typically encode domains as discrete identifiers, ignoring rich semantic information underlying. Consequently, they can hardly generalize to new domains. Besides, existing models can be easily dominated by some specific domains, which results in significant performance drops in the other domains (i.e. the "seesaw phenomenon"). In this paper, we propose a novel solution Uni-CTR to address the above challenges. Uni-CTR leverages a backbone Large Language Model (LLM) to learn layer-wise semantic representations that capture commonalities between domains. Uni-CTR also uses several domain-specific networks to capture the characteristics of each domain. Note that we design a masked loss strategy so that these domain-specific networks are decoupled from backbone LLM. This allows domain-specific networks to remain unchanged when incorporating new or removing domains, thereby enhancing the flexibility and scalability of the system significantly. Experimental results on three public datasets show that Uni-CTR outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) MDCTR models significantly. Furthermore, Uni-CTR demonstrates remarkable effectiveness in zero-shot prediction. We have applied Uni-CTR in industrial scenarios, confirming its efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accept By ACM TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION SYSTEMS(TOIS)</p></details> |

Due to the difficulties in obtaining high-quality training datasets across diverse locations, conventional activity-based models and learning-based human mobility modeling algorithms are particularly limited by the availability and quality of datasets. Furthermore, current research mainly focuses on the spatial-temporal travel pattern but lacks an understanding of the semantic information between activities, which is crucial for modeling the interdependence between activities. In this paper, we propose an innovative Large Language Model (LLM) empowered human mobility modeling framework. Our proposed approach significantly reduces the reliance on detailed human mobility statistical data, utilizing basic socio-demographic information of individuals to generate their daily mobility patterns. We have validated our results using the NHTS and SCAG-ABM datasets, demonstrating the effective modeling of mobility patterns and the strong adaptability of our framework across various geographic locations.</p></details> |  |

This work introduces MaskLLM, a learnable pruning method that establishes Semi-structured (or ``N:M'') Sparsity in LLMs, aimed at reducing computational overhead during inference. Instead of developing a new importance criterion, MaskLLM explicitly models N:M patterns as a learnable distribution through Gumbel Softmax sampling. This approach facilitates end-to-end training on large-scale datasets and offers two notable advantages: 1) High-quality Masks - our method effectively scales to large datasets and learns accurate masks; 2) Transferability - the probabilistic modeling of mask distribution enables the transfer learning of sparsity across domains or tasks. We assessed MaskLLM using 2:4 sparsity on various LLMs, including LLaMA-2, Nemotron-4, and GPT-3, with sizes ranging from 843M to 15B parameters, and our empirical results show substantial improvements over state-of-the-art methods. For instance, leading approaches achieve a perplexity (PPL) of 10 or greater on Wikitext compared to the dense model's 5.12 PPL, but MaskLLM achieves a significantly lower 6.72 PPL solely by learning the masks with frozen weights.

In this paper, we decompose ranking relevance into content-based and engagement-based aspects, and we propose to leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) for both label and feature generation in model training, primarily aiming to improve the model's predictive capability for content-based relevance. Additionally, we introduce different sigmoid transformations on the LLM outputs to polarize relevance scores in labeling, enhancing the model's ability to balance content-based and engagement-based relevances and thus prioritize highly relevant items overall. Comprehensive online tests and offline evaluations are also conducted for the proposed design. Our work sheds light on advanced strategies for integrating LLMs into e-commerce product search ranking model training, offering a pathway to more effective and balanced models with improved ranking relevance.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be published in CIKM 2024 GenAIECommerce Workshop</p></details> |

To mitigate such risks, red teaming has been employed as a proactive security measure to probe language models for harmful outputs via jailbreak attacks. However, current jailbreak attack approaches are single-turn with explicit malicious queries that do not fully capture the complexity of real-world interactions. In reality, users can engage in multi-turn interactions with LLM-based chat assistants, allowing them to conceal their true intentions in a more covert manner. To bridge this gap, we, first, propose a new jailbreak approach, RED QUEEN ATTACK. This method constructs a multi-turn scenario, concealing the malicious intent under the guise of preventing harm. We craft 40 scenarios that vary in turns and select 14 harmful categories to generate 56k multi-turn attack data points. We conduct comprehensive experiments on the RED QUEEN ATTACK with four representative LLM families of different sizes. Our experiments reveal that all LLMs are vulnerable to RED QUEEN ATTACK, reaching 87.62% attack success rate on GPT-4o and 75.4% on Llama3-70B. Further analysis reveals that larger models are more susceptible to the RED QUEEN ATTACK, with multi-turn structures and concealment strategies contributing to its success. To prioritize safety, we introduce a straightforward mitigation strategy called RED QUEEN GUARD, which aligns LLMs to effectively counter adversarial attacks. This approach reduces the attack success rate to below 1% while maintaining the model's performance across standard benchmarks. Full implementation and dataset are publicly accessible at https://github.com/kriti-hippo/red_queen.</p></details> |  |

The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) holds considerable promise for transforming the battle against fake news. Generally, LLMs represent a double-edged sword in this struggle. One major concern is that LLMs can be readily used to craft and disseminate misleading information on a large scale. This raises the pressing questions: Can LLMs easily generate biased fake news? Do all LLMs have this capability? Conversely, LLMs offer valuable prospects for countering fake news, thanks to their extensive knowledge of the world and robust reasoning capabilities. This leads to other critical inquiries: Can we use LLMs to detect fake news, and do they outperform typical detection models? In this paper, we aim to address these pivotal questions by exploring the performance of various LLMs. Our objective is to explore the capability of various LLMs in effectively combating fake news, marking this as the first investigation to analyze seven such models. Our results reveal that while some models adhere strictly to safety protocols, refusing to generate biased or misleading content, other models can readily produce fake news across a spectrum of biases. Additionally, our results show that larger models generally exhibit superior detection abilities and that LLM-generated fake news are less likely to be detected than human-written ones. Finally, our findings demonstrate that users can benefit from LLM-generated explanations in identifying fake news.</p></details> |  |

Numbers can be tokenized into tokens in various ways by different LLMs and affect the numeric operations performance. Currently, there are two representatives: 1) Tokenize into $1$-digit, and 2) Tokenize into $1\sim 3$ digit. The difference is roughly equivalent to using different numeral systems (namely base $10$ or base $10^{3}$). In light of this, we study the scaling behavior of different numeral systems in the context of transformer-based large language models. We empirically show that a base $10$ system is consistently more data-efficient than a base $10^{2}$ or $10^{3}$ system across training data scale, model sizes under from-scratch training settings, while different number systems have very similar fine-tuning performances. We attribute this to higher token frequencies of a base $10$ system. Additionally, we reveal extrapolation behavior patterns on addition and multiplication. We identify that base $100$ and base $1000$ systems struggle on token-level discernment and token-level operations. We also sheds light on the mechanism learnt by the models.</p></details> | EMNLP 2024 Findings |

At this scale, failures are frequent and can have a big impact on training throughput. Utilizing spare GPU servers to mitigate performance loss becomes increasingly costly as model sizes grow. ReCycle is a system designed for efficient DNN training in the presence of failures, without relying on spare servers. It exploits the inherent functional redundancy in distributed training systems -- where servers across data-parallel groups store the same model parameters -- and pipeline schedule bubbles within each data-parallel group. When servers fails, ReCycle dynamically re-routes micro-batches to data-parallel peers, allowing for uninterrupted training despite multiple failures. However, this re-routing can create imbalances across pipeline stages, leading to reduced training throughput. To address this, ReCycle introduces two key optimizations that ensure re-routed micro-batches are processed within the original pipeline schedule's bubbles. First, it decouples the backward pass into two phases: one for computing gradients for the input and another for calculating gradients for the parameters. Second, it avoids synchronization across pipeline stages by staggering the optimizer step. Together, these optimizations enable adaptive pipeline schedules that minimize or even eliminate training throughput degradation during failures. We describe a prototype for ReCycle and show that it achieves high training throughput under multiple failures, outperforming recent proposals for fault-tolerant training such as Oobleck and Bamboo by up to $1.46\times$ and $1.64\times$, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>SOSP'...</summary><p>SOSP'24 | Camera-Ready</p></details> |

Numerous efficient techniques, including weight pruning, quantization, and distillation, have been embraced to compress LLMs, targeting memory reduction and inference acceleration, which underscore the redundancy in LLMs. However, most model compression techniques concentrate on weight optimization, overlooking the exploration of optimal architectures. Besides, traditional architecture search methods, limited by the elevated complexity with extensive parameters, struggle to demonstrate their effectiveness on LLMs. In this paper, we propose a training-free architecture search framework to identify optimal subnets that preserve the fundamental strengths of the original LLMs while achieving inference acceleration. Furthermore, after generating subnets that inherit specific weights from the original LLMs, we introduce a reformation algorithm that utilizes the omitted weights to rectify the inherited weights with a small amount of calibration data. Compared with SOTA training-free structured pruning works that can generate smaller networks, our method demonstrates superior performance across standard benchmarks. Furthermore, our generated subnets can directly reduce the usage of GPU memory and achieve inference acceleration.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |

Significant view changes, such as air-to-ground with very sparse view overlap, pose an even greater challenge to the correspondence solvers. We present a novel optimization-based approach that significantly enhances existing feature matching methods by introducing geometry cues in addition to color cues. This helps fill gaps when there is less overlap in large-scale scenarios. Our method formulates geometric verification as an optimization problem, guiding feature matching within detector-free methods and using sparse correspondences from detector-based methods as anchor points. By enforcing geometric constraints via the Sampson Distance, our approach ensures that the denser correspondences from detector-free methods are geometrically consistent and more accurate. This hybrid strategy significantly improves correspondence density and accuracy, mitigates multi-view inconsistencies, and leads to notable advancements in camera pose accuracy and point cloud density. It outperforms state-of-the-art feature matching methods on benchmark datasets and enables feature matching in challenging extreme large-scale settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[MHRC: Closed-loop Decentralized Multi-Heterogeneous Robot Collaboration with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16030v2)** | 2024-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of large language models (LLMs) with robotics has significantly advanced robots' abilities in perception, cognition, and task planning. The use of natural language interfaces offers a unified approach for expressing the capability differences of heterogeneous robots, facilitating communication between them, and enabling seamless task allocation and collaboration. Currently, the utilization of LLMs to achieve decentralized multi-heterogeneous robot collaborative tasks remains an under-explored area of research. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework that utilizes LLMs to achieve decentralized collaboration among multiple heterogeneous robots. Our framework supports three robot categories, mobile robots, manipulation robots, and mobile manipulation robots, working together to complete tasks such as exploration, transportation, and organization. We developed a rich set of textual feedback mechanisms and chain-of-thought (CoT) prompts to enhance task planning efficiency and overall system performance. The mobile manipulation robot can adjust its base position flexibly, ensuring optimal conditions for grasping tasks. The manipulation robot can comprehend task requirements, seek assistance when necessary, and handle objects appropriately. Meanwhile, the mobile robot can explore the environment extensively, map object locations, and communicate this information to the mobile manipulation robot, thus improving task execution efficiency. We evaluated the framework using PyBullet, creating scenarios with three different room layouts and three distinct operational tasks. We tested various LLM models and conducted ablation studies to assess the contributions of different modules. The experimental results confirm the effectiveness and necessity of our proposed framework.</p></details> |  |

Most efforts to reduce data QC time rely on outlier detection, which cannot capture every instance of algorithm failure. Thus, there is a need to visually inspect every output of data processing pipelines in a scalable manner. We design a QC pipeline that allows for low time cost and effort across a team setting for a large database of diffusion weighted and structural magnetic resonance images. Our proposed method satisfies the following design criteria: 1.) a consistent way to perform and manage quality control across a team of researchers, 2.) quick visualization of preprocessed data that minimizes the effort and time spent on the QC process without compromising the condition or caliber of the QC, and 3.) a way to aggregate QC results across pipelines and datasets that can be easily shared. In addition to meeting these design criteria, we also provide information on what a successful output should be and common occurrences of algorithm failures for various processing pipelines. Our method reduces the time spent on QC by a factor of over 20 when compared to naively opening outputs in an image viewer and demonstrate how it can facilitate aggregation and sharing of QC results within a team. While researchers must spend time on robust visual QC of data, there are mechanisms by which the process can be streamlined and efficient.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 12 figures, 1 table, 6 supplemental figures</p></details> |

However, their application in automating other Software Engineering activities remains largely unexplored. Thus, in this paper, we report the first results of a study in which we are exploring the use of ChatGPT to support API migration tasks, an important problem that demands manual effort and attention from developers. Specifically, in the paper, we share our initial results involving the use of ChatGPT to migrate a client application to use a newer version of SQLAlchemy, an ORM (Object Relational Mapping) library widely used in Python. We evaluate the use of three types of prompts (Zero-Shot, One-Shot, and Chain Of Thoughts) and show that the best results are achieved by the One-Shot prompt, followed by the Chain Of Thoughts. Particularly, with the One-Shot prompt we were able to successfully migrate all columns of our target application and upgrade its code to use new functionalities enabled by SQLAlchemy's latest version, such as Python's asyncio and typing modules, while preserving the original code behavior.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at 18th International Symposium on Empirical Software Engineering and Measurement (ESEM), pages 1-7, 2024</p></details> |

Motivated by text prompting in LLMs, visual prompting has been explored to enhance LVLMs' capabilities of perceiving visual information. However, previous visual prompting techniques solely process visual inputs without considering text queries, limiting the models' ability to follow text instructions to complete tasks. To fill this gap, in this work, we propose a new prompting technique named Attention Prompting on Image, which just simply overlays a text-query-guided attention heatmap on the original input image and effectively enhances LVLM on various tasks. Specifically, we generate an attention heatmap for the input image dependent on the text query with an auxiliary model like CLIP. Then the heatmap simply multiplies the pixel values of the original image to obtain the actual input image for the LVLM. Extensive experiments on various vison-language benchmarks verify the effectiveness of our technique. For example, Attention Prompting on Image improves LLaVA-1.5 by 3.8% and 2.9% on MM-Vet and LLaVA-Wild benchmarks, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>Websi...</summary><p>Website, see https://yu-rp.github.io/api-prompting</p></details> |
| **[FineZip : Pushing the Limits of Large Language Models for Practical Lossless Text Compression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17141v1)** | 2024-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While the language modeling objective has been shown to be deeply connected with compression, it is surprising that modern LLMs are not employed in practical text compression systems. In this paper, we provide an in-depth analysis of neural network and transformer-based compression techniques to answer this question. We compare traditional text compression systems with neural network and LLM-based text compression methods. Although LLM-based systems significantly outperform conventional compression methods, they are highly impractical. Specifically, LLMZip, a recent text compression system using Llama3-8B requires 9.5 days to compress just 10 MB of text, although with huge improvements in compression ratios. To overcome this, we present FineZip - a novel LLM-based text compression system that combines ideas of online memorization and dynamic context to reduce the compression time immensely. FineZip can compress the above corpus in approximately 4 hours compared to 9.5 days, a 54 times improvement over LLMZip and comparable performance. FineZip outperforms traditional algorithmic compression methods with a large margin, improving compression ratios by approximately 50\%. With this work, we take the first step towards making lossless text compression with LLMs a reality. While FineZip presents a significant step in that direction, LLMs are still not a viable solution for large-scale text compression. We hope our work paves the way for future research and innovation to solve this problem.</p></details> |  |

Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently been shown to be effective as automatic evaluators with simple prompting and in-context learning. In this work, we assemble 15 LLMs of four different size ranges and evaluate their output responses by preference ranking from the other LLMs as evaluators, such as System Star is better than System Square. We then evaluate the quality of ranking outputs introducing the Cognitive Bias Benchmark for LLMs as Evaluators (CoBBLEr), a benchmark to measure six different cognitive biases in LLM evaluation outputs, such as the Egocentric bias where a model prefers to rank its own outputs highly in evaluation. We find that LLMs are biased text quality evaluators, exhibiting strong indications on our bias benchmark (average of 40% of comparisons across all models) within each of their evaluations that question their robustness as evaluators. Furthermore, we examine the correlation between human and machine preferences and calculate the average Rank-Biased Overlap (RBO) score to be 49.6%, indicating that machine preferences are misaligned with humans. According to our findings, LLMs may still be unable to be utilized for automatic annotation aligned with human preferences.

| **[VPTQ: Extreme Low-bit Vector Post-Training Quantization for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17066v1)** | 2024-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scaling model size significantly challenges the deployment and inference of Large Language Models (LLMs). Due to the redundancy in LLM weights, recent research has focused on pushing weight-only quantization to extremely low-bit (even down to 2 bits). It reduces memory requirements, optimizes storage costs, and decreases memory bandwidth needs during inference. However, due to numerical representation limitations, traditional scalar-based weight quantization struggles to achieve such extreme low-bit. Recent research on Vector Quantization (VQ) for LLMs has demonstrated the potential for extremely low-bit model quantization by compressing vectors into indices using lookup tables. In this paper, we introduce Vector Post-Training Quantization (VPTQ) for extremely low-bit quantization of LLMs. We use Second-Order Optimization to formulate the LLM VQ problem and guide our quantization algorithm design by solving the optimization. We further refine the weights using Channel-Independent Second-Order Optimization for a granular VQ. In addition, by decomposing the optimization problem, we propose a brief and effective codebook initialization algorithm. We also extend VPTQ to support residual and outlier quantization, which enhances model accuracy and further compresses the model. Our experimental results show that VPTQ reduces model quantization perplexity by $0.01$-$0.34$ on LLaMA-2, $0.38$-$0.68$ on Mistral-7B, $4.41$-$7.34$ on LLaMA-3 over SOTA at 2-bit, with an average accuracy improvement of $0.79$-$1.5\%$ on LLaMA-2, $1\%$ on Mistral-7B, $11$-$22\%$ on LLaMA-3 on QA tasks on average. We only utilize $10.4$-$18.6\%$ of the quantization algorithm execution time, resulting in a $1.6$-$1.8\times$ increase in inference throughput compared to SOTA.</p></details> |  |

What Matters and What Does Not](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17044v1)** | 2024-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The remarkable performance achieved by Large Language Models (LLM) has driven research efforts to leverage them for a wide range of tasks and input modalities. In speech-to-text (S2T) tasks, the emerging solution consists of projecting the output of the encoder of a Speech Foundational Model (SFM) into the LLM embedding space through an adapter module. However, no work has yet investigated how much the downstream-task performance depends on each component (SFM, adapter, LLM) nor whether the best design of the adapter depends on the chosen SFM and LLM. To fill this gap, we evaluate the combination of 5 adapter modules, 2 LLMs (Mistral and Llama), and 2 SFMs (Whisper and SeamlessM4T) on two widespread S2T tasks, namely Automatic Speech Recognition and Speech Translation. Our results demonstrate that the SFM plays a pivotal role in downstream performance, while the adapter choice has moderate impact and depends on the SFM and LLM.</p></details> |  |

Leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP)-powered dialog analyzers to create dialog indicators like Coherence and Emotion has the potential to predict the chat experience. In this paper, we proposed a conceptual model to explain the relationship between the dialog indicators and various factors related to the chat experience, such as users' intentions, affinity toward dialog agents, and prompts of the agents' characters. We evaluated the conceptual model using PLS-SEM with 120 participants and found it well fit. Our results suggest that dialog indicators can predict the chat experience and fully mediate the impact of prompts and user intentions. Additionally, users' affinity toward agents can partially explain these predictions. Our findings demonstrate the potential of using dialog indicators in predicting the chat experience. Through the conceptual model we propose, researchers can apply the dialog analyzers to generate dialog indicators to constantly monitor the dialog process and improve the user's chat experience accordingly.</p></details> | <details><summary>I wil...</summary><p>I will revise the rejected paper when I have time.

[...] Lyra's eyes welled up with tears as she realized the bitter truth - she had sacrificed everything for fleeting riches, and lost the love of her crew, her family, and herself." Although this story, generated by a large language model, is captivating, one may wonder -- how would the story have unfolded if the model had chosen "Captain Maeve" as the protagonist instead? We cannot know. State-of-the-art large language models are stateless -- they maintain no internal memory or state. Given a prompt, they generate a sequence of tokens as an output using an autoregressive process. As a consequence, they cannot reason about counterfactual alternatives to tokens they have generated in the past. In this work, our goal is to enhance them with this functionality. To this end, we develop a causal model of token generation that builds upon the Gumbel-Max structural causal model. Our model allows any large language model to perform counterfactual token generation at almost no cost in comparison with vanilla token generation, it is embarrassingly simple to implement, and it does not require any fine-tuning nor prompt engineering. We implement our model on Llama 3 8B-instruct and conduct both qualitative and quantitative analyses of counterfactually generated text. We conclude with a demonstrative application of counterfactual token generation for bias detection, unveiling interesting insights about the model of the world constructed by large language models.</p></details> |  |

As an increasing number of papers are presented, researchers and developers face the challenge of information overload. Thus, it is particularly important to develop a system that can automatically extract and organise key information about LLMs from academic papers (\textbf{LLM model card}). This work is to develop such a pioneer system by using Named Entity Recognition (\textbf{NER}) and Relation Extraction (\textbf{RE}) methods that automatically extract key information about large language models from the papers, helping researchers to efficiently access information about LLMs. These features include model \textit{licence}, model \textit{name}, and model \textit{application}.

To achieve this, researchers are currently investigating the use of data influence to measure the importance of data instances, $i.e.,$ a high influence score indicates that incorporating this instance to the training set is likely to enhance the model performance. Consequently, they select the top-$k$ instances with the highest scores. However, this approach has several limitations. (1) Computing the influence of all available data is time-consuming. (2) The selected data instances are not diverse enough, which may hinder the pre-trained model's ability to generalize effectively to various downstream tasks. In this paper, we introduce \texttt{Quad}, a data selection approach that considers both quality and diversity by using data influence to achieve state-of-the-art pre-training results. In particular, noting that attention layers capture extensive semantic details, we have adapted the accelerated $iHVP$ computation methods for attention layers, enhancing our ability to evaluate the influence of data, $i.e.,$ its quality. For the diversity, \texttt{Quad} clusters the dataset into similar data instances within each cluster and diverse instances across different clusters. For each cluster, if we opt to select data from it, we take some samples to evaluate the influence to prevent processing all instances. To determine which clusters to select, we utilize the classic Multi-Armed Bandit method, treating each cluster as an arm. This approach favors clusters with highly influential instances (ensuring high quality) or clusters that have been selected less frequently (ensuring diversity), thereby well balancing between quality and diversity.</p></details> |  |

However, the disparity in performance between English and non-English languages remains a challenge yet to be fully addressed. A distinctive characteristic of MLLMs is their high-quality translation capabilities, indicating an acquired proficiency in aligning between languages. This study explores how to enhance the zero-shot performance of MLLMs in non-English languages by leveraging their alignment capability between English and non-English languages. To achieve this, we first analyze the behavior of MLLMs when performing translation and reveal that there are large magnitude features that play a critical role in the translation process. Inspired by these findings, we retain the weights associated with operations involving the large magnitude features and prune other weights to force MLLMs to rely on these features for tasks beyond translation. We empirically demonstrate that this pruning strategy can enhance the MLLMs' performance in non-English language.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at EMNLP 2024 Findings</p></details> |

The results show that LLM-based chatbots significantly improve interactivity and engagement, creating a more dynamic and immersive learning environment. This integration helps document and preserve cultural heritage and enhances dissemination processes, which are crucial for safeguarding intangible cultural heritage (ICH) amid environmental changes. Furthermore, the study highlights the potential of novel technologies in education to provide immersive experiences that foster a deeper appreciation of cultural heritage. These findings support the wider application of LLMs and VR in cultural education to address global challenges and promote sustainable practices to preserve and enhance cultural heritage.</p></details> |  |
| **[GEIC: Universal and Multilingual Named Entity Recognition with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11022v3)** | 2024-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have supplanted traditional methods in numerous natural language processing tasks. Nonetheless, in Named Entity Recognition (NER), existing LLM-based methods underperform compared to baselines and require significantly more computational resources, limiting their application. In this paper, we introduce the task of generation-based extraction and in-context classification (GEIC), designed to leverage LLMs' prior knowledge and self-attention mechanisms for NER tasks. We then propose CascadeNER, a universal and multilingual GEIC framework for few-shot and zero-shot NER. CascadeNER employs model cascading to utilize two small-parameter LLMs to extract and classify independently, reducing resource consumption while enhancing accuracy. We also introduce AnythingNER, the first NER dataset specifically designed for LLMs, including 8 languages, 155 entity types and a novel dynamic categorization system. Experiments show that CascadeNER achieves state-of-the-art performance on low-resource and fine-grained scenarios, including CrossNER and FewNERD. Our work is openly accessible.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-objective Evolution of Heuristic Using Large Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16867v1)** | 2024-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Heuristics are commonly used to tackle diverse search and optimization problems. Design heuristics usually require tedious manual crafting with domain knowledge. Recent works have incorporated large language models (LLMs) into automatic heuristic search leveraging their powerful language and coding capacity. However, existing research focuses on the optimal performance on the target problem as the sole objective, neglecting other criteria such as efficiency and scalability, which are vital in practice. To tackle this challenge, we propose to model heuristic search as a multi-objective optimization problem and consider introducing other practical criteria beyond optimal performance. Due to the complexity of the search space, conventional multi-objective optimization methods struggle to effectively handle multi-objective heuristic search. We propose the first LLM-based multi-objective heuristic search framework, Multi-objective Evolution of Heuristic (MEoH), which integrates LLMs in a zero-shot manner to generate a non-dominated set of heuristics to meet multiple design criteria. We design a new dominance-dissimilarity mechanism for effective population management and selection, which incorporates both code dissimilarity in the search space and dominance in the objective space. MEoH is demonstrated in two well-known combinatorial optimization problems: the online Bin Packing Problem (BPP) and the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). Results indicate that a variety of elite heuristics are automatically generated in a single run, offering more trade-off options than existing methods. It successfully achieves competitive or superior performance while improving efficiency up to 10 times. Moreover, we also observe that the multi-objective search introduces novel insights into heuristic design and leads to the discovery of diverse heuristics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Domain decomposition for data-driven reduced modeling of large-scale systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00883v2)** | 2024-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper focuses on the construction of accurate and predictive data-driven reduced models of large-scale numerical simulations with complex dynamics and sparse training datasets. In these settings, standard, single-domain approaches may be too inaccurate or may overfit and hence generalize poorly. Moreover, processing large-scale datasets typically requires significant memory and computing resources which can render single-domain approaches computationally prohibitive. To address these challenges, we introduce a domain decomposition formulation into the construction of a data-driven reduced model. In doing so, the basis functions used in the reduced model approximation become localized in space, which can increase the accuracy of the domain-decomposed approximation of the complex dynamics. The decomposition furthermore reduces the memory and computing requirements to process the underlying large-scale training dataset. We demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of our approach in a large-scale three-dimensional unsteady rotating detonation rocket engine simulation scenario with over $75$ million degrees of freedom and a sparse training dataset. Our results show that compared to the single-domain approach, the domain-decomposed version reduces both the training and prediction errors for pressure by up to $13 \%$ and up to $5\%$ for other key quantities, such as temperature, and fuel and oxidizer mass fractions. Lastly, our approach decreases the memory requirements for processing by almost a factor of four, which in turn reduces the computing requirements as well.</p></details> | 24 pages, 15 figures |

With the growing demand of unmanned function vehicles, near-field scene understanding becomes an important research topic in the areas of low-speed autonomous driving. Due to the complexity of driving conditions and diversity of near obstacles such as blind spots and high occlusion, the perception capability of near-field environment is still inferior than its farther counterpart. To further enhance the intelligent ability of unmanned vehicles, in this paper, we construct a multimodal data collection platform based on 3 main types of sensors (Camera, LiDAR and Fisheye), which supports flexible sensor configurations to enable dynamic sight of view for ego vehicle, either global view or local view. Meanwhile, a large-scale multi-sensor dataset is built, named RoboSense, to facilitate near-field scene understanding. RoboSense contains more than 133K synchronized data with 1.4M 3D bounding box and IDs annotated in the full $360^{\circ}$ view, forming 216K trajectories across 7.6K temporal sequences. It has $270\times$ and $18\times$ as many annotations of near-field obstacles within 5$m$ as the previous single-vehicle datasets such as KITTI and nuScenes. Moreover, we define a novel matching criterion for near-field 3D perception and prediction metrics. Based on RoboSense, we formulate 6 popular tasks to facilitate the future development of related research, where the detailed data analysis as well as benchmarks are also provided accordingly. Code and dataset will be available at https://github.com/suhaisheng/RoboSense.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mitigating the Bias of Large Language Model Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16788v1)** | 2024-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, there has been a trend of evaluating the Large Language Model (LLM) quality in the flavor of LLM-as-a-Judge, namely leveraging another LLM to evaluate the current output quality. However, existing judges are proven to be biased, namely they would favor answers which present better superficial quality (such as verbosity, fluency) while ignoring the instruction following ability. In this work, we propose systematic research about the bias of LLM-as-a-Judge. Specifically, for closed-source judge models, we apply calibration to mitigate the significance of superficial quality, both on probability level and prompt level. For open-source judge models, we propose to mitigate the bias by contrastive training, with curated negative samples that deviate from instruction but present better superficial quality. We apply our methods on the bias evaluation benchmark, and experiment results show our methods mitigate the bias by a large margin while maintaining a satisfactory evaluation accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Holistic Automated Red Teaming for Large Language Models through Top-Down Test Case Generation and Multi-turn Interaction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16783v1)** | 2024-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated red teaming is an effective method for identifying misaligned behaviors in large language models (LLMs). Existing approaches, however, often focus primarily on improving attack success rates while overlooking the need for comprehensive test case coverage. Additionally, most of these methods are limited to single-turn red teaming, failing to capture the multi-turn dynamics of real-world human-machine interactions. To overcome these limitations, we propose HARM (Holistic Automated Red teaMing), which scales up the diversity of test cases using a top-down approach based on an extensible, fine-grained risk taxonomy. Our method also leverages a novel fine-tuning strategy and reinforcement learning techniques to facilitate multi-turn adversarial probing in a human-like manner. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework enables a more systematic understanding of model vulnerabilities and offers more targeted guidance for the alignment process.</p></details> | <details><summary>EMNLP...</summary><p>EMNLP 2024 camera ready version</p></details> |
| **[DemoRank: Selecting Effective Demonstrations for Large Language Models in Ranking Task](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16332v2)** | 2024-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, there has been increasing interest in applying large language models (LLMs) as zero-shot passage rankers. However, few studies have explored how to select appropriate in-context demonstrations for the passage ranking task, which is the focus of this paper. Previous studies mainly use LLM's feedback to train a retriever for demonstration selection. These studies apply the LLM to score each demonstration independently, which ignores the dependencies between demonstrations (especially important in ranking task), leading to inferior performance of top-$k$ retrieved demonstrations. To mitigate this issue, we introduce a demonstration reranker to rerank the retrieved demonstrations so that top-$k$ ranked ones are more suitable for ICL. However, generating training data for such reranker is quite challenging. On the one hand, different from demonstration retriever, the training samples of reranker need to incorporate demonstration dependencies. On the other hand, obtaining the gold ranking from the retrieved demonstrations is an NP-hard problem, which is hard to implement. To overcome these challenges, we propose a method to approximate the optimal demonstration list iteratively and utilize LLM to score demonstration lists of varying lengths. By doing so, the search space is greatly reduced and demonstration dependencies are considered. Based on these scored demonstration lists, we further design a list-pairwise training approach which compares a pair of lists that only differ in the last demonstration, to teach the reranker how to select the next demonstration given a previous sequence. In this paper, we propose a demonstration selection framework DemoRank for ranking task and conduct extensive experiments to prove its strong ability.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Efficient Benders Decomposition Approach for Optimal Large-Scale Network Slicing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15247v3)** | 2024-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper considers the network slicing (NS) problem which attempts to map multiple customized virtual network requests to a common shared network infrastructure and allocate network resources to meet diverse service requirements. This paper proposes an efficient customized Benders decomposition algorithm for globally solving the large-scale NP-hard NS problem. The proposed algorithm decomposes the hard NS problem into two relatively easy function placement (FP) and traffic routing (TR) subproblems and iteratively solves them enabling the information feedback between each other, which makes it particularly suitable to solve large-scale problems. Specifically, the FP subproblem is to place service functions into cloud nodes in the network, and solving it can return a function placement strategy based on which the TR subproblem is defined; and the TR subproblem is to find paths connecting two nodes hosting two adjacent functions in the network, and solving it can either verify that the solution of the FP subproblem is an optimal solution of the original problem, or return a valid inequality to the FP subproblem that cuts off the current infeasible solution. The proposed algorithm is guaranteed to find the globally optimal solution of the NS problem. By taking the special structure of the NS problem into consideration, we successfully develop two families of valid inequalities that render the proposed algorithm converge much more quickly and thus much more efficient. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed valid inequalities effectively accelerate the convergence of the decomposition algorithm, and the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms the existing algorithms in terms of both solution efficiency and quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 10 figures, accepted for publication in the IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing; for the conference version, see arXiv:2306.15247v1</p></details> |
| **[A Study of Implicit Ranking Unfairness in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07054v2)** | 2024-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated a superior ability to serve as ranking models. However, concerns have arisen as LLMs will exhibit discriminatory ranking behaviors based on users' sensitive attributes (\eg gender). Worse still, in this paper, we identify a subtler form of discrimination in LLMs, termed \textit{implicit ranking unfairness}, where LLMs exhibit discriminatory ranking patterns based solely on non-sensitive user profiles, such as user names. Such implicit unfairness is more widespread but less noticeable, threatening the ethical foundation. To comprehensively explore such unfairness, our analysis will focus on three research aspects: (1) We propose an evaluation method to investigate the severity of implicit ranking unfairness. (2) We uncover the reasons for causing such unfairness. (3) To mitigate such unfairness effectively, we utilize a pair-wise regression method to conduct fair-aware data augmentation for LLM fine-tuning. The experiment demonstrates that our method outperforms existing approaches in ranking fairness, achieving this with only a small reduction in accuracy. Lastly, we emphasize the need for the community to identify and mitigate the implicit unfairness, aiming to avert the potential deterioration in the reinforced human-LLMs ecosystem deterioration.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in EMNLP 2024 findings</p></details> |

Along with scaling them up directly, these models enable LLVMs to showcase powerful vision language (VL) performances by covering diverse tasks via natural language instructions. However, existing open-source LLVMs that perform comparably to closed-source LLVMs such as GPT-4V are often considered too large (e.g., 26B, 34B, and 110B parameters), having a larger number of layers. These large models demand costly, high-end resources for both training and inference. To address this issue, we present a new efficient LLVM family with 1.8B, 3.8B, and 7B LLM model sizes, Traversal of Layers (TroL), which enables the reuse of layers in a token-wise manner. This layer traversing technique simulates the effect of looking back and retracing the answering stream while increasing the number of forward propagation layers without physically adding more layers. We demonstrate that TroL employs a simple layer traversing approach yet efficiently outperforms the open-source LLVMs with larger model sizes and rivals the performances of the closed-source LLVMs with substantial sizes.</p></details> | <details><summary>EMNLP...</summary><p>EMNLP 2024.

| **[The Fine Line: Navigating Large Language Model Pretraining with Down-streaming Capability Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01204v2)** | 2024-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Uncovering early-stage metrics that reflect final model performance is one core principle for large-scale pretraining. The existing scaling law demonstrates the power-law correlation between pretraining loss and training flops, which serves as an important indicator of the current training state for large language models. However, this principle only focuses on the model's compression properties on the training data, resulting in an inconsistency with the ability improvements on the downstream tasks. Some follow-up works attempted to extend the scaling-law to more complex metrics (such as hyperparameters), but still lacked a comprehensive analysis of the dynamic differences among various capabilities during pretraining. To address the aforementioned limitations, this paper undertakes a comprehensive comparison of model capabilities at various pretraining intermediate checkpoints. Through this analysis, we confirm that specific downstream metrics exhibit similar training dynamics across models of different sizes, up to 67 billion parameters. In addition to our core findings, we've reproduced Amber and OpenLLaMA, releasing their intermediate checkpoints. This initiative offers valuable resources to the research community and facilitates the verification and exploration of LLM pretraining by open-source researchers. Besides, we provide empirical summaries, including performance comparisons of different models and capabilities, and tuition of key metrics for different training phases. Based on these findings, we provide a more user-friendly strategy for evaluating the optimization state, offering guidance for establishing a stable pretraining process.</p></details> |  |
| **[Source Attribution for Large Language Model-Generated Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00646v2)** | 2024-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The impressive performances of Large Language Models (LLMs) and their immense potential for commercialization have given rise to serious concerns over the Intellectual Property (IP) of their training data. In particular, the synthetic texts generated by LLMs may infringe the IP of the data being used to train the LLMs. To this end, it is imperative to be able to perform source attribution by identifying the data provider who contributed to the generation of a synthetic text by an LLM. In this paper, we show that this problem can be tackled by watermarking, i.e., by enabling an LLM to generate synthetic texts with embedded watermarks that contain information about their source(s). We identify the key properties of such watermarking frameworks (e.g., source attribution accuracy, robustness against adversaries), and propose a source attribution framework that satisfies these key properties due to our algorithmic designs. Our framework enables an LLM to learn an accurate mapping from the generated texts to data providers, which sets the foundation for effective source attribution. Extensive empirical evaluations show that our framework achieves effective source attribution.</p></details> |  |

However, the expensive memory and computational requirements present significant challenges for their practical deployment. Low-bit quantization has emerged as a critical approach to mitigate these challenges by reducing the bit-width of model parameters, activations, and gradients, thus decreasing memory usage and computational demands. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of low-bit quantization methods tailored for LLMs, covering the fundamental principles, system implementations, and algorithmic strategies. An overview of basic concepts and new data formats specific to low-bit LLMs is first introduced, followed by a review of frameworks and systems that facilitate low-bit LLMs across various hardware platforms. Then, we categorize and analyze techniques and toolkits for efficient low-bit training and inference of LLMs. Finally, we conclude with a discussion of future trends and potential advancements of low-bit LLMs. Our systematic overview from basic, system, and algorithm perspectives can offer valuable insights and guidelines for future works to enhance the efficiency and applicability of LLMs through low-bit quantization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Ruiha...</summary><p>Ruihao Gong leads the overall organization of the survey, with Yifu Ding and Jinyang Du contributing to Sections 2 and 3.

| **[A Prompting-Based Representation Learning Method for Recommendation with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16674v1)** | 2024-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, Recommender Systems (RS) have witnessed a transformative shift with the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP). Models such as GPT-3.5/4, Llama, have demonstrated unprecedented capabilities in understanding and generating human-like text. The extensive information pre-trained by these LLMs allows for the potential to capture a more profound semantic representation from different contextual information of users and items. While the great potential lies behind the thriving of LLMs, the challenge of leveraging user-item preferences from contextual information and its alignment with the improvement of Recommender Systems needs to be addressed. Believing that a better understanding of the user or item itself can be the key factor in improving recommendation performance, we conduct research on generating informative profiles using state-of-the-art LLMs. To boost the linguistic abilities of LLMs in Recommender Systems, we introduce the Prompting-Based Representation Learning Method for Recommendation (P4R). In our P4R framework, we utilize the LLM prompting strategy to create personalized item profiles. These profiles are then transformed into semantic representation spaces using a pre-trained BERT model for text embedding. Furthermore, we incorporate a Graph Convolution Network (GCN) for collaborative filtering representation. The P4R framework aligns these two embedding spaces in order to address the general recommendation tasks. In our evaluation, we compare P4R with state-of-the-art Recommender models and assess the quality of prompt-based profile generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Risks...</summary><p>Risks: The 1st International Workshop on Risks, Opportunities, and Evaluation of Generative Models in Recommendation</p></details> |

It is important to assess the influence of different types of biases embedded in LLMs to ensure fair use in sensitive fields. Although there have been extensive works on bias assessment in English, such efforts are rare and scarce for a major language like Bangla. In this work, we examine two types of social biases in LLM generated outputs for Bangla language. Our main contributions in this work are: (1) bias studies on two different social biases for Bangla (2) a curated dataset for bias measurement benchmarking (3) testing two different probing techniques for bias detection in the context of Bangla. This is the first work of such kind involving bias assessment of LLMs for Bangla to the best of our knowledge.

It focuses on examining and analyzing time-based digital artefacts, such as timestamps derived from event logs, file metadata, and other relevant data, to correlate events linked to cyber incidents and reconstruct their chronological sequence. Traditional tools often struggle to efficiently handle the large volume and variety of data generated during DF investigations and Incident Response (IR) processes. This paper introduces a novel framework, GenDFIR, which combines Rule-Based Artificial Intelligence (R-BAI) algorithms with Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance and automate the TA process. The proposed approach consists of two key stages: (1) R-BAI is used to identify and select anomalous digital artefacts based on predefined rules. (2) The selected artefacts are then transformed into embeddings for processing by an LLM with the assistance of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) agent. The LLM uses its capabilities to perform automated TA on the artefacts and predict potential incident outcomes. To validate the framework, we evaluated its performance, efficiency, and reliability. Several metrics were applied to simulated cyber incident scenarios, which were presented as forensic case documents. Our findings demonstrate the significant potential of integrating R-BAI and LLMs for TA. This innovative approach underscores the power of Generative AI (GenAI), particularly LLMs, and opens up new possibilities for advanced threat detection and incident reconstruction, marking a significant advancement in the field.</p></details> | 22 pages V3.1 |

However, manually writing unit tests is challenging and time-consuming. The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) offers a new direction for automating unit test generation. Existing research primarily focuses on closed-source LLMs (e.g., ChatGPT and CodeX) with fixed prompting strategies, leaving the capabilities of advanced open-source LLMs with various prompting settings unexplored. Particularly, open-source LLMs offer advantages in data privacy protection and have demonstrated superior performance in some tasks. Moreover, effective prompting is crucial for maximizing LLMs' capabilities. In this paper, we conduct the first empirical study to fill this gap, based on 17 Java projects, five widely-used open-source LLMs with different structures and parameter sizes, and comprehensive evaluation metrics. Our findings highlight the significant influence of various prompt factors, show the performance of open-source LLMs compared to the commercial GPT-4 and the traditional Evosuite, and identify limitations in LLM-based unit test generation. We then derive a series of implications from our study to guide future research and practical use of LLM-based unit test generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ASE 2024, Research Paper Track</p></details> |

Speech-Text foundational models leverage large amounts of unlabelled and labelled data both in speech and text modalities to model human language. In this work, we propose novel techniques to use multi-modal LLM for ASR rescoring. We also explore discriminative training to further improve the foundational model rescoring performance. We demonstrate cross-modal knowledge transfer in speech-text LLM can benefit rescoring.

However, they mainly focus on single or multiple homogeneous robots on simple tasks. Practically, complex long-horizon tasks always require collaborations among multiple heterogeneous robots especially with more complex action spaces, which makes these tasks more challenging. To this end, we propose COHERENT, a novel LLM-based task planning framework for collaboration of heterogeneous multi-robot systems including quadrotors, robotic dogs, and robotic arms. Specifically, a Proposal-Execution-Feedback-Adjustment (PEFA) mechanism is designed to decompose and assign actions for individual robots, where a centralized task assigner makes a task planning proposal to decompose the complex task into subtasks, and then assigns subtasks to robot executors. Each robot executor selects a feasible action to implement the assigned subtask and reports self-reflection feedback to the task assigner for plan adjustment. The PEFA loops until the task is completed. Moreover, we create a challenging heterogeneous multi-robot task planning benchmark encompassing 100 complex long-horizon tasks. The experimental results show that our work surpasses the previous methods by a large margin in terms of success rate and execution efficiency. The experimental videos, code, and benchmark are released at https://github.com/MrKeee/COHERENT.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 5 figures.

The interactive nature of these applications demands low latency for LLM inference. Existing LLM serving systems use run-to-completion processing for inference jobs, which suffers from head-of-line blocking and long latency. We present FastServe, a distributed inference serving system for LLMs. FastServe exploits the autoregressive pattern of LLM inference to enable preemption at the granularity of each output token. FastServe uses preemptive scheduling to minimize latency with a novel skip-join Multi-Level Feedback Queue scheduler. Based on the new semi-information-agnostic setting of LLM inference, the scheduler leverages the input length information to assign an appropriate initial queue for each arrival job to join. The higher priority queues than the joined queue are skipped to reduce demotions. We design an efficient GPU memory management mechanism that proactively offloads and uploads intermediate state between GPU memory and host memory for LLM inference. We build a system prototype of FastServe and experimental results show that compared to the state-of-the-art solution vLLM, FastServe improves the throughput by up to 31.4x and 17.9x under the same average and tail latency requirements, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enabling Auditory Large Language Models for Automatic Speech Quality Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16644v1)** | 2024-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Speech quality assessment typically requires evaluating audio from multiple aspects, such as mean opinion score (MOS) and speaker similarity (SIM) etc., which can be challenging to cover using one small model designed for a single task. In this paper, we propose leveraging recently introduced auditory large language models (LLMs) for automatic speech quality assessment. By employing task-specific prompts, auditory LLMs are finetuned to predict MOS, SIM and A/B testing results, which are commonly used for evaluating text-to-speech systems. Additionally, the finetuned auditory LLM is able to generate natural language descriptions assessing aspects like noisiness, distortion, discontinuity, and overall quality, providing more interpretable outputs. Extensive experiments have been performed on the NISQA, BVCC, SOMOS and VoxSim speech quality datasets, using open-source auditory LLMs such as SALMONN, Qwen-Audio, and Qwen2-Audio. For the natural language descriptions task, a commercial model Google Gemini 1.5 Pro is also evaluated. The results demonstrate that auditory LLMs achieve competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art task-specific small models in predicting MOS and SIM, while also delivering promising results in A/B testing and natural language descriptions.

| **[Judgment of Thoughts: Courtroom of the Binary Logical Reasoning in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16635v1)** | 2024-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes a novel prompt engineering technique called Judgment of Thought (JoT) that is specifically tailored for binary logical reasoning tasks. JoT employs three roles$\unicode{x2014}$lawyer, prosecutor, and judge$\unicode{x2014}$to facilitate more reliable and accurate reasoning by the model. In this framework, the judge utilizes a high$\unicode{x2010}$level model, while the lawyer and prosecutor utilize low$\unicode{x2010}$level models. This structure helps the judge better understand the responses from both the lawyer and prosecutor, enabling a more accurate judgment. Experimental results on large language model (LLM) benchmark datasets, such as BigBenchHard and Winogrande, demonstrate that JoT outperforms existing methods, including Chain of Thought (CoT) and Self$\unicode{x2010}$Consistency (SC), in binary logical reasoning tasks. Additionally, in real$\unicode{x2010}$world tasks, such as Fake News Detection and SMS Spam Detection, JoT shows comparable or improved performance compared to existing techniques. JoT significantly enhances the accuracy and reliability of models in binary reasoning tasks and show potential for practical applicability across various domains. Future research should aim to further broaden the applicability of JoT and optimize its implementation for real$\unicode{x2010}$world problem$\unicode{x2010}$solving.</p></details> |  |

The performance of DLRMs is heavily influenced by available bandwidth due to their large vector sizes in embedding tables and concurrent accesses. To achieve substantial improvements over existing solutions, novel approaches towards DLRM optimization are needed, especially, in the context of emerging interconnect technologies like CXL. This study delves into exploring CXL-enabled systems, implementing a process-in-fabric-switch (PIFS) solution to accelerate DLRMs while optimizing their memory and bandwidth scalability. We present an in-depth characterization of industry-scale DLRM workloads running on CXL-ready systems, identifying the predominant bottlenecks in existing CXL systems. We, therefore, propose PIFS-Rec, a PIFS-based scheme that implements near-data processing through downstream ports of the fabric switch. PIFS-Rec achieves a latency that is 3.89x lower than Pond, an industry-standard CXL-based system, and also outperforms BEACON, a state-of-the-art scheme, by 2.03x.</p></details> |  |

However, accessing the novelty in scholarly publications is a largely unexplored area in evaluating LLMs. In this paper, we introduce a scholarly novelty benchmark (SchNovel) to evaluate LLMs' ability to assess novelty in scholarly papers. SchNovel consists of 15000 pairs of papers across six fields sampled from the arXiv dataset with publication dates spanning 2 to 10 years apart. In each pair, the more recently published paper is assumed to be more novel. Additionally, we propose RAG-Novelty, which simulates the review process taken by human reviewers by leveraging the retrieval of similar papers to assess novelty. Extensive experiments provide insights into the capabilities of different LLMs to assess novelty and demonstrate that RAG-Novelty outperforms recent baseline models.</p></details> | under review |

With the further enhancement of this transformation, the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has elevated the intelligence levels of these platforms. However, current academic benchmarks provide limited guidance for real-world industry scenarios. This limitation arises because educational applications require more than mere test question responses. To bridge this gap, we introduce CJEval, a benchmark based on Chinese Junior High School Exam Evaluations. CJEval consists of 26,136 samples across four application-level educational tasks covering ten subjects. These samples include not only questions and answers but also detailed annotations such as question types, difficulty levels, knowledge concepts, and answer explanations. By utilizing this benchmark, we assessed LLMs' potential applications and conducted a comprehensive analysis of their performance by fine-tuning on various educational tasks. Extensive experiments and discussions have highlighted the opportunities and challenges of applying LLMs in the field of education.</p></details> |  |
| **[FLaRe: Achieving Masterful and Adaptive Robot Policies with Large-Scale Reinforcement Learning Fine-Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16578v1)** | 2024-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, the Robotics field has initiated several efforts toward building generalist robot policies through large-scale multi-task Behavior Cloning. However, direct deployments of these policies have led to unsatisfactory performance, where the policy struggles with unseen states and tasks. How can we break through the performance plateau of these models and elevate their capabilities to new heights? In this paper, we propose FLaRe, a large-scale Reinforcement Learning fine-tuning framework that integrates robust pre-trained representations, large-scale training, and gradient stabilization techniques. Our method aligns pre-trained policies towards task completion, achieving state-of-the-art (SoTA) performance both on previously demonstrated and on entirely novel tasks and embodiments. Specifically, on a set of long-horizon mobile manipulation tasks, FLaRe achieves an average success rate of 79.5% in unseen environments, with absolute improvements of +23.6% in simulation and +30.7% on real robots over prior SoTA methods. By utilizing only sparse rewards, our approach can enable generalizing to new capabilities beyond the pretraining data with minimal human effort. Moreover, we demonstrate rapid adaptation to new embodiments and behaviors with less than a day of fine-tuning.

However, replicating the nuanced patterns of expert human communication remains a challenge in Natural Language Processing (NLP). Recent advancements in NLP, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs) such as OpenAI's GPT-4, offer promising solutions by providing human-like and context-aware responses based on extensive pre-trained knowledge. Motivated by the effectiveness of LLMs in various educational tasks (e.g., content creation and summarization, problem-solving, and automated feedback provision), our study introduces the Socratic Playground for Learning (SPL), a dialogue-based ITS powered by the GPT-4 model, which employs the Socratic teaching method to foster critical thinking among learners. Through extensive prompt engineering, SPL can generate specific learning scenarios and facilitates efficient multi-turn tutoring dialogues. The SPL system aims to enhance personalized and adaptive learning experiences tailored to individual needs, specifically focusing on improving critical thinking skills. Our pilot experimental results from essay writing tasks demonstrate SPL has the potential to improve tutoring interactions and further enhance dialogue-based ITS functionalities. Our study, exemplified by SPL, demonstrates how LLMs enhance dialogue-based ITSs and expand the accessibility and efficacy of educational technologies.</p></details> |  |
| **[APILOT: Navigating Large Language Models to Generate Secure Code by Sidestepping Outdated API Pitfalls](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16526v1)** | 2024-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid development of large language models (LLMs), their applications have expanded into diverse fields, such as code assistance. However, the substantial size of LLMs makes their training highly resource- and time-intensive, rendering frequent retraining or updates impractical. Consequently, time-sensitive data can become outdated, potentially misleading LLMs in time-aware tasks. For example, new vulnerabilities are discovered in various programs every day. Without updating their knowledge, LLMs may inadvertently generate code that includes these newly discovered vulnerabilities. Current strategies, such as prompt engineering and fine-tuning, do not effectively address this issue. To address this issue, we propose solution, named APILOT, which maintains a realtime, quickly updatable dataset of outdated APIs. Additionally, APILOT utilizes an augmented generation method that leverages this dataset to navigate LLMs in generating secure, version-aware code. We conducted a comprehensive evaluation to measure the effectiveness of APILOT in reducing the incidence of outdated API recommendations across seven different state-of-the-art LLMs. The evaluation results indicate that APILOT can reduce outdated code recommendations by 89.42% on average with limited performance overhead. Interestingly, while enhancing security, APILOT also improves the usability of the code generated by LLMs, showing an average increase of 27.54% in usability. This underscores APILOT's dual capability to enhance both the safety and practical utility of code suggestions in contemporary software development environments.</p></details> |  |

We build on an opensource tropical and infectious diseases (TRINDs) dataset, expanding it to include demographic and semantic clinical and consumer augmentations yielding 11000+ prompts. We evaluate LLM performance on these, comparing generalist and medical LLMs, as well as LLM outcomes to human experts. We demonstrate through systematic experimentation, the benefit of contextual information such as demographics, location, gender, risk factors for optimal LLM response. Finally we develop a prototype of TRINDs-LM, a research tool that provides a playground to navigate how context impacts LLM outputs for health.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Unified Hallucination Mitigation Framework for Large Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16494v1)** | 2024-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hallucination is a common problem for Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) with long generations which is difficult to eradicate. The generation with hallucinations is partially inconsistent with the image content. To mitigate hallucination, current studies either focus on the process of model inference or the results of model generation, but the solutions they design sometimes do not deal appropriately with various types of queries and the hallucinations of the generations about these queries. To accurately deal with various hallucinations, we present a unified framework, Dentist, for hallucination mitigation. The core step is to first classify the queries, then perform different processes of hallucination mitigation based on the classification result, just like a dentist first observes the teeth and then makes a plan. In a simple deployment, Dentist can classify queries as perception or reasoning and easily mitigate potential hallucinations in answers which has been demonstrated in our experiments. On MMbench, we achieve a 13.44%/10.2%/15.8% improvement in accuracy on Image Quality, a Coarse Perception visual question answering (VQA) task, over the baseline InstructBLIP/LLaVA/VisualGLM.</p></details> | Accepted by TMLR |

However, existing methods often uncritically use the original diffusion formulation, which may not be optimal due to the fundamental differences between dense prediction and image generation. In this paper, we provide a systemic analysis of the diffusion formulation for the dense prediction, focusing on both quality and efficiency. And we find that the original parameterization type for image generation, which learns to predict noise, is harmful for dense prediction; the multi-step noising/denoising diffusion process is also unnecessary and challenging to optimize. Based on these insights, we introduce Lotus, a diffusion-based visual foundation model with a simple yet effective adaptation protocol for dense prediction. Specifically, Lotus is trained to directly predict annotations instead of noise, thereby avoiding harmful variance. We also reformulate the diffusion process into a single-step procedure, simplifying optimization and significantly boosting inference speed. Additionally, we introduce a novel tuning strategy called detail preserver, which achieves more accurate and fine-grained predictions. Without scaling up the training data or model capacity, Lotus achieves SoTA performance in zero-shot depth and normal estimation across various datasets. It also significantly enhances efficiency, being hundreds of times faster than most existing diffusion-based methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://lotus3d.github.io/</p></details> |

While the emergence of large language models (LLMs) and multimodal large language models (MM-LLMs) propels advancements in artificial general intelligence through their versatile capabilities, they still lack true any-to-any understanding and generation. Recently, the release of GPT-4o has showcased the remarkable potential of any-to-any LLMs for complex real-world tasks, enabling omnidirectional input and output across images, speech, and text. However, it is closed-source and does not support the generation of multimodal interleaved sequences. To address this gap, we present MIO, which is trained on a mixture of discrete tokens across four modalities using causal multimodal modeling. MIO undergoes a four-stage training process: (1) alignment pre-training, (2) interleaved pre-training, (3) speech-enhanced pre-training, and (4) comprehensive supervised fine-tuning on diverse textual, visual, and speech tasks. Our experimental results indicate that MIO exhibits competitive, and in some cases superior, performance compared to previous dual-modal baselines, any-to-any model baselines, and even modality-specific baselines. Moreover, MIO demonstrates advanced capabilities inherent to its any-to-any feature, such as interleaved video-text generation, chain-of-visual-thought reasoning, visual guideline generation, instructional image editing, etc.</p></details> | <details><summary>Techn...</summary><p>Technical Report.

| **[Uni-Med: A Unified Medical Generalist Foundation Model For Multi-Task Learning Via Connector-MoE](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17508v1)** | 2024-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have shown impressive capabilities as a general-purpose interface for various visual and linguistic tasks. However, building a unified MLLM for multi-task learning in the medical field remains a thorny challenge. To mitigate the tug-of-war problem of multi-modal multi-task optimization, recent advances primarily focus on improving the LLM components, while neglecting the connector that bridges the gap between modalities. In this paper, we introduce Uni-Med, a novel medical generalist foundation model which consists of a universal visual feature extraction module, a connector mixture-of-experts (CMoE) module, and an LLM. Benefiting from the proposed CMoE that leverages a well-designed router with a mixture of projection experts at the connector, Uni-Med achieves efficient solution to the tug-of-war problem and can perform six different medical tasks including question answering, visual question answering, report generation, referring expression comprehension, referring expression generation and image classification. To the best of our knowledge, Uni-Med is the first effort to tackle multi-task interference at the connector. Extensive ablation experiments validate the effectiveness of introducing CMoE under any configuration, with up to an average 8% performance gains. We further provide interpretation analysis of the tug-of-war problem from the perspective of gradient optimization and parameter statistics. Compared to previous state-of-the-art medical MLLMs, Uni-Med achieves competitive or superior evaluation metrics on diverse tasks. Code, data and model will be soon available at GitHub.</p></details> |  |

Foundation models, based on self-supervised learning, address these issues and improve data efficiency. Natural domain foundation models show promise for medical imaging, but systematic research evaluating domain adaptation, especially using self-supervised learning and parameter-efficient fine-tuning, remains underexplored. Additionally, little research addresses the issue of catastrophic forgetting during fine-tuning of foundation models. We adapted the DINOv2 vision transformer for retinal imaging classification tasks using self-supervised learning and generated two novel foundation models termed DINORET and BE DINORET. Publicly available color fundus photographs were employed for model development and subsequent fine-tuning for diabetic retinopathy staging and glaucoma detection. We introduced block expansion as a novel domain adaptation strategy and assessed the models for catastrophic forgetting. Models were benchmarked to RETFound, a state-of-the-art foundation model in ophthalmology. DINORET and BE DINORET demonstrated competitive performance on retinal imaging tasks, with the block expanded model achieving the highest scores on most datasets. Block expansion successfully mitigated catastrophic forgetting. Our few-shot learning studies indicated that DINORET and BE DINORET outperform RETFound in terms of data-efficiency. This study highlights the potential of adapting natural domain vision models to retinal imaging using self-supervised learning and block expansion. BE DINORET offers robust performance without sacrificing previously acquired capabilities. Our findings suggest that these methods could enable healthcare institutions to develop tailored vision models for their patient populations, enhancing global healthcare inclusivity.</p></details> | <details><summary>J.Zoe...</summary><p>J.Zoellin, C.

The state-of-the-art for processing raw inputs, though, are deep neural networks (DNNs), nowadays often based off from multimodal foundation models. These automatically learn rich representations of concepts and respective reasoning. Unfortunately, the learned qualitative knowledge is opaque, preventing easy inspection, validation, or adaptation against available QR models. So far, it is possible to associate pre-defined concepts with latent representations of DNNs, but extractable relations are mostly limited to semantic similarity. As a next step towards QR for validation and verification of DNNs: Concretely, we propose a method that extracts the learned superclass hierarchy from a multimodal DNN for a given set of leaf concepts. Under the hood we (1) obtain leaf concept embeddings using the DNN's textual input modality; (2) apply hierarchical clustering to them, using that DNNs encode semantic similarities via vector distances; and (3) label the such-obtained parent concepts using search in available ontologies from QR. An initial evaluation study shows that meaningful ontological class hierarchies can be extracted from state-of-the-art foundation models. Furthermore, we demonstrate how to validate and verify a DNN's learned representations against given ontologies. Lastly, we discuss potential future applications in the context of QR.</p></details> | <details><summary>Quali...</summary><p>Qualitative Reasoning Workshop 2024 (QR2024) colocated with ECAI2024, camera-ready submission; first two authors contributed equally; 10 pages, 4 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

| **[How to Connect Speech Foundation Models and Large Language Models? What Matters and What Does Not](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17044v1)** | 2024-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The remarkable performance achieved by Large Language Models (LLM) has driven research efforts to leverage them for a wide range of tasks and input modalities. In speech-to-text (S2T) tasks, the emerging solution consists of projecting the output of the encoder of a Speech Foundational Model (SFM) into the LLM embedding space through an adapter module. However, no work has yet investigated how much the downstream-task performance depends on each component (SFM, adapter, LLM) nor whether the best design of the adapter depends on the chosen SFM and LLM. To fill this gap, we evaluate the combination of 5 adapter modules, 2 LLMs (Mistral and Llama), and 2 SFMs (Whisper and SeamlessM4T) on two widespread S2T tasks, namely Automatic Speech Recognition and Speech Translation. Our results demonstrate that the SFM plays a pivotal role in downstream performance, while the adapter choice has moderate impact and depends on the SFM and LLM.</p></details> |  |

These theoretically-derived dimensions aim to provide a comprehensive profile of an individual's moral concerns which, in recent work, has been linked to behaviour in a range of domains, including society, politics, health, and the environment. In this paper, we investigate how moral foundation dimensions can contribute to predicting an individual's stance on a given target. Specifically we incorporate moral foundation features extracted from text, along with message semantic features, to classify stances at both message- and user-levels using both traditional machine learning models and large language models. Our preliminary results suggest that encoding moral foundations can enhance the performance of stance detection tasks and help illuminate the associations between specific moral foundations and online stances on target topics. The results highlight the importance of considering deeper psychological attributes in stance analysis and underscores the role of moral foundations in guiding online social behavior.</p></details> | 8 pages, 3 figures |

In order to effectively learn correspondences and mis-correspondences between an image pair for the change detection task, we propose to a) ``freeze'' the backbone in order to retain the generality of dense foundation features, and b) employ ``full-image'' cross-attention to better tackle the viewpoint variations between the image pair. We evaluate our approach on two benchmark datasets, VL-CMU-CD and PSCD, along with their viewpoint-varied versions. Our experiments demonstrate significant improvements in F1-score, particularly in scenarios involving geometric changes between image pairs. The results indicate our method's superior generalization capabilities over existing state-of-the-art approaches, showing robustness against photometric and geometric variations as well as better overall generalization when fine-tuned to adapt to new environments. Detailed ablation studies further validate the contributions of each component in our architecture. Source code will be made publicly available upon acceptance.</p></details> | 7 pages |

Our approach leverages a state-of-the-art Vision Foundation Model (VFM) within an encoder-decoder architecture, incorporating cross-attention mechanisms to enhance feature integration. This design captures detailed global representations and preserves essential spectral characteristics, treating RGB-to-NIR translation as more than a simple domain transfer problem. A multi-scale PatchGAN discriminator ensures realistic image generation at various detail levels, while carefully designed loss functions couple global context understanding with local feature preservation. We performed experiments on the RANUS dataset to demonstrate Pix2Next's advantages in quantitative metrics and visual quality, improving the FID score by 34.81% compared to existing methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate the practical utility of Pix2Next by showing improved performance on a downstream object detection task using generated NIR data to augment limited real NIR datasets. The proposed approach enables the scaling up of NIR datasets without additional data acquisition or annotation efforts, potentially accelerating advancements in NIR-based computer vision applications.</p></details> | 19 pages,12 figures |

Automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems are often limited by available transcribed speech data and benefit from a second pass rescoring using LLM. Recently multi-modal large language models, particularly speech and text foundational models have demonstrated strong spoken language understanding. Speech-Text foundational models leverage large amounts of unlabelled and labelled data both in speech and text modalities to model human language. In this work, we propose novel techniques to use multi-modal LLM for ASR rescoring. We also explore discriminative training to further improve the foundational model rescoring performance. We demonstrate cross-modal knowledge transfer in speech-text LLM can benefit rescoring. Our experiments demonstrate up-to 20% relative improvements over Whisper large ASR and up-to 15% relative improvements over text-only LLM.</p></details> |  |

We used ECG-Image-Kit, an open-source Python toolkit, to generate realistic images of 12-lead ECG printouts from raw ECG time-series. The images include realistic distortions such as noise, wrinkles, stains, and perspective shifts, generated both digitally and physically. The toolkit was applied to 977 12-lead ECG records from the PTB-XL database and 1,000 from Emory Healthcare to create high-fidelity synthetic ECG images. These unique images were subjected to both programmatic distortions using ECG-Image-Kit and physical effects like soaking, staining, and mold growth, followed by scanning and photography under various lighting conditions to create real-world artifacts. The resulting dataset includes 35,595 software-labeled ECG images with a wide range of imaging artifacts and distortions. The dataset provides ground truth time-series data alongside the images, offering a reference for developing machine and deep learning models for ECG digitization and classification. The images vary in quality, from clear scans of clean papers to noisy photographs of degraded papers, enabling the development of more generalizable digitization algorithms. ECG-Image-Database addresses a critical need for digitizing paper-based and non-digital ECGs for computerized analysis, providing a foundation for developing robust machine and deep learning models capable of converting ECG images into time-series. The dataset aims to serve as a reference for ECG digitization and computerized annotation efforts. ECG-Image-Database was used in the PhysioNet Challenge 2024 on ECG image digitization and classification.</p></details> |  |

The proposed method is evaluated on multiple speech restoration tasks, including speech denoising, bandwidth extension, codec artifact removal, and target speaker extraction. In all scenarios, finetuning our pretrained model results in superior performance over strong baselines. Notably, in the target speaker extraction task, our model outperforms existing systems, including those leveraging SSL-pretrained encoders like WavLM.

| **[Expert-level vision-language foundation model for real-world radiology and comprehensive evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16183v1)** | 2024-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Radiology is a vital and complex component of modern clinical workflow and covers many tasks. Recently, vision-language (VL) foundation models in medicine have shown potential in processing multimodal information, offering a unified solution for various radiology tasks. However, existing studies either pre-trained VL models on natural data or did not fully integrate vision-language architecture and pretraining, often neglecting the unique multimodal complexity in radiology images and their textual contexts. Additionally, their practical applicability in real-world scenarios remains underexplored. Here, we present RadFound, a large and open-source vision-language foundation model tailored for radiology, that is trained on the most extensive dataset of over 8.1 million images and 250,000 image-text pairs, covering 19 major organ systems and 10 imaging modalities. To establish expert-level multimodal perception and generation capabilities, RadFound introduces an enhanced vision encoder to capture intra-image local features and inter-image contextual information, and a unified cross-modal learning design tailored to radiology. To fully assess the models' capability, we construct a benchmark, RadVLBench, including radiology interpretation tasks like medical vision-language question-answering, as well as text generation tasks ranging from captioning to report generation. We also propose a human evaluation framework. When evaluated on the real-world benchmark involving three representative modalities, 2D images (chest X-rays), multi-view images (mammograms), and 3D images (thyroid CT scans), RadFound significantly outperforms other VL foundation models on both quantitative metrics and human evaluation. In summary, the development of RadFound represents an advancement in radiology generalists, demonstrating broad applicability potential for integration into clinical workflows.</p></details> |  |

Sound planning ability is necessary for robust automation in many task domains, but especially in surgical automation. These agents rely on a highly detailed natural language representation of the scene. Thus, to leverage the emergent capabilities of LLM agents for surgical task planning, developing similarly powerful and robust perception algorithms is necessary to derive a detailed scene representation of the environment from visual input. Previous research has focused primarily on enabling LLM-based task planning while adopting simple yet severely limited perception solutions to meet the needs for bench-top experiments but lack the critical flexibility to scale to less constrained settings. In this work, we propose an alternate perception approach -- a digital twin-based machine perception approach that capitalizes on the convincing performance and out-of-the-box generalization of recent vision foundation models. Integrating our digital twin-based scene representation and LLM agent for planning with the dVRK platform, we develop an embodied intelligence system and evaluate its robustness in performing peg transfer and gauze retrieval tasks. Our approach shows strong task performance and generalizability to varied environment settings. Despite convincing performance, this work is merely a first step towards the integration of digital twin-based scene representations. Future studies are necessary for the realization of a comprehensive digital twin framework to improve the interpretability and generalizability of embodied intelligence in surgery.</p></details> |  |

However, there has been limited work on integrating an additional, typically low-resource, language, while maintaining performance on the original language set. Fine-tuning, while simple, may degrade the accuracy of the original set. We compare three approaches that exploit adaptation parameters: soft language code tuning, train only the language code; soft prompt tuning, train prepended tokens; and LoRA where a small set of additional parameters are optimised. Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) offers an alternative compromise with the potential to maintain performance in specific target languages. Results show that direct fine-tuning yields the best performance for the new language but degrades existing language capabilities. EWC can address this issue for specific languages. If only adaptation parameters are used, the language capabilities are maintained but at the cost of performance in the new language.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proce...</summary><p>Proceedings of Interspeech</p></details> |

In this context, a variety of GNNs have emerged as promising methodologies for encoding the structural information of graphs. By effectively capturing the graph's underlying structure, these GNNs have shown great potential in enhancing performance in graph learning tasks, such as link prediction and node classification. However, despite their successes, a significant challenge persists: these advanced methods often face difficulties in generalizing to unseen graph data that significantly differs from the training instances. In this work, our aim is to advance the graph learning paradigm by developing a general graph foundation model. This model is designed to understand the complex topological patterns present in diverse graph data, enabling it to excel in zero-shot graph learning tasks across different downstream datasets. To achieve this goal, we address several key technical challenges in our OpenGraph model. Firstly, we propose a unified graph tokenizer to adapt our graph model to generalize well on unseen graph data, even when the underlying graph properties differ significantly from those encountered during training. Secondly, we develop a scalable graph transformer as the foundational encoder, which effectively captures node-wise dependencies within the global topological context. Thirdly, we introduce a data augmentation mechanism enhanced by a LLM to alleviate the limitations of data scarcity in real-world scenarios. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our framework. By adapting our OpenGraph to new graph characteristics and comprehending the nuances of diverse graphs, our approach achieves remarkable zero-shot graph learning performance across various settings and domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by EMNLP'2024</p></details> |
| **[Time-MoE: Billion-Scale Time Series Foundation Models with Mixture of Experts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16040v1)** | 2024-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning for time series forecasting has seen significant advancements over the past decades. However, despite the success of large-scale pre-training in language and vision domains, pre-trained time series models remain limited in scale and operate at a high cost, hindering the development of larger capable forecasting models in real-world applications. In response, we introduce Time-MoE, a scalable and unified architecture designed to pre-train larger, more capable forecasting foundation models while reducing inference costs. By leveraging a sparse mixture-of-experts (MoE) design, Time-MoE enhances computational efficiency by activating only a subset of networks for each prediction, reducing computational load while maintaining high model capacity. This allows Time-MoE to scale effectively without a corresponding increase in inference costs. Time-MoE comprises a family of decoder-only transformer models that operate in an auto-regressive manner and support flexible forecasting horizons with varying input context lengths. We pre-trained these models on our newly introduced large-scale data Time-300B, which spans over 9 domains and encompassing over 300 billion time points. For the first time, we scaled a time series foundation model up to 2.4 billion parameters, achieving significantly improved forecasting precision. Our results validate the applicability of scaling laws for training tokens and model size in the context of time series forecasting. Compared to dense models with the same number of activated parameters or equivalent computation budgets, our models consistently outperform them by large margin. These advancements position Time-MoE as a state-of-the-art solution for tackling real-world time series forecasting challenges with superior capability, efficiency, and flexibility.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 10 figures, 13 tables</p></details> |
| **[Towards Universal Large-Scale Foundational Model for Natural Gas Demand Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15794v1)** | 2024-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the context of global energy strategy, accurate natural gas demand forecasting is crucial for ensuring efficient resource allocation and operational planning. Traditional forecasting methods struggle to cope with the growing complexity and variability of gas consumption patterns across diverse industries and commercial sectors. To address these challenges, we propose the first foundation model specifically tailored for natural gas demand forecasting. Foundation models, known for their ability to generalize across tasks and datasets, offer a robust solution to the limitations of traditional methods, such as the need for separate models for different customer segments and their limited generalization capabilities. Our approach leverages contrastive learning to improve prediction accuracy in real-world scenarios, particularly by tackling issues such as noise in historical consumption data and the potential misclassification of similar data samples, which can lead to degradation in the quaility of the representation and thus the accuracy of downstream forecasting tasks. By integrating advanced noise filtering techniques within the contrastive learning framework, our model enhances the quality of learned representations, leading to more accurate predictions. Furthermore, the model undergoes industry-specific fine-tuning during pretraining, enabling it to better capture the unique characteristics of gas consumption across various sectors. We conducted extensive experiments using a large-scale dataset from ENN Group, which includes data from over 10,000 industrial, commercial, and welfare-related customers across multiple regions. Our model outperformed existing state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating a relative improvement in MSE by 3.68\% and in MASE by 6.15\% compared to the best available model.</p></details> |  |
| **[dnaGrinder: a lightweight and high-capacity genomic foundation model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15697v1)** | 2024-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The task of understanding and interpreting the complex information encoded within genomic sequences remains a grand challenge in biological research and clinical applications. In this context, recent advancements in large language model research have led to the development of both encoder-only and decoder-only foundation models designed to decode intricate information in DNA sequences. However, several issues persist, particularly regarding the efficient management of long-range dependencies inherent in genomic sequences, the effective representation of nucleotide variations, and the considerable computational costs associated with large model architectures and extensive pretraining datasets. Current genomic foundation models often face a critical tradeoff: smaller models with mediocre performance versus large models with improved performance. To address these challenges, we introduce dnaGrinder, a unique and efficient genomic foundation model. dnaGrinder excels at managing long-range dependencies within genomic sequences while minimizing computational costs without compromising performance. It achieves results that are not just comparable but often superior to leading DNA models such as Nucleotide Transformer and DNABERT-2. Furthermore, dnaGrinder is designed for easy fine-tuning on workstation-grade GPUs, accommodating input lengths exceeding 17,000 tokens. On a single high-performance GPU, it supports sequences longer than 140,000 tokens, making it a highly efficient and accessible tool for both basic biological research and clinical applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[ReVLA: Reverting Visual Domain Limitation of Robotic Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15250v1)** | 2024-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent progress in large language models and access to large-scale robotic datasets has sparked a paradigm shift in robotics models transforming them into generalists able to adapt to various tasks, scenes, and robot modalities. A large step for the community are open Vision Language Action models which showcase strong performance in a wide variety of tasks. In this work, we study the visual generalization capabilities of three existing robotic foundation models, and propose a corresponding evaluation framework. Our study shows that the existing models do not exhibit robustness to visual out-of-domain scenarios. This is potentially caused by limited variations in the training data and/or catastrophic forgetting, leading to domain limitations in the vision foundation models. We further explore OpenVLA, which uses two pre-trained vision foundation models and is, therefore, expected to generalize to out-of-domain experiments. However, we showcase catastrophic forgetting by DINO-v2 in OpenVLA through its failure to fulfill the task of depth regression. To overcome the aforementioned issue of visual catastrophic forgetting, we propose a gradual backbone reversal approach founded on model merging. This enables OpenVLA which requires the adaptation of the visual backbones during initial training -- to regain its visual generalization ability. Regaining this capability enables our ReVLA model to improve over OpenVLA by a factor of 77% and 66% for grasping and lifting in visual OOD tasks .</p></details> |  |
| **[A Survey of Resource-efficient LLM and Multimodal Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08092v2)** | 2024-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large foundation models, including large language models (LLMs), vision transformers (ViTs), diffusion, and LLM-based multimodal models, are revolutionizing the entire machine learning lifecycle, from training to deployment. However, the substantial advancements in versatility and performance these models offer come at a significant cost in terms of hardware resources. To support the growth of these large models in a scalable and environmentally sustainable way, there has been a considerable focus on developing resource-efficient strategies. This survey delves into the critical importance of such research, examining both algorithmic and systemic aspects. It offers a comprehensive analysis and valuable insights gleaned from existing literature, encompassing a broad array of topics from cutting-edge model architectures and training/serving algorithms to practical system designs and implementations.

| **[Training a high-performance retinal foundation model with half-the-data and 400 times less compute](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00117v2)** | 2024-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Artificial Intelligence in medicine is traditionally limited by the lack of massive training datasets. Foundation models, pre-trained models that can be adapted to downstream tasks with small datasets, could alleviate this problem. Researchers at Moorfields Eye Hospital (MEH) proposed RETFound-MEH, a retinal foundation model trained on 900,000 images, including private hospital data. Recently, data-efficient DERETFound was proposed providing comparable performance while being trained on only 150,000 publicly available images. However, both these models required very substantial resources to train initially and are resource-intensive in downstream use. We propose a novel Token Reconstruction objective that we use to train RETFound-Green, a retinal foundation model trained using only 75,000 publicly available images and 400 times less compute. We estimate the cost of training RETFound-MEH and DERETFound at \$10,000 and \$14,000, respectively. RETFound-Green could be trained for less than \$100, with equally reduced environmental impact. RETFound-Green is also far more efficient in downstream use: it can be downloaded 14 times faster, computes vector embeddings 2.7 times faster which then require 2.6 times less storage space. Despite this, RETFound-Green does not perform systematically worse. In fact, on various task on three downstream datasets from Brazil, India and China, it performs best on 68 tasks out of 119 comparisons, versus 21 for DERETFound and 13 for RETFound-MEH. Our results suggest that RETFound-Green is a very efficient, high-performance retinal foundation model. We anticipate that our Token Reconstruction objective could be scaled up for even higher performance and be applied to other domains beyond retinal imaging.</p></details> |  |
| **[Text-Free Multi-domain Graph Pre-training: Toward Graph Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13934v4)** | 2024-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Given the ubiquity of graph data, it is intriguing to ask: Is it possible to train a graph foundation model on a broad range of graph data across diverse domains? A major hurdle toward this goal lies in the fact that graphs from different domains often exhibit profoundly divergent characteristics. Although there have been some initial efforts in integrating multi-domain graphs for pre-training, they primarily rely on textual descriptions to align the graphs, limiting their application to text-attributed graphs. Moreover, different source domains may conflict or interfere with each other, and their relevance to the target domain can vary significantly. To address these issues, we propose MDGPT, a text free Multi-Domain Graph Pre-Training and adaptation framework designed to exploit multi-domain knowledge for graph learning. First, we propose a set of domain tokens to to align features across source domains for synergistic pre-training. Second, we propose a dual prompts, consisting of a unifying prompt and a mixing prompt, to further adapt the target domain with unified multi-domain knowledge and a tailored mixture of domain-specific knowledge. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments involving six public datasets to evaluate and analyze MDGPT, which outperforms prior art by up to 37.9%.</p></details> | Under review |

We hypothesize that MFMs, with their joint pre-training across multiple modalities, will be more effective in non-verbal sounds emotion recognition (NVER) by better interpreting and differentiating subtle emotional cues that may be ambiguous in audio-only foundation models (AFMs). To validate our hypothesis, we extract representations from state-of-the-art (SOTA) MFMs and AFMs and evaluated them on benchmark NVER datasets. We also investigate the potential of combining selected foundation model representations to enhance NVER further inspired by research in speech recognition and audio deepfake detection. To achieve this, we propose a framework called MATA (Intra-Modality Alignment through Transport Attention). Through MATA coupled with the combination of MFMs: LanguageBind and ImageBind, we report the topmost performance with accuracies of 76.47%, 77.40%, 75.12% and F1-scores of 70.35%, 76.19%, 74.63% for ASVP-ESD, JNV, and VIVAE datasets against individual FMs and baseline fusion techniques and report SOTA on the benchmark datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ICASSP 2025</p></details> |

Enhancing the capabilities of NeRFs in open-vocabulary 3D semantic perception tasks has been a recent focus. However, current methods that extract semantics directly from Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) for semantic field learning encounter difficulties due to noisy and view-inconsistent semantics provided by CLIP. To tackle these limitations, we propose OV-NeRF, which exploits the potential of pre-trained vision and language foundation models to enhance semantic field learning through proposed single-view and cross-view strategies. First, from the single-view perspective, we introduce Region Semantic Ranking (RSR) regularization by leveraging 2D mask proposals derived from Segment Anything (SAM) to rectify the noisy semantics of each training view, facilitating accurate semantic field learning. Second, from the cross-view perspective, we propose a Cross-view Self-enhancement (CSE) strategy to address the challenge raised by view-inconsistent semantics. Rather than invariably utilizing the 2D inconsistent semantics from CLIP, CSE leverages the 3D consistent semantics generated from the well-trained semantic field itself for semantic field training, aiming to reduce ambiguity and enhance overall semantic consistency across different views. Extensive experiments validate our OV-NeRF outperforms current state-of-the-art methods, achieving a significant improvement of 20.31% and 18.42% in mIoU metric on Replica and ScanNet, respectively. Furthermore, our approach exhibits consistent superior results across various CLIP configurations, further verifying its robustness.

When we wield tools -- such as writing with a pen or cutting with scissors -- our hands would reach very specific poses, often drastically different from how we pick up the same objects just to transport them. In this work, we investigate the design of tool-wielding multi-finger robotic hands based on a hypothesis: the poses that a tool and a hand reach during tool-wielding -- what we call "foundational poses" (FPs) -- can be used as a selection mechanism in the design process. We interpret FPs as snapshots that capture the workings of underlying mechanisms formed by the tool and the hand, and one hand can form multiple mechanisms with the same tool. We tested our hypothesis in a hand design experiment, where we developed a sampling-based design optimization framework that uses FPs to computationally generate many different hand designs and evaluate them in multiple metrics. The results show that more than $99\%$ of the $10,785$ generated hand designs successfully wielded tools in simulation, supporting our hypothesis. Meanwhile, our methods provide insights into the non-convex, multi-objective hand design optimization problem that could be hard to unveil otherwise, such as clustering and the Pareto front. Lastly, we demonstrate our methods' real-world feasibility and potential with a hardware prototype equipped with rigid endoskeleton and soft skin.</p></details> |  |

Far-Better Fuse them with Speech Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14131v1)** | 2024-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this study, for the first time, we extensively investigate whether music foundation models (MFMs) or speech foundation models (SFMs) work better for singing voice deepfake detection (SVDD), which has recently attracted attention in the research community. For this, we perform a comprehensive comparative study of state-of-the-art (SOTA) MFMs (MERT variants and music2vec) and SFMs (pre-trained for general speech representation learning as well as speaker recognition). We show that speaker recognition SFM representations perform the best amongst all the foundation models (FMs), and this performance can be attributed to its higher efficacy in capturing the pitch, tone, intensity, etc, characteristics present in singing voices. To our end, we also explore the fusion of FMs for exploiting their complementary behavior for improved SVDD, and we propose a novel framework, FIONA for the same. With FIONA, through the synchronization of x-vector (speaker recognition SFM) and MERT-v1-330M (MFM), we report the best performance with the lowest Equal Error Rate (EER) of 13.74 %, beating all the individual FMs as well as baseline FM fusions and achieving SOTA results.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ICASSP 2025</p></details> |
| **[Foundation Models for Amodal Video Instance Segmentation in Automated Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14095v1)** | 2024-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we study amodal video instance segmentation for automated driving. Previous works perform amodal video instance segmentation relying on methods trained on entirely labeled video data with techniques borrowed from standard video instance segmentation. Such amodally labeled video data is difficult and expensive to obtain and the resulting methods suffer from a trade-off between instance segmentation and tracking performance. To largely solve this issue, we propose to study the application of foundation models for this task. More precisely, we exploit the extensive knowledge of the Segment Anything Model (SAM), while fine-tuning it to the amodal instance segmentation task. Given an initial video instance segmentation, we sample points from the visible masks to prompt our amodal SAM. We use a point memory to store those points. If a previously observed instance is not predicted in a following frame, we retrieve its most recent points from the point memory and use a point tracking method to follow those points to the current frame, together with the corresponding last amodal instance mask. This way, while basing our method on an amodal instance segmentation, we nevertheless obtain video-level amodal instance segmentation results. Our resulting S-AModal method achieves state-of-the-art results in amodal video instance segmentation while resolving the need for amodal video-based labels. Code for S-AModal is available at https://github.com/ifnspaml/S-AModal.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted at ECCV VCAD Workshop 2024</p></details> |

However, the proliferation of FMs brings forth a critical challenge: the potential to generate hallucinated outputs, particularly in high-stakes applications. The tendency of foundation models to produce hallucinated content arguably represents the biggest hindrance to their widespread adoption in real-world scenarios, especially in domains where reliability and accuracy are paramount. This survey paper presents a comprehensive overview of recent developments that aim to identify and mitigate the problem of hallucination in FMs, spanning text, image, video, and audio modalities. By synthesizing recent advancements in detecting and mitigating hallucination across various modalities, the paper aims to provide valuable insights for researchers, developers, and practitioners. Essentially, it establishes a clear framework encompassing definition, taxonomy, and detection strategies for addressing hallucination in multimodal foundation models, laying the foundation for future research in this pivotal area.</p></details> | EMNLP 2024 Findings |

Accurate modeling of these interactions is important to optimize driving performance, but the relevant physical phenomena are too complex to model from first principles. Therefore, we present an offline meta-learning algorithm to construct a rapidly-tunable model of residual dynamics and disturbances. Our model processes terrain images into features using a visual foundation model (VFM), then maps these features and the vehicle state to an estimate of the current actuation matrix using a deep neural network (DNN). We then combine this model with composite adaptive control to modify the last layer of the DNN in real time, accounting for the remaining terrain interactions not captured during offline training. We provide mathematical guarantees of stability and robustness for our controller and demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through simulations and hardware experiments with a tracked vehicle and a car-like robot. We evaluate our method outdoors on different slopes with varying slippage and actuator degradation disturbances, and compare against an adaptive controller that does not use the VFM terrain features. We show significant improvement over the baseline in both hardware experimentation and simulation.</p></details> |  |

While the parallel developments in the AI literature focus on foundation models -- models that can be effectively tuned to address multiple, different use cases -- the developments on the weather and climate side largely focus on single-use cases with particular emphasis on mid-range forecasting. We close this gap by introducing Prithvi WxC, a 2.3 billion parameter foundation model developed using 160 variables from the Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2 (MERRA-2). Prithvi WxC employs an encoder-decoder-based architecture, incorporating concepts from various recent transformer models to effectively capture both regional and global dependencies in the input data. The model has been designed to accommodate large token counts to model weather phenomena in different topologies at fine resolutions. Furthermore, it is trained with a mixed objective that combines the paradigms of masked reconstruction with forecasting. We test the model on a set of challenging downstream tasks namely: Autoregressive rollout forecasting, Downscaling, Gravity wave flux parameterization, and Extreme events estimation. The pretrained model with 2.3 billion parameters, along with the associated fine-tuning workflows, has been publicly released as an open-source contribution via Hugging Face.</p></details> |  |

However, most of these models are designed to handle short univariate time series as an input. This limits their practical use, especially in domains such as healthcare with copious amounts of long and multivariate data with strong temporal and intra-variate dependencies. Our study bridges this gap by cataloging and systematically comparing various context expansion techniques from both language and time series domains, and introducing a novel compressive memory mechanism to allow encoder-only TSFMs to effectively model intra-variate dependencies. We demonstrate the benefits of our approach by imbuing MOMENT, a recent family of multi-task time series foundation models, with the multivariate context.</p></details> |  |

They play a crucial role in understanding the psychological basis of human behavior and cultural orientation. The Moral Foundation Theory (MFT) is a well-established framework that identifies the core moral foundations underlying the manner in which different cultures shape individual and social lives. Recent advancements in natural language processing, particularly Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs), have enabled the extraction and analysis of moral dimensions from textual data. This survey presents a comprehensive review of MFT-informed PLMs, providing an analysis of moral tendencies in PLMs and their application in the context of the MFT. We also review relevant datasets and lexicons and discuss trends, limitations, and future directions.

In the medical domain, however, the development of comprehensive foundation models is constrained by limited access to diverse modalities and stringent privacy regulations. To address these constraints, this study introduces a novel knowledge injection approach, FedKIM, designed to scale the medical foundation model within a federated learning framework. FedKIM leverages lightweight local models to extract healthcare knowledge from private data and integrates this knowledge into a centralized foundation model using a designed adaptive Multitask Multimodal Mixture Of Experts (M3OE) module. This method not only preserves privacy but also enhances the model's ability to handle complex medical tasks involving multiple modalities. Our extensive experiments across twelve tasks in seven modalities demonstrate the effectiveness of FedKIM in various settings, highlighting its potential to scale medical foundation models without direct access to sensitive data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by EMNLP'24 Main</p></details> |

Furthermore, the ARS-Adapter, an efficient parameter fine-tuning method, is proposed to improve the model's adaptability and effectiveness in various ARS vision tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that RingMo-Aerial achieves SOTA performance on multiple downstream tasks.

| **[FreeAvatar: Robust 3D Facial Animation Transfer by Learning an Expression Foundation Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13180v1)** | 2024-09-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video-driven 3D facial animation transfer aims to drive avatars to reproduce the expressions of actors. Existing methods have achieved remarkable results by constraining both geometric and perceptual consistency. However, geometric constraints (like those designed on facial landmarks) are insufficient to capture subtle emotions, while expression features trained on classification tasks lack fine granularity for complex emotions. To address this, we propose \textbf{FreeAvatar}, a robust facial animation transfer method that relies solely on our learned expression representation. Specifically, FreeAvatar consists of two main components: the expression foundation model and the facial animation transfer model. In the first component, we initially construct a facial feature space through a face reconstruction task and then optimize the expression feature space by exploring the similarities among different expressions. Benefiting from training on the amounts of unlabeled facial images and re-collected expression comparison dataset, our model adapts freely and effectively to any in-the-wild input facial images. In the facial animation transfer component, we propose a novel Expression-driven Multi-avatar Animator, which first maps expressive semantics to the facial control parameters of 3D avatars and then imposes perceptual constraints between the input and output images to maintain expression consistency. To make the entire process differentiable, we employ a trained neural renderer to translate rig parameters into corresponding images. Furthermore, unlike previous methods that require separate decoders for each avatar, we propose a dynamic identity injection module that allows for the joint training of multiple avatars within a single network.</p></details> | 11 pages, 11 figures |

Abnormal patterns of neural signaling often indicate the presence of underlying brain diseases. The variability among individuals, the diverse array of clinical symptoms from various brain disorders, and the limited availability of diagnostic classifications, have posed significant barriers to formulating reliable model of neural signals for diverse application contexts. Here, we present BrainWave, the first foundation model for both invasive and non-invasive neural recordings, pretrained on more than 40,000 hours of electrical brain recordings (13.79 TB of data) from approximately 16,000 individuals. Our analysis show that BrainWave outperforms all other competing models and consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance in the diagnosis and identification of neurological disorders. We also demonstrate robust capabilities of BrainWave in enabling zero-shot transfer learning across varying recording conditions and brain diseases, as well as few-shot classification without fine-tuning, suggesting that BrainWave learns highly generalizable representations of neural signals. We hence believe that open-sourcing BrainWave will facilitate a wide range of clinical applications in medicine, paving the way for AI-driven approaches to investigate brain disorders and advance neuroscience research.</p></details> | 39 pages, 14 figures |

However, little is known about the concepts that these models learn and how can we manipulate them in the latent space. Our study bridges these gaps by identifying concepts learned by these models, localizing them to specific parts of the model, and steering model predictions along these conceptual directions, using synthetic time series data. Our results show that MOMENT, a state-of-the-art foundation model, can discern distinct time series patterns, and that this ability peaks in the middle layers of the network. Moreover, we show that model outputs can be steered using insights from its activations (e.g., by introducing periodic trends to initially constant signals through intervention during inference). Our findings underscore the importance of synthetic data in studying and steering time series foundation models and intervening throughout the whole model (using steering matrices), instead of a single layer.</p></details> |  |

However, variations in organs, tissue preparation methods, and image acquisition processes can lead to domain discrepancies among digital pathology images. To address this problem, in this paper, we use Rein, a fine-tuning method, to parametrically and efficiently fine-tune various vision foundation models (VFMs) for MICCAI 2024 Cross-Organ and Cross-Scanner Adenocarcinoma Segmentation (COSAS2024). The core of Rein consists of a set of learnable tokens, which are directly linked to instances, improving functionality at the instance level in each layer. In the data environment of the COSAS2024 Challenge, extensive experiments demonstrate that Rein fine-tuned the VFMs to achieve satisfactory results. Specifically, we used Rein to fine-tune ConvNeXt and DINOv2. Our team used the former to achieve scores of 0.7719 and 0.7557 on the preliminary test phase and final test phase in task1, respectively, while the latter achieved scores of 0.8848 and 0.8192 on the preliminary test phase and final test phase in task2.

| **[SoundBeam meets M2D: Target Sound Extraction with Audio Foundation Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12528v1)** | 2024-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Target sound extraction (TSE) consists of isolating a desired sound from a mixture of arbitrary sounds using clues to identify it. A TSE system requires solving two problems at once, identifying the target source and extracting the target signal from the mixture. For increased practicability, the same system should work with various types of sound. The duality of the problem and the wide variety of sounds make it challenging to train a powerful TSE system from scratch. In this paper, to tackle this problem, we explore using a pre-trained audio foundation model that can provide rich feature representations of sounds within a TSE system. We chose the masked-modeling duo (M2D) foundation model, which appears especially suited for the TSE task, as it is trained using a dual objective consisting of sound-label predictions and improved masked prediction. These objectives are related to sound identification and the signal extraction problems of TSE. We propose a new TSE system that integrates the feature representation from M2D into SoundBeam, which is a strong TSE system that can exploit both target sound class labels and pre-recorded enrollments (or audio queries) as clues. We show experimentally that using M2D can increase extraction performance, especially when employing enrollment clues.</p></details> |  |

However, due to the expensive acquisition cost, the number of hyperspectral images is limited, degenerating the performance of downstream tasks. Although some recent studies have attempted to employ diffusion models to synthesize HSIs, they still struggle with the scarcity of HSIs, affecting the reliability and diversity of the generated images. Some studies propose to incorporate multi-modal data to enhance spatial diversity, but the spectral fidelity cannot be ensured. In addition, existing HSI synthesis models are typically uncontrollable or only support single-condition control, limiting their ability to generate accurate and reliable HSIs. To alleviate these issues, we propose HSIGene, a novel HSI generation foundation model which is based on latent diffusion and supports multi-condition control, allowing for more precise and reliable HSI generation. To enhance the spatial diversity of the training data while preserving spectral fidelity, we propose a new data augmentation method based on spatial super-resolution, in which HSIs are upscaled first, and thus abundant training patches could be obtained by cropping the high-resolution HSIs. In addition, to improve the perceptual quality of the augmented data, we introduce a novel two-stage HSI super-resolution framework, which first applies RGB bands super-resolution and then utilizes our proposed Rectangular Guided Attention Network (RGAN) for guided HSI super-resolution. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed model is capable of generating a vast quantity of realistic HSIs for downstream tasks such as denoising and super-resolution. The code and models are available at https://github.com/LiPang/HSIGene.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose FoME (Foundation Model for EEG), a novel approach using adaptive temporal-lateral attention scaling to address above-mentioned challenges. FoME is pre-trained on a diverse 1.7TB dataset of scalp and intracranial EEG recordings, comprising 745M parameters trained for 1,096k steps. Our model introduces two key innovations: a time-frequency fusion embedding technique and an adaptive time-lateral attention scaling (ATLAS) mechanism. These components synergistically capture complex temporal and spectral EEG dynamics, enabling FoME to adapt to varying patterns across diverse data streams and facilitate robust multi-channel modeling. Evaluations across four downstream tasks demonstrate FoME's superior performance in classification and forecasting applications, consistently achieving state-of-the-art results. To conclude, FoME establishes a new paradigm for EEG analysis, offering a versatile foundation that advances brain-computer interfaces, clinical diagnostics, and cognitive research across neuroscience and related fields. Our code will be available at https://github.com/1061413241/FoME.</p></details> |  |

However, current models are constrained by closed-vocabulary tokenizers that fail to capture the full diversity of molecular structures. In this work, we systematically evaluate thirteen chemistry-specific tokenizers for their coverage of the SMILES language, uncovering substantial gaps. Using N-gram language models, we accessed the impact of tokenizer choice on model performance and quantified the information loss of unknown tokens. We introduce two new tokenizers, <i>smirk</i> and <i>smirk-gpe</i>, which can represent the entirety of the OpenSMILES specification while avoiding the pitfalls of existing tokenizers. Our work highlights the importance of open-vocabulary modeling for molecular foundation models and the need for chemically diverse benchmarks for cheminformatics.</p></details> | 26 pages, 6 figures |

Humans easily infer emotions from situations or facial expressions, situations from emotions, and do a variety of other affective cognition. How adept is modern AI at these inferences? We introduce an evaluation framework for testing affective cognition in foundation models. Starting from psychological theory, we generate 1,280 diverse scenarios exploring relationships between appraisals, emotions, expressions, and outcomes. We evaluate the abilities of foundation models (GPT-4, Claude-3, Gemini-1.5-Pro) and humans (N = 567) across carefully selected conditions. Our results show foundation models tend to agree with human intuitions, matching or exceeding interparticipant agreement. In some conditions, models are ``superhuman'' -- they better predict modal human judgements than the average human. All models benefit from chain-of-thought reasoning. This suggests foundation models have acquired a human-like understanding of emotions and their influence on beliefs and behavior.</p></details> |  |

Existing FMs have struggled to establish sequence-structure alignment, hindering the free flow of genomic information between RNA sequences and structures. In this study, we introduce OmniGenome, an RNA FM trained to align RNA sequences with respect to secondary structures based on structure-contextualised modelling. The alignment enables free and bidirectional mappings between sequences and structures by utilising the flexible RNA modelling paradigm that supports versatile input and output modalities, i.e., sequence and/or structure as input/output. We implement RNA design and zero-shot secondary structure prediction as case studies to evaluate the Seq2Str and Str2Seq mapping capacity of OmniGenome. Results on the EternaV2 benchmark show that OmniGenome solved 74% of puzzles, whereas existing FMs only solved up to 3% of the puzzles due to the oversight of sequence-structure alignment. We leverage four comprehensive in-silico genome modelling benchmarks to evaluate performance across a diverse set of genome downstream tasks, where the results show that OmniGenome achieves state-of-the-art performance on RNA and DNA benchmarks, even without any training on DNA genomes.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted to NeurIPS 2024, 19 pages</p></details> |

One approach involves training LLM architectures on tokenized time series data using cross-entropy loss. Although this method has demonstrated promising results, cross-entropy loss is primarily designed for classification tasks and does not account for the distance between classes. To address this limitation, we propose using the Wasserstein loss for such architectures. To validate our approach, we fine-tuned a foundational time series model on $22$ zero-shot datasets, comparing the performance of cross-entropy loss with that of Wasserstein loss. Our results demonstrate that replacing cross-entropy loss with Wasserstein loss significantly improves point estimation.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 mai...</summary><p>4 main pages; 2 figures</p></details> |

Here we introduce the all-in-one (AIO) ANI model architecture based on multimodal learning which can learn an arbitrary number of QC levels. Our all-in-one learning approach offers a more general and easier-to-use alternative to transfer learning. We use it to train the AIO-ANI-UIP foundational model with the generalization capability comparable to semi-empirical GFN2-xTB and DFT with a double-zeta basis set for organic molecules. We show that the AIO-ANI model can learn across different QC levels ranging from semi-empirical to density functional theory to coupled cluster. We also use AIO models to design the foundational model {\Delta}-AIO-ANI based on {\Delta}-learning with increased accuracy and robustness compared to AIO-ANI-UIP. The code and the foundational models are available at https://github.com/dralgroup/aio-ani; they will be integrated into the universal and updatable AI-enhanced QM (UAIQM) library and made available in the MLatom package so that they can be used online at the XACS cloud computing platform (see https://github.com/dralgroup/mlatom for updates).</p></details> |  |

None of these approaches integrate all modalities simultaneously. To address this gap, we introduce a novel food computing foundation model that achieves true multimodality, encompassing tasks such as t2t, t2i, i2t, it2t, and t2ti. By leveraging large language models (LLMs) and pre-trained image encoder and decoder models, our model can perform a diverse array of food computing-related tasks, including food understanding, food recognition, recipe generation, and food image generation. Compared to previous models, our foundation model demonstrates a significantly broader range of capabilities and exhibits superior performance, particularly in food image generation and recipe generation tasks.

For this reason, they are susceptible to the memorization and subsequent reproduction of training samples. In this paper, we introduce a training-as-compressing perspective, wherein the model's weights embody a compressed representation of the training data. From a copyright standpoint, this point of view implies that the weights could be considered a reproduction or a derivative work of a potentially protected set of works. We investigate the technical and legal challenges that emerge from this framing of the copyright of outputs generated by foundation models, including their implications for practitioners and researchers.

However, current approaches to solve these tasks use independently trained models, which may not benefit from large amounts of unlabeled data. In this paper, we propose M-BEST-RQ, the first multi-channel speech foundation model for smart glasses, which is designed to leverage large-scale self-supervised learning (SSL) in an array-geometry agnostic approach. While prior work on multi-channel speech SSL only evaluated on simulated settings, we curate a suite of real downstream tasks to evaluate our model, namely (i) conversational automatic speech recognition (ASR), (ii) spherical active source localization, and (iii) glasses wearer voice activity detection, which are sourced from the MMCSG and EasyCom datasets. We show that a general-purpose M-BEST-RQ encoder is able to match or surpass supervised models across all tasks. For the conversational ASR task in particular, using only 8 hours of labeled speech, our model outperforms a supervised ASR baseline that is trained on 2000 hours of labeled data, which demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>In su...</summary><p>In submission to IEEE ICASSP 2025</p></details> |

However, their application to sensitive, domain-specific fields like healthcare remains challenging, primarily due to the difficulty of fine-tuning these models for specialized, out-of-domain tasks with scarce publicly available datasets. In this work, we explore the use of Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques to address these limitations, focusing on healthcare applications, particularly ICU vitals forecasting for sepsis patients. We introduce and evaluate two selective (BitFit and LayerNorm Tuning) and two additive (VeRA and FourierFT) PEFT techniques on multiple configurations of the Chronos TSFM for forecasting vital signs of sepsis patients. Our comparative analysis demonstrates that some of these PEFT methods outperform LoRA in terms of parameter efficiency and domain adaptation, establishing state-of-the-art (SOTA) results in ICU vital forecasting tasks. Interestingly, FourierFT applied to the Chronos (Tiny) variant surpasses the SOTA model while fine-tuning only 2,400 parameters compared to the 700K parameters of the benchmark.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages.

These models use a masked prediction objective, where the model learns to predict information about masked input segments from the unmasked context. The choice of prediction targets in this framework can influence performance on downstream tasks. For example, targets that encode prosody are beneficial for speaker-related tasks, while targets that encode phonetics are more suited for content-related tasks. Additionally, prediction targets can vary in the level of detail they encode; targets that encode fine-grained acoustic details are beneficial for denoising tasks, while targets that encode higher-level abstractions are more suited for content-related tasks. Despite the importance of prediction targets, the design choices that affect them have not been thoroughly studied. This work explores the design choices and their impact on downstream task performance. Our results indicate that the commonly used design choices for HuBERT can be suboptimal. We propose novel approaches to create more informative prediction targets and demonstrate their effectiveness through improvements across various downstream tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ICASSP 2025</p></details> |

Without an external intervention, often in terms of a high-level command, a low-level control policy cannot resolve such deadlocks. Utilizing the generalizability and low data requirements of foundation models, this paper explores the possibility of using text-based models, i.e., large language models (LLMs), and text-and-image-based models, i.e., vision-language models (VLMs), as high-level planners for deadlock resolution. We propose a hierarchical control framework where a foundation model-based high-level planner helps to resolve deadlocks by assigning a leader to the MRS along with a set of waypoints for the MRS leader. Then, a low-level distributed control policy based on graph neural networks is executed to safely follow these waypoints, thereby evading the deadlock. We conduct extensive experiments on various MRS environments using the best available pre-trained LLMs and VLMs. We compare their performance with a graph-based planner in terms of effectiveness in helping the MRS reach their target locations and computational time. Our results illustrate that, compared to grid-based planners, the foundation models perform better in terms of the goal-reaching rate and computational time for complex environments, which helps us conclude that foundation models can assist MRS operating in complex obstacle-cluttered environments to resolve deadlocks efficiently.</p></details> |  |

We hypothesize that LoRA, a parameter-efficient technique, can significantly accelerate the adaptation of large-scale EO models to this critical task while maintaining high performance. We apply LoRA to fine-tune a state-of-the-art EO foundation model pre-trained on diverse satellite imagery, using a curated dataset of flood events. Our results demonstrate that LoRA-based fine-tuning (r-256) improves F1 score by 6.66 points and IoU by 0.11 compared to a frozen encoder baseline, while significantly reducing computational costs. Notably, LoRA outperforms full fine-tuning, which proves computationally infeasible on our hardware. We further assess generalization through out-of-distribution (OOD) testing on a geographically distinct flood event. While LoRA configurations show improved OOD performance over the baseline. This work contributes to research on efficient adaptation of foundation models for specialized EO tasks, with implications for rapid response systems in disaster management. Our findings demonstrate LoRA's potential for enabling faster deployment of accurate flood segmentation models in resource-constrained, time-critical scenarios.</p></details> | 9 pages 2 figures |
| **[Estimating Wage Disparities Using Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09894v1)** | 2024-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One thread of empirical work in social science focuses on decomposing group differences in outcomes into unexplained components and components explained by observable factors. In this paper, we study gender wage decompositions, which require estimating the portion of the gender wage gap explained by career histories of workers. Classical methods for decomposing the wage gap employ simple predictive models of wages which condition on a small set of simple summaries of labor history. The problem is that these predictive models cannot take advantage of the full complexity of a worker's history, and the resulting decompositions thus suffer from omitted variable bias (OVB), where covariates that are correlated with both gender and wages are not included in the model. Here we explore an alternative methodology for wage gap decomposition that employs powerful foundation models, such as large language models, as the predictive engine. Foundation models excel at making accurate predictions from complex, high-dimensional inputs. We use a custom-built foundation model, designed to predict wages from full labor histories, to decompose the gender wage gap. We prove that the way such models are usually trained might still lead to OVB, but develop fine-tuning algorithms that empirically mitigate this issue. Our model captures a richer representation of career history than simple models and predicts wages more accurately. In detail, we first provide a novel set of conditions under which an estimator of the wage gap based on a fine-tuned foundation model is $\sqrt{n}$-consistent. Building on the theory, we then propose methods for fine-tuning foundation models that minimize OVB. Using data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, we find that history explains more of the gender wage gap than standard econometric models can measure, and we identify elements of history that are important for reducing OVB.</p></details> |  |

We introduce fusion schemes for feature vectors to enhance their contextual knowledge and performance on complex queries. Additionally, we explore large language models for robust automatic annotation and spatial reasoning tasks.

This shift involves moving away from specialized predictive models trained for specific, well-defined domain questions to generalist FMs pre-trained on vast amounts of unstructured data, which can then be adapted to various clinical tasks and questions. As a result, the standard data science workflow in medicine has been fundamentally altered; the foundation model lifecycle (FMLC) now includes distinct upstream and downstream processes, in which computational resources, model and data access, and decision-making power are distributed among multiple stakeholders. At their core, FMs are fundamentally statistical models, and this new workflow challenges the principles of Veridical Data Science (VDS), hindering the rigorous statistical analysis expected in transparent and scientifically reproducible data science practices. We critically examine the medical FMLC in light of the core principles of VDS: predictability, computability, and stability (PCS), and explain how it deviates from the standard data science workflow. Finally, we propose recommendations for a reimagined medical FMLC that expands and refines the PCS principles for VDS including considering the computational and accessibility constraints inherent to FMs.</p></details> |  |

This work presents a new transformer-based multi-operator learning approach that fuses symbolic information to perform operator-based data prediction, i.e. non-autoregressive. By incorporating multiple modalities in the inputs, the PDE foundation model builds in a pathway for including mathematical descriptions of the physical behavior. We pre-train our foundation model on 6 parametric families of equations collected from 13 datasets, including over 60K trajectories. Our model outperforms popular operator learning, computer vision, and multi-physics models, in benchmark forward prediction tasks.

The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) has introduced new ways to analyze music, aiming to replicate human understanding of music and provide related services. While the traditional models focused on audio features and simple tasks, the recent development of large language models (LLMs) and foundation models (FMs), which excel in various fields by integrating semantic information and demonstrating strong reasoning abilities, could capture complex musical features and patterns, integrate music with language and incorporate rich musical, emotional and psychological knowledge. Therefore, they have the potential in handling complex music understanding tasks from a semantic perspective, producing outputs closer to human perception. This work, to our best knowledge, is one of the early reviews of the intersection of AI techniques and music understanding. We investigated, analyzed, and tested recent large-scale music foundation models in respect of their music comprehension abilities. We also discussed their limitations and proposed possible future directions, offering insights for researchers in this field.</p></details> | 20 pages, 2 figures |
| **[COMFORT: A Continual Fine-Tuning Framework for Foundation Models Targeted at Consumer Healthcare](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09549v1)** | 2024-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Wearable medical sensors (WMSs) are revolutionizing smart healthcare by enabling continuous, real-time monitoring of user physiological signals, especially in the field of consumer healthcare. The integration of WMSs and modern machine learning (ML) enables unprecedented solutions to efficient early-stage disease detection. Despite the success of Transformers in various fields, their application to sensitive domains, such as smart healthcare, remains underexplored due to limited data accessibility and privacy concerns. To bridge the gap between Transformer-based foundation models and WMS-based disease detection, we propose COMFORT, a continual fine-tuning framework for foundation models targeted at consumer healthcare. COMFORT introduces a novel approach for pre-training a Transformer-based foundation model on a large dataset of physiological signals exclusively collected from healthy individuals with commercially available WMSs. We adopt a masked data modeling (MDM) objective to pre-train this health foundation model. We then fine-tune the model using various parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods, such as low-rank adaptation (LoRA) and its variants, to adapt it to various downstream disease detection tasks that rely on WMS data. In addition, COMFORT continually stores the low-rank decomposition matrices obtained from the PEFT algorithms to construct a library for multi-disease detection. The COMFORT library enables scalable and memory-efficient disease detection on edge devices. Our experimental results demonstrate that COMFORT achieves highly competitive performance while reducing memory overhead by up to 52% relative to conventional methods. Thus, COMFORT paves the way for personalized and proactive solutions to efficient and effective early-stage disease detection for consumer healthcare.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 10 figures.

However, it remains an open question on how to design an infrared foundation model. In this paper, we propose InfMAE, a foundation model in infrared modality. We release an infrared dataset, called Inf30 to address the problem of lacking large-scale data for self-supervised learning in the infrared vision community. Besides, we design an information-aware masking strategy, which is suitable for infrared images. This masking strategy allows for a greater emphasis on the regions with richer information in infrared images during the self-supervised learning process, which is conducive to learning the generalized representation. In addition, we adopt a multi-scale encoder to enhance the performance of the pre-trained encoders in downstream tasks. Finally, based on the fact that infrared images do not have a lot of details and texture information, we design an infrared decoder module, which further improves the performance of downstream tasks. Extensive experiments show that our proposed method InfMAE outperforms other supervised methods and self-supervised learning methods in three downstream tasks.</p></details> | 8 pages, 2 figures |
| **[On the Generalizability of Foundation Models for Crop Type Mapping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09451v1)** | 2024-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models pre-trained using self-supervised and weakly-supervised learning have shown powerful transfer learning capabilities on various downstream tasks, including language understanding, text generation, and image recognition. Recently, the Earth observation (EO) field has produced several foundation models pre-trained directly on multispectral satellite imagery (e.g., Sentinel-2) for applications like precision agriculture, wildfire and drought monitoring, and natural disaster response. However, few studies have investigated the ability of these models to generalize to new geographic locations, and potential concerns of geospatial bias -- models trained on data-rich developed countries not transferring well to data-scarce developing countries -- remain. We investigate the ability of popular EO foundation models to transfer to new geographic regions in the agricultural domain, where differences in farming practices and class imbalance make transfer learning particularly challenging. We first select six crop classification datasets across five continents, normalizing for dataset size and harmonizing classes to focus on four major cereal grains: maize, soybean, rice, and wheat. We then compare three popular foundation models, pre-trained on SSL4EO-S12, SatlasPretrain, and ImageNet, using in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) evaluation. Experiments show that pre-trained weights designed explicitly for Sentinel-2, such as SSL4EO-S12, outperform general pre-trained weights like ImageNet. Furthermore, the benefits of pre-training on OOD data are the most significant when only 10--100 ID training samples are used. Transfer learning and pre-training with OOD and limited ID data show promising applications, as many developing regions have scarce crop type labels. All harmonized datasets and experimental code are open-source and available for download.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evaluating Pre-trained Convolutional Neural Networks and Foundation Models as Feature Extractors for Content-based Medical Image Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09430v1)** | 2024-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical image retrieval refers to the task of finding similar images for given query images in a database, with applications such as diagnosis support, treatment planning, and educational tools for inexperienced medical practitioners. While traditional medical image retrieval was performed using clinical metadata, content-based medical image retrieval (CBMIR) relies on the characteristic features of the images, such as color, texture, shape, and spatial features. Many approaches have been proposed for CBMIR, and among them, using pre-trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) is a widely utilized approach. However, considering the recent advances in the development of foundation models for various computer vision tasks, their application for CBMIR can be also investigated for its potentially superior performance. In this study, we used several pre-trained feature extractors from well-known pre-trained CNNs (VGG19, ResNet-50, DenseNet121, and EfficientNetV2M) and pre-trained foundation models (MedCLIP, BioMedCLIP, OpenCLIP, CONCH and UNI) and investigated the CBMIR performance on a subset of the MedMNIST V2 dataset, including eight types of 2D and 3D medical images. Furthermore, we also investigated the effect of image size on the CBMIR performance. Our results show that, overall, for the 2D datasets, foundation models deliver superior performance by a large margin compared to CNNs, with UNI providing the best overall performance across all datasets and image sizes. For 3D datasets, CNNs and foundation models deliver more competitive performance, with CONCH achieving the best overall performance. Moreover, our findings confirm that while using larger image sizes (especially for 2D datasets) yields slightly better performance, competitive CBMIR performance can still be achieved even with smaller image sizes. Our codes to generate and reproduce the results are available on GitHub.</p></details> | 29 pages |
| **[Prevailing Research Areas for Music AI in the Era of Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09378v1)** | 2024-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In tandem with the recent advancements in foundation model research, there has been a surge of generative music AI applications within the past few years. As the idea of AI-generated or AI-augmented music becomes more mainstream, many researchers in the music AI community may be wondering what avenues of research are left. With regards to music generative models, we outline the current areas of research with significant room for exploration. Firstly, we pose the question of foundational representation of these generative models and investigate approaches towards explainability. Next, we discuss the current state of music datasets and their limitations. We then overview different generative models, forms of evaluating these models, and their computational constraints/limitations. Subsequently, we highlight applications of these generative models towards extensions to multiple modalities and integration with artists' workflow as well as music education systems. Finally, we survey the potential copyright implications of generative music and discuss strategies for protecting the rights of musicians. While it is not meant to be exhaustive, our survey calls to attention a variety of research directions enabled by music foundation models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evaluating General Purpose Vision Foundation Models for Medical Image Analysis: An Experimental Study of DINOv2 on Radiology Benchmarks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02366v4)** | 2024-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of deep learning systems into healthcare has been hindered by the resource-intensive process of data annotation and the inability of these systems to generalize to different data distributions. Foundation models, which are models pre-trained on large datasets, have emerged as a solution to reduce reliance on annotated data and enhance model generalizability and robustness. DINOv2 is an open-source foundation model pre-trained with self-supervised learning on 142 million curated natural images that exhibits promising capabilities across various vision tasks. Nevertheless, a critical question remains unanswered regarding DINOv2's adaptability to radiological imaging, and whether its features are sufficiently general to benefit radiology image analysis. Therefore, this study comprehensively evaluates the performance DINOv2 for radiology, conducting over 200 evaluations across diverse modalities (X-ray, CT, and MRI). To measure the effectiveness and generalizability of DINOv2's feature representations, we analyze the model across medical image analysis tasks including disease classification and organ segmentation on both 2D and 3D images, and under different settings like kNN, few-shot learning, linear-probing, end-to-end fine-tuning, and parameter-efficient fine-tuning. Comparative analyses with established supervised, self-supervised, and weakly-supervised models reveal DINOv2's superior performance and cross-task generalizability. The findings contribute insights to potential avenues for optimizing pre-training strategies for medical imaging and enhancing the broader understanding of DINOv2's role in bridging the gap between natural and radiological image analysis.

| **[Leveraging Foundation Models for Efficient Federated Learning in Resource-restricted Edge Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09273v1)** | 2024-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently pre-trained Foundation Models (FMs) have been combined with Federated Learning (FL) to improve training of downstream tasks while preserving privacy. However, deploying FMs over edge networks with resource-constrained Internet of Things (IoT) devices is under-explored. This paper proposes a novel framework, namely, Federated Distilling knowledge to Prompt (FedD2P), for leveraging the robust representation abilities of a vision-language FM without deploying it locally on edge devices. This framework distills the aggregated knowledge of IoT devices to a prompt generator to efficiently adapt the frozen FM for downstream tasks. To eliminate the dependency on a public dataset, our framework leverages perclass local knowledge from IoT devices and linguistic descriptions of classes to train the prompt generator. Our experiments on diverse image classification datasets CIFAR, OxfordPets, SVHN, EuroSAT, and DTD show that FedD2P outperforms the baselines in terms of model performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[A foundation model enpowered by a multi-modal prompt engine for universal seismic geobody interpretation across surveys](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04962v2)** | 2024-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Seismic geobody interpretation is crucial for structural geology studies and various engineering applications. Existing deep learning methods show promise but lack support for multi-modal inputs and struggle to generalize to different geobody types or surveys. We introduce a promptable foundation model for interpreting any geobodies across seismic surveys. This model integrates a pre-trained vision foundation model (VFM) with a sophisticated multi-modal prompt engine. The VFM, pre-trained on massive natural images and fine-tuned on seismic data, provides robust feature extraction for cross-survey generalization. The prompt engine incorporates multi-modal prior information to iteratively refine geobody delineation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the model's superior accuracy, scalability from 2D to 3D, and generalizability to various geobody types, including those unseen during training. To our knowledge, this is the first highly scalable and versatile multi-modal foundation model capable of interpreting any geobodies across surveys while supporting real-time interactions. Our approach establishes a new paradigm for geoscientific data interpretation, with broad potential for transfer to other tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Eureka: Evaluating and Understanding Large Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10566v1)** | 2024-09-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rigorous and reproducible evaluation is critical for assessing the state of the art and for guiding scientific advances in Artificial Intelligence. Evaluation is challenging in practice due to several reasons, including benchmark saturation, lack of transparency in methods used for measurement, development challenges in extracting measurements for generative tasks, and, more generally, the extensive number of capabilities required for a well-rounded comparison across models. We make three contributions to alleviate the above challenges. First, we present Eureka, an open-source framework for standardizing evaluations of large foundation models beyond single-score reporting and rankings. Second, we introduce Eureka-Bench as an extensible collection of benchmarks testing capabilities that (i) are still challenging for state-of-the-art models and (ii) represent fundamental but overlooked language and multimodal capabilities. The inherent space for improvement in non-saturated benchmarks enables us to discover meaningful differences between models at a capability level. Third, using Eureka, we conduct an analysis of 12 state-of-the-art models, providing in-depth insights into failure understanding and model comparison, which can be leveraged to plan targeted improvements. In contrast to recent trends in reports and leaderboards showing absolute rankings and claims for one model or another to be the best, our analysis shows that there is no such best model. Different models have different strengths, but there are models that appear more often than others as best performers for some capabilities. Despite the recent improvements, current models still struggle with several fundamental capabilities including detailed image understanding, benefiting from multimodal input when available rather than fully relying on language, factuality and grounding for information retrieval, and over refusals.</p></details> |  |

We even observe an incursion of these models into disciplines related to human psychology, such as the Affective Computing domain, suggesting their affective, emerging capabilities. In this work, we aim to raise awareness of the power of Foundation Models in the field of Affective Computing by synthetically generating and analysing multimodal affective data, focusing on vision, linguistics, and speech (acoustics). We also discuss some fundamental problems, such as ethical issues and regulatory aspects, related to the use of Foundation Models in this research area.</p></details> |  |
| **[Uncertainty and Generalizability in Foundation Models for Earth Observation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08744v1)** | 2024-09-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We take the perspective in which we want to design a downstream task (such as estimating vegetation coverage) on a certain area of interest (AOI) with a limited labeling budget. By leveraging an existing Foundation Model (FM) we must decide whether we train a downstream model on a different but label-rich AOI hoping it generalizes to our AOI, or we split labels in our AOI for training and validating. In either case, we face choices concerning what FM to use, how to sample our AOI for labeling, etc. which affect both the performance and uncertainty of the results. In this work, we perform a large ablative study using eight existing FMs on either Sentinel 1 or Sentinel 2 as input data, and the classes from the ESA World Cover product as downstream tasks across eleven AOIs. We do repeated sampling and training, resulting in an ablation of some 500K simple linear regression models. Our results show both the limits of spatial generalizability across AOIs and the power of FMs where we are able to get over 0.9 correlation coefficient between predictions and targets on different chip level predictive tasks. And still, performance and uncertainty vary greatly across AOIs, tasks and FMs. We believe this is a key issue in practice, because there are many design decisions behind each FM and downstream task (input modalities, sampling, architectures, pretraining, etc.) and usually a downstream task designer is aware of and can decide upon a few of them. Through this work, we advocate for the usage of the methodology herein described (large ablations on reference global labels and simple probes), both when publishing new FMs, and to make informed decisions when designing downstream tasks to use them.</p></details> | <details><summary>A lar...</summary><p>A large ablation study measuring uncertainty and spatial generalizability with 8 foundation models, 11 world regions and 7 downstream tasks</p></details> |

However, these claims have not been thoroughly analyzed yet. Recently, foundation models have demonstrated unparalleled capabilities across diverse domains from language to computer vision, marking them as a potential cornerstone of future research for a multitude of computational tasks. In this paper, we conduct an extensive empirical study on representation learning for downstream Visual Question Answering (VQA), which requires an accurate compositional understanding of the scene. We thoroughly investigate the benefits and trade-offs of OC models and alternative approaches including large pre-trained foundation models on both synthetic and real-world data, and demonstrate a viable way to achieve the best of both worlds. The extensiveness of our study, encompassing over 800 downstream VQA models and 15 different types of upstream representations, also provides several additional insights that we believe will be of interest to the community at large.</p></details> |  |
| **[Annotation Free Semantic Segmentation with Vision Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09307v3)** | 2024-09-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semantic Segmentation is one of the most challenging vision tasks, usually requiring large amounts of training data with expensive pixel level annotations. With the success of foundation models and especially vision-language models, recent works attempt to achieve zeroshot semantic segmentation while requiring either large-scale training or additional image/pixel level annotations. In this work, we generate free annotations for any semantic segmentation dataset using existing foundation models. We use CLIP to detect objects and SAM to generate high quality object masks. Next, we build a lightweight module on top of a self-supervised vision encoder, DinoV2, to align the patch features with a pretrained text encoder for zeroshot semantic segmentation. Our approach can bring language-based semantics to any pretrained vision encoder with minimal training, uses foundation models as the sole source of supervision and generalizes from little training data with no annotation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Semi-supervised 3D Semantic Scene Completion with 2D Vision Foundation Model Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11559v2)** | 2024-09-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate prediction of 3D semantic occupancy from 2D visual images is vital in enabling autonomous agents to comprehend their surroundings for planning and navigation. State-of-the-art methods typically employ fully supervised approaches, necessitating a huge labeled dataset acquired through expensive LiDAR sensors and meticulous voxel-wise labeling by human annotators. The resource-intensive nature of this annotating process significantly hampers the application and scalability of these methods. We introduce a novel semi-supervised framework to alleviate the dependency on densely annotated data. Our approach leverages 2D foundation models to generate essential 3D scene geometric and semantic cues, facilitating a more efficient training process. Our framework exhibits notable properties: (1) Generalizability, applicable to various 3D semantic scene completion approaches, including 2D-3D lifting and 3D-2D transformer methods. (2) Effectiveness, as demonstrated through experiments on SemanticKITTI and NYUv2, wherein our method achieves up to 85% of the fully-supervised performance using only 10% labeled data. This approach not only reduces the cost and labor associated with data annotation but also demonstrates the potential for broader adoption in camera-based systems for 3D semantic occupancy prediction.</p></details> |  |

We report macro average of F1 score for top-1 retrieval, majority of top-3 retrievals, and majority of top-5 retrievals. We perform zero-shot retrievals, i.e., we do not alter embeddings and we do not train any classifier. As test data, we used diagnostic slides of TCGA, The Cancer Genome Atlas, consisting of 23 organs and 117 cancer subtypes. As a search platform we used Yottixel that enabled us to perform WSI search using patches. Achieved F1 scores show low performance, e.g., for top-5 retrievals, 27% +/- 13% (Yottixel-DenseNet), 42% +/- 14% (Yottixel-UNI), 40%+/-13% (Yottixel-Virchow), 41%+/-13% (Yottixel-GigaPath), and 41%+/-14% (GigaPath WSI).</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper will be updated with more results</p></details> |

A potential application of such models is in computer network traffic analysis, where these models can grasp the complexities of network traffic dynamics and adapt to any specific task or network environment with minimal fine-tuning. Previous approaches have used tokenized hex-level packet data and the model architecture of large language transformer models. We propose a new, efficient graph-based alternative at the flow-level. Our approach represents network traffic as a dynamic spatio-temporal graph, employing a self-supervised link prediction pretraining task to capture the spatial and temporal dynamics in this network graph framework. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct a few-shot learning experiment for three distinct downstream network tasks: intrusion detection, traffic classification, and botnet classification. Models finetuned from our pretrained base achieve an average performance increase of 6.87\% over training from scratch, demonstrating their ability to effectively learn general network traffic dynamics during pretraining. This success suggests the potential for a large-scale version to serve as an operational foundational model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Pre-p...</summary><p>Pre-print of Accepted Workshop paper to 3rd GNNet, co-located with CoNEXT'24</p></details> |

However, it is extremely challenging for sensors in many different fields to collect similar scales of natural images to train strong foundation models. To this end, this work presents a simple and effective framework SimMAT to study an open problem: the transferability from vision foundation models trained on natural RGB images to other image modalities of different physical properties (e.g., polarization). SimMAT consists of a modality-agnostic transfer layer (MAT) and a pretrained foundation model. We apply SimMAT to a representative vision foundation model Segment Anything Model (SAM) to support any evaluated new image modality. Given the absence of relevant benchmarks, we construct a new benchmark to evaluate the transfer learning performance. Our experiments confirm the intriguing potential of transferring vision foundation models in enhancing other sensors' performance. Specifically, SimMAT can improve the segmentation performance (mIoU) from 22.15% to 53.88% on average for evaluated modalities and consistently outperforms other baselines. We hope that SimMAT can raise awareness of cross-modal transfer learning and benefit various fields for better results with vision foundation models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Githu...</summary><p>Github link: https://github.com/mt-cly/SimMAT</p></details> |

However, their performance drops significantly under domain (covariate) shift, a prevalent issue in medical image segmentation due to varying acquisition settings across different scanner models and protocols. Recently, foundational models (FMs) trained on large datasets have gained attention for their ability to be adapted for downstream tasks and achieve state-of-the-art performance with excellent generalization capabilities on natural images. However, their effectiveness in medical image segmentation remains underexplored. In this paper, we investigate the domain generalization performance of various FMs, including DinoV2, SAM, MedSAM, and MAE, when fine-tuned using various parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques such as Ladder and Rein (+LoRA) and decoder heads. We introduce a novel decode head architecture, HQHSAM, which simply integrates elements from two state-of-the-art decoder heads, HSAM and HQSAM, to enhance segmentation performance. Our extensive experiments on multiple datasets, encompassing various anatomies and modalities, reveal that FMs, particularly with the HQHSAM decode head, improve domain generalization for medical image segmentation. Moreover, we found that the effectiveness of PEFT techniques varies across different FMs. These findings underscore the potential of FMs to enhance the domain generalization performance of neural networks in medical image segmentation across diverse clinical settings, providing a solid foundation for future research.

| **[Foundation Models Boost Low-Level Perceptual Similarity Metrics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07650v1)** | 2024-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For full-reference image quality assessment (FR-IQA) using deep-learning approaches, the perceptual similarity score between a distorted image and a reference image is typically computed as a distance measure between features extracted from a pretrained CNN or more recently, a Transformer network. Often, these intermediate features require further fine-tuning or processing with additional neural network layers to align the final similarity scores with human judgments. So far, most IQA models based on foundation models have primarily relied on the final layer or the embedding for the quality score estimation. In contrast, this work explores the potential of utilizing the intermediate features of these foundation models, which have largely been unexplored so far in the design of low-level perceptual similarity metrics. We demonstrate that the intermediate features are comparatively more effective. Moreover, without requiring any training, these metrics can outperform both traditional and state-of-the-art learned metrics by utilizing distance measures between the features.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/abhijay9/ZS-IQA</p></details> |

It examines the characteristics of FMs, including their training on vast datasets and use of embedding spaces to capture semantic relationships. The paper discusses recent advancements in FMs' reasoning abilities which we argue cannot be attributed to increased model size but to novel training techniques which yield learning phenomena like grokking. It also addresses the challenges in benchmarking FMs and compares their structure to the human brain. We argue that while FMs show promising developments in reasoning and knowledge representation, understanding their inner workings remains a significant challenge, similar to ongoing efforts in neuroscience to comprehend human brain function. Despite having some similarities, fundamental differences between FMs and the structure of human brain warn us against making direct comparisons or expecting neuroscience to provide immediate insights into FM function.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 4 Figures, to appear in Proceedings of the 2nd International Conference on Foundation and Large Language Models (FLLM2024) 26-29 November, 2024, Dubai, UAE</p></details> |

While artificial intelligence (AI) foundation models hold significant promise for addressing these challenges, existing ophthalmic foundation models primarily focus on a single modality, whereas diagnosing eye diseases requires multiple modalities. A critical yet often overlooked aspect is harnessing the multi-view information across various modalities for the same patient. Additionally, due to the long-tail nature of ophthalmic diseases, standard fully supervised or unsupervised learning approaches often struggle. Therefore, it is essential to integrate clinical text to capture a broader spectrum of diseases. We propose EyeCLIP, a visual-language foundation model developed using over 2.77 million multi-modal ophthalmology images with partial text data. To fully leverage the large multi-modal unlabeled and labeled data, we introduced a pretraining strategy that combines self-supervised reconstructions, multi-modal image contrastive learning, and image-text contrastive learning to learn a shared representation of multiple modalities. Through evaluation using 14 benchmark datasets, EyeCLIP can be transferred to a wide range of downstream tasks involving ocular and systemic diseases, achieving state-of-the-art performance in disease classification, visual question answering, and cross-modal retrieval. EyeCLIP represents a significant advancement over previous methods, especially showcasing few-shot, even zero-shot capabilities in real-world long-tail scenarios.</p></details> |  |

We collected data from 18 researchers with an interface that we designed using network simplification methods and analyzed how users browsed and identified important papers. Our analysis reveals six major patterns used for identifying papers of interest, which can be categorized into three key components: Fields, Bridges, and Foundations, each viewed from two distinct perspectives: layout-oriented and connection-oriented. The connection-oriented approach was found to be more reliable for selecting relevant papers, but the layout-oriented method was adopted more often, even though it led to unexpected results and user frustration. Our findings emphasize the importance of integrating these components and the necessity to balance visual layouts with meaningful connections to enhance the effectiveness of citation networks in academic browsing systems.</p></details> |  |

However, the performance of these methods is often constrained by models pre-trained on classification tasks. The exploration of what types of pre-trained models can provide more beneficial implicit knowledge for FSS remains limited. In this paper, inspired by the representation consistency of foundational computer vision models, we develop a FSS framework based on foundation models. To be specific, we propose a simple approach to extract implicit knowledge from foundation models to construct coarse correspondence and introduce a lightweight decoder to refine coarse correspondence for fine-grained segmentation. We systematically summarize the performance of various foundation models on FSS and discover that the implicit knowledge within some of these models is more beneficial for FSS than models pre-trained on classification tasks. Extensive experiments on two widely used datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in leveraging the implicit knowledge of foundation models. Notably, the combination of DINOv2 and DFN exceeds previous state-of-the-art methods by 17.5% on COCO-20i.

| **[ProteinBench: A Holistic Evaluation of Protein Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06744v1)** | 2024-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent years have witnessed a surge in the development of protein foundation models, significantly improving performance in protein prediction and generative tasks ranging from 3D structure prediction and protein design to conformational dynamics. However, the capabilities and limitations associated with these models remain poorly understood due to the absence of a unified evaluation framework. To fill this gap, we introduce ProteinBench, a holistic evaluation framework designed to enhance the transparency of protein foundation models. Our approach consists of three key components: (i) A taxonomic classification of tasks that broadly encompass the main challenges in the protein domain, based on the relationships between different protein modalities; (ii) A multi-metric evaluation approach that assesses performance across four key dimensions: quality, novelty, diversity, and robustness; and (iii) In-depth analyses from various user objectives, providing a holistic view of model performance. Our comprehensive evaluation of protein foundation models reveals several key findings that shed light on their current capabilities and limitations. To promote transparency and facilitate further research, we release the evaluation dataset, code, and a public leaderboard publicly for further analysis and a general modular toolkit. We intend for ProteinBench to be a living benchmark for establishing a standardized, in-depth evaluation framework for protein foundation models, driving their development and application while fostering collaboration within the field.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 1 figure and 11 tables</p></details> |

Geoscience foundation models (GFMs) emerge as a paradigm-shifting solution, integrating extensive cross-disciplinary data to enhance the simulation and understanding of Earth system dynamics. These data-centric AI models extract insights from petabytes of structured and unstructured data, effectively addressing the complexities of Earth systems that traditional models struggle to capture. The unique strengths of GFMs include flexible task specification, diverse input-output capabilities, and multi-modal knowledge representation, enabling analyses that surpass those of individual data sources or traditional AI methods. This review not only highlights the key advantages of GFMs, but also presents essential techniques for their construction, with a focus on transformers, pre-training, and adaptation strategies. Subsequently, we examine recent advancements in GFMs, including large language models, vision models, and vision-language models, particularly emphasizing the potential applications in remote sensing. Additionally, the review concludes with a comprehensive analysis of the challenges and future trends in GFMs, addressing five critical aspects: data integration, model complexity, uncertainty quantification, interdisciplinary collaboration, and concerns related to privacy, trust, and security. This review offers a comprehensive overview of emerging geoscientific research paradigms, emphasizing the untapped opportunities at the intersection of advanced AI techniques and geoscience. It examines major methodologies, showcases advances in large-scale models, and discusses the challenges and prospects that will shape the future landscape of GFMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>the m...</summary><p>the manuscript is under review</p></details> |
| **[A Comprehensive Evaluation of Histopathology Foundation Models for Ovarian Cancer Subtype Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09990v2)** | 2024-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large pretrained transformers are increasingly being developed as generalised foundation models which can underpin powerful task-specific artificial intelligence models. Histopathology foundation models show great promise across many tasks, but analyses have typically been limited by arbitrary hyperparameters that were not tuned to the specific task. We report the most rigorous single-task validation of histopathology foundation models to date, specifically in ovarian cancer morphological subtyping. Attention-based multiple instance learning classifiers were compared using three ImageNet-pretrained feature extractors and fourteen histopathology foundation models. The training set consisted of 1864 whole slide images from 434 ovarian carcinoma cases at Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust. Five-class classification performance was evaluated through five-fold cross-validation, and these cross-validation models were ensembled for hold-out testing and external validation on the Transcanadian Study and OCEAN Challenge datasets. The best-performing model used the H-optimus-0 foundation model, with five-class balanced accuracies of 89%, 97%, and 74% in the test sets. Normalisations and augmentations aided the performance of the ImageNet-pretrained ResNets, but these were still outperformed by 13 of the 14 foundation models. Hyperparameter tuning the downstream classifiers improved performance by a median 1.9% balanced accuracy, with many improvements being statistically significant. Histopathology foundation models offer a clear benefit to ovarian cancer subtyping, improving classification performance to a degree where clinical utility is tangible, albeit with an increased computational burden. Such models could provide a second opinion to histopathologists diagnosing challenging cases and may improve the accuracy, objectivity, and efficiency of pathological diagnoses overall.</p></details> |  |
| **[Segmentation by Factorization: Unsupervised Semantic Segmentation for Pathology by Factorizing Foundation Model Features](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05697v1)** | 2024-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Segmentation by Factorization (F-SEG), an unsupervised segmentation method for pathology that generates segmentation masks from pre-trained deep learning models. F-SEG allows the use of pre-trained deep neural networks, including recently developed pathology foundation models, for semantic segmentation. It achieves this without requiring additional training or finetuning, by factorizing the spatial features extracted by the models into segmentation masks and their associated concept features. We create generic tissue phenotypes for H&E images by training clustering models for multiple numbers of clusters on features extracted from several deep learning models on The Cancer Genome Atlas Program (TCGA), and then show how the clusters can be used for factorizing corresponding segmentation masks using off-the-shelf deep learning models. Our results show that F-SEG provides robust unsupervised segmentation capabilities for H&E pathology images, and that the segmentation quality is greatly improved by utilizing pathology foundation models. We discuss and propose methods for evaluating the performance of unsupervised segmentation in pathology.</p></details> |  |

This paper investigates how to efficiently train speech foundation models with self-supervised learning (SSL) under a limited compute budget. We examine critical factors in SSL that impact the budget, including model architecture, model size, and data size. Our goal is to make analytical steps toward understanding the training dynamics of speech foundation models. We benchmark SSL objectives in an entirely comparable setting and find that other factors contribute more significantly to the success of SSL. Our results show that slimmer model architectures outperform common small architectures under the same compute and parameter budget. We demonstrate that the size of the pre-training data remains crucial, even with data augmentation during SSL training, as performance suffers when iterating over limited data. Finally, we identify a trade-off between model size and data size, highlighting an optimal model size for a given compute budget.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in SLT 2024</p></details> |
| **[Can OOD Object Detectors Learn from Foundation Models?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05162v1)** | 2024-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Out-of-distribution (OOD) object detection is a challenging task due to the absence of open-set OOD data. Inspired by recent advancements in text-to-image generative models, such as Stable Diffusion, we study the potential of generative models trained on large-scale open-set data to synthesize OOD samples, thereby enhancing OOD object detection. We introduce SyncOOD, a simple data curation method that capitalizes on the capabilities of large foundation models to automatically extract meaningful OOD data from text-to-image generative models. This offers the model access to open-world knowledge encapsulated within off-the-shelf foundation models. The synthetic OOD samples are then employed to augment the training of a lightweight, plug-and-play OOD detector, thus effectively optimizing the in-distribution (ID)/OOD decision boundaries. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that SyncOOD significantly outperforms existing methods, establishing new state-of-the-art performance with minimal synthetic data usage.</p></details> | 19 pages, 4 figures |

| **[OmniJet-$α$: The first cross-task foundation model for particle physics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05618v2)** | 2024-09-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models are multi-dataset and multi-task machine learning methods that once pre-trained can be fine-tuned for a large variety of downstream applications. The successful development of such general-purpose models for physics data would be a major breakthrough as they could improve the achievable physics performance while at the same time drastically reduce the required amount of training time and data. We report significant progress on this challenge on several fronts. First, a comprehensive set of evaluation methods is introduced to judge the quality of an encoding from physics data into a representation suitable for the autoregressive generation of particle jets with transformer architectures (the common backbone of foundation models). These measures motivate the choice of a higher-fidelity tokenization compared to previous works. Finally, we demonstrate transfer learning between an unsupervised problem (jet generation) and a classic supervised task (jet tagging) with our new OmniJet-$\alpha$ model. This is the first successful transfer between two different and actively studied classes of tasks and constitutes a major step in the building of foundation models for particle physics.</p></details> |  |
| **[VILA-U: a Unified Foundation Model Integrating Visual Understanding and Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04429v1)** | 2024-09-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>VILA-U is a Unified foundation model that integrates Video, Image, Language understanding and generation. Traditional visual language models (VLMs) use separate modules for understanding and generating visual content, which can lead to misalignment and increased complexity. In contrast, VILA-U employs a single autoregressive next-token prediction framework for both tasks, eliminating the need for additional components like diffusion models. This approach not only simplifies the model but also achieves near state-of-the-art performance in visual language understanding and generation. The success of VILA-U is attributed to two main factors: the unified vision tower that aligns discrete visual tokens with textual inputs during pretraining, which enhances visual perception, and autoregressive image generation can achieve similar quality as diffusion models with high-quality dataset. This allows VILA-U to perform comparably to more complex models using a fully token-based autoregressive framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 7 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |
