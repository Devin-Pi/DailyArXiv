Despite the advancements in Deep Learning (DL) and Transformer architectures for HSI classification, challenges such as computational efficiency and the need for extensive labeled data persist. This paper introduces WaveMamba, a novel approach that integrates wavelet transformation with the spatial-spectral Mamba architecture to enhance HSI classification. WaveMamba captures both local texture patterns and global contextual relationships in an end-to-end trainable model. The Wavelet-based enhanced features are then processed through the state-space architecture to model spatial-spectral relationships and temporal dependencies. The experimental results indicate that WaveMamba surpasses existing models, achieving an accuracy improvement of 4.5\% on the University of Houston dataset and a 2.0\% increase on the Pavia University dataset.</p></details> |  |
| **[GIS Copilot: Towards an Autonomous GIS Agent for Spatial Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03205v4)** | 2024-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in Generative AI offer promising capabilities for spatial analysis. Despite their potential, the integration of generative AI with established GIS platforms remains underexplored. In this study, we propose a framework for integrating LLMs directly into existing GIS platforms, using QGIS as an example. Our approach leverages the reasoning and programming capabilities of LLMs to autonomously generate spatial analysis workflows and code through an informed agent that has comprehensive documentation of key GIS tools and parameters. The implementation of this framework resulted in the development of a "GIS Copilot" that allows GIS users to interact with QGIS using natural language commands for spatial analysis. The GIS Copilot was evaluated with over 100 spatial analysis tasks with three complexity levels: basic tasks that require one GIS tool and typically involve one data layer to perform simple operations; intermediate tasks involving multi-step processes with multiple tools, guided by user instructions; and advanced tasks which involve multi-step processes that require multiple tools but not guided by user instructions, necessitating the agent to independently decide on and executes the necessary steps. The evaluation reveals that the GIS Copilot demonstrates strong potential in automating foundational GIS operations, with a high success rate in tool selection and code generation for basic and intermediate tasks, while challenges remain in achieving full autonomy for more complex tasks. This study contributes to the emerging vision of Autonomous GIS, providing a pathway for non-experts to engage with geospatial analysis with minimal prior expertise. While full autonomy is yet to be achieved, the GIS Copilot demonstrates significant potential for simplifying GIS workflows and enhancing decision-making processes.</p></details> |  |

Inspired by the concept of location encoding, which aims to capture location characteristics to enhance GeoAI decision-making capabilities, we improve the GeoAI model by a knowledge driven approach to integrate both first-order and second-order effects of point patterns. This paper investigates how these spatial contexts impact the accuracy of terrain feature predictions. The results show that incorporating spatial point pattern statistics notably enhances model performance by leveraging different representations of spatial relationships.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 pag...</summary><p>4 pages with 1 figure.

| **[Coarse Correspondences Boost Spatial-Temporal Reasoning in Multimodal Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00754v2)** | 2024-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal language models (MLLMs) are increasingly being applied in real-world environments, necessitating their ability to interpret 3D spaces and comprehend temporal dynamics. Current methods often rely on specialized architectural designs or task-specific fine-tuning to achieve this. We introduce Coarse Correspondences, a simple lightweight method that enhances MLLMs' spatial-temporal reasoning with 2D images as input, without modifying the architecture or requiring task-specific fine-tuning. Our method uses a lightweight tracking model to identify primary object correspondences between frames in a video or across different image viewpoints, and then conveys this information to MLLMs through visual prompting. We demonstrate that this simple training-free approach brings substantial gains to GPT4-V/O consistently on four benchmarks that require spatial-temporal reasoning, including +20.5\% improvement on ScanQA, +9.7\% on OpenEQA's episodic memory subset, +6.0\% on the long-form video benchmark EgoSchema, and +11\% on the R2R navigation benchmark. Additionally, we show that Coarse Correspondences can also enhance open-source MLLMs' spatial reasoning (by +6.9\% on ScanQA) when applied in both training and inference and that the improvement can generalize to unseen datasets such as SQA3D (+3.1\%). Taken together, we show that Coarse Correspondences effectively and efficiently boosts models' performance on downstream tasks requiring spatial-temporal reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>proje...</summary><p>project page: https://coarse-correspondence.github.io</p></details> |
| **[Sparkle: Mastering Basic Spatial Capabilities in Vision Language Models Elicits Generalization to Composite Spatial Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16162v2)** | 2024-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision language models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance across a wide range of downstream tasks. However, their proficiency in spatial reasoning remains limited, despite its crucial role in tasks involving navigation and interaction with physical environments. Specifically, most of these tasks rely on the core spatial reasoning capabilities in two-dimensional (2D) environments, and our evaluation reveals that state-of-the-art VLMs frequently generate implausible and incorrect responses to composite spatial reasoning problems, including simple pathfinding tasks that humans can solve effortlessly at a glance. To address this, we explore an effective approach to enhance 2D spatial reasoning within VLMs by training the model solely on basic spatial capabilities. We begin by disentangling the key components of 2D spatial reasoning: direction comprehension, distance estimation, and localization. Our central hypothesis is that mastering these basic spatial capabilities can significantly enhance a model's performance on composite spatial tasks requiring advanced spatial understanding and combinatorial problem-solving, with generalized improvements in visual-spatial tasks. To investigate this hypothesis, we introduce Sparkle, a framework that fine-tunes VLMs on these three basic spatial capabilities by synthetic data generation and targeted supervision to form an instruction dataset for each capability. Our experiments demonstrate that VLMs fine-tuned with Sparkle achieve significant performance gains, not only in the basic tasks themselves but also in generalizing to composite and out-of-distribution spatial reasoning tasks. These findings underscore the effectiveness of mastering basic spatial capabilities in enhancing composite spatial problem-solving, offering insights into systematic strategies for improving VLMs' spatial reasoning capabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sparse Zero Correlation Zone Arrays for Training Design in Spatial Modulation Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13878v1)** | 2024-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a novel training matrix design for spatial modulation (SM) systems, by introducing a new class of two-dimensional (2D) arrays called sparse zero correlation zone (SZCZ) arrays. An SZCZ array is characterized by a majority of zero entries and exhibits the zero periodic auto- and cross-correlation zone properties across any two rows. With these unique properties, we show that SZCZ arrays can be effectively used as training matrices for SM systems. Additionally, direct constructions of SZCZ arrays with large ZCZ widths and controllable sparsity levels based on 2D restricted generalized Boolean functions (RGBFs) are proposed. Compared with existing training schemes, the proposed SZCZ-based training matrices have larger ZCZ widths, thereby offering greater tolerance for delay spread in multipath channels. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed SZCZ-based training design exhibits superior channel estimation performance over frequency-selective fading channels compared to existing alternatives.</p></details> |  |
| **[CLIPer: Hierarchically Improving Spatial Representation of CLIP for Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13836v1)** | 2024-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) exhibits strong zero-shot classification ability on various image-level tasks, leading to the research to adapt CLIP for pixel-level open-vocabulary semantic segmentation without additional training. The key is to improve spatial representation of image-level CLIP, such as replacing self-attention map at last layer with self-self attention map or vision foundation model based attention map. In this paper, we present a novel hierarchical framework, named CLIPer, that hierarchically improves spatial representation of CLIP. The proposed CLIPer includes an early-layer fusion module and a fine-grained compensation module. We observe that, the embeddings and attention maps at early layers can preserve spatial structural information. Inspired by this, we design the early-layer fusion module to generate segmentation map with better spatial coherence. Afterwards, we employ a fine-grained compensation module to compensate the local details using the self-attention maps of diffusion model. We conduct the experiments on seven segmentation datasets. Our proposed CLIPer achieves the state-of-the-art performance on these datasets. For instance, using ViT-L, CLIPer has the mIoU of 69.8% and 43.3% on VOC and COCO Object, outperforming ProxyCLIP by 9.2% and 4.1% respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>Homep...</summary><p>Homepange and code: https://linsun449.github.io/cliper</p></details> |
| **[Ecology, Spatial Structure, and Selection Pressure Induce Strong Signatures in Phylogenetic Structure](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07245v2)** | 2024-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Evolutionary dynamics are shaped by a variety of fundamental, generic drivers, including spatial structure, ecology, and selection pressure. These drivers impact the trajectory of evolution, and have been hypothesized to influence phylogenetic structure. Here, we set out to assess (1) if spatial structure, ecology, and selection pressure leave detectable signatures in phylogenetic structure, (2) the extent, in particular, to which ecology can be detected and discerned in the presence of spatial structure, and (3) the extent to which these phylogenetic signatures generalize across evolutionary systems. To this end, we analyze phylogenies generated by manipulating spatial structure, ecology, and selection pressure within three computational models of varied scope and sophistication. We find that selection pressure, spatial structure, and ecology have characteristic effects on phylogenetic metrics, although these effects are complex and not always intuitive. Signatures have some consistency across systems when using equivalent taxonomic unit definitions (e.g., individual, genotype, species). Further, we find that sufficiently strong ecology can be detected in the presence of spatial structure. We also find that, while low-resolution phylogenetic reconstructions can bias some phylogenetic metrics, high-resolution reconstructions recapitulate them faithfully. Although our results suggest potential for evolutionary inference of spatial structure, ecology, and selection pressure through phylogenetic analysis, further methods development is needed to distinguish these drivers' phylometric signatures from each other and to appropriately normalize phylogenetic metrics. With such work, phylogenetic analysis could provide a versatile toolkit to study large-scale evolving populations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatial error models with heteroskedastic normal perturbations and joint modeling of mean and variance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13432v1)** | 2024-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work presents the spatial error model with heteroskedasticity, which allows the joint modeling of the parameters associated with both the mean and the variance, within a traditional approach to spatial econometrics. The estimation algorithm is based on the log-likelihood function and incorporates the use of GAMLSS models in an iterative form. Two theoretical results show the advantages of the model to the usual models of spatial econometrics and allow obtaining the bias of weighted least squares estimators. The proposed methodology is tested through simulations, showing notable results in terms of the ability to recover all parameters and the consistency of its estimates. Finally, this model is applied to identify the factors associated with school desertion in Colombia.</p></details> |  |
| **[Raster Interval Object Approximations for Spatial Intersection Joins](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01716v3)** | 2024-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial join processing techniques that identify intersections between complex geometries (e.g., polygons) commonly follow a two-step filter-and-refine pipeline. The filter step evaluates the query predicate on the minimum bounding rectangles (MBRs) of the geometries, while the refinement step eliminates false positives by applying the query on the exact geometries. To accelerate spatial join evaluation over complex geometries, we propose a raster intervals approximation of object geometries and introduce a powerful intermediate step in the pipeline. In a preprocessing phase, our method (i) rasterizes each object geometry using a fine grid, (ii) models groups of nearby cells that intersect the polygon as an interval, and (iii) encodes each interval with a bitstring capturing the overlap of each cell in it with the polygon. Going one step further, we improve our approach by approximating each object by two sets of intervals that succinctly capture the raster cells which (i) intersect with the object and (ii) are fully contained within the object. Using this representation, we show that we can verify whether two polygons intersect through a sequence of linear-time joins between the interval sets. Our approximations are effectively compressible and customizable for partitioned data and polygons of varying sizes, rasterized at different granularities. Finally, we propose a novel algorithm that computes the interval approximation of a polygon without fully rasterizing it first, rendering the computation of approximations orders of magnitude faster. Experiments on real data demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposal over previous work.</p></details> | 25 pages |
| **[I2TTS: Image-indicated Immersive Text-to-speech Synthesis with Spatial Perception](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13314v1)** | 2024-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Controlling the style and characteristics of speech synthesis is crucial for adapting the output to specific contexts and user requirements. Previous Text-to-speech (TTS) works have focused primarily on the technical aspects of producing natural-sounding speech, such as intonation, rhythm, and clarity. However, they overlook the fact that there is a growing emphasis on spatial perception of synthesized speech, which may provide immersive experience in gaming and virtual reality. To solve this issue, in this paper, we present a novel multi-modal TTS approach, namely Image-indicated Immersive Text-to-speech Synthesis (I2TTS). Specifically, we introduce a scene prompt encoder that integrates visual scene prompts directly into the synthesis pipeline to control the speech generation process. Additionally, we propose a reverberation classification and refinement technique that adjusts the synthesized mel-spectrogram to enhance the immersive experience, ensuring that the involved reverberation condition matches the scene accurately. Experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves high-quality scene and spatial matching without compromising speech naturalness, marking a significant advancement in the field of context-aware speech synthesis.

| **[Intensity-Spatial Dual Masked Autoencoder for Multi-Scale Feature Learning in Chest CT Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13198v1)** | 2024-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the field of medical image segmentation, challenges such as indistinct lesion features, ambiguous boundaries,and multi-scale characteristics have long revailed. This paper proposes an improved method named Intensity-Spatial Dual Masked AutoEncoder (ISD-MAE). Based on the tissue-contrast semi-masked autoencoder, a Masked AutoEncoder (MAE) branch is introduced to perform intensity masking and spatial masking operations on chest CT images for multi-scale feature learning and segmentation tasks. The model utilizes a dual-branch structure and contrastive learning to enhance the ability to learn tissue features and boundary details. Experiments are conducted on multiple 2D and 3D datasets. The results show that ISD-MAE significantly outperforms other methods in 2D pneumonia and mediastinal tumor segmentation tasks. For example, the Dice score reaches 90.10% on the COVID19 LESION dataset, and the performance is relatively stable. However, there is still room for improvement on 3D datasets. In response to this, improvement directions are proposed, including optimizing the loss function, using enhanced 3D convolution blocks, and processing datasets from multiple perspectives.Our code is available at:https://github.com/prowontheus/ISD-MAE.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages,6 figures,3 tables</p></details> |
| **[Approximating Spatial Distance Through Confront Networks: Application to the Segmentation of Medieval Avignon](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13134v1)** | 2024-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In historical studies, the older the sources, the more common it is to have access to data that are only partial, and/or unreliable or imprecise. This can make it difficult, or even impossible, to perform certain tasks of interest, such as the segmentation of some urban space based on the location of its constituting elements. Indeed, traditional approaches to tackle this specific task require knowing the position of all these elements before clustering them. Yet, alternative information is sometimes available, which can be leveraged to address this challenge. For instance, in the Middle Ages, land registries typically do not provide exact addresses, but rather locate spatial objects relative to each other, e.g. x being to the North of y. Spatial graphs are particularly adapted to model such spatial relationships, called confronts, which is why we propose their use over standard tabular databases. However, historical data are rich and allow extracting confront networks in many ways, making the process non-trivial. In this article, we propose several extraction methods and compare them to identify the most appropriate. We postulate that the best candidate must constitute an optimal trade-off between covering as much of the original data as possible, and providing the best graph-based approximation of spatial distance. Leveraging a dataset that describes Avignon during its papal period, we show empirically that the best results require ignoring some of the information present in the original historical sources, and that including additional information from secondary sources significantly improves the confront network. We illustrate the relevance of our method by partitioning the best graph that we extracted, and discussing its community structure in terms of urban space organization, from a historical perspective. Our data and source code are both publicly available online.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we introduce DriveMLLM, a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the spatial understanding capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in autonomous driving. DriveMLLM includes 2,734 front-facing camera images and introduces both absolute and relative spatial reasoning tasks, accompanied by linguistically diverse natural language questions. To measure MLLMs' performance, we propose novel evaluation metrics focusing on spatial understanding. We evaluate several state-of-the-art MLLMs on DriveMLLM, and our results reveal the limitations of current models in understanding complex spatial relationships in driving contexts. We believe these findings underscore the need for more advanced MLLM-based spatial reasoning methods and highlight the potential for DriveMLLM to drive further research in autonomous driving.

| **[RIS-Assisted Received Adaptive Spatial Modulation for Wireless Communication](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06894v3)** | 2024-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A novel wireless transmission scheme, as named the reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted received adaptive spatial modulation (RASM) scheme, is proposed in this paper. In this scheme, the adaptive spatial modulation (ASM)-based antennas selection works at the receiver by employing the characteristics of the RIS in each time slot, where the signal-to-noise ratio at specific selected antennas can be further enhanced with near few powers. Besides for the bits from constellation symbols, the extra bits can be mapped into the indices of receive antenna combinations and conveyed to the receiver through the ASM-based antenna-combination selection, thus providing higher spectral efficiency. To explicitly present the RASM scheme, the analytical performance of bit error rate of it is discussed in this paper. As a trade-off selection, the proposed scheme shows higher spectral efficiency and remains the satisfactory error performance. Simulation and analytical results demonstrate the better performance and exhibit more potential to apply in practical wireless communication.</p></details> |  |
| **[Integrating Secondary Structures Information into Triangular Spatial Relationships (TSR) for Advanced Protein Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12853v1)** | 2024-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Protein structures represent the key to deciphering biological functions. The more detailed form of similarity among these proteins is sometimes overlooked by the conventional structural comparison methods. In contrast, further advanced methods, such as Triangular Spatial Relationship (TSR), have been demonstrated to make finer differentiations. Still, the classical implementation of TSR does not provide for the integration of secondary structure information, which is important for a more detailed understanding of the folding pattern of a protein. To overcome these limitations, we developed the SSE-TSR approach. The proposed method integrates secondary structure elements (SSEs) into TSR-based protein representations. This allows an enriched representation of protein structures by considering 18 different combinations of helix, strand, and coil arrangements. Our results show that using SSEs improves the accuracy and reliability of protein classification to varying degrees. We worked with two large protein datasets of 9.2K and 7.8K samples, respectively. We applied the SSE-TSR approach and used a neural network model for classification. Interestingly, introducing SSEs improved performance statistics for Dataset 1, with accuracy moving from 96.0% to 98.3%. For Dataset 2, where the performance statistics were already good, further small improvements were found with the introduction of SSE, giving an accuracy of 99.5% compared to 99.4%. These results show that SSE integration can dramatically improve TSR key discrimination, with significant benefits in datasets with low initial accuracies and only incremental gains in those with high baseline performance. Thus, SSE-TSR is a powerful bioinformatics tool that improves protein classification and understanding of protein function and interaction.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dense ReLU Neural Networks for Temporal-spatial Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09961v2)** | 2024-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we focus on fully connected deep neural networks utilizing the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation function for nonparametric estimation. We derive non-asymptotic bounds that lead to convergence rates, addressing both temporal and spatial dependence in the observed measurements. By accounting for dependencies across time and space, our models better reflect the complexities of real-world data, enhancing both predictive performance and theoretical robustness. We also tackle the curse of dimensionality by modeling the data on a manifold, exploring the intrinsic dimensionality of high-dimensional data. We broaden existing theoretical findings of temporal-spatial analysis by applying them to neural networks in more general contexts and demonstrate that our proof techniques are effective for models with short-range dependence. Our empirical simulations across various synthetic response functions underscore the superior performance of our method, outperforming established approaches in the existing literature. These findings provide valuable insights into the strong capabilities of dense neural networks for temporal-spatial modeling across a broad range of function classes.</p></details> |  |
| **[AI's Spatial Intelligence: Evaluating AI's Understanding of Spatial Transformations in PSVT:R and Augmented Reality](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06269v3)** | 2024-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial intelligence is important in Architecture, Construction, Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM), and Medicine. Understanding three-dimensional (3D) spatial rotations can involve verbal descriptions and visual or interactive examples, illustrating how objects change orientation in 3D space. Recent studies show Artificial Intelligence (AI) with language and vision capabilities still face limitations in spatial reasoning. In this paper, we have studied generative AI's spatial capabilities of understanding rotations of objects utilizing its image and language processing features. We examined the spatial intelligence of the GPT-4 model with vision in understanding spatial rotation process with diagrams based on the Revised Purdue Spatial Visualization Test: Visualization of Rotations (Revised PSVT:R). Next, we incorporated a layer of coordinate system axes on Revised PSVT:R to study the variations in GPT-4's performance. We also examined GPT-4's understanding of 3D rotations in Augmented Reality (AR) scenes that visualize spatial rotations of an object in 3D space and observed increased accuracy of GPT-4's understanding of the rotations by adding supplementary textual information depicting the rotation process or mathematical representations of the rotation (e.g., matrices). The results indicate that while GPT-4 as a major current Generative AI model lacks the understanding of a spatial rotation process, it has the potential to understand the rotation process with additional information that can be provided by methods such as AR. By combining the potentials in spatial intelligence of AI with AR's interactive visualization abilities, we expect to offer enhanced guidance for students' spatial learning activities. Such spatial guidance can benefit understanding spatial transformations and additionally support processes like assembly, fabrication, and manufacturing.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robust 3D Semantic Occupancy Prediction with Calibration-free Spatial Transformation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12177v1)** | 2024-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D semantic occupancy prediction, which seeks to provide accurate and comprehensive representations of environment scenes, is important to autonomous driving systems. For autonomous cars equipped with multi-camera and LiDAR, it is critical to aggregate multi-sensor information into a unified 3D space for accurate and robust predictions. Recent methods are mainly built on the 2D-to-3D transformation that relies on sensor calibration to project the 2D image information into the 3D space. These methods, however, suffer from two major limitations: First, they rely on accurate sensor calibration and are sensitive to the calibration noise, which limits their application in real complex environments. Second, the spatial transformation layers are computationally expensive and limit their running on an autonomous vehicle. In this work, we attempt to exploit a Robust and Efficient 3D semantic Occupancy (REO) prediction scheme. To this end, we propose a calibration-free spatial transformation based on vanilla attention to implicitly model the spatial correspondence. In this way, we robustly project the 2D features to a predefined BEV plane without using sensor calibration as input. Then, we introduce 2D and 3D auxiliary training tasks to enhance the discrimination power of 2D backbones on spatial, semantic, and texture features. Last, we propose a query-based prediction scheme to efficiently generate large-scale fine-grained occupancy predictions. By fusing point clouds that provide complementary spatial information, our REO surpasses the existing methods by a large margin on three benchmarks, including OpenOccupancy, Occ3D-nuScenes, and SemanticKITTI Scene Completion. For instance, our REO achieves 19.8$\times$ speedup compared to Co-Occ, with 1.1 improvements in geometry IoU on OpenOccupancy. Our code will be available at https://github.com/ICEORY/REO.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 11 figures, 18 tables</p></details> |

Existing methods for imputing missing values in remote sensing images fail to fully exploit spatiotemporal auxiliary information, which restricts the accuracy of their reconstructions. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel deep learning-based approach called MS2TAN (Multi-Scale Masked Spatial-Temporal Attention Network) for reconstructing time-series remote sensing images. First, we introduce an efficient spatiotemporal feature extractor based on Masked Spatial-Temporal Attention (MSTA) to capture high-quality representations of spatiotemporal neighborhood features surrounding missing regions while significantly reducing the computational complexity of the attention mechanism. Second, a Multi-Scale Restoration Network composed of MSTA-based Feature Extractors is designed to progressively refine missing values by exploring spatiotemporal neighborhood features at different scales. Third, we propose a "Pixel-Structure-Perception" Multi-Objective Joint Optimization method to enhance the visual quality of the reconstructed results from multiple perspectives and to preserve more texture structures. Finally, quantitative experimental results under multi-temporal inputs on two public datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms competitive approaches, achieving a 9.76%/9.30% reduction in Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and a 0.56 dB/0.62 dB increase in Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), along with stronger texture and structural consistency. Ablation experiments further validate the contribution of the core innovations to imputation accuracy.</p></details> |  |

Affordance regions are defined as object parts that provide interaction possibilities to an agent. For example, the bottom of a bottle affords the object to be placed on a surface, while its spout affords the contained liquid to be poured. We propose a novel approach to learn changes of affordance constraints in human demonstration to construct spatial bimanual action models representing object interactions. To exploit the information encoded in these spatial bimanual action models, we formulate an optimization problem to determine optimal object configurations across multiple execution keypoints while taking into account the initial scene, the learned affordance constraints, and the robot's kinematics. We evaluate the approach in simulation with two example tasks (pouring drinks and rolling dough) and compare three different definitions of affordance constraints: (i) component-wise distances between affordance regions in Cartesian space, (ii) component-wise distances between affordance regions in cylindrical space, and (iii) degrees of satisfaction of manually defined symbolic spatial affordance constraints.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, accepted for publication at Humanoids 2024 - Copyright IEEE</p></details> |

Using this finding, we derive a discrete stochastic maximal \(L^p\)-regularity estimate for a spatial semidiscretization. Furthermore, we provide a nearly optimal pathwise uniform convergence estimate for this spatial semidiscretization under a wide range of spatial \(L^q\)-norms.</p></details> |  |
| **[Skeleton-Guided Spatial-Temporal Feature Learning for Video-Based Visible-Infrared Person Re-Identification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11069v1)** | 2024-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video-based visible-infrared person re-identification (VVI-ReID) is challenging due to significant modality feature discrepancies. Spatial-temporal information in videos is crucial, but the accuracy of spatial-temporal information is often influenced by issues like low quality and occlusions in videos. Existing methods mainly focus on reducing modality differences, but pay limited attention to improving spatial-temporal features, particularly for infrared videos. To address this, we propose a novel Skeleton-guided spatial-Temporal feAture leaRning (STAR) method for VVI-ReID. By using skeleton information, which is robust to issues such as poor image quality and occlusions, STAR improves the accuracy of spatial-temporal features in videos of both modalities. Specifically, STAR employs two levels of skeleton-guided strategies: frame level and sequence level. At the frame level, the robust structured skeleton information is used to refine the visual features of individual frames. At the sequence level, we design a feature aggregation mechanism based on skeleton key points graph, which learns the contribution of different body parts to spatial-temporal features, further enhancing the accuracy of global features. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that STAR outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Code will be open source soon.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Normal: Learning Spatial Density Models of Node Mobility](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10997v1)** | 2024-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning models of complex spatial density functions, representing the steady-state density of mobile nodes moving on a two-dimensional terrain, can assist in network design and optimization problems, e.g., by accelerating the computation of the density function during a parameter sweep. We address the question of applicability for off-the-shelf mixture density network models for the description of mobile node density over a disk. We propose the use of M\"obius distributions to retain symmetric spatial relations, yet be flexible enough to capture changes as one radially traverses the disk. The mixture models for M\"obius versus Gaussian distributions are compared and the benefits of choosing M\"obius distributions become evident, yet we also observe that learning mixtures of M\"obius distributions is a fragile process, when using current tools, compared to learning mixtures of Gaussians.</p></details> |  |
| **[Vision-Language Modeling with Regularized Spatial Transformer Networks for All Weather Crosswind Landing of Aircraft](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05574v2)** | 2024-11-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The intrinsic capability of the Human Vision System (HVS) to perceive depth of field and failure of Instrument Landing Systems (ILS) stimulates a pilot to perform a vision-based manual landing over an autoland approach. However, harsh weather creates challenges, and a pilot must have a clear view of runway elements before the minimum decision altitude. To aid in manual landing, a vision-based system trained to clear weather-induced visual degradations requires a robust landing dataset under various climatic conditions. Nevertheless, to acquire a dataset, flying an aircraft in dangerous weather impacts safety. Also, this system fails to generate reliable warnings, as localization of runway elements suffers from projective distortion while landing at crosswind. To combat, we propose to synthesize harsh weather landing images by training a prompt-based climatic diffusion network. Also, we optimize a weather distillation model using a novel diffusion-distillation loss to learn to clear these visual degradations. Precisely, the distillation model learns an inverse relationship with the diffusion network. Inference time, pre-trained distillation network directly clears weather-impacted onboard camera images, which can be further projected to display devices for improved visibility.Then, to tackle crosswind landing, a novel Regularized Spatial Transformer Networks (RuSTaN) module accurately warps landing images. It minimizes the localization error of runway object detector and helps generate reliable internal software warnings. Finally, we curated an aircraft landing dataset (AIRLAD) by simulating a landing scenario under various weather degradations and experimentally validated our contributions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in Indian Conference on Vision Graphics and Image Processing - ICVGIP 2024</p></details> |
| **[Wasserstein Spatial Depth](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10646v1)** | 2024-11-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modeling observations as random distributions embedded within Wasserstein spaces is becoming increasingly popular across scientific fields, as it captures the variability and geometric structure of the data more effectively. However, the distinct geometry and unique properties of Wasserstein space pose challenges to the application of conventional statistical tools, which are primarily designed for Euclidean spaces. Consequently, adapting and developing new methodologies for analysis within Wasserstein spaces has become essential. The space of distributions on $\mathbb{R}^d$ with $d>1$ is not linear, and ''mimic'' the geometry of a Riemannian manifold. In this paper, we extend the concept of statistical depth to distribution-valued data, introducing the notion of {\it Wasserstein spatial depth}. This new measure provides a way to rank and order distributions, enabling the development of order-based clustering techniques and inferential tools. We show that Wasserstein spatial depth (WSD) preserves critical properties of conventional statistical depths, notably, ranging within $[0,1]$, transformation invariance, vanishing at infinity, reaching a maximum at the geometric median, and continuity. Additionally, the population WSD has a straightforward plug-in estimator based on sampled empirical distributions. We establish the estimator's consistency and asymptotic normality. Extensive simulation and real-data application showcase the practical efficacy of WSD.</p></details> |  |

This motivates us to jointly analyze active fires and population changes in the U.S. from July 2020 to June 2021. The available data are recorded on different scales (or spatial resolutions) and by different types of distributions (referred to as multi-type data). Moreover, wildfires are known to have feedback mechanism that creates signal-to-noise dependence. We analyze point-referenced remote sensing fire data from National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and county-level population change data provided by U.S. Census Bureau's Population Estimates Program (PEP). We develop a multiscale multi-type spatial Bayesian model that assumes the average number of fires is zero-inflated normal, the incidence of fire as Bernoulli, and the percentage population change as normally distributed. This high-dimensional dataset makes Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) implementation infeasible. We bypass MCMC by extending a recently introduced computationally efficient Bayesian framework to directly sample from the exact posterior distribution, which includes a term to model signal-to-noise dependence. Such signal-to-noise dependence is known to be present in wildfire data, but is commonly not accounted for. A simulation study is used to highlight the computational performance of our method. In our analysis, we obtained predictions of wildfire probabilities, identified several useful covariates, and found that regions with many fires were associated with population change.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Spatial Complexity of Optical Computing and How to Reduce It](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10435v1)** | 2024-11-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Similar to algorithms, which consume time and memory to run, hardware requires resources to function. For devices processing physical waves, implementing operations needs sufficient "space," as dictated by wave physics. How much space is needed to perform a certain function is a fundamental question in optics, with recent research addressing it for given mathematical operations, but not for more general computing tasks, e.g., classification. Inspired by computational complexity theory, we study the "spatial complexity" of optical computing systems in terms of scaling laws - specifically, how their physical dimensions must scale as the dimension of the mathematical operation increases - and propose a new paradigm for designing optical computing systems: space-efficient neuromorphic optics, based on structural sparsity constraints and neural pruning methods motivated by wave physics (notably, the concept of "overlapping nonlocality"). On two mainstream platforms, free-space optics and on-chip integrated photonics, our methods demonstrate substantial size reductions (to 1%-10% the size of conventional designs) with minimal compromise on performance. Our theoretical and computational results reveal a trend of diminishing returns on accuracy as structure dimensions increase, providing a new perspective for interpreting and approaching the ultimate limits of optical computing - a balanced trade-off between device size and accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Instrumental Variables Framework to Unite Spatial Confounding Methods](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10381v1)** | 2024-11-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Studies investigating the causal effects of spatially varying exposures on health$\unicode{x2013}$such as air pollution, green space, or crime$\unicode{x2013}$often rely on observational and spatially indexed data. A prevalent challenge is unmeasured spatial confounding, where an unobserved spatially varying variable affects both exposure and outcome, leading to biased causal estimates and invalid confidence intervals. In this paper, we introduce a general framework based on instrumental variables (IV) that encompasses and unites most of the existing methods designed to account for an unmeasured spatial confounder. We show that a common feature of all existing methods is their reliance on small-scale variation in exposure, which functions as an IV. In this framework, we outline the underlying assumptions and the estimation strategy of each method. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the IV can be used to identify and estimate the exposure-response curve under more relaxed assumptions. We conclude by estimating the exposure-response curve between long-term exposure to fine particulate matter and all-cause mortality among 33,454 zip codes in the United States while adjusting for unmeasured spatial confounding.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages with 10 figures and tables</p></details> |
| **[Semantics and Spatiality of Emergent Communication](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10173v1)** | 2024-11-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When artificial agents are jointly trained to perform collaborative tasks using a communication channel, they develop opaque goal-oriented communication protocols. Good task performance is often considered sufficient evidence that meaningful communication is taking place, but existing empirical results show that communication strategies induced by common objectives can be counterintuitive whilst solving the task nearly perfectly. In this work, we identify a goal-agnostic prerequisite to meaningful communication, which we term semantic consistency, based on the idea that messages should have similar meanings across instances. We provide a formal definition for this idea, and use it to compare the two most common objectives in the field of emergent communication: discrimination and reconstruction. We prove, under mild assumptions, that semantically inconsistent communication protocols can be optimal solutions to the discrimination task, but not to reconstruction. We further show that the reconstruction objective encourages a stricter property, spatial meaningfulness, which also accounts for the distance between messages. Experiments with emergent communication games validate our theoretical results. These findings demonstrate an inherent advantage of distance-based communication goals, and contextualize previous empirical discoveries.</p></details> | <details><summary>34 pa...</summary><p>34 pages, to be published in NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |
| **[Enhancing Robustness to Noise Corruption for Point Cloud Recognition via Spatial Sorting and Set-Mixing Aggregation Module](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10806v2)** | 2024-11-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current models for point cloud recognition demonstrate promising performance on synthetic datasets. However, real-world point cloud data inevitably contains noise, impacting model robustness. While recent efforts focus on enhancing robustness through various strategies, there still remains a gap in comprehensive analyzes from the standpoint of network architecture design. Unlike traditional methods that rely on generic techniques, our approach optimizes model robustness to noise corruption through network architecture design. Inspired by the token-mixing technique applied in 2D images, we propose Set-Mixer, a noise-robust aggregation module which facilitates communication among all points to extract geometric shape information and mitigating the influence of individual noise points. A sorting strategy is designed to enable our module to be invariant to point permutation, which also tackles the unordered structure of point cloud and introduces consistent relative spatial information. Experiments conducted on ModelNet40-C indicate that Set-Mixer significantly enhances the model performance on noisy point clouds, underscoring its potential to advance real-world applicability in 3D recognition and perception tasks.</p></details> | Accepted by ACCV2024 |

While deep learning models support robust autonomy, current methods lack pixel-precision positioning and require extensive labeled data. To overcome these challenges, we propose a self-supervised convolutional neural network with a spatially differentiable loss function, incorporating shape priors to refine predictions of optimal robot contact poses for semiconductor characterization. This network improves valid pose generation by 20.0%, relative to existing models. We demonstrate our network's performance by driving a 4-degree-of-freedom robot to characterize photoconductivity at 3,025 predicted poses across a gradient of perovskite compositions, achieving throughputs over 125 measurements per hour. Spatially mapping photoconductivity onto each drop-casted film reveals regions of inhomogeneity. With this self-supervised deep learning-driven robotic system, we enable high-precision and reliable automation of contact-based characterization techniques at high throughputs, thereby allowing the measurement of previously inaccessible yet important semiconductor properties for self-driving laboratories.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatial Re-parameterization for N:M Sparsity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05612v2)** | 2024-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a Spatial Re-parameterization (SpRe) method for the N:M sparsity in CNNs. SpRe is stemmed from an observation regarding the restricted variety in spatial sparsity present in N:M sparsity compared with unstructured sparsity. Particularly, N:M sparsity exhibits a fixed sparsity rate within the spatial domains due to its distinctive pattern that mandates N non-zero components among M successive weights in the input channel dimension of convolution filters. On the contrary, we observe that unstructured sparsity displays a substantial divergence in sparsity across the spatial domains, which we experimentally verified to be very crucial for its robust performance retention compared with N:M sparsity. Therefore, SpRe employs the spatial-sparsity distribution of unstructured sparsity to assign an extra branch in conjunction with the original N:M branch at training time, which allows the N:M sparse network to sustain a similar distribution of spatial sparsity with unstructured sparsity. During inference, the extra branch can be further re-parameterized into the main N:M branch, without exerting any distortion on the sparse pattern or additional computation costs. SpRe has achieved a commendable feat by matching the performance of N:M sparsity methods with state-of-the-art unstructured sparsity methods across various benchmarks.

To efficiently handle TkQs, many indexes have been developed, but the effectiveness of TkQ is limited. To improve effectiveness, several deep learning models have recently been proposed, but they suffer severe efficiency issues and there are no efficient indexes specifically designed to accelerate the top-k search process for these deep learning models. To tackle these issues, we consider embedding based spatial keyword queries, which capture the semantic meaning of query keywords and object descriptions in two separate embeddings to evaluate textual relevance. Although various models can be used to generate these embeddings, no indexes have been specifically designed for such queries. To fill this gap, we propose LIST, a novel machine learning based Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search index that Learns to Index the Spatio-Textual data. LIST utilizes a new learning-to-cluster technique to group relevant queries and objects together while separating irrelevant queries and objects. There are two key challenges in building an effective and efficient index, i.e., the absence of high-quality labels and the unbalanced clustering results. We develop a novel pseudo-label generation technique to address the two challenges. Additionally, we introduce a learning based spatial relevance model that can integrates with various text relevance models to form a lightweight yet effective relevance for reranking objects retrieved by LIST.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by VLDB Journal</p></details> |
| **[Fourier analysis of spatial point processes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06403v2)** | 2024-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this article, we develop comprehensive frequency domain methods for estimating and inferring the second-order structure of spatial point processes. The main element here is on utilizing the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) of the point pattern and its tapered counterpart. Under second-order stationarity, we show that both the DFTs and the tapered DFTs are asymptotically jointly independent Gaussian even when the DFTs share the same limiting frequencies. Based on these results, we establish an $\alpha$-mixing central limit theorem for a statistic formulated as a quadratic form of the tapered DFT. As applications, we derive the asymptotic distribution of the kernel spectral density estimator and establish a frequency domain inferential method for parametric stationary point processes. For the latter, the resulting model parameter estimator is computationally tractable and yields meaningful interpretations even in the case of model misspecification. We investigate the finite sample performance of our estimator through simulations, considering scenarios of both correctly specified and misspecified models. Furthermore, we extend our proposed DFT-based frequency domain methods to a class of non-stationary spatial point processes.</p></details> |  |

However, contemporary scene flow methods encounter three major challenges. Firstly, flow estimation solely based on local receptive fields lacks long-dependency matching of point pairs. To address this issue, we propose global attentive flow embedding to match all-to-all point pairs in both feature space and Euclidean space, providing global initialization before local refinement. Secondly, there are deformations existing in non-rigid objects after warping, which leads to variations in the spatiotemporal relation between the consecutive frames. For a more precise estimation of residual flow, a spatial temporal feature re-embedding module is devised to acquire the sequence features after deformation. Furthermore, previous methods perform poor generalization due to the significant domain gap between the synthesized and LiDAR-scanned datasets. We leverage novel domain adaptive losses to effectively bridge the gap of motion inference from synthetic to real-world. Experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance across various datasets, with particularly outstanding results on real-world LiDAR-scanned datasets.

I replicate the results presented by Zhong et al. for interaction structures with one, two, three, and four arcs ablated from the dominance network. I then empirically demonstrate that the dynamics of the RPSLS ESCG have sufficiently long time constants that the true asymptotic outcomes can often only be identified after running the ablated ESCG for 10,000,000MCS or longer, and that the true long-term outcomes can be markedly less diverse than those reported by Zhong et al. as asymptotic. Finally I demonstrate that, when run for sufficiently many MCS, the original unablated RPSLS system exhibits essentially the same asymptotic outcomes as the ablated RPSLS systems, and in this sense the only causal effect of the ablations is to alter the time required for the system to converge to the long-term asymptotic states that the unablated system eventually settles to anyhow.</p></details> | <details><summary>84 Pa...</summary><p>84 Pages, 49 Figures, 41 References</p></details> |

This approach enables each Gaussian to exhibit a richer representation by accommodating varying colors and opacities across its surface, significantly enhancing rendering quality compared to traditional methods. To demonstrate the merits of our approach, we have adapted the Mini-Splatting architecture to integrate textured Gaussians without increasing the number of Gaussians. Our experiments across multiple real-world datasets show that Textured-GS consistently outperforms both the baseline Mini-Splatting and standard 3DGS in terms of visual fidelity. The results highlight the potential of Textured-GS to advance Gaussian-based rendering technologies, promising more efficient and high-quality scene reconstructions.

However, it cannot incorporate the spatial heterogeneity that is typically present in spatial data. To address this issue, we introduce an effective method specifically designed to discover the potential dependence structures in multivariate spatial data. Our approach assumes that spatial locations can be approximately divided into a finite number of clusters, with locations within the same cluster sharing similar dependence structures. By leveraging an iterative algorithm that combines spatial clustering with factor analysis, we simultaneously detect spatial clusters and estimate a unique factor model for each cluster. The proposed method is evaluated through comprehensive simulation studies, demonstrating its flexibility. In addition, we apply the proposed method to a dataset of railway station attributes in the Tokyo metropolitan area, highlighting its practical applicability and effectiveness in uncovering complex spatial dependencies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Anonymous Distributed Localisation via Spatial Population Protocols](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08434v1)** | 2024-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the distributed localization problem (DLP), n anonymous robots (agents) A0, A1, ..., A(n-1) begin at arbitrary positions p0, ..., p(n-1) in S, where S is a Euclidean space. The primary goal in DLP is for agents to reach a consensus on a unified coordinate system that accurately reflects the relative positions of all points, p0, ... , p(n-1), in S. Extensive research on DLP has primarily focused on the feasibility and complexity of achieving consensus when agents have limited access to inter-agent distances, often due to missing or imprecise data. In this paper, however, we examine a minimalist, computationally efficient model of distributed computing in which agents have access to all pairwise distances, if needed. Specifically, we introduce a novel variant of population protocols, referred to as the spatial population protocols model. In this variant each agent can memorise one or a fixed number of coordinates, and when agents A(i) and A(j) interact, they can not only exchange their current knowledge but also either determine the distance d(i,j) between them in S (distance query model) or obtain the vector v(i,j) spanning points p(i) and p(j) (vector query model). We examine three DLP scenarios: - Self-stabilising localisation protocol with distance queries We propose and analyse self-stabilising localisation protocol based on pairwise distance adjustment. We also discuss several hard instances in this scenario, and suggest possible improvements for the considered protocol, - Leader-based localisation protocol with distance queries We propose and analyse several leader-based protocols which stabilise in o(n) parallel time. These protocols rely on efficient solution to multi-contact epidemic, and - Self-stabilising localisation protocol with vector queries We propose and analyse superfast self-stabilising DLP protocol which stabilises in O(log n) parallel time.</p></details> |  |

Our model leverages a Graph Attention Network (GAT) to capture spatial dependencies and temporal dynamics in the data, further enhanced by a spatial regularization term ensuring geographic coherence. We construct two graph datasets employing rainfall, pressure, and temperature attributes from the Indian Meteorological Department and ERA5 Reanalysis on Single Levels, respectively. Our network operates on graph representations of the data, where nodes represent geographic locations, and edges, inferred through event synchronization, denote significant co-occurrences of rainfall events. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our GAE effectively identifies anomalous rainfall patterns across the Indian landscape. Our work paves the way for sophisticated spatiotemporal anomaly detection methodologies in climate science, contributing to better climate change preparedness and response strategies.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods face limitations in recognizing objects located at a distance or occluded, due to the sparse nature of outdoor point clouds. In this work, we observe a significant mitigation of this problem by accumulating multiple temporally consecutive LiDAR sweeps, resulting in a remarkable improvement in perception accuracy. However, the computation cost also increases, hindering previous approaches from utilizing a large number of LiDAR sweeps. To tackle this challenge, we find that a considerable portion of points in the accumulated point cloud is redundant, and discarding these points has minimal impact on perception accuracy. We introduce a simple yet effective Gumbel Spatial Pruning (GSP) layer that dynamically prunes points based on a learned end-to-end sampling. The GSP layer is decoupled from other network components and thus can be seamlessly integrated into existing point cloud network architectures. Without incurring additional computational overhead, we increase the number of LiDAR sweeps from 10, a common practice, to as many as 40. Consequently, there is a significant enhancement in perception performance. For instance, in nuScenes 3D object detection and BEV map segmentation tasks, our pruning strategy improves the vanilla TransL baseline and other baseline methods.</p></details> |  |

We employ a stochastic sampling design that can flexibly generate irregularly spaced sampling sites, encompassing both pure increasing and mixed increasing domain frameworks. Specifically, we focus on a spatial trend regression model and a nonparametric regression model with spatially dependent covariates. For these models, we investigate $L^2$-penalized series estimation of the trend and regression functions. We establish uniform and $L^2$ convergence rates and multivariate central limit theorems for general series estimators as main results. Additionally, we show that spline and wavelet series estimators achieve optimal uniform and $L^2$ convergence rates and propose methods for constructing confidence intervals for these estimators. Finally, we demonstrate that our dependence structure conditions on the underlying spatial processes cover a broad class of random fields, including L\'evy-driven continuous autoregressive and moving average random fields.</p></details> | 55 pages |

While current research has predominantly focused on the benchmarking of text-to-image (T2I) models, we propose a more comprehensive evaluation that includes \textit{both} T2I and Large Language Models (LLMs). As spatial relations are naturally understood in a visuo-spatial manner, we develop an approach to convert LLM outputs into an image, thereby allowing us to evaluate both T2I models and LLMs \textit{visually}. We examined the spatial relation understanding of 8 prominent generative models (3 T2I models and 5 LLMs) on a set of 10 common prepositions, as well as assess the feasibility of automatic evaluation methods. Surprisingly, we found that T2I models only achieve subpar performance despite their impressive general image-generation abilities. Even more surprisingly, our results show that LLMs are significantly more accurate than T2I models in generating spatial relations, despite being primarily trained on textual data. We examined reasons for model failures and highlight gaps that can be filled to enable more spatially faithful generations.</p></details> |  |

While their combination is more beneficial for leveraging their individual strengths, the synergy between channel and spatial attentions has not been fully explored, lacking in fully harness the synergistic potential of multi-semantic information for feature guidance and mitigation of semantic disparities. Our study attempts to reveal the synergistic relationship between spatial and channel attention at multiple semantic levels, proposing a novel Spatial and Channel Synergistic Attention module (SCSA). Our SCSA consists of two parts: the Shareable Multi-Semantic Spatial Attention (SMSA) and the Progressive Channel-wise Self-Attention (PCSA). SMSA integrates multi-semantic information and utilizes a progressive compression strategy to inject discriminative spatial priors into PCSA's channel self-attention, effectively guiding channel recalibration. Additionally, the robust feature interactions based on the self-attention mechanism in PCSA further mitigate the disparities in multi-semantic information among different sub-features within SMSA. We conduct extensive experiments on seven benchmark datasets, including classification on ImageNet-1K, object detection on MSCOCO 2017, segmentation on ADE20K, and four other complex scene detection datasets. Our results demonstrate that our proposed SCSA not only surpasses the current state-of-the-art attention but also exhibits enhanced generalization capabilities across various task scenarios.

Hence, accurate delineation of the boundaries is crucial for improving safety in autonomous driving. A novel spatial inter-correlation enhancement and spatially-embedded feature fusion network (SIESEF-FusionNet) is proposed in this paper, enhancing spatial inter-correlation by combining inverse distance weighting and angular compensation to extract more beneficial spatial information without causing redundancy. Meanwhile, a new spatial adaptive pooling module is also designed, embedding enhanced spatial information into semantic features for strengthening the context-awareness of semantic features. Experimental results demonstrate that 83.7% mIoU and 97.8% OA are achieved by SIESEF-FusionNet on the Toronto3D dataset, with performance superior to other baseline methods. A value of 61.1% mIoU is reached on the semanticKITTI dataset, where a marked improvement in segmentation performance is observed. In addition, the effectiveness and plug-and-play capability of the proposed modules are further verified through ablation studies.</p></details> | 9 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Joinable Search over Multi-source Spatial Datasets: Overlap, Coverage, and Efficiency](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13383v2)** | 2024-11-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The search for joinable data is pivotal for numerous applications, such as data integration, data augmentation, and data analysis. Although there have been many successful joinable search studies for table discovery, the study of finding joinable spatial datasets for a given query from multiple spatial data sources has not been well considered. This paper studies two cases of joinable search problems from multiple spatial data sources. In addition to the overlap joinable search problem (OJSP), we also propose a novel coverage joinable search problem (CJSP) that has not been considered before, motivated by many real world applications in the field of spatial search. To support two cases of joinable search over multiple spatial data sources seamlessly, we propose a multi-source spatial dataset search framework. Firstly, we design a DIstributed Tree-based Spatial index structure called DITS, which is used not only to design acceleration strategies to speed up joinable searches, but also to support efficient communication between multiple data sources. Additionally, we prove that the CJSP is NP-hard and design a greedy approximate algorithm to solve the problem. We evaluate the efficiency of our search framework on five real-world data sources, and the experimental results show that our framework can significantly reduce running time and communication costs compared with baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[ENAT: Rethinking Spatial-temporal Interactions in Token-based Image Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06959v1)** | 2024-11-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, token-based generation have demonstrated their effectiveness in image synthesis. As a representative example, non-autoregressive Transformers (NATs) can generate decent-quality images in a few steps. NATs perform generation in a progressive manner, where the latent tokens of a resulting image are incrementally revealed. At each step, the unrevealed image regions are padded with mask tokens and inferred by NAT. In this paper, we delve into the mechanisms behind the effectiveness of NATs and uncover two important patterns that naturally emerge from NATs: Spatially (within a step), although mask and visible tokens are processed uniformly by NATs, the interactions between them are highly asymmetric. In specific, mask tokens mainly gather information for decoding, while visible tokens tend to primarily provide information, and their deep representations can be built only upon themselves. Temporally (across steps), the interactions between adjacent generation steps mostly concentrate on updating the representations of a few critical tokens, while the computation for the majority of tokens is generally repetitive. Driven by these findings, we propose EfficientNAT (ENAT), a NAT model that explicitly encourages these critical interactions inherent in NATs. At the spatial level, we disentangle the computations of visible and mask tokens by encoding visible tokens independently, while decoding mask tokens conditioned on the fully encoded visible tokens. At the temporal level, we prioritize the computation of the critical tokens at each step, while maximally reusing previously computed token representations to supplement necessary information. ENAT improves the performance of NATs notably with significantly reduced computational cost. Experiments on ImageNet-256, ImageNet-512 and MS-COCO validate the effectiveness of ENAT.

| **[Electroencephalogram-based Multi-class Decoding of Attended Speakers' Direction with Audio Spatial Spectrum](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06928v1)** | 2024-11-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Decoding the directional focus of an attended speaker from listeners' electroencephalogram (EEG) signals is essential for developing brain-computer interfaces to improve the quality of life for individuals with hearing impairment. Previous works have concentrated on binary directional focus decoding, i.e., determining whether the attended speaker is on the left or right side of the listener. However, a more precise decoding of the exact direction of the attended speaker is necessary for effective speech processing. Additionally, audio spatial information has not been effectively leveraged, resulting in suboptimal decoding results. In this paper, we observe that, on our recently presented dataset with 15-class directional focus, models relying exclusively on EEG inputs exhibits significantly lower accuracy when decoding the directional focus in both leave-one-subject-out and leave-one-trial-out scenarios. By integrating audio spatial spectra with EEG features, the decoding accuracy can be effectively improved. We employ the CNN, LSM-CNN, and EEG-Deformer models to decode the directional focus from listeners' EEG signals with the auxiliary audio spatial spectra. The proposed Sp-Aux-Deformer model achieves notable 15-class decoding accuracies of 57.48% and 61.83% in leave-one-subject-out and leave-one-trial-out scenarios, respectively.</p></details> |  |

| **[Efficient Unsupervised Domain Adaptation Regression for Spatial-Temporal Air Quality Sensor Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06917v1)** | 2024-11-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The deployment of affordable Internet of Things (IoT) sensors for air pollution monitoring has increased in recent years due to their scalability and cost-effectiveness. However, accurately calibrating these sensors in uncontrolled environments remains a significant challenge. While expensive reference sensors can provide accurate ground truth data, they are often deployed on a limited scale due to high costs, leading to a scarcity of labeled data. In diverse urban environments, data distributions constantly shift due to varying factors such as traffic patterns, industrial activities, and weather conditions, which impact sensor readings. Consequently, traditional machine learning models -- despite their increasing deployment for environmental sensor calibration -- often struggle to provide reliable pollutant measurements across different locations due to domain shifts. To address these challenges, we propose a novel unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) method specifically tailored for regression tasks on graph-structured data. Our approach leverages Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to model the relationships between sensors. To effectively capture critical spatial-temporal interactions, we incorporate spatial-temporal graph neural networks (STGNNs), which extend GNNs by incorporating temporal dynamics. To handle the resulting larger embeddings, we propose a domain adaptation method using a closed-form solution inspired by the Tikhonov-regularized least-squares problem. This method leverages Cholesky decomposition and power iteration to align the subspaces between source and target domains. By aligning these subspaces, our approach allows low-cost IoT sensors to learn calibration parameters from expensive reference sensors. This facilitates reliable pollutant measurements in new locations without the need for additional costly equipment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatially Constrained Transformer with Efficient Global Relation Modelling for Spatio-Temporal Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06836v1)** | 2024-11-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate spatio-temporal prediction is crucial for the sustainable development of smart cities. However, current approaches often struggle to capture important spatio-temporal relationships, particularly overlooking global relations among distant city regions. Most existing techniques predominantly rely on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to capture global relations. However, CNNs exhibit neighbourhood bias, making them insufficient for capturing distant relations. To address this limitation, we propose ST-SampleNet, a novel transformer-based architecture that combines CNNs with self-attention mechanisms to capture both local and global relations effectively. Moreover, as the number of regions increases, the quadratic complexity of self-attention becomes a challenge. To tackle this issue, we introduce a lightweight region sampling strategy that prunes non-essential regions and enhances the efficiency of our approach. Furthermore, we introduce a spatially constrained position embedding that incorporates spatial neighbourhood information into the self-attention mechanism, aiding in semantic interpretation and improving the performance of ST-SampleNet. Our experimental evaluation on three real-world datasets demonstrates the effectiveness of ST-SampleNet. Additionally, our efficient variant achieves a 40% reduction in computational costs with only a marginal compromise in performance, approximately 1%.</p></details> |  |

| **[PRAGA: Prototype-aware Graph Adaptive Aggregation for Spatial Multi-modal Omics Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12728v3)** | 2024-11-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial multi-modal omics technology, highlighted by Nature Methods as an advanced biological technique in 2023, plays a critical role in resolving biological regulatory processes with spatial context. Recently, graph neural networks based on K-nearest neighbor (KNN) graphs have gained prominence in spatial multi-modal omics methods due to their ability to model semantic relations between sequencing spots. However, the fixed KNN graph fails to capture the latent semantic relations hidden by the inevitable data perturbations during the biological sequencing process, resulting in the loss of semantic information. In addition, the common lack of spot annotation and class number priors in practice further hinders the optimization of spatial multi-modal omics models. Here, we propose a novel spatial multi-modal omics resolved framework, termed PRototype-Aware Graph Adaptative Aggregation for Spatial Multi-modal Omics Analysis (PRAGA). PRAGA constructs a dynamic graph to capture latent semantic relations and comprehensively integrate spatial information and feature semantics. The learnable graph structure can also denoise perturbations by learning cross-modal knowledge. Moreover, a dynamic prototype contrastive learning is proposed based on the dynamic adaptability of Bayesian Gaussian Mixture Models to optimize the multi-modal omics representations for unknown biological priors. Quantitative and qualitative experiments on simulated and real datasets with 7 competing methods demonstrate the superior performance of PRAGA.</p></details> |  |
| **[Analysis of spatially clustered survival data with unobserved covariates using SBART](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06591v1)** | 2024-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Usual parametric and semi-parametric regression methods are inappropriate and inadequate for large clustered survival studies when the appropriate functional forms of the covariates and their interactions in hazard functions are unknown, and random cluster effects and cluster-level covariates are spatially correlated. We present a general nonparametric method for such studies under the Bayesian ensemble learning paradigm called Soft Bayesian Additive Regression Trees. Our methodological and computational challenges include large number of clusters, variable cluster sizes, and proper statistical augmentation of the unobservable cluster-level covariate using a data registry different from the main survival study. We use an innovative 3-step approach based on latent variables to address our computational challenges. We illustrate our method and its advantages over existing methods by assessing the impacts of intervention in some county-level and patient-level covariates to mitigate existing racial disparity in breast cancer survival in 67 Florida counties (clusters) using two different data resources. Florida Cancer Registry (FCR) is used to obtain clustered survival data with patient-level covariates, and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Survey (BRFSS) is used to obtain further data information on an unobservable county-level covariate of Screening Mammography Utilization (SMU).</p></details> |  |
| **[Regularization of the ensemble Kalman filter using a non-parametric, non-stationary spatial model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14318v5)** | 2024-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The sample covariance matrix of a random vector is a good estimate of the true covariance matrix if the sample size is much larger than the length of the vector. In high-dimensional problems, this condition is never met. As a result, in high dimensions the Ensemble Kalman Filter's (EnKF) ensemble does not contain enough information to specify the prior covariance matrix accurately. This necessitates the need for regularization of the analysis (observation update) problem. We propose a regularization technique based on a new spatial model. The model is a constrained version of the general Gaussian process convolution model. The constraints include local stationarity and smoothness of local spectra. We regularize EnKF by postulating that its prior covariances obey the spatial model. Placing a hyperprior distribution on the model parameters and using the likelihood of the prior ensemble data allows for an optimized use of both the ensemble and the hyperprior. The respective estimator is shown to be consistent. Its neural Bayes implementation proved to be both accurate and computationally efficient. In simulation experiments, the new technique led to substantially better EnKF performance than several existing techniques.</p></details> | 50 pages, 9 figures |

This requires a model with a strong capacity to capture long-range dependencies. Existing models struggle in this regard due to the slow growth of receptive field for Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) based methods and patch-level interactions in Transformer-based methods, which are ineffective for capturing long-range dependencies. Motivated by this, we propose SEM-Net, a novel visual State Space model (SSM) vision network, modelling corrupted images at the pixel level while capturing long-range dependencies (LRDs) in state space, achieving a linear computational complexity. To address the inherent lack of spatial awareness in SSM, we introduce the Snake Mamba Block (SMB) and Spatially-Enhanced Feedforward Network. These innovations enable SEM-Net to outperform state-of-the-art inpainting methods on two distinct datasets, showing significant improvements in capturing LRDs and enhancement in spatial consistency. Additionally, SEM-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance on motion deblurring, demonstrating its generalizability.

However, their spatial reasoning capabilities are under-investigated. In this paper, we construct a novel VQA dataset, Spatial-MM, to comprehensively study LMMs' spatial understanding and reasoning capabilities. Our analyses on object-relationship and multi-hop reasoning reveal several important findings. Firstly, bounding boxes and scene graphs, even synthetic ones, can significantly enhance LMMs' spatial reasoning. Secondly, LMMs struggle more with questions posed from the human perspective than the camera perspective about the image. Thirdly, chain of thought (CoT) prompting does not improve model performance on complex multi-hop questions involving spatial relations. % Moreover, spatial reasoning steps are much less accurate than non-spatial ones across MLLMs. Lastly, our perturbation analysis on GQA-spatial reveals that LMMs are much stronger at basic object detection than complex spatial reasoning. We believe our benchmark dataset and in-depth analyses can spark further research on LMMs spatial reasoning.

However, sorting through this data for specific scenarios is a meticulous and error-prone process, often dependent on the application, and lacks generality and reproducibility. In this work, we introduce SpREs as a novel querying language for pattern matching over perception streams containing spatial and temporal data derived from multi-modal dynamic environments. To highlight the capabilities of SpREs, we developed the STREM tool as both an offline and online pattern matching framework for perception data. We demonstrate the offline capabilities of STREM through a case study on a publicly available AV dataset (Woven Planet Perception) and its online capabilities through a case study integrating STREM in ROS with the CARLA simulator. We also conduct performance benchmark experiments on various SpRE queries. Using our matching framework, we are able to find over 20,000 matches within 296 ms making STREM applicable in runtime monitoring applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the International Journal on Software Tools for Technology Transfer</p></details> |

Based on this, we explore spatial modulation (SM) and space shift keying (SSK) designs as pivotal techniques to enhance spectral efficiency (SE) and bit-error rate (BER) performance in the LEO satellite-assisted multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. The various performance analysis of these designs are presented in this paper, revealing insightful findings and conclusions through analytical methods and Monte Carlo simulations with perfect and imperfect channel state information (CSI) estimation. The results provide a comprehensive analysis of the merits and trade-offs associated with the investigated schemes, particularly in terms of BER, computational complexity, and SE.

| **[Demystifying Spatial Confounding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16861v2)** | 2024-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial confounding is a fundamental issue in spatial regression models which arises because spatial random effects, included to approximate unmeasured spatial variation, are typically not independent of covariates in the model. This can lead to significant bias in covariate effect estimates. The problem is complex and has been the topic of extensive research with sometimes puzzling and seemingly contradictory results. Here, we develop a broad theoretical framework that brings mathematical clarity to the mechanisms of spatial confounding, providing explicit analytical expressions for the resulting bias. We see that the problem is directly linked to spatial smoothing and identify exactly how the size and occurrence of bias relate to the features of the spatial model as well as the underlying confounding scenario. Using our results, we can explain subtle and counter-intuitive behaviours. Finally, we propose a general approach for dealing with spatial confounding bias in practice, applicable for any spatial model specification. When a covariate has non-spatial information, we show that a general form of the so-called spatial+ method can be used to eliminate bias. When no such information is present, the situation is more challenging but, under the assumption of unconfounded high frequencies, we develop a procedure in which multiple capped versions of spatial+ are applied to assess the bias in this case. We illustrate our approach with an application to air temperature in Germany.</p></details> |  |

While supervised methods demonstrate proficiency, their reliance on extensive pixel-level annotations limits scalability. We introduce DynaSeg, an innovative unsupervised image segmentation approach that overcomes the challenge of balancing feature similarity and spatial continuity without relying on extensive hyperparameter tuning. Unlike traditional methods, DynaSeg employs a dynamic weighting scheme that automates parameter tuning, adapts flexibly to image characteristics, and facilitates easy integration with other segmentation networks. By incorporating a Silhouette Score Phase, DynaSeg prevents undersegmentation failures where the number of predicted clusters might converge to one. DynaSeg uses CNN-based and pre-trained ResNet feature extraction, making it computationally efficient and more straightforward than other complex models. Experimental results showcase state-of-the-art performance, achieving a 12.2% and 14.12% mIOU improvement over current unsupervised segmentation approaches on COCO-All and COCO-Stuff datasets, respectively.

| **[Spatial Transformers for Radio Map Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01211v2)** | 2024-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Radio map estimation (RME) involves spatial interpolation of radio measurements to predict metrics such as the received signal strength at locations where no measurements were collected. The most popular estimators nowadays project the measurement locations to a regular grid and complete the resulting measurement tensor with a convolutional deep neural network. Unfortunately, these approaches suffer from poor spatial resolution and require a great number of parameters. The first contribution of this paper addresses these limitations by means of an attention-based estimator named Spatial TransfOrmer for Radio Map estimation (STORM). This scheme not only outperforms the existing estimators, but also exhibits lower computational complexity, translation equivariance, rotation equivariance, and full spatial resolution. The second contribution is an extended transformer architecture that allows STORM to perform active sensing, by which the next measurement location is selected based on the previous measurements. This is particularly useful for minimization of drive tests (MDT) in cellular networks, where operators request user equipment to collect measurements. Finally, STORM is extensively validated by experiments with one ray-tracing and two real-measurement datasets.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we address the challenging task of Multi-Image Super-Resolution in Remote Sensing (MISR-RS), aiming to generate a High-Resolution (HR) image from multiple Low-Resolution (LR) images obtained by satellites. Recently, the weak temporal correlations among LR images have attracted increasing attention in the MISR-RS task. However, existing MISR methods treat the LR images as sequences with strong temporal correlations, overlooking spatial correlations and imposing temporal dependencies. To address this problem, we propose a novel end-to-end framework named Enhancing Spatial Correlations in MISR (ESC-MISR), which fully exploits the spatial-temporal relations of multiple images for HR image reconstruction. Specifically, we first introduce a novel fusion module named Multi-Image Spatial Transformer (MIST), which emphasizes parts with clearer global spatial features and enhances the spatial correlations between LR images. Besides, we perform a random shuffle strategy for the sequential inputs of LR images to attenuate temporal dependencies and capture weak temporal correlations in the training stage. Compared with the state-of-the-art methods, our ESC-MISR achieves 0.70dB and 0.76dB cPSNR improvements on the two bands of the PROBA-V dataset respectively, demonstrating the superiority of our method.</p></details> |  |

This study focuses on using spatio-temporal disease mapping models to explore the temporal trends of IHD at the county level from 1999 to 2021. To manage the computational burden arising from the high-dimensional data, we employ scalable Bayesian models using a "divide and conquer" strategy. This approach allows for fast model fitting and serves as an efficient procedure for screening spatio-temporal patterns. Additionally, we analyze trends in four regional subdivisions, West, Midwest, South and Northeast, and in urban and rural areas. The dataset on IHD contains missing data, and we propose a procedure to impute the omitted information. The results show a slowdown in the decrease of IHD mortality in the US after 2014 with a slight increase noted after 2019. However, differences exists among the counties, the four big geographical regions, and rural and urban areas.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Spatio-Temporal Signal Recognition on Edge Devices Using PointLCA-Net](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14585v1)** | 2024-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in machine learning, particularly through deep learning architectures like PointNet, have transformed the processing of three-dimensional (3D) point clouds, significantly improving 3D object classification and segmentation tasks. While 3D point clouds provide detailed spatial information, spatio-temporal signals introduce a dynamic element that accounts for changes over time. However, applying deep learning techniques to spatio-temporal signals and deploying them on edge devices presents challenges, including real-time processing, memory capacity, and power consumption. To address these issues, this paper presents a novel approach that combines PointNet's feature extraction with the in-memory computing capabilities and energy efficiency of neuromorphic systems for spatio-temporal signal recognition. The proposed method consists of a two-stage process: in the first stage, PointNet extracts features from the spatio-temporal signals, which are then stored in non-volatile memristor crossbar arrays. In the second stage, these features are processed by a single-layer spiking neural encoder-decoder that employs the Locally Competitive Algorithm (LCA) for efficient encoding and classification. This work integrates the strengths of both PointNet and LCA, enhancing computational efficiency and energy performance on edge devices. PointLCA-Net achieves high recognition accuracy for spatio-temporal data with substantially lower energy burden during both inference and training than comparable approaches, thus advancing the deployment of advanced neural architectures in energy-constrained environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2411.00140</p></details> |
| **[Trajectory Representation Learning on Road Networks and Grids with Spatio-Temporal Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14014v1)** | 2024-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory representation learning is a fundamental task for applications in fields including smart city, and urban planning, as it facilitates the utilization of trajectory data (e.g., vehicle movements) for various downstream applications, such as trajectory similarity computation or travel time estimation. This is achieved by learning low-dimensional representations from high-dimensional and raw trajectory data. However, existing methods for trajectory representation learning either rely on grid-based or road-based representations, which are inherently different and thus, could lose information contained in the other modality. Moreover, these methods overlook the dynamic nature of urban traffic, relying on static road network features rather than time varying traffic patterns. In this paper, we propose TIGR, a novel model designed to integrate grid and road network modalities while incorporating spatio-temporal dynamics to learn rich, general-purpose representations of trajectories. We evaluate TIGR on two realworld datasets and demonstrate the effectiveness of combining both modalities by substantially outperforming state-of-the-art methods, i.e., up to 43.22% for trajectory similarity, up to 16.65% for travel time estimation, and up to 10.16% for destination prediction.</p></details> |  |

However, real-world visual relationships often exhibit a long-tailed distribution, causing existing methods for tasks like Video Scene Graph Generation (VidSGG) and Scene Graph Anticipation (SGA) to produce biased scene graphs. To this end, we propose ImparTail, a novel training framework that leverages curriculum learning and loss masking to mitigate bias in the generation and anticipation of spatio-temporal scene graphs. Our approach gradually decreases the dominance of the head relationship classes during training and focuses more on tail classes, leading to more balanced training. Furthermore, we introduce two new tasks, Robust Spatio-Temporal Scene Graph Generation and Robust Scene Graph Anticipation, designed to evaluate the robustness of STSG models against distribution shifts. Extensive experiments on the Action Genome dataset demonstrate that our framework significantly enhances the unbiased performance and robustness of STSG models compared to existing methods.</p></details> | Under review |
| **[A Foundation Model for Unified Urban Spatio-Temporal Flow Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12972v1)** | 2024-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Urban spatio-temporal flow prediction, encompassing traffic flows and crowd flows, is crucial for optimizing city infrastructure and managing traffic and emergency responses. Traditional approaches have relied on separate models tailored to either grid-based data, representing cities as uniform cells, or graph-based data, modeling cities as networks of nodes and edges. In this paper, we build UniFlow, a foundational model for general urban flow prediction that unifies both grid-based and graphbased data. We first design a multi-view spatio-temporal patching mechanism to standardize different data into a consistent sequential format and then introduce a spatio-temporal transformer architecture to capture complex correlations and dynamics. To leverage shared spatio-temporal patterns across different data types and facilitate effective cross-learning, we propose SpatioTemporal Memory Retrieval Augmentation (ST-MRA). By creating structured memory modules to store shared spatio-temporal patterns, ST-MRA enhances predictions through adaptive memory retrieval. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniFlow outperforms existing models in both grid-based and graph-based flow prediction, excelling particularly in scenarios with limited data availability, showcasing its superior performance and broad applicability. The datasets and code implementation have been released on https://github.com/YuanYuan98/UniFlow.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hierarchical Spatio-Temporal Uncertainty Quantification for Distributed Energy Adoption](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12193v1)** | 2024-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid deployment of distributed energy resources (DER) has introduced significant spatio-temporal uncertainties in power grid management, necessitating accurate multilevel forecasting methods. However, existing approaches often produce overly conservative uncertainty intervals at individual spatial units and fail to properly capture uncertainties when aggregating predictions across different spatial scales. This paper presents a novel hierarchical spatio-temporal model based on the conformal prediction framework to address these challenges. Our approach generates circuit-level DER growth predictions and efficiently aggregates them to the substation level while maintaining statistical validity through a tailored non-conformity score. Applied to a decade of DER installation data from a local utility network, our method demonstrates superior performance over existing approaches, particularly in reducing prediction interval widths while maintaining coverage.</p></details> |  |

Effectively modeling these dynamics is essential for understanding and optimizing urban systems In this work, we introduce UrbanDiT, a foundation model for open-world urban spatio-temporal learning that successfully scale up diffusion transformers in this field. UrbanDiT pioneers a unified model that integrates diverse spatio-temporal data sources and types while learning universal spatio-temporal patterns across different cities and scenarios. This allows the model to unify both multi-data and multi-task learning, and effectively support a wide range of spatio-temporal applications. Its key innovation lies in the elaborated prompt learning framework, which adaptively generates both data-driven and task-specific prompts, guiding the model to deliver superior performance across various urban applications. UrbanDiT offers three primary advantages: 1) It unifies diverse data types, such as grid-based and graph-based data, into a sequential format, allowing to capture spatio-temporal dynamics across diverse scenarios of different cities; 2) With masking strategies and task-specific prompts, it supports a wide range of tasks, including bi-directional spatio-temporal prediction, temporal interpolation, spatial extrapolation, and spatio-temporal imputation; and 3) It generalizes effectively to open-world scenarios, with its powerful zero-shot capabilities outperforming nearly all baselines with training data. These features allow UrbanDiT to achieves state-of-the-art performance in different domains such as transportation traffic, crowd flows, taxi demand, bike usage, and cellular traffic, across multiple cities and tasks. UrbanDiT sets up a new benchmark for foundation models in the urban spatio-temporal domain.</p></details> |  |

This paper advances the analysis of such spatio-spherical data by developing convolutional network layers that are equivariant to the $\mathbf{E(3) \times SO(3)}$ group and account for the physical symmetries of dMRI including rotations, translations, and reflections of space alongside voxel-wise rotations. Further, neuronal fibers are typically antipodally symmetric, a fact we leverage to construct highly efficient spatio-hemispherical graph convolutions to accelerate the analysis of high-dimensional dMRI data. In the context of sparse spherical fiber deconvolution to recover white matter microstructure, our proposed equivariant network layers yield substantial performance and efficiency gains, leading to better and more practical resolution of crossing neuronal fibers and fiber tractography. These gains are experimentally consistent across both simulation and in vivo human datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2024. 24 pages with 13 figures.

Existing thermal comfort models usually overlook temporal dynamics alongside spatial dependencies. We address this problem by introducing a spatio-temporal jump model that clusters data with persistence across both spatial and temporal dimensions. This framework enhances interpretability, minimizes abrupt state changes, and easily handles missing data. We validate our approach through extensive simulations, demonstrating its accuracy in recovering the true underlying partition. When applied to hourly environmental data gathered from a set of weather stations located across the city of Singapore, our proposal identifies meaningful thermal comfort regimes, demonstrating its effectiveness in dynamic urban settings and suitability for real-world monitoring. The comparison of these regimes with feedback on thermal preference indicates the potential of an unsupervised approach to avoid extensive surveys.</p></details> |  |

These patterns vary in color, shape, and location across video frames, posing challenges in extracting information from adjacent frames and preserving temporal consistency throughout the restoration process. Existing deep learning methods often depend on well-designed alignment modules, such as optical flow estimation, deformable convolution, and cross-frame self-attention layers, incurring high computational costs. Recent studies indicate that utilizing raw data as input can significantly improve the effectiveness of video demoireing by providing the pristine degradation information and more detailed content. However, previous works fail to design both efficient and effective raw video demoireing methods that can maintain temporal consistency and prevent degradation of color and spatial details. This paper introduces a novel alignment-free raw video demoireing network with frequency-assisted spatio-temporal Mamba (DemMamba). It features sequentially arranged Spatial Mamba Blocks (SMB) and Temporal Mamba Blocks (TMB) to effectively model the inter- and intra-relationships in raw videos affected by moire patterns. An Adaptive Frequency Block (AFB) within the SMB facilitates demoireing in the frequency domain, while a Channel Attention Block (CAB) in the TMB enhances the temporal information interactions by leveraging inter-channel relationships among features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed DemMamba surpasses state-of-the-art methods by 1.3 dB in PSNR, and also provides a satisfactory visual experience.</p></details> |  |

Traditional methods, which use recurrent neural networks to capture temporal patterns, have proven their effectiveness but come with high system complexity and computational demand. Convolutions could offer a more efficient alternative but are limited by their characteristic of treating all previous frames equally, resulting in poor temporal characterization, and by their local receptive field, limiting the capacity to capture distant correlations among frames. In this paper, we propose STLight, a novel method for spatio-temporal learning that relies solely on channel-wise and depth-wise convolutions as learnable layers. STLight overcomes the limitations of traditional convolutional approaches by rearranging spatial and temporal dimensions together, using a single convolution to mix both types of features into a comprehensive spatio-temporal patch representation. This representation is then processed in a purely convolutional framework, capable of focusing simultaneously on the interaction among near and distant patches, and subsequently allowing for efficient reconstruction of the predicted frames. Our architecture achieves state-of-the-art performance on STL benchmarks across different datasets and settings, while significantly improving computational efficiency in terms of parameters and computational FLOPs.

Predicting these extreme events remains challenging, as their complex interactions with large-scale atmospheric and climatic variables are difficult to capture with traditional statistical and dynamical models. This work presents a general method for driver identification in extreme climate events. A novel framework (STCO-FS) is proposed to identify key immediate (short-term) HW drivers by combining clustering algorithms with an ensemble evolutionary algorithm. The framework analyzes spatio-temporal data, reduces dimensionality by grouping similar geographical nodes for each variable, and develops driver selection in spatial and temporal domains, identifying the best time lags between predictive variables and HW occurrences. The proposed method has been applied to analyze HWs in the Adda river basin in Italy. The approach effectively identifies significant variables influencing HWs in this region. This research can potentially enhance our understanding of HW drivers and predictability.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, 10 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

In this paper, we demonstrate that effective information compression may occur over time or space during sequences of node communications in distributed algorithms, leading to the concept of spatio-temporal compressors. This abstraction classifies existing compressors as spatio-temporal compressors, with their effectiveness described by constructive stability criteria from nonlinear system theory. Subsequently, we apply these spatio-temporal compressors to standard continuous-time consensus flows and distributed prime-dual flows, establishing conditions ensuring convergence. Additionally, we introduce a novel observer-based distributed primal-dual continuous flow integrated with spatio-temporal compressors, which provides broader convergence conditions. These continuous flows achieve exponential convergence to the global optimum when the objective function is strongly convex and can be discretized using Euler approximations. Finally, numerical simulations illustrate the versatility of the proposed spatio-temporal compressors and verify the convergence of algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2408.02332</p></details> |
| **[Spatio-Temporal Communication Compression in Distributed Prime-Dual Flows](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02332v2)** | 2024-11-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we study distributed prime-dual flows for multi-agent optimization with spatio-temporal compressions. The central aim of multi-agent optimization is for a network of agents to collaboratively solve a system-level optimization problem with local objective functions and node-to-node communication by distributed algorithms. The scalability of such algorithms crucially depends on the complexity of the communication messages, and a number of communication compressors for distributed optimization have recently been proposed in the literature. First of all, we introduce a general spatio-temporal compressor characterized by the stability of the resulting dynamical system along the vector field of the compressor. We show that several important distributed optimization compressors such as the greedy sparsifier, the uniform quantizer, and the scalarizer all fall into the category of this spatio-temporal compressor. Next, we propose two distributed prime-dual flows with the spatio-temporal compressors being applied to local node states and local error states, respectively, and prove (exponential) convergence of the node trajectories to the global optimizer for (strongly) convex cost functions. Finally, a few numerical examples are present to illustrate our theoretical results.</p></details> |  |

Most of the existing models achieve either spectral or spatial compression, and do not jointly consider the spatio-spectral redundancies present in HSIs. To address this problem, in this paper we focus our attention on the High Fidelity Compression (HiFiC) model (which is proven to be highly effective for spatial compression problems) and adapt it to perform spatio-spectral compression of HSIs. In detail, we introduce two new models: i) HiFiC using Squeeze and Excitation (SE) blocks (denoted as HiFiC$_{SE}$); and ii) HiFiC with 3D convolutions (denoted as HiFiC$_{3D}$) in the framework of compression of HSIs. We analyze the effectiveness of HiFiC$_{SE}$ and HiFiC$_{3D}$ in compressing the spatio-spectral redundancies with channel attention and inter-dependency analysis. Experimental results show the efficacy of the proposed models in performing spatio-spectral compression, while reconstructing images at reduced bitrates with higher reconstruction quality.

To efficiently handle TkQs, many indexes have been developed, but the effectiveness of TkQ is limited. To improve effectiveness, several deep learning models have recently been proposed, but they suffer severe efficiency issues and there are no efficient indexes specifically designed to accelerate the top-k search process for these deep learning models. To tackle these issues, we consider embedding based spatial keyword queries, which capture the semantic meaning of query keywords and object descriptions in two separate embeddings to evaluate textual relevance. Although various models can be used to generate these embeddings, no indexes have been specifically designed for such queries. To fill this gap, we propose LIST, a novel machine learning based Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search index that Learns to Index the Spatio-Textual data. LIST utilizes a new learning-to-cluster technique to group relevant queries and objects together while separating irrelevant queries and objects. There are two key challenges in building an effective and efficient index, i.e., the absence of high-quality labels and the unbalanced clustering results. We develop a novel pseudo-label generation technique to address the two challenges. Additionally, we introduce a learning based spatial relevance model that can integrates with various text relevance models to form a lightweight yet effective relevance for reranking objects retrieved by LIST.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by VLDB Journal</p></details> |

Existing approaches often address these dimensions in isolation, neglecting their critical interdependencies. In this paper, we introduce the Spatio-Temporal Unitized Model (STUM), a unified framework designed to capture both spatial and temporal dependencies while addressing spatio-temporal heterogeneity through techniques such as distribution alignment and feature fusion. It also ensures both predictive accuracy and computational efficiency. Central to STUM is the Adaptive Spatio-temporal Unitized Cell (ASTUC), which utilizes low-rank matrices to seamlessly store, update, and interact with space, time, as well as their correlations. Our framework is also modular, allowing it to integrate with various spatio-temporal graph neural networks through components such as backbone models, feature extractors, residual fusion blocks, and predictive modules to collectively enhance forecasting outcomes. Experimental results across multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that STUM consistently improves prediction performance with minimal computational cost. These findings are further supported by hyperparameter optimization, pre-training analysis, and result visualization. We provide our source code for reproducibility at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/STUM-E4F0.</p></details> |  |

However, current approaches often struggle to capture important spatio-temporal relationships, particularly overlooking global relations among distant city regions. Most existing techniques predominantly rely on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to capture global relations. However, CNNs exhibit neighbourhood bias, making them insufficient for capturing distant relations. To address this limitation, we propose ST-SampleNet, a novel transformer-based architecture that combines CNNs with self-attention mechanisms to capture both local and global relations effectively. Moreover, as the number of regions increases, the quadratic complexity of self-attention becomes a challenge. To tackle this issue, we introduce a lightweight region sampling strategy that prunes non-essential regions and enhances the efficiency of our approach. Furthermore, we introduce a spatially constrained position embedding that incorporates spatial neighbourhood information into the self-attention mechanism, aiding in semantic interpretation and improving the performance of ST-SampleNet. Our experimental evaluation on three real-world datasets demonstrates the effectiveness of ST-SampleNet. Additionally, our efficient variant achieves a 40% reduction in computational costs with only a marginal compromise in performance, approximately 1%.</p></details> |  |

However, most current systems assume a static environment, which limits the system's applicability in real-world scenarios where environments frequently change due to human intervention or the robot's own actions. In this work, we present DynaMem, a new approach to open-world mobile manipulation that uses a dynamic spatio-semantic memory to represent a robot's environment. DynaMem constructs a 3D data structure to maintain a dynamic memory of point clouds, and answers open-vocabulary object localization queries using multimodal LLMs or open-vocabulary features generated by state-of-the-art vision-language models. Powered by DynaMem, our robots can explore novel environments, search for objects not found in memory, and continuously update the memory as objects move, appear, or disappear in the scene. We run extensive experiments on the Stretch SE3 robots in three real and nine offline scenes, and achieve an average pick-and-drop success rate of 70% on non-stationary objects, which is more than a 2x improvement over state-of-the-art static systems.

Yet, their performance is constrained by the reliance on extensive data for training on a specific task, thereby limiting their adaptability to new urban domains with varied task demands. Although transfer learning has been proposed to remedy this problem by leveraging knowledge across domains, the cross-task generalization still remains under-explored in spatio-temporal graph transfer learning due to the lack of a unified framework. To bridge the gap, we propose Spatio-Temporal Graph Prompting (STGP), a prompt-based framework capable of adapting to multi-diverse tasks in a data-scarce domain. Specifically, we first unify different tasks into a single template and introduce a task-agnostic network architecture that aligns with this template. This approach enables capturing dependencies shared across tasks. Furthermore, we employ learnable prompts to achieve domain and task transfer in a two-stage prompting pipeline, facilitating the prompts to effectively capture domain knowledge and task-specific properties. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that STGP outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in three tasks-forecasting, kriging, and extrapolation-achieving an improvement of up to 10.7%.</p></details> |  |

While convolutional neural networks are widely used in learning ice layer patterns from raw echogram images captured by airborne snow radar sensors, noise in the echogram images prevents researchers from getting high-quality results. Instead, we focus on geometric deep learning using graph neural networks, aiming to build a spatio-temporal graph neural network that learns from thickness information of the top ice layers and predicts for deeper layers. In this paper, we developed a novel multi-branch spatio-temporal graph neural network that used the GraphSAGE framework for spatio features learning and a temporal convolution operation to capture temporal changes, enabling different branches of the network to be more specialized and focusing on a single learning task. We found that our proposed multi-branch network can consistently outperform the current fused spatio-temporal graph neural network in both accuracy and efficiency.</p></details> |  |

This perspective considers spatio-temporal dynamics unitedly and reformulates multi-person motion prediction into a problem on a single graph. Leveraging the dynamic message passing based on this hypergraph, our model dynamically learns from both types of relations to generate targeted messages that reflect the relevance among nodes.

HD EEG devices improve the spatial resolution of EEG by placing more electrodes on the scalp, which meet the requirements of clinical diagnostic applications such as epilepsy focus localization. However, this technique faces challenges, such as high acquisition costs and limited usage scenarios. In this paper, spatio-temporal adaptive diffusion models (STAD) are proposed to pioneer the use of diffusion models for achieving spatial SR reconstruction from low-resolution (LR, 64 channels or fewer) EEG to high-resolution (HR, 256 channels) EEG. Specifically, a spatio-temporal condition module is designed to extract the spatio-temporal features of LR EEG, which then used as conditional inputs to direct the reverse denoising process. Additionally, a multi-scale Transformer denoising module is constructed to leverage multi-scale convolution blocks and cross-attention-based diffusion Transformer blocks for conditional guidance to generate subject-adaptive SR EEG. Experimental results demonstrate that the STAD significantly enhances the spatial resolution of LR EEG and quantitatively outperforms existing methods. Furthermore, STAD demonstrate their value by applying synthetic SR EEG to classification and source localization tasks, indicating their potential to Substantially boost the spatial resolution of EEG.</p></details> |  |

Our approach captures temporal and feature dependencies within a unified spatio-temporal pipeline by leveraging a GCNN that uses a spatio-temporal graph aimed at optimizing predictive accuracy and interoperability. For graph estimation, we introduce techniques, including one based on the (heterogeneous) Gower distance. Once estimated, we propose two methods for graph construction: one based on the Cartesian product, treating temporal instants homogeneously, and another spatio-temporal approach with distinct graphs per time step. We also propose two GCNN architectures: a standard GCNN with a normalized adjacency matrix and a higher-order polynomial GCNN. In addition to accuracy, we emphasize explainability by designing an inherently interpretable model and performing a thorough interpretability analysis, identifying key feature-time combinations that drive predictions. We evaluate XST-GCNN using real-world Electronic Health Record data from University Hospital of Fuenlabrada to predict Multidrug Resistance (MDR) in ICU patients, a critical healthcare challenge linked to high mortality and complex treatments. Our architecture outperforms traditional models, achieving a mean ROC-AUC score of 81.03 +- 2.43. Furthermore, the interpretability analysis provides actionable insights into clinical factors driving MDR predictions, enhancing model transparency.

However, Transformer's complex architecture and black-box nature pose challenges for explainability, a crucial aspect for real-world applications and scientific inquiry. Current Explainable AI (XAI) methods can only provide one-dimensional feature importance, either spatial or temporal explanation, with significant computational complexity. This paper introduces STAA (Spatio-Temporal Attention Attribution), an XAI method for interpreting video Transformer models. Differ from traditional methods that separately apply image XAI techniques for spatial features or segment contribution analysis for temporal aspects, STAA offers both spatial and temporal information simultaneously from attention values in Transformers. The study utilizes the Kinetics-400 dataset, a benchmark collection of 400 human action classes used for action recognition research. We introduce metrics to quantify explanations. We also apply optimization to enhance STAA's raw output. By implementing dynamic thresholding and attention focusing mechanisms, we improve the signal-to-noise ratio in our explanations, resulting in more precise visualizations and better evaluation results.

Current state-of-the-art methods either require multiple independent stages of processing that employ motion cues or, in the case of end-to-end trainable networks, lack in segmentation accuracy, in part due to the difficulty of learning segmentation maps from videos with transient object presence. This limits the application of WSVOS for semantic annotation of surgical videos where multiple surgical tools frequently move in and out of the field of view, a problem that is more difficult than typically encountered in WSVOS. This paper introduces Video Spatio-Temporal Disentanglement Networks (VDST-Net), a framework to disentangle spatiotemporal information using semi-decoupled knowledge distillation to predict high-quality class activation maps (CAMs). A teacher network designed to resolve temporal conflicts when specifics about object location and timing in the video are not provided works with a student network that integrates information over time by leveraging temporal dependencies. We demonstrate the efficacy of our framework on a public reference dataset and on a more challenging surgical video dataset where objects are, on average, present in less than 60\% of annotated frames. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques and generates superior segmentation masks under video-level weak supervision.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV)</p></details> |

If these components are found, they can be modelled univariately. Blind source separation aims to recover the latent components by estimating the unmixing transformation based on the observed data only. The current methods for spatio-temporal blind source separation are restricted to linear unmixing, and nonlinear variants have not been implemented. In this paper, we extend identifiable variational autoencoder to the nonlinear nonstationary spatio-temporal blind source separation setting and demonstrate its performance using comprehensive simulation studies. Additionally, we introduce two alternative methods for the latent dimension estimation, which is a crucial task in order to obtain the correct latent representation. Finally, we illustrate the proposed methods using a meteorological application, where we estimate the latent dimension and the latent components, interpret the components, and show how nonstationarity can be accounted and prediction accuracy can be improved by using the proposed nonlinear blind source separation method as a preprocessing method.</p></details> |  |

This is because whole sequence segmentation is currently a tedious process and inaccurate. Conventional whole sequence segmentation approaches first estimate the motion field between frames, which is then used to propagate the mask along the temporal axis. However, the mask propagation results could be prone to error, especially for the basal and apex slices, where through-plane motion leads to significant morphology and structural change during the cardiac cycle. Inspired by recent advances in video object segmentation (VOS), based on spatio-temporal memory (STM) networks, we propose a continuous STM (CSTM) network for semi-supervised whole heart and whole sequence cMR segmentation. Our CSTM network takes full advantage of the spatial, scale, temporal and through-plane continuity prior of the underlying heart anatomy structures, to achieve accurate and fast 4D segmentation. Results of extensive experiments across multiple cMR datasets show that our method can improve the 4D cMR segmentation performance, especially for the hard-to-segment regions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to WACV 2025</p></details> |
| **[Identifying Spatio-Temporal Drivers of Extreme Events](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24075v1)** | 2024-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The spatio-temporal relations of impacts of extreme events and their drivers in climate data are not fully understood and there is a need of machine learning approaches to identify such spatio-temporal relations from data. The task, however, is very challenging since there are time delays between extremes and their drivers, and the spatial response of such drivers is inhomogeneous. In this work, we propose a first approach and benchmarks to tackle this challenge. Our approach is trained end-to-end to predict spatio-temporally extremes and spatio-temporally drivers in the physical input variables jointly. By enforcing the network to predict extremes from spatio-temporal binary masks of identified drivers, the network successfully identifies drivers that are correlated with extremes. We evaluate our approach on three newly created synthetic benchmarks, where two of them are based on remote sensing or reanalysis climate data, and on two real-world reanalysis datasets.

| **[STC-ViT: Spatio Temporal Continuous Vision Transformer for Weather Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17966v3)** | 2024-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Operational weather forecasting system relies on computationally expensive physics-based models. Recently, transformer based models have shown remarkable potential in weather forecasting achieving state-of-the-art results. However, transformers are discrete and physics-agnostic models which limit their ability to learn the continuous spatio-temporal features of the dynamical weather system. We address this issue with STC-ViT, a Spatio-Temporal Continuous Vision Transformer for weather forecasting. STC-ViT incorporates the continuous time Neural ODE layers with multi-head attention mechanism to learn the continuous weather evolution over time. The attention mechanism is encoded as a differentiable function in the transformer architecture to model the complex weather dynamics. Further, we define a customised physics informed loss for STC-ViT which penalize the model's predictions for deviating away from physical laws. We evaluate STC-ViT against operational Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) model and several deep learning based weather forecasting models. STC-ViT, trained on 1.5-degree 6-hourly data, demonstrates computational efficiency and competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art data-driven models trained on higher-resolution data for global forecasting.</p></details> |  |
| **[Causal Deciphering and Inpainting in Spatio-Temporal Dynamics via Diffusion Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19608v2)** | 2024-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal (ST) prediction has garnered a De facto attention in earth sciences, such as meteorological prediction, human mobility perception. However, the scarcity of data coupled with the high expenses involved in sensor deployment results in notable data imbalances. Furthermore, models that are excessively customized and devoid of causal connections further undermine the generalizability and interpretability. To this end, we establish a causal framework for ST predictions, termed CaPaint, which targets to identify causal regions in data and endow model with causal reasoning ability in a two-stage process. Going beyond this process, we utilize the back-door adjustment to specifically address the sub-regions identified as non-causal in the upstream phase. Specifically, we employ a novel image inpainting technique. By using a fine-tuned unconditional Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) as the generative prior, we in-fill the masks defined as environmental parts, offering the possibility of reliable extrapolation for potential data distributions. CaPaint overcomes the high complexity dilemma of optimal ST causal discovery models by reducing the data generation complexity from exponential to quasi-linear levels. Extensive experiments conducted on five real-world ST benchmarks demonstrate that integrating the CaPaint concept allows models to achieve improvements ranging from 4.3% to 77.3%. Moreover, compared to traditional mainstream ST augmenters, CaPaint underscores the potential of diffusion models in ST enhancement, offering a novel paradigm for this field.

| **[An Overtaking Trajectory Planning Framework Based on Spatio-temporal Topology and Reachable Set Analysis Ensuring Time Efficiency](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22643v1)** | 2024-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating overtaking trajectories in high-speed scenarios presents significant challenges and is typically addressed through hierarchical planning methods. However, this method has two primary drawbacks. First, heuristic algorithms can only provide a single initial solution, which may lead to local optima and consequently diminish the quality of the solution. Second, the time efficiency of trajectory refinement based on numerical optimization is insufficient. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes an overtaking trajectory planning framework based on spatio-temporal topology and reachable set analysis (SROP), to improve trajectory quality and time efficiency. Specifically, this paper introduces topological classes to describe trajectories representing different overtaking behaviors, which support the spatio-temporal topological search method employed by the upper-layer planner to identify diverse initial paths. This approach helps prevent getting stuck in local optima, enhancing the overall solution quality by considering multiple initial solutions from distinct topologies. Moreover, the reachable set method is integrated into the lower-layer planner for parallel trajectory evaluation. This method enhances planning efficiency by decoupling vehicle model constraints from the optimization process, enabling parallel computation while ensuring control feasibility. Simulation results show that the proposed method improves the smoothness of generated trajectories by 66.8% compared to state-of-the-art methods, highlighting its effectiveness in enhancing trajectory quality. Additionally, this method reduces computation time by 62.9%, demonstrating its efficiency.</p></details> |  |

| **[A Hierarchical Framework with Spatio-Temporal Consistency Learning for Emergence Detection in Complex Adaptive Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10300v2)** | 2024-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Emergence, a global property of complex adaptive systems (CASs) constituted by interactive agents, is prevalent in real-world dynamic systems, e.g., network-level traffic congestions. Detecting its formation and evaporation helps to monitor the state of a system, allowing to issue a warning signal for harmful emergent phenomena. Since there is no centralized controller of CAS, detecting emergence based on each agent's local observation is desirable but challenging. Existing works are unable to capture emergence-related spatial patterns, and fail to model the nonlinear relationships among agents. This paper proposes a hierarchical framework with spatio-temporal consistency learning to solve these two problems by learning the system representation and agent representations, respectively. Spatio-temporal encoders composed of spatial and temporal transformers are designed to capture agents' nonlinear relationships and the system's complex evolution. Agents' and the system's representations are learned to preserve the spatio-temporal consistency by minimizing the spatial and temporal dissimilarities in a self-supervised manner in the latent space. Our method achieves more accurate detection than traditional methods and deep learning methods on three datasets with well-known yet hard-to-detect emergent behaviors. Notably, our hierarchical framework is generic in incorporating other deep learning methods for agent-level and system-level detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, accepted by IEEE TNNLS</p></details> |
| **[DeepMIDE: A Multivariate Spatio-Temporal Method for Ultra-Scale Offshore Wind Energy Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20166v1)** | 2024-10-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To unlock access to stronger winds, the offshore wind industry is advancing with significantly larger and taller wind turbines. This massive upscaling motivates a departure from univariate wind forecasting methods that traditionally focused on a single representative height. To fill this gap, we propose DeepMIDE--a statistical deep learning method which jointly models the offshore wind speeds across space, time, and height. DeepMIDE is formulated as a multi-output integro-difference equation model with a multivariate, nonstationary, and state-dependent kernel characterized by a set of advection vectors that encode the physics of wind field formation and propagation. Embedded within DeepMIDE, an advanced deep learning architecture learns these advection vectors from high dimensional streams of exogenous weather information, which, along with other parameters, are plugged back into the statistical model for probabilistic multi-height space-time forecasting. Tested on real-world data from future offshore wind energy sites in the Northeastern United States, the wind speed and power forecasts from DeepMIDE are shown to outperform those from prevalent time series, spatio-temporal, and deep learning methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Non-stationary Spatio-Temporal Modeling Using the Stochastic Advection-Diffusion Equation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03400v2)** | 2024-10-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We construct flexible spatio-temporal models through stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) where both diffusion and advection can be spatially varying. Computations are done through a Gaussian Markov random field approximation of the solution of the SPDE, which is constructed through a finite volume method. The new flexible non-separable model is compared to a flexible separable model both for reconstruction and forecasting, and evaluated in terms of root mean square errors and continuous rank probability scores. A simulation study demonstrates that the non-separable model performs better when the data is simulated from a non-separable model with diffusion and advection. Further, we estimate surrogate models for emulating the output of a ocean model in Trondheimsfjorden, Norway, and simulate observations of autonomous underwater vehicles. The results show that the flexible non-separable model outperforms the flexible separable model for real-time prediction of unobserved locations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adaptive Spatio-temporal Estimation on the Graph Edges via Line Graph Transformation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00656v3)** | 2024-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal estimation of signals on graph edges is challenging because most conventional Graph Signal Processing techniques are defined on the graph nodes. Leveraging the Line Graph transform, the Line Graph Least Mean Square (LGLMS) algorithm is proposed to conduct adaptive estimation of time-varying edge signals by projecting the edge signals from edge space to node space. LGLMS is an adaptive algorithm analogous to the classical LMS algorithm but applied to graph edges. Unlike edge-specific methods, LGLMS retains all GSP concepts and techniques originally designed for graph nodes, without the need for redefinition on the edges. Experimenting with transportation graphs and meteorological graphs, with the signal observations having noisy and missing values, we confirmed that LGLMS is suitable for the online prediction of time-varying edge signals.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatio-temporal Multivariate Cluster Evolution Analysis for Detecting and Tracking Climate Impacts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16544v1)** | 2024-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent years have seen a growing concern about climate change and its impacts. While Earth System Models (ESMs) can be invaluable tools for studying the impacts of climate change, the complex coupling processes encoded in ESMs and the large amounts of data produced by these models, together with the high internal variability of the Earth system, can obscure important source-to-impact relationships. This paper presents a novel and efficient unsupervised data-driven approach for detecting statistically-significant impacts and tracing spatio-temporal source-impact pathways in the climate through a unique combination of ideas from anomaly detection, clustering and Natural Language Processing (NLP). Using as an exemplar the 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines, we demonstrate that the proposed approach is capable of detecting known post-eruption impacts/events. We additionally describe a methodology for extracting meaningful sequences of post-eruption impacts/events by using NLP to efficiently mine frequent multivariate cluster evolutions, which can be used to confirm or discover the chain of physical processes between a climate source and its impact(s).</p></details> |  |

Similar to Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), high-quality benchmark datasets are of great importance to the advances of SNNs. However, our analysis indicates that many prevalent neuromorphic datasets lack strong temporal correlation, preventing SNNs from fully exploiting their spatio-temporal representation capabilities. Meanwhile, the integration of event and frame modalities offers more comprehensive visual spatio-temporal information. Yet, the SNN-based cross-modality fusion remains underexplored. In this work, we present a neuromorphic dataset called DVS-SLR that can better exploit the inherent spatio-temporal properties of SNNs. Compared to existing datasets, it offers advantages in terms of higher temporal correlation, larger scale, and more varied scenarios. In addition, our neuromorphic dataset contains corresponding frame data, which can be used for developing SNN-based fusion methods. By virtue of the dual-modal feature of the dataset, we propose a Cross-Modality Attention (CMA) based fusion method. The CMA model efficiently utilizes the unique advantages of each modality, allowing for SNNs to learn both temporal and spatial attention scores from the spatio-temporal features of event and frame modalities, subsequently allocating these scores across modalities to enhance their synergy. Experimental results demonstrate that our method not only improves recognition accuracy but also ensures robustness across diverse scenarios.</p></details> |  |

Inevitably, the issue of missing data caused by various disturbances threatens the reliability of data acquisition. Recent studies of diffusion probability models have demonstrated the superiority of deep generative models in imputation tasks by precisely capturing the spatio-temporal correlation of traffic data. One drawback of diffusion models is their slow sampling/denoising process. In this work, we aim to accelerate the imputation process while retaining the performance. We propose a fast conditional diffusion model for spatiotemporal traffic data imputation (FastSTI). To speed up the process yet, obtain better performance, we propose the application of a high-order pseudo-numerical solver. Our method further revs the imputation by introducing a predefined alignment strategy of variance schedule during the sampling process. Evaluating FastSTI on two types of real-world traffic datasets (traffic speed and flow) with different missing data scenarios proves its ability to impute higher-quality samples in only six sampling steps, especially under high missing rates (60\% $\sim$ 90\%). The experimental results illustrate a speed-up of $\textbf{8.3} \times$ faster than the current state-of-the-art model while achieving better performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems for publication.

Existing techniques are often cumbersome, computationally heavy and generally suffer from limitations in wavenumber/frequency response. To address these challenges, we propose Wave (from) Polarized Light Learning (WPLL), a learning based remote sensing method for laboratory implementation, capable of inferring surface elevation and slope maps in high resolution. The method uses the polarization properties of light reflected from the water surface. The WPLL uses a deep neural network (DNN) model that approximates the water surface slopes from the polarized light intensities. Once trained on simple monochromatic wave trains, the WPLL is capable of producing high-resolution and accurate 2D reconstruction of the water surface slopes and elevation in a variety of irregular wave fields. The method's robustness is demonstrated by showcasing its high wavenumber/frequency response, its ability to reconstruct wave fields propagating at arbitrary angles relative to the camera optical axis, and its computational efficiency. This developed methodology is an accurate and cost-effective near-real time remote sensing tool for laboratory water surface waves measurements, setting the path for upscaling to open sea application for research, monitoring, and short-time forecasting.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 17 figures, 5 tables, under review in Applied Ocean Research Journal</p></details> |

To make the cooperation safe for the humans involved, the systems have to follow protocols with rigid real-time and real-space properties, but they also need to be capable of making competitive and collaborative decisions with varying rewards and penalties. Due to these tough requirements, the construction of system control software is often very difficult. This calls for applying a model-based engineering approach, which allows one to formally express the time and space properties and use them as guidance for the whole engineering process from requirement definition via system design to software development. Moreover, it is beneficial, if one can verify with acceptable effort, that the time and space requirements are preserved throughout the development steps. This paper focuses on modelling spatio-temporal properties and their model-checking and simulation using different analysis tools in combination with the methods and tool extensions proposed here.

We present a comprehensive investigation of Graph U-Nets, originally developed for classification tasks, now tailored for mesh-agnostic spatio-temporal forecasting of fluid dynamics. Our focus is on enhancing their performance through systematic hyperparameter tuning and architectural modifications. We propose novel approaches to improve mesh-agnostic spatio-temporal prediction of transient flow fields using Graph U-Nets, enabling accurate prediction on diverse mesh configurations. Key enhancements to the Graph U-Net architecture, including the Gaussian-mixture-model convolutional operator and noise injection approaches, provide increased flexibility in modeling node dynamics: the former reduces prediction error by 95\% compared to conventional convolutional operators, while the latter improves long-term prediction robustness, resulting in an error reduction of 86\%. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these enhancements in both transductive and inductive learning settings, showcasing the adaptability of Graph U-Nets to various flow conditions and mesh structures. This work contributes to the field of reduced-order modeling for computational fluid dynamics by establishing Graph U-Nets as a viable and flexible alternative to convolutional neural networks, capable of accurately and efficiently predicting complex fluid flow phenomena across diverse scenarios.</p></details> |  |

This study aims to develop a methodology for analyzing the occupancy rate from large-scale datasets to identify gaps between supply and demand in public transportation.

The results of the model are examined at both the segment and ride levels. Initially, the analysis focuses on identifying segments more likely associated with undercrowding, understanding factors influencing the probability of undercrowding, and exploring their relationships. Subsequently, the analysis extends to the temporal distribution of undercrowding, encompassing its impact on the entire journey.

Although spatio-temporal graph neural networks have achieved success in modeling various static spatio-temporal forecasting scenarios, real-world spatio-temporal data are typically received in a streaming manner, and the network continuously expands with the installation of new sensors. Thus, spatio-temporal forecasting in streaming scenarios faces dual challenges: the inefficiency of retraining models over newly arrived data and the detrimental effects of catastrophic forgetting over long-term history. To address these challenges, we propose a novel prompt tuning-based continuous forecasting method, following two fundamental tuning principles guided by empirical and theoretical analysis: expand and compress, which effectively resolve the aforementioned problems with lightweight tuning parameters. Specifically, we integrate the base spatio-temporal graph neural network with a continuous prompt pool, utilizing stored prompts (i.e., few learnable parameters) in memory, and jointly optimize them with the base spatio-temporal graph neural network. This method ensures that the model sequentially learns from the spatio-temporal data stream to accomplish tasks for corresponding periods. Extensive experimental results on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate the multi-faceted superiority of our method over the state-of-the-art baselines, including effectiveness, efficiency, universality, etc.</p></details> |  |

Accurate forecasting of nuclear radiation levels is crucial for informed decision-making by both individuals and governments. However, this task is challenging due to the imbalanced distribution of monitoring stations over a wide spatial range and the non-stationary radiation variation patterns. In this study, we introduce NRFormer, an innovative framework tailored for national-wide prediction of nuclear radiation variations. By integrating a non-stationary temporal attention module, an imbalance-aware spatial attention module, and a radiation propagation prompting module, NRFormer collectively captures complex spatio-temporal dynamics of nuclear radiation. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed framework against seven baselines. This research not only enhances the accuracy and reliability in nuclear radiation forecasting but also contributes to advancing emergency response strategies and monitoring systems, thereby safeguarding environmental and public health.</p></details> |  |

In the human language system, experimental studies have observed clusters for syntactic and semantic categories, but the mechanisms underlying this functional organization remain unclear. Here, building on work from the vision literature, we develop TopoLM, a transformer language model with an explicit two-dimensional spatial representation of model units. By combining a next-token prediction objective with a spatial smoothness loss, representations in this model assemble into clusters that correspond to semantically interpretable groupings of text and closely match the functional organization in the brain's language system. TopoLM successfully predicts the emergence of the spatio-functional organization of a cortical language system as well as the organization of functional clusters selective for fine-grained linguistic features empirically observed in human cortex. Our results suggest that the functional organization of the human language system is driven by a unified spatial objective, and provide a functionally and spatially aligned model of language processing in the brain.</p></details> |  |

However, the restricted capturing devices and transmission bandwidth lead to the low resolution of ODVs. Video super-resolution (VSR) methods are proposed to enhance the resolution of videos, but ODV projection distortions in the application are not well addressed directly applying such methods. To achieve better super-resolution reconstruction quality, we propose a novel Spatio-Temporal Distortion Aware Network (STDAN) oriented to ODV characteristics. Specifically, a spatio-temporal distortion modulation module is introduced to improve spatial ODV projection distortions and exploit the temporal correlation according to intra and inter alignments. Next, we design a multi-frame reconstruction and fusion mechanism to refine the consistency of reconstructed ODV frames. Furthermore, we incorporate latitude-saliency adaptive maps in the loss function to concentrate on important viewpoint regions with higher texture complexity and human-watching interest. In addition, we collect a new ODV-SR dataset with various scenarios.

| **[MoChat: Joints-Grouped Spatio-Temporal Grounding LLM for Multi-Turn Motion Comprehension and Description](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11404v1)** | 2024-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite continuous advancements in deep learning for understanding human motion, existing models often struggle to accurately identify action timing and specific body parts, typically supporting only single-round interaction. Such limitations in capturing fine-grained motion details reduce their effectiveness in motion understanding tasks. In this paper, we propose MoChat, a multimodal large language model capable of spatio-temporal grounding of human motion and understanding multi-turn dialogue context. To achieve these capabilities, we group the spatial information of each skeleton frame based on human anatomical structure and then apply them with Joints-Grouped Skeleton Encoder, whose outputs are combined with LLM embeddings to create spatio-aware and temporal-aware embeddings separately. Additionally, we develop a pipeline for extracting timestamps from skeleton sequences based on textual annotations, and construct multi-turn dialogues for spatially grounding. Finally, various task instructions are generated for jointly training. Experimental results demonstrate that MoChat achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple metrics in motion understanding tasks, making it as the first model capable of fine-grained spatio-temporal grounding of human motion.</p></details> |  |
| **[Echo State Networks for Spatio-Temporal Area-Level Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10641v1)** | 2024-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal area-level datasets play a critical role in official statistics, providing valuable insights for policy-making and regional planning. Accurate modeling and forecasting of these datasets can be extremely useful for policymakers to develop informed strategies for future planning. Echo State Networks (ESNs) are efficient methods for capturing nonlinear temporal dynamics and generating forecasts. However, ESNs lack a direct mechanism to account for the neighborhood structure inherent in area-level data. Ignoring these spatial relationships can significantly compromise the accuracy and utility of forecasts. In this paper, we incorporate approximate graph spectral filters at the input stage of the ESN, thereby improving forecast accuracy while preserving the model's computational efficiency during training. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach using Eurostat's tourism occupancy dataset and show how it can support more informed decision-making in policy and planning contexts.</p></details> | 23 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Get Rid of Task Isolation: A Continuous Multi-task Spatio-Temporal Learning Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10524v1)** | 2024-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatiotemporal learning has become a pivotal technique to enable urban intelligence. Traditional spatiotemporal models mostly focus on a specific task by assuming a same distribution between training and testing sets. However, given that urban systems are usually dynamic, multi-sourced with imbalanced data distributions, current specific task-specific models fail to generalize to new urban conditions and adapt to new domains without explicitly modeling interdependencies across various dimensions and types of urban data. To this end, we argue that there is an essential to propose a Continuous Multi-task Spatio-Temporal learning framework (CMuST) to empower collective urban intelligence, which reforms the urban spatiotemporal learning from single-domain to cooperatively multi-dimensional and multi-task learning. Specifically, CMuST proposes a new multi-dimensional spatiotemporal interaction network (MSTI) to allow cross-interactions between context and main observations as well as self-interactions within spatial and temporal aspects to be exposed, which is also the core for capturing task-level commonality and personalization. To ensure continuous task learning, a novel Rolling Adaptation training scheme (RoAda) is devised, which not only preserves task uniqueness by constructing data summarization-driven task prompts, but also harnesses correlated patterns among tasks by iterative model behavior modeling. We further establish a benchmark of three cities for multi-task spatiotemporal learning, and empirically demonstrate the superiority of CMuST via extensive evaluations on these datasets. The impressive improvements on both few-shot streaming data and new domain tasks against existing SOAT methods are achieved. Code is available at https://github.com/DILab-USTCSZ/CMuST.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |
| **[Graph Masked Autoencoder for Spatio-Temporal Graph Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10915v1)** | 2024-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Effective spatio-temporal prediction frameworks play a crucial role in urban sensing applications, including traffic analysis, human mobility behavior modeling, and citywide crime prediction. However, the presence of data noise and label sparsity in spatio-temporal data presents significant challenges for existing neural network models in learning effective and robust region representations. To address these challenges, we propose a novel spatio-temporal graph masked autoencoder paradigm that explores generative self-supervised learning for effective spatio-temporal data augmentation. Our proposed framework introduces a spatial-temporal heterogeneous graph neural encoder that captures region-wise dependencies from heterogeneous data sources, enabling the modeling of diverse spatial dependencies. In our spatio-temporal self-supervised learning paradigm, we incorporate a masked autoencoding mechanism on node representations and structures. This mechanism automatically distills heterogeneous spatio-temporal dependencies across regions over time, enhancing the learning process of dynamic region-wise spatial correlations. To validate the effectiveness of our STGMAE framework, we conduct extensive experiments on various spatio-temporal mining tasks. We compare our approach against state-of-the-art baselines. The results of these evaluations demonstrate the superiority of our proposed framework in terms of performance and its ability to address the challenges of spatial and temporal data noise and sparsity in practical urban sensing scenarios.</p></details> | 12 pages |

Our focus lies in the parametric estimation of its intensity function, incorporating both spatial factors (such as altitude) and spatio-temporal covariates (such as field temperature, precipitation, etc.). The events are observed in France over a span of three years. Spatio-temporal covariates are observed with resolution $0.1^\circ \times 0.1^\circ$ ($\approx 100$km$^2$) and six-hour periods. This results in an extensive dataset, further characterized by a significant excess of zeroes (i.e., spatio-temporal cells with no observed events). We reexamine composite likelihood methods commonly employed for spatial point processes, especially in situations where covariates are piecewise constant. Additionally, we extend these methods to account for zero-deflated subsampling, a strategy involving dependent subsampling, with a focus on selecting more cells in regions where events are observed. A simulation study is conducted to illustrate these novel methodologies, followed by their application to the dataset of lightning strikes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Gridded Transformer Neural Processes for Large Unstructured Spatio-Temporal Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06731v2)** | 2024-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many important problems require modelling large-scale spatio-temporal datasets, with one prevalent example being weather forecasting. Recently, transformer-based approaches have shown great promise in a range of weather forecasting problems. However, these have mostly focused on gridded data sources, neglecting the wealth of unstructured, off-the-grid data from observational measurements such as those at weather stations. A promising family of models suitable for such tasks are neural processes (NPs), notably the family of transformer neural processes (TNPs). Although TNPs have shown promise on small spatio-temporal datasets, they are unable to scale to the quantities of data used by state-of-the-art weather and climate models. This limitation stems from their lack of efficient attention mechanisms. We address this shortcoming through the introduction of gridded pseudo-token TNPs which employ specialised encoders and decoders to handle unstructured observations and utilise a processor containing gridded pseudo-tokens that leverage efficient attention mechanisms. Our method consistently outperforms a range of strong baselines on various synthetic and real-world regression tasks involving large-scale data, while maintaining competitive computational efficiency. The real-life experiments are performed on weather data, demonstrating the potential of our approach to bring performance and computational benefits when applied at scale in a weather modelling pipeline.</p></details> |  |
| **[LSTM networks provide efficient cyanobacterial blooms forecasting even with incomplete spatio-temporal data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08237v1)** | 2024-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cyanobacteria are the most frequent dominant species of algal blooms in inland waters, threatening ecosystem function and water quality, especially when toxin-producing strains predominate. Enhanced by anthropogenic activities and global warming, cyanobacterial blooms are expected to increase in frequency and global distribution. Early warning systems (EWS) for cyanobacterial blooms development allow timely implementation of management measures, reducing the risks associated to these blooms. In this paper, we propose an effective EWS for cyanobacterial bloom forecasting, which uses 6 years of incomplete high-frequency spatio-temporal data from multiparametric probes, including phycocyanin (PC) fluorescence as a proxy for cyanobacteria. A probe agnostic and replicable method is proposed to pre-process the data and to generate time series specific for cyanobacterial bloom forecasting. Using these pre-processed data, six different non-site/species-specific predictive models were compared including the autoregressive and multivariate versions of Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Long-Term Short-Term (LSTM) neural networks. Results were analyzed for seven forecasting time horizons ranging from 4 to 28 days evaluated with a hybrid system that combined regression metrics (MSE, R2, MAPE) for PC values, classification metrics (Accuracy, F1, Kappa) for a proposed alarm level of 10 ug PC/L, and a forecasting-specific metric to measure prediction improvement over the displaced signal (skill). The multivariate version of LSTM showed the best and most consistent results across all forecasting horizons and metrics, achieving accuracies of up to 90% in predicting the proposed PC alarm level. Additionally, positive skill values indicated its outstanding effectiveness to forecast cyanobacterial blooms from 16 to 28 days in advance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning from Spatio-temporal Correlation for Semi-Supervised LiDAR Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06893v1)** | 2024-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We address the challenges of the semi-supervised LiDAR segmentation (SSLS) problem, particularly in low-budget scenarios. The two main issues in low-budget SSLS are the poor-quality pseudo-labels for unlabeled data, and the performance drops due to the significant imbalance between ground-truth and pseudo-labels. This imbalance leads to a vicious training cycle. To overcome these challenges, we leverage the spatio-temporal prior by recognizing the substantial overlap between temporally adjacent LiDAR scans. We propose a proximity-based label estimation, which generates highly accurate pseudo-labels for unlabeled data by utilizing semantic consistency with adjacent labeled data. Additionally, we enhance this method by progressively expanding the pseudo-labels from the nearest unlabeled scans, which helps significantly reduce errors linked to dynamic classes. Additionally, we employ a dual-branch structure to mitigate performance degradation caused by data imbalance. Experimental results demonstrate remarkable performance in low-budget settings (i.e., <= 5%) and meaningful improvements in normal budget settings (i.e., 5 - 50%). Finally, our method has achieved new state-of-the-art results on SemanticKITTI and nuScenes in semi-supervised LiDAR segmentation. With only 5% labeled data, it offers competitive results against fully-supervised counterparts. Moreover, it surpasses the performance of the previous state-of-the-art at 100% labeled data (75.2%) using only 20% of labeled data (76.0%) on nuScenes. The code is available on https://github.com/halbielee/PLE.</p></details> |  |

By leveraging real-time environmental data, JC\&S improves resource allocation, reduces latency, and enhances power efficiency, while also supporting simulations and predictive modeling. This makes it a key technology for reactive systems and digital twins. These systems can respond to environmental events in real-time, offering transformative potential in sectors like smart cities, healthcare, and Industry 5.0, where adaptive and multimodal interaction is critical to enhance real-time decision-making. In this work, we present a transformer-based architecture that processes temporal Channel State Information (CSI) data, specifically amplitude and phase, to generate 3D point clouds of indoor environments. The model utilizes a multi-head attention to capture complex spatio-temporal relationships in CSI data and is adaptable to different CSI configurations. We evaluate the architecture on the MM-Fi dataset, using two different protocols to capture human presence in indoor environments. The system demonstrates strong potential for accurate 3D reconstructions and effectively distinguishes between close and distant objects, advancing JC\&S applications for spatial sensing in future wireless networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 5 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

Different from the common penalty-based approach, this work promotes adherence to the underlying physical mechanism that facilitates statistical procedures. The motivating application concerns modeling fluorescence recovery after photobleaching, which is used for characterization of diffusion processes. We propose a physics-encoded regression model for handling spatio-temporally distributed data, which enables principled interpretability, parsimonious computation and efficient estimation by exploiting the structure of solutions of a governing evolution equation. The rate of convergence attaining the minimax optimality is theoretically demonstrated, generalizing the result obtained for the spatial regression. We conduct simulation studies to assess the performance of our proposed estimator and illustrate its usage in the aforementioned real data example.</p></details> |  |
| **[Language Model Empowered Spatio-Temporal Forecasting via Physics-Aware Reprogramming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14505v2)** | 2024-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal forecasting is pivotal in numerous real-world applications, including transportation planning, energy management, and climate monitoring. In this work, we aim to harness the reasoning and generalization abilities of Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) for more effective spatio-temporal forecasting, particularly in data-scarce scenarios. However, recent studies uncover that PLMs, which are primarily trained on textual data, often falter when tasked with modeling the intricate correlations in numerical time series, thereby limiting their effectiveness in comprehending spatio-temporal data. To bridge the gap, we propose RePST, a physics-aware PLM reprogramming framework tailored for spatio-temporal forecasting. Specifically, we first propose a physics-aware decomposer that adaptively disentangles spatially correlated time series into interpretable sub-components, which facilitates PLM to understand sophisticated spatio-temporal dynamics via a divide-and-conquer strategy. Moreover, we propose a selective discrete reprogramming scheme, which introduces an expanded spatio-temporal vocabulary space to project spatio-temporal series into discrete representations. This scheme minimizes the information loss during reprogramming and enriches the representations derived by PLMs. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that the proposed RePST outperforms twelve state-of-the-art baseline methods, particularly in data-scarce scenarios, highlighting the effectiveness and superior generalization capabilities of PLMs for spatio-temporal forecasting.</p></details> |  |

However, multimedia technology for contact interaction is less mature than non-contact multimedia technologies and requires further development. Specialized haptic media technologies, requiring low latency and bitrates, are essential to enable haptic interaction, necessitating haptic information compression. Existing vibrotactile signal compression methods, based on the perceptual model, do not consider the characteristics of fused tactile perception at multiple spatially distributed interaction points. In fact, differences in tactile perceptual importance are not limited to conventional frequency and time domains, but also encompass differences in the spatial locations on the skin unique to tactile perception. For the most frequently used tactile information, vibrotactile texture perception, we have developed a model to predict its perceptual importance at multiple points, based on self-supervised learning and Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Network. Current experimental results indicate that this model can effectively predict the perceptual importance of various points in multi-point tactile perception scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a conference paper at Eurohaptics 2024</p></details> |
| **[Fast spatio-temporally varying coefficient modeling with reluctant interaction selection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07229v1)** | 2024-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatially and temporally varying coefficient (STVC) models are currently attracting attention as a flexible tool to explore the spatio-temporal patterns in regression coefficients. However, these models often struggle with balancing computational efficiency and model flexibility. To address this challenge, this study develops a fast and flexible method for STVC modeling. For enhanced flexibility in modeling, we assume multiple processes in each varying coefficient, including purely spatial, purely temporal, and spatio-temporal interaction processes with or without time cyclicity. While considering multiple processes can be time consuming, we combine a pre-conditioning method with a model selection procedure, inspired by reluctant interaction modeling. This approach allows us to computationally efficiently select and specify the latent space-time structure. Monte Carlo experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms alternatives in terms of coefficient estimation accuracy and computational efficiency. Finally, we apply the proposed method to crime analysis using a sample size of 279,360, confirming that the proposed method provides reasonable estimates of varying coefficients. The STVC model is implemented in an R package spmoran.</p></details> |  |

Effective monitoring of transformer health is critical to maintain grid stability and performance. Thermal insulation ageing is a key transformer failure mode, which is generally tracked by monitoring the hotspot temperature (HST). However, HST measurement is complex, costly, and often estimated from indirect measurements. Existing HST models focus on space-agnostic thermal models, providing worst-case HST estimates. This article introduces a spatio-temporal model for transformer winding temperature and ageing estimation, which leverages physics-based partial differential equations (PDEs) with data-driven Neural Networks (NN) in a Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) configuration to improve prediction accuracy and acquire spatio-temporal resolution. The computational accuracy of the PINN model is improved through the implementation of the Residual-Based Attention (PINN-RBA) scheme that accelerates the PINN model convergence. The PINN-RBA model is benchmarked against self-adaptive attention schemes and classical vanilla PINN configurations. For the first time, PINN based oil temperature predictions are used to estimate spatio-temporal transformer winding temperature values, validated through PDE numerical solution and fiber optic sensor measurements. Furthermore, the spatio-temporal transformer ageing model is inferred, which supports transformer health management decision-making. Results are validated with a distribution transformer operating on a floating photovoltaic power plant.</p></details> | 23 pages, 18 figures |

This allows for modeling non-linearities and interactions among predictor variables in a flexible data-driven manner and for accounting for spatio-temporal variation that is not explained by observable predictor variables. We also show how estimation and prediction can be done in a computationally efficient manner. In an application to a large U.S. mortgage credit risk data set, we find that both predictive default probabilities for individual loans and predictive loan portfolio loss distributions obtained with our novel approach are more accurate compared to conventional independent linear hazard models and also linear spatio-temporal models. Using interpretability tools for machine learning models, we find that the likely reasons for this outperformance are strong interaction and non-linear effects in the predictor variables and the presence of large spatio-temporal frailty effects.</p></details> |  |

Severity is often measured by the Mayo Endoscopic Subscore (MES) and Ulcerative Colitis Endoscopic Index of Severity (UCEIS) score. However, expert MES/UCEIS annotation is time-consuming and susceptible to inter-rater variability, factors addressable by automation. Automation attempts with frame-level labels face challenges in fully-supervised solutions due to the prevalence of video-level labels in clinical trials. CNN-based weakly-supervised models (WSL) with end-to-end (e2e) training lack generalization to new disease scores and ignore spatio-temporal information crucial for accurate scoring. To address these limitations, we propose "Arges", a deep learning framework that utilizes a transformer with positional encoding to incorporate spatio-temporal information from frame features to estimate disease severity scores in endoscopy video. Extracted features are derived from a foundation model (ArgesFM), pre-trained on a large diverse dataset from multiple clinical trials (61M frames, 3927 videos). We evaluate four UC disease severity scores, including MES and three UCEIS component scores. Test set evaluation indicates significant improvements, with F1 scores increasing by 4.1% for MES and 18.8%, 6.6%, 3.8% for the three UCEIS component scores compared to state-of-the-art methods. Prospective validation on previously unseen clinical trial data further demonstrates the model's successful generalization.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 2 figures, 5 tables, accepted at MLMI, MICCAI</p></details> |
| **[Towards Unifying Diffusion Models for Probabilistic Spatio-Temporal Graph Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17360v2)** | 2024-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal graph learning is a fundamental problem in modern urban systems. Existing approaches tackle different tasks independently, tailoring their models to unique task characteristics. These methods, however, fall short of modeling intrinsic uncertainties in the spatio-temporal data. Meanwhile, their specialized designs misalign with the current research efforts toward unifying spatio-temporal graph learning solutions. In this paper, we propose to model these tasks in a unified probabilistic perspective, viewing them as predictions based on conditional information with shared dependencies. Based on this proposal, we introduce Unified Spatio-Temporal Diffusion Models (USTD) to address the tasks uniformly under the uncertainty-aware diffusion framework. USTD is holistically designed, comprising a shared spatio-temporal encoder and attention-based denoising decoders that are task-specific. The encoder, optimized by pre-training strategies, effectively captures conditional spatio-temporal patterns. The decoders, utilizing attention mechanisms, generate predictions by leveraging learned patterns. Opting for forecasting and kriging, the decoders are designed as Spatial Gated Attention (SGA) and Temporal Gated Attention (TGA) for each task, with different emphases on the spatial and temporal dimensions. Combining the advantages of deterministic encoders and probabilistic decoders, USTD achieves state-of-the-art performances compared to both deterministic and probabilistic baselines, while also providing valuable uncertainty estimates.</p></details> |  |

Our proposed method applies DETR to each frame and uses feature shift to incorporate temporal information. However, DETR's object queries in each frame may correspond to different objects, making a simple feature shift ineffective. To overcome this issue, we propose query matching across different frames, ensuring that queries for the same object are matched and used for the feature shift. Experimental results show that performance on the JHMDB21 dataset improves significantly when query features are shifted using the proposed query matching.</p></details> |  |

The algorithm is capable of safely tracking a time-varying safe region without the need for explicit change detection. Optimality guarantees are also provided for the algorithm when the optimization problem becomes stationary. We show that TVSafeOpt compares favorably against SafeOpt on synthetic data, both regarding safety and optimality. Evaluation on a realistic case study with gas compressors confirms that TVSafeOpt ensures safety when solving time-varying optimization problems with unknown reward and safety functions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |

Existing RGB-E tracking methods model event characteristics utilising attention mechanism of Transformer before integrating both modalities. Nevertheless, these methods involve aggregating the event stream into a single event frame, lacking the utilisation of the temporal information inherent in the event stream.Moreover, the traditional attention mechanism is well-suited for dense semantic features, while the attention mechanism for sparse event features require revolution. In this paper, we propose a dynamic event subframe splitting strategy to split the event stream into more fine-grained event clusters, aiming to capture spatio-temporal features that contain motion cues. Based on this, we design an event-based sparse attention mechanism to enhance the interaction of event features in temporal and spatial dimensions. The experimental results indicate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on the FE240 and COESOT datasets, providing an effective processing manner for the event data.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 8 figures, conference</p></details> |

This paper introduces SEA-ViT, an advanced deep learning model that integrates Vision Transformer (ViT) with bidirectional Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) to capture spatio-temporal covariance for predicting sea surface currents (U, V) using high-frequency radar (HF) data. The name SEA-ViT is derived from ``Sea Surface Currents Forecasting using Vision Transformer,'' highlighting the model's emphasis on ocean dynamics and its use of the ViT architecture to enhance forecasting capabilities. SEA-ViT is designed to unravel complex dependencies by leveraging a rich dataset spanning over 30 years and incorporating ENSO indices (El Ni\~no, La Ni\~na, and neutral phases) to address the intricate relationship between geographic coordinates and climatic variations. This development enhances the predictive capabilities for sea surface currents, supporting the efforts of the Geo-Informatics and Space Technology Development Agency (GISTDA) in Thailand's maritime regions.

Recently, several automated spatio-temporal forecasting methods have been proposed to automatically search the optimal neural network architecture for capturing complex spatio-temporal dependencies. However, the existing automated approaches suffer from expensive neural architecture search overhead, which hinders their practical use and the further exploration of diverse spatio-temporal operators in a finer granularity. In this paper, we propose AutoSTF, a decoupled automatic neural architecture search framework for cost-effective automated spatio-temporal forecasting. From the efficiency perspective, we first decouple the mixed search space into temporal space and spatial space and respectively devise representation compression and parameter-sharing schemes to mitigate the parameter explosion. The decoupled spatio-temporal search not only expedites the model optimization process but also leaves new room for more effective spatio-temporal dependency modeling. From the effectiveness perspective, we propose a multi-patch transfer module to jointly capture multi-granularity temporal dependencies and extend the spatial search space to enable finer-grained layer-wise spatial dependency search. Extensive experiments on eight datasets demonstrate the superiority of AutoSTF in terms of both accuracy and efficiency. Specifically, our proposed method achieves up to 13.48x speed-up compared to state-of-the-art automatic spatio-temporal forecasting methods while maintaining the best forecasting accuracy.</p></details> | 16 pages, 13 figures |
| **[Automated Spatio-Temporal Weather Modeling for Load Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16326v1)** | 2024-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Electricity is difficult to store, except at prohibitive cost, and therefore the balance between generation and load must be maintained at all times. Electricity is traditionally managed by anticipating demand and intermittent production (wind, solar) and matching flexible production (hydro, nuclear, coal and gas). Accurate forecasting of electricity load and renewable production is therefore essential to ensure grid performance and stability. Both are highly dependent on meteorological variables (temperature, wind, sunshine). These dependencies are complex and difficult to model. On the one hand, spatial variations do not have a uniform impact because population, industry, and wind and solar farms are not evenly distributed across the territory. On the other hand, temporal variations can have delayed effects on load (due to the thermal inertia of buildings). With access to observations from different weather stations and simulated data from meteorological models, we believe that both phenomena can be modeled together. In today's state-of-the-art load forecasting models, the spatio-temporal modeling of the weather is fixed. In this work, we aim to take advantage of the automated representation and spatio-temporal feature extraction capabilities of deep neural networks to improve spatio-temporal weather modeling for load forecasting. We compare our deep learning-based methodology with the state-of-the-art on French national load. This methodology could also be fully adapted to forecasting renewable energy production.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatio-Temporal Motion Retargeting for Quadruped Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11557v2)** | 2024-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work introduces a motion retargeting approach for legged robots, which aims to create motion controllers that imitate the fine behavior of animals. Our approach, namely spatio-temporal motion retargeting (STMR), guides imitation learning procedures by transferring motion from source to target, effectively bridging the morphological disparities by ensuring the feasibility of imitation on the target system. Our STMR method comprises two components: spatial motion retargeting (SMR) and temporal motion retargeting (TMR). On the one hand, SMR tackles motion retargeting at the kinematic level by generating kinematically feasible whole-body motions from keypoint trajectories. On the other hand, TMR aims to retarget motion at the dynamic level by optimizing motion in the temporal domain. We showcase the effectiveness of our method in facilitating Imitation Learning (IL) for complex animal movements through a series of simulation and hardware experiments. In these experiments, our STMR method successfully tailored complex animal motions from various media, including video captured by a hand-held camera, to fit the morphology and physical properties of the target robots. This enabled RL policy training for precise motion tracking, while baseline methods struggled with highly dynamic motion involving flying phases. Moreover, we validated that the control policy can successfully imitate six different motions in two quadruped robots with different dimensions and physical properties in real-world settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>34 pa...</summary><p>34 pages, 7 figures, videos available at https://terry97-guel.github.io/STMR-RL.github.io/</p></details> |

Traditional rPPG models often struggle with poor generalization capacity in unseen domains. Current solutions to this problem is to improve its generalization in the target domain through Domain Generalization (DG) or Domain Adaptation (DA). However, both traditional methods require access to both source domain data and target domain data, which cannot be implemented in scenarios with limited access to source data, and another issue is the privacy of accessing source domain data. In this paper, we propose the first Source-free Domain Adaptation benchmark for rPPG measurement (SFDA-rPPG), which overcomes these limitations by enabling effective domain adaptation without access to source domain data. Our framework incorporates a Three-Branch Spatio-Temporal Consistency Network (TSTC-Net) to enhance feature consistency across domains. Furthermore, we propose a new rPPG distribution alignment loss based on the Frequency-domain Wasserstein Distance (FWD), which leverages optimal transport to align power spectrum distributions across domains effectively and further enforces the alignment of the three branches. Extensive cross-domain experiments and ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method in source-free domain adaptation settings. Our findings highlight the significant contribution of the proposed FWD loss for distributional alignment, providing a valuable reference for future research and applications.

| **[EventAug: Multifaceted Spatio-Temporal Data Augmentation Methods for Event-based Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11813v1)** | 2024-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The event camera has demonstrated significant success across a wide range of areas due to its low time latency and high dynamic range. However, the community faces challenges such as data deficiency and limited diversity, often resulting in over-fitting and inadequate feature learning. Notably, the exploration of data augmentation techniques in the event community remains scarce. This work aims to address this gap by introducing a systematic augmentation scheme named EventAug to enrich spatial-temporal diversity. In particular, we first propose Multi-scale Temporal Integration (MSTI) to diversify the motion speed of objects, then introduce Spatial-salient Event Mask (SSEM) and Temporal-salient Event Mask (TSEM) to enrich object variants. Our EventAug can facilitate models learning with richer motion patterns, object variants and local spatio-temporal relations, thus improving model robustness to varied moving speeds, occlusions, and action disruptions. Experiment results show that our augmentation method consistently yields significant improvements across different tasks and backbones (e.g., a 4.87% accuracy gain on DVS128 Gesture). Our code will be publicly available for this community.</p></details> |  |

The proposed model can simplify the parameterization by using network structure in data, and can capture the asymmetric property in dynamic volatility by adopting a threshold structure. The proposed model assumes the conditional distribution is Poisson distribution. Asymptotic theory of maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) for the spatial model is derived when both sample size and network dimension are large. We obtain asymptotic statistical inferences via investigation of the weak dependence of components of the model and application of limit theorems for weakly dependent random fields. Simulation studies and a real data example are presented to support our methodology.</p></details> |  |
| **[STCMOT: Spatio-Temporal Cohesion Learning for UAV-Based Multiple Object Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11234v1)** | 2024-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiple object tracking (MOT) in Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) videos is important for diverse applications in computer vision. Current MOT trackers rely on accurate object detection results and precise matching of target reidentification (ReID). These methods focus on optimizing target spatial attributes while overlooking temporal cues in modelling object relationships, especially for challenging tracking conditions such as object deformation and blurring, etc. To address the above-mentioned issues, we propose a novel Spatio-Temporal Cohesion Multiple Object Tracking framework (STCMOT), which utilizes historical embedding features to model the representation of ReID and detection features in a sequential order. Concretely, a temporal embedding boosting module is introduced to enhance the discriminability of individual embedding based on adjacent frame cooperation. While the trajectory embedding is then propagated by a temporal detection refinement module to mine salient target locations in the temporal field. Extensive experiments on the VisDrone2019 and UAVDT datasets demonstrate our STCMOT sets a new state-of-the-art performance in MOTA and IDF1 metrics.

| **[Spatio-Temporal-Network Point Processes for Modeling Crime Events with Landmarks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10882v1)** | 2024-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-exciting point processes are widely used to model the contagious effects of crime events living within continuous geographic space, using their occurrence time and locations. However, in urban environments, most events are naturally constrained within the city's street network structure, and the contagious effects of crime are governed by such a network geography. Meanwhile, the complex distribution of urban infrastructures also plays an important role in shaping crime patterns across space. We introduce a novel spatio-temporal-network point process framework for crime modeling that integrates these urban environmental characteristics by incorporating self-attention graph neural networks. Our framework incorporates the street network structure as the underlying event space, where crime events can occur at random locations on the network edges. To realistically capture criminal movement patterns, distances between events are measured using street network distances. We then propose a new mark for a crime event by concatenating the event's crime category with the type of its nearby landmark, aiming to capture how the urban design influences the mixing structures of various crime types. A graph attention network architecture is adopted to learn the existence of mark-to-mark interactions. Extensive experiments on crime data from Valencia, Spain, demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in understanding the crime landscape and forecasting crime risks across regions.</p></details> |  |

While limiting the variety of training data can make training easier, it can also lead to a lack of knowledge and information for the model, resulting in a decrease in performance. To address this challenge, we presented an innovative paradigm that incorporates three separate forms of curriculum learning specifically targeting from spatial, temporal, and quantile perspectives. Furthermore, our framework incorporates a stacking fusion module to combine diverse information from three types of curriculum learning, resulting in a strong and thorough learning process. We demonstrated the effectiveness of this framework with extensive empirical evaluations, highlighting its better performance in addressing complex ST challenges. We provided thorough ablation studies to investigate the effectiveness of our curriculum and to explain how it contributes to the improvement of learning efficiency on ST data.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accept by sigspatial 2024</p></details> |

Specifically, we consider the global task as a conjunction of independent and collaborative tasks, defined over the absolute and relative states of agent pairs. Task dependencies in this form are then represented by a task graph, which we assume to be acyclic. From the given task graph, we provide an algorithmic approach to define a distributed sampled-data controller prioritizing the fulfilment of collaborative tasks as the primary objective, while fulfilling independent tasks unless they conflict with collaborative ones. Moreover, communication maintenance among collaborating agents is seamlessly enforced within the proposed control framework.

However, scalability and generalization challenges remain significant obstacles. Advanced models often rely on Graph Neural Networks to encode spatial and temporal correlations, but struggle with the increased complexity of large-scale datasets. The recursive GNN-based message passing schemes used in these models hinder their training and deployment in real-life urban sensing scenarios. Moreover, long-spanning large-scale spatio-temporal data introduce distribution shifts, necessitating improved generalization performance. To address these challenges, we propose a simple framework for spatio-temporal prediction - EasyST paradigm. It learns lightweight and robust Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) by effectively distilling knowledge from complex spatio-temporal GNNs. We ensure robust knowledge distillation by integrating the spatio-temporal information bottleneck with teacher-bounded regression loss, filtering out task-irrelevant noise and avoiding erroneous guidance. We further enhance the generalization ability of the student model by incorporating spatial and temporal prompts to provide downstream task contexts. Evaluation on three spatio-temporal datasets for urban computing tasks demonstrates that EasyST surpasses state-of-the-art approaches in terms of efficiency and accuracy. The implementation code is available at: https://github.com/HKUDS/EasyST.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CIKM'2024, full paper</p></details> |
| **[A general reduced-order neural operator for spatio-temporal predictive learning on complex spatial domains](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05508v1)** | 2024-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predictive learning for spatio-temporal processes (PL-STP) on complex spatial domains plays a critical role in various scientific and engineering fields, with its essence being the construction of operators between infinite-dimensional function spaces. This paper focuses on the unequal-domain mappings in PL-STP and categorising them into increase-domain and decrease-domain mapping. Recent advances in deep learning have revealed the great potential of neural operators (NOs) to learn operators directly from observational data. However, existing NOs require input space and output space to be the same domain, which pose challenges in ensuring predictive accuracy and stability for unequal-domain mappings. To this end, this study presents a general reduced-order neural operator named Reduced-Order Neural Operator on Riemannian Manifolds (RO-NORM), which consists of two parts: the unequal-domain encoder/decoder and the same-domain approximator. Motivated by the variable separation in classical modal decomposition, the unequal-domain encoder/decoder uses the pre-computed bases to reformulate the spatio-temporal function as a sum of products between spatial (or temporal) bases and corresponding temporally (or spatially) distributed weight functions, thus the original unequal-domain mapping can be converted into a same-domain mapping. Consequently, the same-domain approximator NORM is applied to model the transformed mapping. The performance of our proposed method has been evaluated on six benchmark cases, including parametric PDEs, engineering and biomedical applications, and compared with four baseline algorithms: DeepONet, POD-DeepONet, PCA-Net, and vanilla NORM. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of RO-NORM in prediction accuracy and training efficiency for PL-STP.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Spatio-Temporal Attention-Based Method for Detecting Student Classroom Behaviors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02523v4)** | 2024-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurately detecting student behavior from classroom videos is beneficial for analyzing their classroom status and improving teaching efficiency. However, low accuracy in student classroom behavior detection is a prevalent issue. To address this issue, we propose a Spatio-Temporal Attention-Based Method for Detecting Student Classroom Behaviors (BDSTA). Firstly, the SlowFast network is used to generate motion and environmental information feature maps from the video. Then, the spatio-temporal attention module is applied to the feature maps, including information aggregation, compression and stimulation processes. Subsequently, attention maps in the time, channel and space dimensions are obtained, and multi-label behavior classification is performed based on these attention maps. To solve the long-tail data problem that exists in student classroom behavior datasets, we use an improved focal loss function to assign more weight to the tail class data during training. Experimental results are conducted on a self-made student classroom behavior dataset named STSCB. Compared with the SlowFast model, the average accuracy of student behavior classification detection improves by 8.94\% using BDSTA.</p></details> |  |

However, the lack of publicly available spatio-temporal datasets on student behavior, as well as the high cost of manually labeling such datasets, pose significant challenges for researchers in this field. To address this issue, we proposed a method for extending the spatio-temporal behavior dataset in Student Classroom Scenarios (SCB-ST-Dataset4) through image dataset. Our SCB-ST-Dataset4 comprises 757265 images with 25810 labels, focusing on 3 behaviors: hand-raising, reading, writing. Our proposed method can rapidly generate spatio-temporal behavior datasets without requiring extra manual labeling. Furthermore, we proposed a Behavior Similarity Index (BSI) to explore the similarity of behaviors. We evaluated the dataset using the YOLOv5, YOLOv7, YOLOv8, and SlowFast algorithms, achieving a mean average precision (map) of up to 82.3%. Last, we fused multiple models to generate student behavior-related data from various perspectives. The experiment further demonstrates the effectiveness of our method. And SCB-ST-Dataset4 provides a robust foundation for future research in student behavior detection, potentially contributing to advancements in this field. The SCB-ST-Dataset4 is available for download at: https://github.com/Whiffe/SCB-dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2310.02522; text overlap with arXiv:2306.03318</p></details> |

Developing techniques to identify and analyze communities in these time-varying graph structures is an important challenge. In this work, we generalize existing spectral clustering algorithms from static to dynamic graphs using canonical correlation analysis (CCA) to capture the temporal evolution of clusters. Based on this extended canonical correlation framework, we define the spatio-temporal graph Laplacian and investigate its spectral properties. We connect these concepts to dynamical systems theory via transfer operators, and illustrate the advantages of our method on benchmark graphs by comparison with existing methods. We show that the spatio-temporal graph Laplacian allows for a clear interpretation of cluster structure evolution over time for directed and undirected graphs.</p></details> |  |

A critical component of disease behavior is the velocity with which disease spreads, defined as the rate of change between time and space. In this paper, we propose a spatio-temporal modeling approach to determine the velocities of infectious disease spread. Our approach assumes that the locations and times of people infected can be considered as a spatio-temporal point pattern that arises as a realization of a spatio-temporal log-Gaussian Cox process. The intensity of this process is estimated using fast Bayesian inference by employing the integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA) and the Stochastic Partial Differential Equations (SPDE) approaches. The velocity is then calculated using finite differences that approximate the derivatives of the intensity function. Finally, the directions and magnitudes of the velocities can be mapped at specific times to examine better the spread of the disease throughout the region. We demonstrate our method by analyzing COVID-19 spread in Cali, Colombia, during the 2020-2021 pandemic.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 46 figures, Journal American Statistican, submitted on 3rd of September</p></details> |

A video tutorial for this library is available on YouTube. We consider two types of methods to estimate a non-homogeneous Poisson process in space and time. The methods approximate the arrival intensity function of the Poisson process by discretizing space and time, and estimating arrival intensity as a function of subregion and time interval. With such methods, it is typical that the dimension of the estimator is large relative to the amount of data, and therefore the performance of the estimator can be improved by using additional data. The first method uses additional data to add a regularization term to the likelihood function for calibrating the intensity of the Poisson process. The second method uses additional data to estimate arrival intensity as a function of covariates. We describe a Python package to perform various types of space and time discretization. We also describe two packages for the calibration of the models, one in Matlab and one in C++. We demonstrate the advantages of our methods compared to basic maximum likelihood estimation with simulated and real data. The experiments with real data calibrate models of the arrival process of emergencies to be handled by the Rio de Janeiro emergency medical service.</p></details> |  |

Recently, the forecasting models have employed multi-source data as the multi-modality input, thus improving the prediction accuracy. However, the prevailing methods usually suffer from the desynchronization of multi-source variables, the insufficient capability of capturing spatio-temporal dependency, and unsatisfactory performance in predicting extreme precipitation events. To fix these problems, we propose a short-term precipitation forecasting model based on spatio-temporal alignment attention, with SATA as the temporal alignment module and STAU as the spatio-temporal feature extractor to filter high-pass features from precipitation signals and capture multi-term temporal dependencies. Based on satellite and ERA5 data from the southwestern region of China, our model achieves improvements of 12.61\% in terms of RMSE, in comparison with the state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

Designing spatio-temporal forecasting models separately in a task-wise and city-wise manner to forecast demand and supply-demand gap in a ride-hailing system poses a burden for the expanding transportation network companies. Therefore, a multi-task learning architecture is proposed in this study by developing gated ensemble of spatio-temporal mixture of experts network (GESME-Net) with convolutional recurrent neural network (CRNN), convolutional neural network (CNN), and recurrent neural network (RNN) for simultaneously forecasting these spatio-temporal tasks in a city as well as across different cities. Furthermore, a task adaptation layer is integrated with the architecture for learning joint representation in multi-task learning and revealing the contribution of the input features utilized in prediction. The proposed architecture is tested with data from Didi Chuxing for: (i) simultaneously forecasting demand and supply-demand gap in Beijing, and (ii) simultaneously forecasting demand across Chengdu and Xian. In both scenarios, models from our proposed architecture outperformed the single-task and multi-task deep learning benchmarks and ensemble-based machine learning algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2012.08868</p></details> |

Although adopting a surrogate gradient (SG) makes the non-differentiability SNN trainable, achieving comparable accuracy for ANNs and keeping low-power features simultaneously is still tricky. In this paper, we proposed an energy-efficient spike-train level spiking neural network with spatio-temporal conversion, which has low computational cost and high accuracy. In the STCSNN, spatio-temporal conversion blocks (STCBs) are proposed to keep the low power features of SNNs and improve accuracy. However, STCSNN cannot adopt backpropagation algorithms directly due to the non-differentiability nature of spike trains. We proposed a suitable learning rule for STCSNNs by deducing the equivalent gradient of STCB. We evaluate the proposed STCSNN on static and neuromorphic datasets, including Fashion-Mnist, Cifar10, Cifar100, TinyImageNet, and DVS-Cifar10. The experiment results show that our proposed STCSNN outperforms the state-of-the-art accuracy on nearly all datasets, using fewer time steps and being highly energy-efficient.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Neurocomputing on 10 August 2024</p></details> |

We also derive a posteriori error estimates, which coupled with adaptive space-time mesh refinement provide efficient and accurate solutions. The accuracy of the space-time solutions is illustrated against analytical solutions as well as against numerical solutions using a conventional time-marching algorithm.</p></details> |  |

As a result, interactions with robots must be simple and intuitive, with robots perception adapting efficiently to human-induced changes. This paper presents a robot control architecture that addresses key challenges in human-robot interaction, with a particular focus on the dynamic creation and continuous update of the robot state representation. The architecture uses Large Language Models to integrate diverse information sources, including natural language commands, robotic skills representation, real-time dynamic semantic mapping of the perceived scene. This enables flexible and adaptive robotic behavior in complex, dynamic environments. Traditional robotic systems often rely on static, pre-programmed instructions and settings, limiting their adaptability to dynamic environments and real-time collaboration. In contrast, this architecture uses LLMs to interpret complex, high-level instructions and generate actionable plans that enhance human-robot collaboration. At its core, the system Perception Module generates and continuously updates a semantic scene graph using RGB-D sensor data, providing a detailed and structured representation of the environment. A particle filter is employed to ensure accurate object localization in dynamic, real-world settings. The Planner Module leverages this up-to-date semantic map to break down high-level tasks into sub-tasks and link them to robotic skills such as navigation, object manipulation (e.g., PICK and PLACE), and movement (e.g., GOTO). By combining real-time perception, state tracking, and LLM-driven communication and task planning, the architecture enhances adaptability, task efficiency, and human-robot collaboration in dynamic environments.</p></details> |  |

Despite significant advancements in deep learning, the theoretical understanding of how and why complex architectures function remains limited, prompting the need for more interpretable models. Recently, the Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have been proposed as a more interpretable alternative. While KAN-related research is significantly rising, to date, the study of KAN architectures for time series classification has been limited. In this paper, we aim to conduct a comprehensive and robust exploration of the KAN architecture for time series classification on the UCR benchmark. More specifically, we look at a) how reference architectures for forecasting transfer to classification, at the b) hyperparameter and implementation influence on the classification performance in view of finding the one that performs best on the selected benchmark, the c) complexity trade-offs and d) interpretability advantages. Our results show that (1) Efficient KAN outperforms MLP in performance and computational efficiency, showcasing its suitability for tasks classification tasks. (2) Efficient KAN is more stable than KAN across grid sizes, depths, and layer configurations, particularly with lower learning rates. (3) KAN maintains competitive accuracy compared to state-of-the-art models like HIVE-COTE2, with smaller architectures and faster training times, supporting its balance of performance and transparency. (4) The interpretability of the KAN model aligns with findings from SHAP analysis, reinforcing its capacity for transparent decision-making.</p></details> |  |
| **[Cinematic Gaussians: Real-Time HDR Radiance Fields with Depth of Field](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07329v4)** | 2024-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Radiance field methods represent the state of the art in reconstructing complex scenes from multi-view photos. However, these reconstructions often suffer from one or both of the following limitations: First, they typically represent scenes in low dynamic range (LDR), which restricts their use to evenly lit environments and hinders immersive viewing experiences. Secondly, their reliance on a pinhole camera model, assuming all scene elements are in focus in the input images, presents practical challenges and complicates refocusing during novel-view synthesis. Addressing these limitations, we present a lightweight method based on 3D Gaussian Splatting that utilizes multi-view LDR images of a scene with varying exposure times, apertures, and focus distances as input to reconstruct a high-dynamic-range (HDR) radiance field. By incorporating analytical convolutions of Gaussians based on a thin-lens camera model as well as a tonemapping module, our reconstructions enable the rendering of HDR content with flexible refocusing capabilities. We demonstrate that our combined treatment of HDR and depth of field facilitates real-time cinematic rendering, outperforming the state of the art.</p></details> |  |

It aims to implement the Ultra Fast Lane Detection algorithm for real-time application on the SEATER P2MC-BRIN prototype using a camera and optimize its performance on the Jetson Nano platform. Preliminary experiments were conducted to evaluate the algorithm's performance in terms of data processing speed and accuracy using two types of datasets: outdoor using a public dataset and indoor using an internal dataset from the indoor area of the BRIN Workshop Building in Bandung. The experiments revealed that the algorithm runs more optimally on the Jetson Nano platform after conversion to TensorRT compared to the ONNX model, achieving processing speeds of approximately 101 ms using CULane and 105 ms using TuSimple, which is about 22 times faster than the previous model. While the algorithm demonstrates good accuracy on the outdoor public dataset, its performance falls short on the indoor dataset. Future work should focus on transfer learning and fine-tuning to enhance indoor lane detection accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 pag...</summary><p>4 pages, 9 figures 2 tables</p></details> |

They are meant to provide reliable and timely predictions to inform decisions along the entire product life cycle. One of their most interesting applications in the naval field is the digital twinning of ship performances in waves, a crucial aspect in design and operation safety. In this paper, a Bayesian extension of the Hankel dynamic mode decomposition method is proposed for ship motion's nowcasting as a prediction tool for naval digital twins. The proposed algorithm meets all the requirements for formulations devoted to digital twinning, being able to adapt the resulting models with the data incoming from the physical system, using a limited amount of data, producing real-time predictions, and estimating their reliability. Results are presented and discussed for the course-keeping of the 5415M model in beam-quartering sea state 7 irregular waves at Fr = 0.33, using data from three different CFD solvers. The results show predictions keeping good accuracy levels up to five wave encounter periods, with the Bayesian formulation improving the deterministic forecasts. In addition, a connection between the predicted uncertainty and prediction accuracy is found.</p></details> |  |

The method allows for very general discrete spaces and prismatic space-time meshes. Existence and uniqueness of a discrete solution are shown by means of an inf-sup condition, whose proof does not rely on polynomial inverse estimates. Moreover, for piecewise polynomial spaces satisfying an additional mild condition, we show a second inf-sup condition that provides an additional control of the time derivative of the discrete solution. We derive hp-a priori error bounds based on these inf-sup conditions, which we use to prove convergence rates for standard, tensor-product, and quasi-Trefftz polynomial spaces. Numerical experiments validate our theoretical results.</p></details> |  |
| **[Stable Neural Stochastic Differential Equations in Analyzing Irregular Time Series Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14989v5)** | 2024-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Irregular sampling intervals and missing values in real-world time series data present challenges for conventional methods that assume consistent intervals and complete data. Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs) offer an alternative approach, utilizing neural networks combined with ODE solvers to learn continuous latent representations through parameterized vector fields. Neural Stochastic Differential Equations (Neural SDEs) extend Neural ODEs by incorporating a diffusion term, although this addition is not trivial, particularly when addressing irregular intervals and missing values. Consequently, careful design of drift and diffusion functions is crucial for maintaining stability and enhancing performance, while incautious choices can result in adverse properties such as the absence of strong solutions, stochastic destabilization, or unstable Euler discretizations, significantly affecting Neural SDEs' performance. In this study, we propose three stable classes of Neural SDEs: Langevin-type SDE, Linear Noise SDE, and Geometric SDE. Then, we rigorously demonstrate their robustness in maintaining excellent performance under distribution shift, while effectively preventing overfitting. To assess the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets for interpolation, forecasting, and classification tasks, and analyze the robustness of our methods with 30 public datasets under different missing rates. Our results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method in handling real-world irregular time series data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at the Twelfth International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR 2024), Spotlight presentation (Notable Top 5%). https://openreview.net/forum?id=4VIgNuQ1pY</p></details> |
| **[Segmenting Action-Value Functions Over Time-Scales in SARSA using TD($Δ$)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14783v1)** | 2024-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In numerous episodic reinforcement learning (RL) settings, SARSA-based methodologies are employed to enhance policies aimed at maximizing returns over long horizons. Conventional SARSA algorithms, however, have difficulties in balancing bias and variation due to the reliance on a singular, fixed discount factor. This study expands the temporal difference decomposition approach, TD($\triangle$), to the SARSA algorithm. SARSA, a widely utilised on-policy RL method, enhances action-value functions via temporal difference updates. TD($\triangle$) facilitates learning over several time-scales by breaking the action-value function into components associated with distinct discount factors. This decomposition improves learning efficiency and stability, particularly in problems necessitating long-horizon optimization. We illustrate that our methodology mitigates bias in SARSA's updates while facilitating accelerated convergence in contexts characterized by dense rewards. Experimental findings across many benchmark tasks indicate that the proposed SARSA($\triangle$) surpasses conventional TD learning methods in both tabular and deep RL contexts.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2411.14019</p></details> |
| **[ArrivalNet: Predicting City-wide Bus/Tram Arrival Time with Two-dimensional Temporal Variation Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14742v2)** | 2024-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate arrival time prediction (ATP) of buses and trams plays a crucial role in public transport operations. Current methods focused on modeling one-dimensional temporal information but overlooked the latent periodic information within time series. Moreover, most studies developed algorithms for ATP based on a single or a few routes of public transport, which reduces the transferability of the prediction models and their applicability in public transport management systems. To this end, this paper proposes \textit{ArrivalNet}, a two-dimensional temporal variation-based multi-step ATP for buses and trams. It decomposes the one-dimensional temporal sequence into intra-periodic and inter-periodic variations, which can be recast into two-dimensional tensors (2D blocks). Each row of a tensor contains the time points within a period, and each column involves the time points at the same intra-periodic index across various periods. The transformed 2D blocks in different frequencies have an image-like feature representation that enables effective learning with computer vision backbones (e.g., convolutional neural network). Drawing on the concept of residual neural network, the 2D block module is designed as a basic module for flexible aggregation. Meanwhile, contextual factors like workdays, peak hours, and intersections, are also utilized in the augmented feature representation to improve the performance of prediction. 125 days of public transport data from Dresden were collected for model training and validation. Experimental results show that the root mean square error, mean absolute error, and mean absolute percentage error of the proposed predictor decrease by at least 6.1\%, 14.7\%, and 34.2\% compared with state-of-the-art baseline methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Con4m: Context-aware Consistency Learning Framework for Segmented Time Series Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00041v2)** | 2024-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time Series Classification (TSC) encompasses two settings: classifying entire sequences or classifying segmented subsequences. The raw time series for segmented TSC usually contain Multiple classes with Varying Duration of each class (MVD). Therefore, the characteristics of MVD pose unique challenges for segmented TSC, yet have been largely overlooked by existing works. Specifically, there exists a natural temporal dependency between consecutive instances (segments) to be classified within MVD. However, mainstream TSC models rely on the assumption of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.), focusing on independently modeling each segment. Additionally, annotators with varying expertise may provide inconsistent boundary labels, leading to unstable performance of noise-free TSC models. To address these challenges, we first formally demonstrate that valuable contextual information enhances the discriminative power of classification instances. Leveraging the contextual priors of MVD at both the data and label levels, we propose a novel consistency learning framework Con4m, which effectively utilizes contextual information more conducive to discriminating consecutive segments in segmented TSC tasks, while harmonizing inconsistent boundary labels for training. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets validate the effectiveness of Con4m in handling segmented TSC tasks on MVD.</p></details> |  |
| **[Introducing Spectral Attention for Long-Range Dependency in Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20772v3)** | 2024-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sequence modeling faces challenges in capturing long-range dependencies across diverse tasks. Recent linear and transformer-based forecasters have shown superior performance in time series forecasting. However, they are constrained by their inherent inability to effectively address long-range dependencies in time series data, primarily due to using fixed-size inputs for prediction. Furthermore, they typically sacrifice essential temporal correlation among consecutive training samples by shuffling them into mini-batches. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a fast and effective Spectral Attention mechanism, which preserves temporal correlations among samples and facilitates the handling of long-range information while maintaining the base model structure. Spectral Attention preserves long-period trends through a low-pass filter and facilitates gradient to flow between samples. Spectral Attention can be seamlessly integrated into most sequence models, allowing models with fixed-sized look-back windows to capture long-range dependencies over thousands of steps. Through extensive experiments on 11 real-world time series datasets using 7 recent forecasting models, we consistently demonstrate the efficacy of our Spectral Attention mechanism, achieving state-of-the-art results.</p></details> | <details><summary>Co-fi...</summary><p>Co-first Author: Bong Gyun Kang, Dongjun Lee.

| **[Modelling Loss of Complexity in Intermittent Time Series and its Application](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14635v1)** | 2024-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we developed a nonparametric relative entropy (RlEn) for modelling loss of complexity in intermittent time series. This technique consists of two steps. First, we carry out a nonlinear autoregressive model where the lag order is determined by a Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), and complexity of each intermittent time series is obtained by our novel relative entropy. Second, change-points in complexity were detected by using the cumulative sum (CUSUM) based method. Using simulations and compared to the popular method appropriate entropy (ApEN), the performance of RlEn was assessed for its (1) ability to localise complexity change-points in intermittent time series; (2) ability to faithfully estimate underlying nonlinear models. The performance of the proposal was then examined in a real analysis of fatigue-induced changes in the complexity of human motor outputs. The results demonstrated that the proposed method outperformed the ApEn in accurately detecting complexity changes in intermittent time series segments.</p></details> | 44 pages, 4 figures |

That may not always be possible. Similar data assimilation problems, involving other dissipative systems, are of considerable interest in the geophysical sciences, and are commonly solved using computationally intensive methods based on neural networks informed by machine learning. Successful solution of ill-posed time-reversed Navier-Stokes equations is limited by uncertainty estimates, based on logarithmic convexity, that place limits on the value of $T > 0$. In computational experiments involving satellite images of hurricanes and other meteorological phenomena, the present method is shown to produce successful solutions at values of $T > 0$, that are several orders of magnitude larger than would be expected, based on the best-known uncertainty estimates. However, unsuccessful examples are also given. The present self-contained paper outlines the stabilizing technique, based on applying a compensating smoothing operator at each time step, and stresses the important differences between data assimilation, and backward recovery, in ill-posed time reversed problems for dissipative equations. While theorems are stated without proof, the reader is referred to a previous paper, on Navier-Stokes backward recovery, where these proofs can be found.</p></details> |  |

Most existing studies rely upon self-report or manual measures from bulky wearable sensors, thus lacking efficiency and accuracy in capturing quantitative screen exposure data. In this work, we developed a novel sensor informatics framework that utilizes egocentric images from a wearable sensor, termed the screen time tracker (STT), and a vision language model (VLM). In particular, we devised a multi-view VLM that takes multiple views from egocentric image sequences and interprets screen exposure dynamically. We validated our approach by using a dataset of children's free-living activities, demonstrating significant improvement over existing methods in plain vision language models and object detection models. Results supported the promise of this monitoring approach, which could optimize behavioral research on screen exposure in children's naturalistic settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepa...</summary><p>Prepare for submission</p></details> |

The semantic descriptions of LTL3 in previous work are given only in terms of the relationship to conventional LTL. Our approach, by contrast, gives a full model-based inductive accounting of the semantics of LTL3, in terms of families of definitive prefix sets. We show that our definitive prefix sets are isomorphic to linear-time temporal properties (sets of infinite traces), and thereby show that our semantics of LTL3 directly correspond to the semantics of conventional LTL. In addition, we formalise the formula progression evaluation technique, popularly used in runtime verification and testing contexts, and show its soundness and completeness up to finite traces with respect to our semantics.

The primary goal is to optimize motion execution time by leveraging the redundancy of both arms, specifically in tasks where only the relative pose of the robots is constrained, such as dual-arm scanning of unknown objects. Unlike traditional inverse kinematics methods that use surrogate metrics such as joint configuration distance, our method incorporates direct motion execution time and implicit collisions into the optimization process, thereby finding target joints that allow subsequent trajectory generation to get more efficient and collision-free motion. A neural network based execution time approximator is employed to predict time-efficient joint configurations while accounting for potential collisions. Through experimental evaluation on a system composed of a UR5 and a KUKA iiwa robot, we demonstrate significant reductions in execution time. The proposed method outperforms conventional approaches, showing improved motion efficiency without sacrificing positioning accuracy. These results highlight the potential of ETA-IK to improve the performance of dual-arm systems in applications, where efficiency and safety are paramount.</p></details> |  |

In order to maximize the productivity of content creators and to fully realize their artistic imagination, it requires both quick interactive interfaces and fine-grained regional controls in their tools. Despite astonishing generation quality from recent diffusion models, we find that existing approaches for regional controllability are very slow (52 seconds for $512 \times 512$ image) while not compatible with acceleration methods such as LCM, blocking their huge potential in interactive content creation. From this observation, we build our solution for interactive content creation in two steps: (1) we establish compatibility between region-based controls and acceleration techniques for diffusion models, maintaining high fidelity of multi-prompt image generation with $\times 10$ reduced number of inference steps, (2) we increase the generation throughput with our new multi-prompt stream batch pipeline, enabling low-latency generation from multiple, region-based text prompts on a single RTX 2080 Ti GPU. Our proposed framework is generalizable to any existing diffusion models and acceleration schedulers, allowing sub-second (0.64 seconds) image content creation application upon well-established image diffusion models.

Nonetheless, it has difficulties in reconciling bias with variance, particularly in the context of long-term rewards. This paper introduces Q($\Delta$)-Learning, an extension of TD($\Delta$) for the Q-Learning framework. TD($\Delta$) facilitates efficient learning over several time scales by breaking the Q($\Delta$)-function into distinct discount factors. This approach offers improved learning stability and scalability, especially for long-term tasks where discounting bias may impede convergence. Our methodology guarantees that each element of the Q($\Delta$)-function is acquired individually, facilitating expedited convergence on shorter time scales and enhancing the learning of extended time scales. We demonstrate through theoretical analysis and practical evaluations on standard benchmarks like Atari that Q($\Delta$)-Learning surpasses conventional Q-Learning and TD learning methods in both tabular and deep RL environments.</p></details> | 17 pages |

The main reasons for using such a likelihood approximation is that i) it has substantially lower computational cost and better scalability to long time series compared to the time domain likelihood, particularly when used for Bayesian inference via Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), ii) convenience when the model itself is specified in the frequency domain, and iii) it provides access to bootstrap and subsampling MCMC which exploits the asymptotic independence of Fourier transformed data. Most of the existing literature compares the asymptotic performance of the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) from such frequency domain likelihood approximation with the exact time domain MLE. Our article uses three simulation studies to assess the finite-sample accuracy of several frequency domain likelihood functions when used to approximate the posterior distribution in time-varying parameter models. The methods are illustrated on an application to egg price data.</p></details> |  |

Current publicly available datasets are too small, not diverse and feature trivial anomalies, which hinders measurable progress in this research area. We propose a solution: a diverse, extensive, and non-trivial dataset generated via state-of-the-art simulation tools that reflects realistic behaviour of an automotive powertrain, including its multivariate, dynamic and variable-state properties. To cater for both unsupervised and semi-supervised anomaly detection settings, as well as time series generation and forecasting, we make different versions of the dataset available, where training and test subsets are offered in contaminated and clean versions, depending on the task. We also provide baseline results from a small selection of approaches based on deterministic and variational autoencoders, as well as a non-parametric approach. As expected, the baseline experimentation shows that the approaches trained on the semi-supervised version of the dataset outperform their unsupervised counterparts, highlighting a need for approaches more robust to contaminated training data.</p></details> |  |

However, they still face huge challenges in reflective surface reconstruction. Although recent methods model the light trace to learn specularity, the ignorance of indirect illumination makes it hard to handle inter-reflections among multiple smooth objects. In this work, we propose Ref-MC2 that introduces the multi-time Monte Carlo sampling which comprehensively computes the environmental illumination and meanwhile considers the reflective light from object surfaces. To address the computation challenge as the times of Monte Carlo sampling grow, we propose a specularity-adaptive sampling strategy, significantly reducing the computational complexity. Besides the computational resource, higher geometry accuracy is also required because geometric errors accumulate multiple times. Therefore, we further introduce a reflection-aware surface model to initialize the geometry and refine it during inverse rendering. We construct a challenging dataset containing scenes with multiple objects and inter-reflections. Experiments show that our method outperforms other inverse rendering methods on various object groups. We also show downstream applications, e.g., relighting and material editing, to illustrate the disentanglement ability of our method.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages,6 figures, Accepted by NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |
| **[Maximum Weight Independent Set in Graphs with no Long Claws in Quasi-Polynomial Time](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15738v3)** | 2024-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We show that the \textsc{Maximum Weight Independent Set} problem (\textsc{MWIS}) can be solved in quasi-polynomial time on $H$-free graphs (graphs excluding a fixed graph $H$ as an induced subgraph) for every $H$ whose every connected component is a path or a subdivided claw (i.e., a tree with at most three leaves). This completes the dichotomy of the complexity of \textsc{MWIS} in $\mathcal{F}$-free graphs for any finite set $\mathcal{F}$ of graphs into NP-hard cases and cases solvable in quasi-polynomial time, and corroborates the conjecture that the cases not known to be NP-hard are actually polynomial-time solvable. The key graph-theoretic ingredient in our result is as follows. Fix an integer $t \geq 1$. Let $S_{t,t,t}$ be the graph created from three paths on $t$ edges by identifying one endpoint of each path into a single vertex. We show that, given a graph $G$, one can in polynomial time find either an induced $S_{t,t,t}$ in $G$, or a balanced separator consisting of $\Oh(\log |V(G)|)$ vertex neighborhoods in $G$, or an extended strip decomposition of $G$ (a decomposition almost as useful for recursion for \textsc{MWIS} as a partition into connected components) with each particle of weight multiplicatively smaller than the weight of $G$. This is a strengthening of a result of Majewski et al.\ [ICALP~2022] which provided such an extended strip decomposition only after the deletion of $\Oh(\log |V(G)|)$ vertex neighborhoods. To reach the final result, we employ an involved branching strategy that relies on the structural lemma presented above.</p></details> | 59 pages, 4 figures |

In the light field domain, segmentation presents an additional objective of recognizing the same segment through all the views. Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM 2) allows producing semantically meaningful segments for monocular images and videos. However, using SAM 2 directly on light fields is highly ineffective due to unexploited constraints. In this work, we present a novel light field segmentation method that adapts SAM 2 to the light field domain without retraining or modifying the model. By utilizing the light field domain constraints, the method produces high quality and view-consistent light field masks, outperforming the SAM 2 video tracking baseline and working 7 times faster, with a real-time speed. We achieve this by exploiting the epipolar geometry cues to propagate the masks between the views, probing the SAM 2 latent space to estimate their occlusion, and further prompting SAM 2 for their refinement.</p></details> |  |
| **[WaveRoRA: Wavelet Rotary Route Attention for Multivariate Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22649v2)** | 2024-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, Transformer-based models (Transformers) have achieved significant success in multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF). However, previous works focus on extracting features either from the time domain or the frequency domain, which inadequately captures the trends and periodic characteristics. To address this issue, we propose a wavelet learning framework to model complex temporal dependencies of the time series data. The wavelet domain integrates both time and frequency information, allowing for the analysis of local characteristics of signals at different scales. Additionally, the Softmax self-attention mechanism used by Transformers has quadratic complexity, which leads to excessive computational costs when capturing long-term dependencies. Therefore, we propose a novel attention mechanism: Rotary Route Attention (RoRA). Unlike Softmax attention, RoRA utilizes rotary position embeddings to inject relative positional information to sequence tokens and introduces a small number of routing tokens $r$ to aggregate information from the $KV$ matrices and redistribute it to the $Q$ matrix, offering linear complexity. We further propose WaveRoRA, which leverages RoRA to capture inter-series dependencies in the wavelet domain. We conduct extensive experiments on eight real-world datasets. The results indicate that WaveRoRA outperforms existing state-of-the-art models while maintaining lower computational costs.

Kapitza's work is an example that an originally unstable system can become stable after a minor perturbation of its properties or initial conditions is applied. Inspired by his ideas, we show how non-Foster circuits can be stabilized with the application of external \textit{electrical vibration}, i.e., time modulations. Non-Foster circuits are highly appreciated in the engineering community since their bandwidth characteristics are not limited by passive-circuits bounds. Unfortunately, non-Foster circuits are usually unstable and they must be stabilized prior to operation. Here, we focus on the study of non-Foster $L(t)C$ circuits with time-varying inductors and time-invariant negative capacitors. We find an intrinsic connection between Kapitza's inverted pendulum and non-Foster $L(t)C$ resonators. Moreover, we show how positive time-varying modulations of $L(t)>0$ can overcome and stabilize non-Foster negative capacitances $C<0$. These findings open up an alternative manner of stabilizing electric circuits with the use of time modulations, and lay the groundwork for application of, what we coin \textit{Vibrational Electromagnetics}, in more complex media.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages (7 pages main text, 3 pages supplementary materials), 4 figures; a minor issue in Fig. 3(a) is corrected</p></details> |

LiDAR data, for instance, can be affected by sensor failures or environmental factors, causing domain gaps. Adapting models to these distribution shifts online is crucial, as training for every possible variation is impractical. Existing methods often focus on fine-tuning pre-trained models based on self-supervised learning or pseudo-labeling, which can lead to forgetting valuable source domain knowledge over time and reduce generalization on future tests. In this paper, we introduce a novel 3D test-time adaptation method, termed 3DD-TTA, which stands for 3D Denoising Diffusion Test-Time Adaptation. This method uses a diffusion strategy that adapts input point cloud samples to the source domain while keeping the source model parameters intact. The approach uses a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to encode the corrupted point cloud into a shape latent and latent points. These latent points are corrupted with Gaussian noise and subjected to a denoising diffusion process. During this process, both the shape latent and latent points are updated to preserve fidelity, guiding the denoising toward generating consistent samples that align more closely with the source domain. We conduct extensive experiments on the ShapeNet dataset and investigate its generalizability on ModelNet40 and ScanObjectNN, achieving state-of-the-art results.

| **[Joint model with latent disease age: overcoming the need for reference time](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17249v2)** | 2024-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Introduction: Heterogeneity of the progression of neurodegenerative diseases is one of the main challenges faced in developing effective therapies. With the increasing number of large clinical databases, disease progression models have led to a better understanding of this heterogeneity. Nevertheless, these diseases may have no clear onset and biological underlying processes may start before the first symptoms. Such an ill-defined disease reference time is an issue for current joint models, which have proven their effectiveness by combining longitudinal and survival data. Objective In this work, we propose a joint non-linear mixed effect model with a latent disease age, to overcome this need for a precise reference time. Method: To do so, we utilized an existing longitudinal model with a latent disease age as a longitudinal sub-model and associated it with a survival sub-model that estimates a Weibull distribution from the latent disease age. We then validated our model on different simulated scenarios. Finally, we benchmarked our model with a state-of-the-art joint model and reference survival and longitudinal models on simulated and real data in the context of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). Results: On real data, our model got significantly better results than the state-of-the-art joint model for absolute bias (4.21(4.41) versus 4.24(4.14)(p-value=1.4e-17)), and mean cumulative AUC for right censored events (0.67(0.07) versus 0.61(0.09)(p-value=1.7e-03)). Conclusion: We showed that our approach is better suited than the state-of-the-art in the context where the reference time is not reliable. This work opens up the perspective to design predictive and personalized therapeutic strategies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fast Machine-Precision Spectral Likelihoods for Stationary Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16583v3)** | 2024-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We provide in this work an algorithm for approximating a very broad class of symmetric Toeplitz matrices to machine precision in $\mathcal{O}(n \log n)$ time with applications to fitting time series models. In particular, for a symmetric Toeplitz matrix $\mathbf{\Sigma}$ with values $\mathbf{\Sigma}_{j,k} = h_{|j-k|} = \int_{-1/2}^{1/2} e^{2 \pi i |j-k| \omega} S(\omega) \mathrm{d} \omega$ where $S(\omega)$ is piecewise smooth, we give an approximation $\mathbf{\mathcal{F}} \mathbf{\Sigma} \mathbf{\mathcal{F}}^H \approx \mathbf{D} + \mathbf{U} \mathbf{V}^H$, where $\mathbf{\mathcal{F}}$ is the DFT matrix, $\mathbf{D}$ is diagonal, and the matrices $\mathbf{U}$ and $\mathbf{V}$ are in $\mathbb{C}^{n \times r}$ with $r \ll n$. Studying these matrices in the context of time series, we offer a theoretical explanation of this structure and connect it to existing spectral-domain approximation frameworks. We then give a complete discussion of the numerical method for assembling the approximation and demonstrate its efficiency for improving Whittle-type likelihood approximations, including dramatic examples where a correction of rank $r = 2$ to the standard Whittle approximation increases the accuracy of the log-likelihood approximation from $3$ to $14$ digits for a matrix $\mathbf{\Sigma} \in \mathbb{R}^{10^5 \times 10^5}$. The method and analysis of this work applies well beyond time series analysis, providing an algorithm for extremely accurate solutions to linear systems with a wide variety of symmetric Toeplitz matrices whose entries are generated by a piecewise smooth $S(\omega)$. The analysis employed here largely depends on asymptotic expansions of oscillatory integrals, and also provides a new perspective on when existing spectral-domain approximation methods for Gaussian log-likelihoods can be particularly problematic.</p></details> |  |
| **[GRATEV2.0: Computational Tools for Real-time Analysis of High-throughput High-resolution TEM (HRTEM) Images of Conjugated Polymers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03474v2)** | 2024-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated analysis of high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images is increasingly essential for advancing research in organic electronics, where precise characterization of nanoscale crystal structures is crucial for optimizing material properties. This paper introduces an open-source computational framework called GRATEV2.0 (GRaph-based Analysis of TEM), designed for real-time analysis of HRTEM data, with a focus on characterizing complex microstructures in conjugated polymers, illustrated using Poly[N-9'-heptadecanyl-2,7-carbazole-alt-5,5-(4',7'-di-2-thienyl-2',1',3'-benzothiadiazole)] (PCDTBT), a key material in organic photovoltaics. GRATEV2.0 employs fast, automated image processing algorithms, enabling rapid extraction of structural features like d-spacing, orientation, and crystal shape metrics. Gaussian process optimization rapidly identifies the user-defined parameters in the approach, reducing the need for manual parameter tuning and thus enhancing reproducibility and usability. Additionally, GRATEV2.0 is compatible with high-performance computing (HPC) environments, allowing for efficient, large-scale data processing at near real-time speeds. A unique feature of GRATEV2.0 is a Wasserstein distance-based stopping criterion, which optimizes data collection by determining when further sampling no longer adds statistically significant information. This capability optimizes the amount of time the TEM facility is used while ensuring data adequacy for in-depth analysis. Open-source and tested on a substantial PCDTBT dataset, this tool offers a powerful, robust, and accessible solution for high-throughput material characterization in organic electronics.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 9 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

| **[Space-time model reduction in the frequency domain](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13531v1)** | 2024-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most model reduction methods are space-only in that they reduce the spatial dimension of the solution but not the temporal one. These methods integrate an encoding of the state of the nonlinear dynamical system forward in time. We propose a space-time method -- one that solves a system of algebraic equations for the encoding of the trajectory, i.e., the solution on a time interval $[0,T]$. The benefit of this approach is that with the same total number of degrees of freedom, a space-time encoding can leverage spatiotemporal correlations to represent the trajectory far more accurately than a space-only one. We use spectral proper orthogonal decomposition (SPOD) modes, a spatial basis at each temporal frequency tailored to the structures that appear at that frequency, to represent the trajectory. These modes have a number of properties that make them an ideal choice for space-time model reduction. We derive an algebraic system involving the SPOD coefficients that represent the solution, as well as the initial condition and the forcing. The online phase of the method consists of solving this system for the SPOD coefficients given the initial condition and forcing. We test the model on a Ginzburg-Landau system, a $1 + 1$ dimensional nonlinear PDE. We find that the proposed method is $\sim 2$ orders of magnitude more accurate than POD-Galerkin at the same number of modes and CPU time for all of our tests. In fact, the method is substantially more accurate even than the projection of the solution onto the POD modes, which is a lower bound for the error of any space-only Petrov-Galerkin method.</p></details> | 34 pages, 11 figures |

Recent research exploits large language models (LLMs) to facilitate table reasoning, which however struggle with pattern recognition and lack support for visual-based pattern exploration. To address these limitations, we propose VisTR, a framework that leverages visualizations as representations to facilitate data pattern recognition and support cross-modal exploration. We describe VisTR as a process consisting of four major modules: 1) visualization alignment that utilizes multimodal LLMs to align visualizations across various modalities, including chart, text, and sketch; 2) visualization referencing that decomposes a table into multifaceted visualization references that comprehensively represent the table; 3) visualization pruning that incorporates data and retrieval pruning to excise visualization references with poor information and enhance retrieval efficiency; and 4) visualization interaction that offers an interactive visual interface with multimodal interactions for user-friendly table reasoning. Quantitative evaluation with existing multimodal LLMs demonstrates the effectiveness of the alignment model in cross-modal visualization pairings. We further illustrate the applicability of the proposed framework in various time-series table reasoning and exploration tasks.</p></details> | 11 pages, 10 figures |
| **[From Decoding to Meta-Generation: Inference-time Algorithms for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16838v2)** | 2024-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One of the most striking findings in modern research on large language models (LLMs) is that scaling up compute during training leads to better results. However, less attention has been given to the benefits of scaling compute during inference. This survey focuses on these inference-time approaches. We explore three areas under a unified mathematical formalism: token-level generation algorithms, meta-generation algorithms, and efficient generation. Token-level generation algorithms, often called decoding algorithms, operate by sampling a single token at a time or constructing a token-level search space and then selecting an output. These methods typically assume access to a language model's logits, next-token distributions, or probability scores. Meta-generation algorithms work on partial or full sequences, incorporating domain knowledge, enabling backtracking, and integrating external information. Efficient generation methods aim to reduce token costs and improve the speed of generation. Our survey unifies perspectives from three research communities: traditional natural language processing, modern LLMs, and machine learning systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[RTSR: A Real-Time Super-Resolution Model for AV1 Compressed Content](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13362v1)** | 2024-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Super-resolution (SR) is a key technique for improving the visual quality of video content by increasing its spatial resolution while reconstructing fine details. SR has been employed in many applications including video streaming, where compressed low-resolution content is typically transmitted to end users and then reconstructed with a higher resolution and enhanced quality. To support real-time playback, it is important to implement fast SR models while preserving reconstruction quality; however most existing solutions, in particular those based on complex deep neural networks, fail to do so. To address this issue, this paper proposes a low-complexity SR method, RTSR, designed to enhance the visual quality of compressed video content, focusing on resolution up-scaling from a) 360p to 1080p and from b) 540p to 4K. The proposed approach utilizes a CNN-based network architecture, which was optimized for AV1 (SVT)-encoded content at various quantization levels based on a dual-teacher knowledge distillation method. This method was submitted to the AIM 2024 Video Super-Resolution Challenge, specifically targeting the Efficient/Mobile Real-Time Video Super-Resolution competition. It achieved the best trade-off between complexity and coding performance (measured in PSNR, SSIM and VMAF) among all six submissions. The code will be available soon.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sublinear-time Sampling of Spanning Trees in the Congested Clique](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13334v1)** | 2024-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present the first sublinear round algorithm for approximately sampling uniform spanning trees in the CongestedClique model of distributed computing. In particular, our algorithm requires $\~O(n^{0.658})$ rounds for sampling a spanning tree from a distribution within total variation distance $1/n^c$, for arbitrary constant $c > 0$, from the uniform distribution. More precisely, our algorithm requires $\~O(n^{1/2 + \alpha})$ rounds, where $O(n^\alpha)$ is the running time of matrix multiplication in the CongestedClique model, currently at $\alpha = 1 - 2/\omega = 0.158$, where $\omega$ is the sequential matrix multiplication time exponent. In addition, we show how to take somewhat shorter random walks even more efficiently in the CongestedClique model. Specifically, we show how to construct length-$\tau$ walks, for $\tau = \Omega(n/\log n)$, in $O\left(\frac{\tau}{n} \log \tau \log n\right)$ rounds and for $\tau = O(n/\log n)$ in $O(\log \tau)$ rounds. This implies an $O(\log^3 n)$-round algorithm in the CongestedClique model for sampling spanning trees for Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graphs and regular expander graphs due to the $O(n \log n)$ bound on their cover time. This also implies that polylogarithmic-length walks, which are useful for page rank estimation, can be constructed in $O(\log \log n)$ rounds in the CongestedClique model. These results are obtained by adding a load balancing component to the random walk algorithm of Bahmani, Chakrabarti and Xin (SIGMOD 2011) that uses the ``doubling'' technique.</p></details> |  |

To address this, we propose Domain-Adversarial Test-Time Adaptation (DATTA), a novel framework combining domain-adversarial training (DAT), test-time adaptation (TTA), and weight resetting to facilitate adaptation to unseen target domains and to prevent catastrophic forgetting. DATTA is integrated into a lightweight, flexible architecture optimized for speed. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of DATTA, including an ablation study on all key components using publicly available data, and verify its suitability for real-time applications such as human activity recognition. When combining a SotA video-based variant of TTA with WiFi-based DAT and comparing it to DATTA, our method achieves an 8.1% higher F1-Score.

To address these issues, we propose and implement a fully integrated system that replaces conventional AFE models with Open AI's Whisper, leveraging its encoder to optimize processing and improve overall system efficiency. Our evaluation of two open-source real-time models across three different datasets shows that Whisper not only accelerates processing but also improves specific aspects of rendering quality, resulting in more realistic and responsive talking-head interactions. These advancements make the system a more effective tool for immersive, interactive training applications, expanding the potential of AI-driven avatars in interviewer training.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 6 figures, 3 tables. submitted to MDPI journal in as Big Data and Cognitive Computing</p></details> |

In this paper, we reconsidered the deficiencies in the current approaches to initializing single object trackers and propose a new paradigm for single object tracking algorithms, ClickTrack, a new paradigm using clicking interaction for real-time scenarios. Moreover, click as an input type inherently lack hierarchical information. To address ambiguity in certain special scenarios, we designed the Guided Click Refiner(GCR), which accepts point and optional textual information as inputs, transforming the point into the bounding box expected by the operator. The bounding box will be used as input of single object trackers. Experiments on LaSOT and GOT-10k benchmarks show that tracker combined with GCR achieves stable performance in real-time interactive scenarios. Furthermore, we explored the integration of GCR into the Segment Anything model(SAM), significantly reducing ambiguity issues when SAM receives point inputs.</p></details> |  |

The task is to estimate the time difference between a signal arriving at two different sensors. For the audio sensor modality, most current systems are based on classical methods such as the Generalized Cross-Correlation Phase Transform (GCC-PHAT) method. In this paper we demonstrate that learning based methods can, even based on synthetic data, significantly outperform GCC-PHAT on novel real world data. To overcome the lack of data with ground truth for the task, we train our model on a simulated dataset which is sufficiently large and varied, and that captures the relevant characteristics of the real world problem. We provide our trained model, SONNET (Simulation Optimized Neural Network Estimator of Timeshifts), which is runnable in real-time and works on novel data out of the box for many real data applications, i.e. without re-training. We further demonstrate greatly improved performance on the downstream task of self-calibration when using our model compared to classical methods.</p></details> |  |

The main property to ensure the convergence thereof is the regularity of the approximation (in the vocabulary of discrete approximation schemes). In a previous work the existence of discrete operators $T_n$ which converge to $T$ in a discrete norm was shown to be sufficient to obtain regularity. Although this framework proved useful for many applications for some instances the former assumption is too strong. Thus in the present article we report a weaker criterion for which the discrete operators $T_n$ only have to converge point-wise, but in addition a weak T-coercivity condition has to be satisfied on the discrete level. We apply the new framework to prove the convergence of certain $H^1$-conforming finite element discretizations of the damped time-harmonic Galbrun's equation, which is used to model the oscillations of stars. A main ingredient in the latter analysis is the uniformly stable invertibility of the divergence operator on certain spaces, which is related to the topic of divergence free elements for the Stokes equation.</p></details> | 31 pages, 6 figures |

While most contributions to the task brought improvements in robustness and generalization, this paper addresses the critical performance measure of the speed at which an in-hand manipulation can be performed. We present reinforcement learning policies that can perform in-hand reorientation significantly faster than previous approaches for the complex setting of goal-conditioned reorientation in SO(3) with permanent force closure and tactile feedback only (i.e., using the hand's torque and position sensors). Moreover, we show how policies can be trained to be speed-adjustable, allowing for setting the average orientation speed of the manipulated object during deployment. To this end, we present suitable and minimalistic reinforcement learning objectives for time-optimal and speed-adjustable in-hand manipulation, as well as an analysis based on extensive experiments in simulation. We also demonstrate the zero-shot transfer of the learned policies to the real DLR-Hand II with a wide range of target speeds and the fastest dextrous in-hand manipulation without visual inputs.</p></details> |  |

However, recent studies have shown that the inference performance of CLIP can be greatly degraded by small adversarial perturbations, especially its visual modality, posing significant safety threats. To mitigate this vulnerability, in this paper, we propose a novel defense method called Test-Time Adversarial Prompt Tuning (TAPT) to enhance the inference robustness of CLIP against visual adversarial attacks. TAPT is a test-time defense method that learns defensive bimodal (textual and visual) prompts to robustify the inference process of CLIP. Specifically, it is an unsupervised method that optimizes the defensive prompts for each test sample by minimizing a multi-view entropy and aligning adversarial-clean distributions. We evaluate the effectiveness of TAPT on 11 benchmark datasets, including ImageNet and 10 other zero-shot datasets, demonstrating that it enhances the zero-shot adversarial robustness of the original CLIP by at least 48.9% against AutoAttack (AA), while largely maintaining performance on clean examples. Moreover, TAPT outperforms existing adversarial prompt tuning methods across various backbones, achieving an average robustness improvement of at least 36.6%.</p></details> |  |

While neural radiance representations based on voxels or mesh individually offer distinct advantages, excelling in either rendering quality or speed, each has limitations in the other aspect. In response, we propose a hybrid representation named Vosh, seamlessly combining both voxel and mesh components in hybrid rendering for view synthesis. Vosh is meticulously crafted by optimizing the voxel grid based on neural rendering, strategically meshing a portion of the volumetric density field to surface. Therefore, it excels in fast rendering scenes with simple geometry and textures through its mesh component, while simultaneously enabling high-quality rendering in intricate regions by leveraging voxel component. The flexibility of Vosh is showcased through the ability to adjust hybrid ratios, providing users the ability to control the balance between rendering quality and speed based on flexible usage. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves commendable trade-off between rendering quality and speed, and notably has real-time performance on mobile devices.

| **[TSINR: Capturing Temporal Continuity via Implicit Neural Representations for Time Series Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11641v2)** | 2024-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series anomaly detection aims to identify unusual patterns in data or deviations from systems' expected behavior. The reconstruction-based methods are the mainstream in this task, which learn point-wise representation via unsupervised learning. However, the unlabeled anomaly points in training data may cause these reconstruction-based methods to learn and reconstruct anomalous data, resulting in the challenge of capturing normal patterns. In this paper, we propose a time series anomaly detection method based on implicit neural representation (INR) reconstruction, named TSINR, to address this challenge. Due to the property of spectral bias, TSINR enables prioritizing low-frequency signals and exhibiting poorer performance on high-frequency abnormal data. Specifically, we adopt INR to parameterize time series data as a continuous function and employ a transformer-based architecture to predict the INR of given data. As a result, the proposed TSINR method achieves the advantage of capturing the temporal continuity and thus is more sensitive to discontinuous anomaly data. In addition, we further design a novel form of INR continuous function to learn inter- and intra-channel information, and leverage a pre-trained large language model to amplify the intense fluctuations in anomalies. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TSINR achieves superior overall performance on both univariate and multivariate time series anomaly detection benchmarks compared to other state-of-the-art reconstruction-based methods.

Due to the abundant seasonal information they contain, timestamps possess the potential to offer robust global guidance for forecasting techniques. However, existing works primarily focus on local observations, with timestamps being treated merely as an optional supplement that remains underutilized. When data gathered from the real world is polluted, the absence of global information will damage the robust prediction capability of these algorithms. To address these problems, we propose a novel framework named GLAFF. Within this framework, the timestamps are modeled individually to capture the global dependencies. Working as a plugin, GLAFF adaptively adjusts the combined weights for global and local information, enabling seamless collaboration with any time series forecasting backbone. Extensive experiments conducted on nine real-world datasets demonstrate that GLAFF significantly enhances the average performance of widely used mainstream forecasting models by 12.5%, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art method by 5.5%.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |

Despite the promising results achieved by existing studies, the inherently ill-posed nature of the task presents significant challenges in diverse driving scenarios. This paper introduces TALoS, a novel test-time adaptation approach for SSC that excavates the information available in driving environments. Specifically, we focus on that observations made at a certain moment can serve as Ground Truth (GT) for scene completion at another moment. Given the characteristics of the LiDAR sensor, an observation of an object at a certain location confirms both 1) the occupation of that location and 2) the absence of obstacles along the line of sight from the LiDAR to that point. TALoS utilizes these observations to obtain self-supervision about occupancy and emptiness, guiding the model to adapt to the scene in test time. In a similar manner, we aggregate reliable SSC predictions among multiple moments and leverage them as semantic pseudo-GT for adaptation. Further, to leverage future observations that are not accessible at the current time, we present a dual optimization scheme using the model in which the update is delayed until the future observation is available. Evaluations on the SemanticKITTI validation and test sets demonstrate that TALoS significantly improves the performance of the pre-trained SSC model.

| **[Finding irrelevant vertices in linear time on bounded-genus graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1907.05940v6)** | 2024-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The irrelevant vertex technique provides a powerful tool for the design of parameterized algorithms for a wide variety of problems on graphs. A common characteristic of these problems, permitting the application of this technique on surface-embedded graphs, is the fact that every graph of large enough treewidth contains a vertex that is irrelevant, in the sense that its removal yields an equivalent instance of the problem. The straightforward application of this technique yields algorithms with running time that is quadratic in the size of the input graph. This running time is due to the fact that it takes linear time to detect one irrelevant vertex and the total number of irrelevant vertices to be detected is linear as well. Using advanced techniques, sub-quadratic algorithms have been designed for particular problems, even in general graphs. However, designing a general framework for linear-time algorithms has been open, even for the bounded-genus case. In this paper we introduce a general framework that enables finding in linear time an entire set of irrelevant vertices whose removal yields a bounded-treewidth graph, provided that the input graph has bounded genus. Our technique consists of decomposing any surface-embedded graph into a tree-structured collection of bounded-treewidth subgraphs where detecting globally irrelevant vertices can be done locally and independently. Our method is applicable to a wide variety of known graph containment or graph modification problems where the irrelevant vertex technique applies. Examples include the (Induced) Minor Folio problem, the (Induced) Disjoint Paths problem, and the $\mathcal{F}$-Minor-Deletion problem.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication to SODA 2025</p></details> |

In fact, the maximum bound principle (MBP) for the first- and second-order ETD schemes is presented in a prior publication [SIAM Review, 63(2), 2021], assuming a symmetric initial matrix field. Noteworthy is our novel contribution, demonstrating that the first- and second-order ETD schemes for the matrix-valued Allen-Cahn equation -- both being linear schemes -- unconditionally preserve the MBP, even in instances of nonsymmetric initial conditions. Additionally, we prove that these two ETD schemes preserve the energy dissipation law unconditionally for the matrix-valued Allen-Cahn equation. Some numerical examples are presented to verify our theoretical results and to simulate the evolution of corresponding matrix fields.</p></details> |  |

| **[LiDAR-based End-to-end Temporal Perception for Vehicle-Infrastructure Cooperation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14927v1)** | 2024-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal perception, the ability to detect and track objects over time, is critical in autonomous driving for maintaining a comprehensive understanding of dynamic environments. However, this task is hindered by significant challenges, including incomplete perception caused by occluded objects and observational blind spots, which are common in single-vehicle perception systems. To address these issues, we introduce LET-VIC, a LiDAR-based End-to-End Tracking framework for Vehicle-Infrastructure Cooperation (VIC). LET-VIC leverages Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication to enhance temporal perception by fusing spatial and temporal data from both vehicle and infrastructure sensors. First, it spatially integrates Bird's Eye View (BEV) features from vehicle-side and infrastructure-side LiDAR data, creating a comprehensive view that mitigates occlusions and compensates for blind spots. Second, LET-VIC incorporates temporal context across frames, allowing the model to leverage historical data for enhanced tracking stability and accuracy. To further improve robustness, LET-VIC includes a Calibration Error Compensation (CEC) module to address sensor misalignments and ensure precise feature alignment. Experiments on the V2X-Seq-SPD dataset demonstrate that LET-VIC significantly outperforms baseline models, achieving at least a 13.7% improvement in mAP and a 13.1% improvement in AMOTA without considering communication delays. This work offers a practical solution and a new research direction for advancing temporal perception in autonomous driving through vehicle-infrastructure cooperation.</p></details> | 11 pages, 7 figures |

Specifically, these VLMs are constrained by frame limitations, often losing essential temporal details needed for accurate event localization in extended video content. We propose ReVisionLLM, a recursive vision-language model designed to locate events in hour-long videos. Inspired by human search strategies, our model initially targets broad segments of interest, progressively revising its focus to pinpoint exact temporal boundaries. Our model can seamlessly handle videos of vastly different lengths, from minutes to hours. We also introduce a hierarchical training strategy that starts with short clips to capture distinct events and progressively extends to longer videos. To our knowledge, ReVisionLLM is the first VLM capable of temporal grounding in hour-long videos, outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods across multiple datasets by a significant margin (+2.6% R1@0.1 on MAD). The code is available at https://github.com/Tanveer81/ReVisionLLM.</p></details> |  |
| **[TIMotion: Temporal and Interactive Framework for Efficient Human-Human Motion Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17135v2)** | 2024-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human-human motion generation is essential for understanding humans as social beings. Current methods fall into two main categories: single-person-based methods and separate modeling-based methods. To delve into this field, we abstract the overall generation process into a general framework MetaMotion, which consists of two phases: temporal modeling and interaction mixing. For temporal modeling, the single-person-based methods concatenate two people into a single one directly, while the separate modeling-based methods skip the modeling of interaction sequences. The inadequate modeling described above resulted in sub-optimal performance and redundant model parameters. In this paper, we introduce TIMotion (Temporal and Interactive Modeling), an efficient and effective framework for human-human motion generation. Specifically, we first propose Causal Interactive Injection to model two separate sequences as a causal sequence leveraging the temporal and causal properties. Then we present Role-Evolving Scanning to adjust to the change in the active and passive roles throughout the interaction. Finally, to generate smoother and more rational motion, we design Localized Pattern Amplification to capture short-term motion patterns. Extensive experiments on InterHuman and InterX demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance. The project code will be released upon acceptance.

This study focuses on using spatio-temporal disease mapping models to explore the temporal trends of IHD at the county level from 1999 to 2021. To manage the computational burden arising from the high-dimensional data, we employ scalable Bayesian models using a "divide and conquer" strategy. This approach allows for fast model fitting and serves as an efficient procedure for screening spatio-temporal patterns. Additionally, we analyze trends in four regional subdivisions, West, Midwest, South and Northeast, and in urban and rural areas. The dataset on IHD contains missing data, and we propose a procedure to impute the omitted information. The results show a slowdown in the decrease of IHD mortality in the US after 2014 with a slight increase noted after 2019. However, differences exists among the counties, the four big geographical regions, and rural and urban areas.</p></details> |  |
| **[ArrivalNet: Predicting City-wide Bus/Tram Arrival Time with Two-dimensional Temporal Variation Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14742v2)** | 2024-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate arrival time prediction (ATP) of buses and trams plays a crucial role in public transport operations. Current methods focused on modeling one-dimensional temporal information but overlooked the latent periodic information within time series. Moreover, most studies developed algorithms for ATP based on a single or a few routes of public transport, which reduces the transferability of the prediction models and their applicability in public transport management systems. To this end, this paper proposes \textit{ArrivalNet}, a two-dimensional temporal variation-based multi-step ATP for buses and trams. It decomposes the one-dimensional temporal sequence into intra-periodic and inter-periodic variations, which can be recast into two-dimensional tensors (2D blocks). Each row of a tensor contains the time points within a period, and each column involves the time points at the same intra-periodic index across various periods. The transformed 2D blocks in different frequencies have an image-like feature representation that enables effective learning with computer vision backbones (e.g., convolutional neural network). Drawing on the concept of residual neural network, the 2D block module is designed as a basic module for flexible aggregation. Meanwhile, contextual factors like workdays, peak hours, and intersections, are also utilized in the augmented feature representation to improve the performance of prediction. 125 days of public transport data from Dresden were collected for model training and validation. Experimental results show that the root mean square error, mean absolute error, and mean absolute percentage error of the proposed predictor decrease by at least 6.1\%, 14.7\%, and 34.2\% compared with state-of-the-art baseline methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Spatio-Temporal Signal Recognition on Edge Devices Using PointLCA-Net](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14585v1)** | 2024-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in machine learning, particularly through deep learning architectures like PointNet, have transformed the processing of three-dimensional (3D) point clouds, significantly improving 3D object classification and segmentation tasks. While 3D point clouds provide detailed spatial information, spatio-temporal signals introduce a dynamic element that accounts for changes over time. However, applying deep learning techniques to spatio-temporal signals and deploying them on edge devices presents challenges, including real-time processing, memory capacity, and power consumption. To address these issues, this paper presents a novel approach that combines PointNet's feature extraction with the in-memory computing capabilities and energy efficiency of neuromorphic systems for spatio-temporal signal recognition. The proposed method consists of a two-stage process: in the first stage, PointNet extracts features from the spatio-temporal signals, which are then stored in non-volatile memristor crossbar arrays. In the second stage, these features are processed by a single-layer spiking neural encoder-decoder that employs the Locally Competitive Algorithm (LCA) for efficient encoding and classification. This work integrates the strengths of both PointNet and LCA, enhancing computational efficiency and energy performance on edge devices. PointLCA-Net achieves high recognition accuracy for spatio-temporal data with substantially lower energy burden during both inference and training than comparable approaches, thus advancing the deployment of advanced neural architectures in energy-constrained environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2411.00140</p></details> |
| **[Semantics for Linear-time Temporal Logic with Finite Observations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14581v1)** | 2024-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LTL3 is a multi-valued variant of Linear-time Temporal Logic for runtime verification applications. The semantic descriptions of LTL3 in previous work are given only in terms of the relationship to conventional LTL. Our approach, by contrast, gives a full model-based inductive accounting of the semantics of LTL3, in terms of families of definitive prefix sets. We show that our definitive prefix sets are isomorphic to linear-time temporal properties (sets of infinite traces), and thereby show that our semantics of LTL3 directly correspond to the semantics of conventional LTL. In addition, we formalise the formula progression evaluation technique, popularly used in runtime verification and testing contexts, and show its soundness and completeness up to finite traces with respect to our semantics. All of our definitions and proofs are mechanised in Isabelle/HOL.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings EXPRESS/SOS 2024, arXiv:2411.13318</p></details> |

Current methods often rely on specialized architectural designs or task-specific fine-tuning to achieve this. We introduce Coarse Correspondences, a simple lightweight method that enhances MLLMs' spatial-temporal reasoning with 2D images as input, without modifying the architecture or requiring task-specific fine-tuning. Our method uses a lightweight tracking model to identify primary object correspondences between frames in a video or across different image viewpoints, and then conveys this information to MLLMs through visual prompting. We demonstrate that this simple training-free approach brings substantial gains to GPT4-V/O consistently on four benchmarks that require spatial-temporal reasoning, including +20.5\% improvement on ScanQA, +9.7\% on OpenEQA's episodic memory subset, +6.0\% on the long-form video benchmark EgoSchema, and +11\% on the R2R navigation benchmark. Additionally, we show that Coarse Correspondences can also enhance open-source MLLMs' spatial reasoning (by +6.9\% on ScanQA) when applied in both training and inference and that the improvement can generalize to unseen datasets such as SQA3D (+3.1\%). Taken together, we show that Coarse Correspondences effectively and efficiently boosts models' performance on downstream tasks requiring spatial-temporal reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>proje...</summary><p>project page: https://coarse-correspondence.github.io</p></details> |
| **[Trajectory Representation Learning on Road Networks and Grids with Spatio-Temporal Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14014v1)** | 2024-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory representation learning is a fundamental task for applications in fields including smart city, and urban planning, as it facilitates the utilization of trajectory data (e.g., vehicle movements) for various downstream applications, such as trajectory similarity computation or travel time estimation. This is achieved by learning low-dimensional representations from high-dimensional and raw trajectory data. However, existing methods for trajectory representation learning either rely on grid-based or road-based representations, which are inherently different and thus, could lose information contained in the other modality. Moreover, these methods overlook the dynamic nature of urban traffic, relying on static road network features rather than time varying traffic patterns. In this paper, we propose TIGR, a novel model designed to integrate grid and road network modalities while incorporating spatio-temporal dynamics to learn rich, general-purpose representations of trajectories. We evaluate TIGR on two realworld datasets and demonstrate the effectiveness of combining both modalities by substantially outperforming state-of-the-art methods, i.e., up to 43.22% for trajectory similarity, up to 16.65% for travel time estimation, and up to 10.16% for destination prediction.</p></details> |  |
| **[SpikEmo: Enhancing Emotion Recognition With Spiking Temporal Dynamics in Conversations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13917v1)** | 2024-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In affective computing, the task of Emotion Recognition in Conversations (ERC) has emerged as a focal area of research. The primary objective of this task is to predict emotional states within conversations by analyzing multimodal data including text, audio, and video. While existing studies have progressed in extracting and fusing representations from multimodal data, they often overlook the temporal dynamics in the data during conversations. To address this challenge, we have developed the SpikEmo framework, which is based on spiking neurons and employs a Semantic & Dynamic Two-stage Modeling approach to more precisely capture the complex temporal features of multimodal emotional data. Additionally, to tackle the class imbalance and emotional semantic similarity problems in the ERC tasks, we have devised an innovative combination of loss functions that significantly enhances the model's performance when dealing with ERC data characterized by long-tail distributions. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple ERC benchmark datasets demonstrate that SpikEmo significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in ERC tasks.

To address these limitations, we propose BiT-MamSleep, a novel architecture that integrates the Triple-Resolution CNN (TRCNN) for efficient multi-scale feature extraction with the Bidirectional Mamba (BiMamba) mechanism, which models both short- and long-term temporal dependencies through bidirectional processing of EEG data. Additionally, BiT-MamSleep incorporates an Adaptive Feature Recalibration (AFR) module and a temporal enhancement block to dynamically refine feature importance, optimizing classification accuracy without increasing computational complexity. To further improve robustness, we apply optimization techniques such as Focal Loss and SMOTE to mitigate class imbalance. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate that BiT-MamSleep significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly in handling long EEG sequences and addressing class imbalance, leading to more accurate and scalable sleep stage classification.</p></details> |  |
| **[MOT FCG++: Enhanced Representation of Spatio-temporal Motion and Appearance Features](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10028v2)** | 2024-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The goal of multi-object tracking (MOT) is to detect and track all objects in a scene across frames, while maintaining a unique identity for each object. Most existing methods rely on the spatial-temporal motion features and appearance embedding features of the detected objects in consecutive frames. Effectively and robustly representing the spatial and appearance features of long trajectories has become a critical factor affecting the performance of MOT. We propose a novel approach for appearance and spatial-temporal motion feature representation, improving upon the hierarchical clustering association method MOT FCG. For spatialtemporal motion features, we first propose Diagonal Modulated GIoU, which more accurately represents the relationship between the position and shape of the objects. Second, Mean Constant Velocity Modeling is proposed to reduce the effect of observation noise on target motion state estimation. For appearance features, we utilize a dynamic appearance representation that incorporates confidence information, enabling the trajectory appearance features to be more robust and global. Based on the baseline model MOT FCG, we have realized further improvements in the performance of all. we achieved 63.1 HOTA, 76.9 MOTA and 78.2 IDF1 on the MOT17 test set, and also achieved competitive performance on the MOT20 and DanceTrack sets.</p></details> | 14 pages, 7 figures |

The primary aim of the paper is to construct the spatiotemporal tube (STT) using a sampling-based approach and thereby devise a closed-form approximation-free control strategy to ensure that system trajectory reaches the target set while avoiding time-dependent unsafe sets. The proposed scheme utilizes a novel method involving STTs to provide controllers that guarantee both system safety and reachability. In our sampling-based framework, we translate the requirements of STTs into a Robust optimization program (ROP). To address the infeasibility of ROP caused by infinite constraints, we utilize the sampling-based Scenario optimization program (SOP). Subsequently, we solve the SOP to generate the tube and closed-form controller for an unknown system, ensuring the temporal reach-avoid-stay specification. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated through three case studies: an omnidirectional robot, a SCARA manipulator, and a magnetic levitation system.</p></details> |  |

Traditional transformer-based temporal fusion methods suffer from quadratic computational cost and information decay as the length of the frame sequence increases. In this paper, we propose a novel method called MambaDETR, whose main idea is to implement temporal fusion in the efficient state space. Moreover, we design a Motion Elimination module to remove the relatively static objects for temporal fusion. On the standard nuScenes benchmark, our proposed MambaDETR achieves remarkable result in the 3D object detection task, exhibiting state-of-the-art performance among existing temporal fusion methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[TSINR: Capturing Temporal Continuity via Implicit Neural Representations for Time Series Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11641v2)** | 2024-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series anomaly detection aims to identify unusual patterns in data or deviations from systems' expected behavior. The reconstruction-based methods are the mainstream in this task, which learn point-wise representation via unsupervised learning. However, the unlabeled anomaly points in training data may cause these reconstruction-based methods to learn and reconstruct anomalous data, resulting in the challenge of capturing normal patterns. In this paper, we propose a time series anomaly detection method based on implicit neural representation (INR) reconstruction, named TSINR, to address this challenge. Due to the property of spectral bias, TSINR enables prioritizing low-frequency signals and exhibiting poorer performance on high-frequency abnormal data. Specifically, we adopt INR to parameterize time series data as a continuous function and employ a transformer-based architecture to predict the INR of given data. As a result, the proposed TSINR method achieves the advantage of capturing the temporal continuity and thus is more sensitive to discontinuous anomaly data. In addition, we further design a novel form of INR continuous function to learn inter- and intra-channel information, and leverage a pre-trained large language model to amplify the intense fluctuations in anomalies. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TSINR achieves superior overall performance on both univariate and multivariate time series anomaly detection benchmarks compared to other state-of-the-art reconstruction-based methods.

However, real-world visual relationships often exhibit a long-tailed distribution, causing existing methods for tasks like Video Scene Graph Generation (VidSGG) and Scene Graph Anticipation (SGA) to produce biased scene graphs. To this end, we propose ImparTail, a novel training framework that leverages curriculum learning and loss masking to mitigate bias in the generation and anticipation of spatio-temporal scene graphs. Our approach gradually decreases the dominance of the head relationship classes during training and focuses more on tail classes, leading to more balanced training. Furthermore, we introduce two new tasks, Robust Spatio-Temporal Scene Graph Generation and Robust Scene Graph Anticipation, designed to evaluate the robustness of STSG models against distribution shifts. Extensive experiments on the Action Genome dataset demonstrate that our framework significantly enhances the unbiased performance and robustness of STSG models compared to existing methods.</p></details> | Under review |

However, most of them require a training set with ground truth sensor poses to obtain positive and negative samples of each observation's spatial neighborhood for supervised learning. When such information is unavailable, temporal neighborhoods from a sequentially collected data stream could be exploited for self-supervised training, although we find its performance suboptimal. Inspired by noisy label learning, we propose a novel self-supervised framework named TF-VPR that uses temporal neighborhoods and learnable feature neighborhoods to discover unknown spatial neighborhoods. Our method follows an iterative training paradigm which alternates between: (1) representation learning with data augmentation, (2) positive set expansion to include the current feature space neighbors, and (3) positive set contraction via geometric verification. We conduct auto-labeling and generalization tests on both simulated and real datasets, with either RGB images or point clouds as inputs. The results show that our method outperforms self-supervised baselines in recall rate, robustness, and heading diversity, a novel metric we propose for VPR.

However, the order of organs in scanned images has been disregarded by current medical image segmentation approaches based on UNet. Furthermore, the inherent network structure of UNet does not provide direct capabilities for integrating temporal information. To efficiently integrate temporal information, we propose TP-UNet that utilizes temporal prompts, encompassing organ-construction relationships, to guide the segmentation UNet model. Specifically, our framework is featured with cross-attention and semantic alignment based on unsupervised contrastive learning to combine temporal prompts and image features effectively. Extensive evaluations on two medical image segmentation datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of TP-UNet. Our implementation will be open-sourced after acceptance.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Foundation Model for Unified Urban Spatio-Temporal Flow Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12972v1)** | 2024-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Urban spatio-temporal flow prediction, encompassing traffic flows and crowd flows, is crucial for optimizing city infrastructure and managing traffic and emergency responses. Traditional approaches have relied on separate models tailored to either grid-based data, representing cities as uniform cells, or graph-based data, modeling cities as networks of nodes and edges. In this paper, we build UniFlow, a foundational model for general urban flow prediction that unifies both grid-based and graphbased data. We first design a multi-view spatio-temporal patching mechanism to standardize different data into a consistent sequential format and then introduce a spatio-temporal transformer architecture to capture complex correlations and dynamics. To leverage shared spatio-temporal patterns across different data types and facilitate effective cross-learning, we propose SpatioTemporal Memory Retrieval Augmentation (ST-MRA). By creating structured memory modules to store shared spatio-temporal patterns, ST-MRA enhances predictions through adaptive memory retrieval. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniFlow outperforms existing models in both grid-based and graph-based flow prediction, excelling particularly in scenarios with limited data availability, showcasing its superior performance and broad applicability. The datasets and code implementation have been released on https://github.com/YuanYuan98/UniFlow.</p></details> |  |
| **[CRT-Fusion: Camera, Radar, Temporal Fusion Using Motion Information for 3D Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03013v2)** | 2024-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate and robust 3D object detection is a critical component in autonomous vehicles and robotics. While recent radar-camera fusion methods have made significant progress by fusing information in the bird's-eye view (BEV) representation, they often struggle to effectively capture the motion of dynamic objects, leading to limited performance in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we introduce CRT-Fusion, a novel framework that integrates temporal information into radar-camera fusion to address this challenge. Our approach comprises three key modules: Multi-View Fusion (MVF), Motion Feature Estimator (MFE), and Motion Guided Temporal Fusion (MGTF). The MVF module fuses radar and image features within both the camera view and bird's-eye view, thereby generating a more precise unified BEV representation. The MFE module conducts two simultaneous tasks: estimation of pixel-wise velocity information and BEV segmentation. Based on the velocity and the occupancy score map obtained from the MFE module, the MGTF module aligns and fuses feature maps across multiple timestamps in a recurrent manner. By considering the motion of dynamic objects, CRT-Fusion can produce robust BEV feature maps, thereby improving detection accuracy and robustness. Extensive evaluations on the challenging nuScenes dataset demonstrate that CRT-Fusion achieves state-of-the-art performance for radar-camera-based 3D object detection. Our approach outperforms the previous best method in terms of NDS by +1.7%, while also surpassing the leading approach in mAP by +1.4%. These significant improvements in both metrics showcase the effectiveness of our proposed fusion strategy in enhancing the reliability and accuracy of 3D object detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS2024</p></details> |

Yet, such temporal comprehension capabilities are neither well-studied nor understood. So we conduct a study on prediction consistency -- a key indicator for robustness and trustworthiness of temporal grounding. After the model identifies an initial moment within the video content, we apply a series of probes to check if the model's responses align with this initial grounding as an indicator of reliable comprehension. Our results reveal that current Video-LLMs are sensitive to variations in video contents, language queries, and task settings, unveiling severe deficiencies in maintaining consistency. We further explore common prompting and instruction-tuning methods as potential solutions, but find that their improvements are often unstable. To that end, we propose event temporal verification tuning that explicitly accounts for consistency, and demonstrate significant improvements for both grounding and consistency. Our data and code will be available at https://github.com/minjoong507/Consistency-of-Video-LLM.</p></details> |  |

Many techniques were devised to investigate the evolution of temporal graphs by comparing their state at different time points. However, quantifying the similarity between temporal graphs as a whole is an open problem. Here, we use embeddings based on time-respecting random walks to introduce a new notion of distance between temporal graphs. This distance is well-defined for pairs of temporal graphs with different numbers of nodes and different time spans. We study the case of a matched pair of graphs, when a known relation exists between their nodes, and the case of unmatched graphs, when such a relation is unavailable and the graphs may be of different sizes. We use empirical and synthetic temporal network data to show that the distance we introduce discriminates graphs with different topological and temporal properties. We provide an efficient implementation of the distance computation suitable for large-scale temporal graphs.</p></details> |  |

We derive non-asymptotic bounds that lead to convergence rates, addressing both temporal and spatial dependence in the observed measurements. By accounting for dependencies across time and space, our models better reflect the complexities of real-world data, enhancing both predictive performance and theoretical robustness. We also tackle the curse of dimensionality by modeling the data on a manifold, exploring the intrinsic dimensionality of high-dimensional data. We broaden existing theoretical findings of temporal-spatial analysis by applying them to neural networks in more general contexts and demonstrate that our proof techniques are effective for models with short-range dependence. Our empirical simulations across various synthetic response functions underscore the superior performance of our method, outperforming established approaches in the existing literature. These findings provide valuable insights into the strong capabilities of dense neural networks for temporal-spatial modeling across a broad range of function classes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Revisiting Fake News Detection: Towards Temporality-aware Evaluation by Leveraging Engagement Earliness](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12775v1)** | 2024-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Social graph-based fake news detection aims to identify news articles containing false information by utilizing social contexts, e.g., user information, tweets and comments. However, conventional methods are evaluated under less realistic scenarios, where the model has access to future knowledge on article-related and context-related data during training. In this work, we newly formalize a more realistic evaluation scheme that mimics real-world scenarios, where the data is temporality-aware and the detection model can only be trained on data collected up to a certain point in time. We show that the discriminative capabilities of conventional methods decrease sharply under this new setting, and further propose DAWN, a method more applicable to such scenarios. Our empirical findings indicate that later engagements (e.g., consuming or reposting news) contribute more to noisy edges that link real news-fake news pairs in the social graph. Motivated by this, we utilize feature representations of engagement earliness to guide an edge weight estimator to suppress the weights of such noisy edges, thereby enhancing the detection performance of DAWN. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that DAWN outperforms existing fake news detection methods under real-world environments.

| **[Hierarchical Spatio-Temporal Uncertainty Quantification for Distributed Energy Adoption](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12193v1)** | 2024-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid deployment of distributed energy resources (DER) has introduced significant spatio-temporal uncertainties in power grid management, necessitating accurate multilevel forecasting methods. However, existing approaches often produce overly conservative uncertainty intervals at individual spatial units and fail to properly capture uncertainties when aggregating predictions across different spatial scales. This paper presents a novel hierarchical spatio-temporal model based on the conformal prediction framework to address these challenges. Our approach generates circuit-level DER growth predictions and efficiently aggregates them to the substation level while maintaining statistical validity through a tailored non-conformity score. Applied to a decade of DER installation data from a local utility network, our method demonstrates superior performance over existing approaches, particularly in reducing prediction interval widths while maintaining coverage.</p></details> |  |
| **[UrbanDiT: A Foundation Model for Open-World Urban Spatio-Temporal Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12164v1)** | 2024-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The urban environment is characterized by complex spatio-temporal dynamics arising from diverse human activities and interactions. Effectively modeling these dynamics is essential for understanding and optimizing urban systems In this work, we introduce UrbanDiT, a foundation model for open-world urban spatio-temporal learning that successfully scale up diffusion transformers in this field. UrbanDiT pioneers a unified model that integrates diverse spatio-temporal data sources and types while learning universal spatio-temporal patterns across different cities and scenarios. This allows the model to unify both multi-data and multi-task learning, and effectively support a wide range of spatio-temporal applications. Its key innovation lies in the elaborated prompt learning framework, which adaptively generates both data-driven and task-specific prompts, guiding the model to deliver superior performance across various urban applications. UrbanDiT offers three primary advantages: 1) It unifies diverse data types, such as grid-based and graph-based data, into a sequential format, allowing to capture spatio-temporal dynamics across diverse scenarios of different cities; 2) With masking strategies and task-specific prompts, it supports a wide range of tasks, including bi-directional spatio-temporal prediction, temporal interpolation, spatial extrapolation, and spatio-temporal imputation; and 3) It generalizes effectively to open-world scenarios, with its powerful zero-shot capabilities outperforming nearly all baselines with training data. These features allow UrbanDiT to achieves state-of-the-art performance in different domains such as transportation traffic, crowd flows, taxi demand, bike usage, and cellular traffic, across multiple cities and tasks. UrbanDiT sets up a new benchmark for foundation models in the urban spatio-temporal domain.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robust-Locomotion-by-Logic: Perturbation-Resilient Bipedal Locomotion via Signal Temporal Logic Guided Model Predictive Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15993v2)** | 2024-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study introduces a robust planning framework that utilizes a model predictive control (MPC) approach, enhanced by incorporating signal temporal logic (STL) specifications. This marks the first-ever study to apply STL-guided trajectory optimization for bipedal locomotion, specifically designed to handle both translational and orientational perturbations. Existing recovery strategies often struggle with reasoning complex task logic and evaluating locomotion robustness systematically, making them susceptible to failures caused by inappropriate recovery strategies or lack of robustness. To address these issues, we design an analytical stability metric for bipedal locomotion and quantify this metric using STL specifications, which guide the generation of recovery trajectories to achieve maximum robustness degree. To enable safe and computational-efficient crossed-leg maneuver, we design data-driven self-leg-collision constraints that are $1000$ times faster than the traditional inverse-kinematics-based approach. Our framework outperforms a state-of-the-art locomotion controller, a standard MPC without STL, and a linear-temporal-logic-based planner in a high-fidelity dynamic simulation, especially in scenarios involving crossed-leg maneuvers. Additionally, the Cassie bipedal robot achieves robust performance under horizontal and orientational perturbations such as those observed in ship motions. These environments are validated in simulations and deployed on hardware. Furthermore, our proposed method demonstrates versatility on stepping stones and terrain-agnostic features on inclined terrains.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-scale Restoration of Missing Data in Optical Time-series Images with Masked Spatial-Temporal Attention Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13358v2)** | 2024-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Remote sensing images often suffer from substantial data loss due to factors such as thick cloud cover and sensor limitations. Existing methods for imputing missing values in remote sensing images fail to fully exploit spatiotemporal auxiliary information, which restricts the accuracy of their reconstructions. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel deep learning-based approach called MS2TAN (Multi-Scale Masked Spatial-Temporal Attention Network) for reconstructing time-series remote sensing images. First, we introduce an efficient spatiotemporal feature extractor based on Masked Spatial-Temporal Attention (MSTA) to capture high-quality representations of spatiotemporal neighborhood features surrounding missing regions while significantly reducing the computational complexity of the attention mechanism. Second, a Multi-Scale Restoration Network composed of MSTA-based Feature Extractors is designed to progressively refine missing values by exploring spatiotemporal neighborhood features at different scales. Third, we propose a "Pixel-Structure-Perception" Multi-Objective Joint Optimization method to enhance the visual quality of the reconstructed results from multiple perspectives and to preserve more texture structures. Finally, quantitative experimental results under multi-temporal inputs on two public datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms competitive approaches, achieving a 9.76%/9.30% reduction in Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and a 0.56 dB/0.62 dB increase in Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), along with stronger texture and structural consistency. Ablation experiments further validate the contribution of the core innovations to imputation accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[TimeFormer: Capturing Temporal Relationships of Deformable 3D Gaussians for Robust Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11941v1)** | 2024-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dynamic scene reconstruction is a long-term challenge in 3D vision. Recent methods extend 3D Gaussian Splatting to dynamic scenes via additional deformation fields and apply explicit constraints like motion flow to guide the deformation. However, they learn motion changes from individual timestamps independently, making it challenging to reconstruct complex scenes, particularly when dealing with violent movement, extreme-shaped geometries, or reflective surfaces. To address the above issue, we design a plug-and-play module called TimeFormer to enable existing deformable 3D Gaussians reconstruction methods with the ability to implicitly model motion patterns from a learning perspective. Specifically, TimeFormer includes a Cross-Temporal Transformer Encoder, which adaptively learns the temporal relationships of deformable 3D Gaussians. Furthermore, we propose a two-stream optimization strategy that transfers the motion knowledge learned from TimeFormer to the base stream during the training phase. This allows us to remove TimeFormer during inference, thereby preserving the original rendering speed. Extensive experiments in the multi-view and monocular dynamic scenes validate qualitative and quantitative improvement brought by TimeFormer.

| **[Generative Spatio-temporal GraphNet for Transonic Wing Pressure Distribution Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11592v1)** | 2024-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study presents a framework for predicting unsteady transonic wing pressure distributions, integrating an autoencoder architecture with graph convolutional networks and graph-based temporal layers to model time dependencies. The framework compresses high-dimensional pressure distribution data into a lower-dimensional latent space using an autoencoder, ensuring efficient data representation while preserving essential features. Within this latent space, graph-based temporal layers are employed to predict future wing pressures based on past data, effectively capturing temporal dependencies and improving predictive accuracy. This combined approach leverages the strengths of autoencoders for dimensionality reduction, graph convolutional networks for handling unstructured grid data, and temporal layers for modeling time-based sequences. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is validated through its application to the Benchmark Super Critical Wing test case, achieving accuracy comparable to computational fluid dynamics, while significantly reducing prediction time. This framework offers a scalable, computationally efficient solution for the aerodynamic analysis of unsteady phenomena.</p></details> |  |
| **[Structure learning with Temporal Gaussian Mixture for model-based Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11511v1)** | 2024-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model-based reinforcement learning refers to a set of approaches capable of sample-efficient decision making, which create an explicit model of the environment. This model can subsequently be used for learning optimal policies. In this paper, we propose a temporal Gaussian Mixture Model composed of a perception model and a transition model. The perception model extracts discrete (latent) states from continuous observations using a variational Gaussian mixture likelihood. Importantly, our model constantly monitors the collected data searching for new Gaussian components, i.e., the perception model performs a form of structure learning (Smith et al., 2020; Friston et al., 2018; Neacsu et al., 2022) as it learns the number of Gaussian components in the mixture. Additionally, the transition model learns the temporal transition between consecutive time steps by taking advantage of the Dirichlet-categorical conjugacy. Both the perception and transition models are able to forget part of the data points, while integrating the information they provide within the prior, which ensure fast variational inference. Finally, decision making is performed with a variant of Q-learning which is able to learn Q-values from beliefs over states. Empirically, we have demonstrated the model's ability to learn the structure of several mazes: the model discovered the number of states and the transition probabilities between these states. Moreover, using its learned Q-values, the agent was able to successfully navigate from the starting position to the maze's exit.</p></details> |  |
| **[Temporal and Spatial Reservoir Ensembling Techniques for Liquid State Machines](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11414v1)** | 2024-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reservoir computing (RC), is a class of computational methods such as Echo State Networks (ESN) and Liquid State Machines (LSM) describe a generic method to perform pattern recognition and temporal analysis with any non-linear system. This is enabled by Reservoir Computing being a shallow network model with only Input, Reservoir, and Readout layers where input and reservoir weights are not learned (only the readout layer is trained). LSM is a special case of Reservoir computing inspired by the organization of neurons in the brain and generally refers to spike-based Reservoir computing approaches. LSMs have been successfully used to showcase decent performance on some neuromorphic vision and speech datasets but a common problem associated with LSMs is that since the model is more-or-less fixed, the main way to improve the performance is by scaling up the Reservoir size, but that only gives diminishing rewards despite a tremendous increase in model size and computation. In this paper, we propose two approaches for effectively ensembling LSM models - Multi-Length Scale Reservoir Ensemble (MuLRE) and Temporal Excitation Partitioned Reservoir Ensemble (TEPRE) and benchmark them on Neuromorphic-MNIST (N-MNIST), Spiking Heidelberg Digits (SHD), and DVSGesture datasets, which are standard neuromorphic benchmarks. We achieve 98.1% test accuracy on N-MNIST with a 3600-neuron LSM model which is higher than any prior LSM-based approach and 77.8% test accuracy on the SHD dataset which is on par with a standard Recurrent Spiking Neural Network trained by Backprop Through Time (BPTT). We also propose receptive field-based input weights to the Reservoir to work alongside the Multi-Length Scale Reservoir ensemble model for vision tasks. Thus, we introduce effective means of scaling up the performance of LSM models and evaluate them against relevant neuromorphic benchmarks</p></details> |  |

Existing thermal comfort models usually overlook temporal dynamics alongside spatial dependencies. We address this problem by introducing a spatio-temporal jump model that clusters data with persistence across both spatial and temporal dimensions. This framework enhances interpretability, minimizes abrupt state changes, and easily handles missing data. We validate our approach through extensive simulations, demonstrating its accuracy in recovering the true underlying partition. When applied to hourly environmental data gathered from a set of weather stations located across the city of Singapore, our proposal identifies meaningful thermal comfort regimes, demonstrating its effectiveness in dynamic urban settings and suitability for real-world monitoring. The comparison of these regimes with feedback on thermal preference indicates the potential of an unsupervised approach to avoid extensive surveys.</p></details> |  |
| **[DemMamba: Alignment-free Raw Video Demoireing with Frequency-assisted Spatio-Temporal Mamba](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10679v2)** | 2024-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Moire patterns, resulting from the interference of two similar repetitive patterns, are frequently observed during the capture of images or videos on screens. These patterns vary in color, shape, and location across video frames, posing challenges in extracting information from adjacent frames and preserving temporal consistency throughout the restoration process. Existing deep learning methods often depend on well-designed alignment modules, such as optical flow estimation, deformable convolution, and cross-frame self-attention layers, incurring high computational costs. Recent studies indicate that utilizing raw data as input can significantly improve the effectiveness of video demoireing by providing the pristine degradation information and more detailed content. However, previous works fail to design both efficient and effective raw video demoireing methods that can maintain temporal consistency and prevent degradation of color and spatial details. This paper introduces a novel alignment-free raw video demoireing network with frequency-assisted spatio-temporal Mamba (DemMamba). It features sequentially arranged Spatial Mamba Blocks (SMB) and Temporal Mamba Blocks (TMB) to effectively model the inter- and intra-relationships in raw videos affected by moire patterns. An Adaptive Frequency Block (AFB) within the SMB facilitates demoireing in the frequency domain, while a Channel Attention Block (CAB) in the TMB enhances the temporal information interactions by leveraging inter-channel relationships among features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed DemMamba surpasses state-of-the-art methods by 1.3 dB in PSNR, and also provides a satisfactory visual experience.</p></details> |  |
| **[Structural temporal logic for mechanized program verification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14906v3)** | 2024-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mechanized verification of liveness properties for programs with effects, nondeterminism, and nontermination is difficult. Existing temporal reasoning frameworks operate on the level of models (traces, automata) not executable code, creating a verification gap and losing the benefits of modularity and composition enjoyed by structural program logics. Reasoning about infinite traces and automata requires complex (co-)inductive proof techniques and familiarity with proof assistant mechanics (e.g., guardedness checker). We propose a structural approach to the verification of temporal properties with a new temporal logic that we call Ticl. Using Ticl, we internalize complex (co-)inductive proof techniques to structural lemmas and reasoning about variants and invariants. We show that it is possible to perform mechanized proofs of general temporal properties, while working in a high-level of abstraction. We demonstrate the benefits of ticl by giving short, structural proofs of safety and liveness properties for programs with queues, secure memory, and distributed consensus.</p></details> | 24 pages, 13 figures |

Though large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance in many reasoning tasks, temporal reasoning remains challenging due to its intrinsic complexity. In this work, we first study an essential task of temporal reasoning -- temporal graph generation, to unveil LLMs' inherent, global reasoning capabilities. We show that this task presents great challenges even for the most powerful LLMs, such as GPT-3.5/4. We also notice a significant performance gap by small models (<10B) that lag behind LLMs by 50%. Next, we study how to close this gap with a budget constraint, e.g., not using model finetuning. We propose a new prompting technique tailored for temporal reasoning, Narrative-of-Thought (NoT), that first converts the events set to a Python class, then prompts a small model to generate a temporally grounded narrative, guiding the final generation of a temporal graph. Extensive experiments showcase the efficacy of NoT in improving various metrics. Notably, NoT attains the highest F1 on the Schema-11 evaluation set, while securing an overall F1 on par with GPT-3.5. NoT also achieves the best structural similarity across the board, even compared with GPT-3.5/4. Our code is available at https://github.com/launchnlp/NoT.</p></details> | EMNLP'24 Findings |

Spatial-temporal information in videos is crucial, but the accuracy of spatial-temporal information is often influenced by issues like low quality and occlusions in videos. Existing methods mainly focus on reducing modality differences, but pay limited attention to improving spatial-temporal features, particularly for infrared videos. To address this, we propose a novel Skeleton-guided spatial-Temporal feAture leaRning (STAR) method for VVI-ReID. By using skeleton information, which is robust to issues such as poor image quality and occlusions, STAR improves the accuracy of spatial-temporal features in videos of both modalities. Specifically, STAR employs two levels of skeleton-guided strategies: frame level and sequence level. At the frame level, the robust structured skeleton information is used to refine the visual features of individual frames. At the sequence level, we design a feature aggregation mechanism based on skeleton key points graph, which learns the contribution of different body parts to spatial-temporal features, further enhancing the accuracy of global features. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that STAR outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Code will be open source soon.</p></details> |  |

Temporal duration of anomalies vary within video streams, leading to complications in learning the temporal dynamics of specific events. This paper presents a temporal-granularity method for an anomaly detection model (TeG) in real-world surveillance, combining spatio-temporal features at different time-scales. The TeG model employs multi-head cross-attention blocks and multi-head self-attention blocks for this purpose. Additionally, we extend the UCF-Crime dataset with new anomaly types relevant to Smart City research project. The TeG model is deployed and validated in a city surveillance system, achieving successful real-time results in industrial settings.</p></details> |  |

In a transductive graph learning setting, where each node is associated with a timestamp, we focus on the task of Semi-Supervised Node Classification (SSNC), aiming to classify recent nodes using labels of past nodes. Temporal dependencies in node connections create domain shifts, causing significant performance degradation when applying models trained on historical data into recent data. Given the practical relevance of this scenario, addressing domain adaptation in chronological split data is crucial, yet underexplored. We propose Imposing invariance with Message Passing in Chronological split Temporal Graphs (IMPaCT), a method that imposes invariant properties based on realistic assumptions derived from temporal graph structures. Unlike traditional domain adaptation approaches which rely on unverifiable assumptions, IMPaCT explicitly accounts for the characteristics of chronological splits. The IMPaCT is further supported by rigorous mathematical analysis, including a derivation of an upper bound of the generalization error. Experimentally, IMPaCT achieves a 3.8% performance improvement over current SOTA method on the ogbn-mag graph dataset. Additionally, we introduce the Temporal Stochastic Block Model (TSBM), which replicates temporal graphs under varying conditions, demonstrating the applicability of our methods to general spatial GNNs.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages (without appendix), 35 pages (with appendix), 14 figures</p></details> |

Until now, no tabular method has consistently outperformed classical supervised learning, which ignores these shifts. To address temporal distribution shifts, we present Drift-Resilient TabPFN, a fresh approach based on In-Context Learning with a Prior-Data Fitted Network that learns the learning algorithm itself: it accepts the entire training dataset as input and makes predictions on the test set in a single forward pass. Specifically, it learns to approximate Bayesian inference on synthetic datasets drawn from a prior that specifies the model's inductive bias. This prior is based on structural causal models (SCM), which gradually shift over time. To model shifts of these causal models, we use a secondary SCM, that specifies changes in the primary model parameters. The resulting Drift-Resilient TabPFN can be applied to unseen data, runs in seconds on small to moderately sized datasets and needs no hyperparameter tuning. Comprehensive evaluations across 18 synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate large performance improvements over a wide range of baselines, such as XGB, CatBoost, TabPFN, and applicable methods featured in the Wild-Time benchmark. Compared to the strongest baselines, it improves accuracy from 0.688 to 0.744 and ROC AUC from 0.786 to 0.832 while maintaining stronger calibration. This approach could serve as significant groundwork for further research on out-of-distribution prediction.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 38th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2024)</p></details> |

Normalised Mutual Information (NMI) has been used to measure the similarity of communities when the nodes on a network do not change. We propose two extensions namely Union-Normalised Mutual Information (UNMI) and Intersection-Normalised Mutual Information (INMI). UNMI and INMI evaluate the similarity of community structure under the condition of node variation. Experiments show that these methods are effective in dealing with temporal networks with the changes in the set of nodes, and can capture the dynamic evolution of community structure in both synthetic and real temporal networks. This study not only provides a new similarity measurement method for network analysis but also helps to deepen the understanding of community change in complex temporal networks.</p></details> |  |

These individuals often face earlier onset and higher prevalence of MLTCs, yet specific co-occurrence patterns remain unexplored. This study applies an unsupervised approach to characterise MLTC clusters based on shared disease trajectories using electronic health records (EHRs) from 13069 individuals with ID in Wales (2000-2021). Disease associations and temporal directionality were assessed, followed by spectral clustering to group shared trajectories. The population consisted of 52.3% males and 47.7% females, with an average of 4.5 conditions per patient. Males under 45 formed a single cluster dominated by neurological conditions (32.4%), while males above 45 had three clusters, the largest characterised circulatory (51.8%). Females under 45 formed one cluster with digestive conditions (24.6%) as most prevalent, while those aged 45 and older showed two clusters: one dominated by circulatory (34.1%), and the other by digestive (25.9%) and musculoskeletal (21.9%) system conditions. Mental illness, epilepsy, and reflux were common across groups. These clusters offer insights into disease progression in individuals with ID, informing targeted interventions and personalised healthcare strategies.</p></details> |  |

However, they struggle to extend this visual understanding to tasks requiring precise temporal localization, known as Video Temporal Grounding (VTG). To address this gap, we introduce Number-Prompt (NumPro), a novel method that empowers Vid-LLMs to bridge visual comprehension with temporal grounding by adding unique numerical identifiers to each video frame. Treating a video as a sequence of numbered frame images, NumPro transforms VTG into an intuitive process: flipping through manga panels in sequence. This allows Vid-LLMs to "read" event timelines, accurately linking visual content with corresponding temporal information. Our experiments demonstrate that NumPro significantly boosts VTG performance of top-tier Vid-LLMs without additional computational cost. Furthermore, fine-tuning on a NumPro-enhanced dataset defines a new state-of-the-art for VTG, surpassing previous top-performing methods by up to 6.9\% in mIoU for moment retrieval and 8.5\% in mAP for highlight detection. The code will be available at https://github.com/yongliang-wu/NumPro.</p></details> | 11 pages, 7 figures |

However, current methods often overlook the critical importance of preserving symmetry when generating scene graphs from 3D point clouds, which can lead to reduced accuracy and robustness, particularly when dealing with noisy, multi-view data. This work, to the best of our knowledge, presents the first implementation of an Equivariant Scene Graph Neural Network (ESGNN) to generate semantic scene graphs from 3D point clouds, specifically for enhanced scene understanding. Furthermore, a significant limitation of prior methods is the absence of temporal modeling to capture time-dependent relationships among dynamically evolving entities within a scene. To address this gap, we introduce a novel temporal layer that leverages the symmetry-preserving properties of ESGNN to fuse scene graphs across multiple sequences into a unified global representation by an approximate graph-matching algorithm. Our combined architecture, termed the Temporal Equivariant Scene Graph Neural Network (TESGNN), not only surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods in scene estimation accuracy but also achieves faster convergence. Importantly, TESGNN is computationally efficient and straightforward to implement using existing frameworks, making it well-suited for real-time applications in robotics and computer vision. This approach paves the way for more robust and scalable solutions to complex multi-view scene understanding challenges.

| **[MDHP-Net: Detecting Injection Attacks on In-vehicle Network using Multi-Dimensional Hawkes Process and Temporal Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10258v1)** | 2024-11-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of intelligent and connected technologies in modern vehicles, while offering enhanced functionalities through Electronic Control Unit and interfaces like OBD-II and telematics, also exposes the vehicle's in-vehicle network (IVN) to potential cyberattacks. In this paper, we consider a specific type of cyberattack known as the injection attack. As demonstrated by empirical data from real-world cybersecurity adversarial competitions(available at https://mimic2024.xctf.org.cn/race/qwmimic2024 ), these injection attacks have excitation effect over time, gradually manipulating network traffic and disrupting the vehicle's normal functioning, ultimately compromising both its stability and safety. To profile the abnormal behavior of attackers, we propose a novel injection attack detector to extract long-term features of attack behavior. Specifically, we first provide a theoretical analysis of modeling the time-excitation effects of the attack using Multi-Dimensional Hawkes Process (MDHP). A gradient descent solver specifically tailored for MDHP, MDHP-GDS, is developed to accurately estimate optimal MDHP parameters. We then propose an injection attack detector, MDHP-Net, which integrates optimal MDHP parameters with MDHP-LSTM blocks to enhance temporal feature extraction. By introducing MDHP parameters, MDHP-Net captures complex temporal features that standard Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) cannot, enriching temporal dependencies within our customized structure. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed detection approach.</p></details> |  |

These surveys gather information on the health status of individual respondents, including details on their behaviours, risk factors, and relevant socio-demographic information. While the collected data undoubtedly provides valuable information, modelling such data presents several challenges. For instance, in health risk models, it is essential to consider behavioural information, local and temporal dynamics, and disease co-occurrence. In response to these challenges, our work proposes a multivariate temporal logistic model for chronic disease diagnoses at local level. Linear predictors are modelled using individual risk factor covariates and a latent individual propensity to diseases. Leveraging a state space formulation of the model, we construct a framework in which temporal heterogeneity in regression coefficients is informed by exogenous information at local level, correspond ing to different contextual risk factors that may affect the occurrence of chronic diseases in different ways. To explore the utility and the effectiveness of our method, we analyse behavioural and risk factor surveillance data collected in Italy (PASSI), which is well-known as a country characterised by high peculiar administrative, social and territorial diversities reflected on high variability in morbidity among population subgroups.</p></details> | revised |

Traditional methods, which use recurrent neural networks to capture temporal patterns, have proven their effectiveness but come with high system complexity and computational demand. Convolutions could offer a more efficient alternative but are limited by their characteristic of treating all previous frames equally, resulting in poor temporal characterization, and by their local receptive field, limiting the capacity to capture distant correlations among frames. In this paper, we propose STLight, a novel method for spatio-temporal learning that relies solely on channel-wise and depth-wise convolutions as learnable layers. STLight overcomes the limitations of traditional convolutional approaches by rearranging spatial and temporal dimensions together, using a single convolution to mix both types of features into a comprehensive spatio-temporal patch representation. This representation is then processed in a purely convolutional framework, capable of focusing simultaneously on the interaction among near and distant patches, and subsequently allowing for efficient reconstruction of the predicted frames. Our architecture achieves state-of-the-art performance on STL benchmarks across different datasets and settings, while significantly improving computational efficiency in terms of parameters and computational FLOPs.

Predicting these extreme events remains challenging, as their complex interactions with large-scale atmospheric and climatic variables are difficult to capture with traditional statistical and dynamical models. This work presents a general method for driver identification in extreme climate events. A novel framework (STCO-FS) is proposed to identify key immediate (short-term) HW drivers by combining clustering algorithms with an ensemble evolutionary algorithm. The framework analyzes spatio-temporal data, reduces dimensionality by grouping similar geographical nodes for each variable, and develops driver selection in spatial and temporal domains, identifying the best time lags between predictive variables and HW occurrences. The proposed method has been applied to analyze HWs in the Adda river basin in Italy. The approach effectively identifies significant variables influencing HWs in this region. This research can potentially enhance our understanding of HW drivers and predictability.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, 10 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

In this paper, we demonstrate that effective information compression may occur over time or space during sequences of node communications in distributed algorithms, leading to the concept of spatio-temporal compressors. This abstraction classifies existing compressors as spatio-temporal compressors, with their effectiveness described by constructive stability criteria from nonlinear system theory. Subsequently, we apply these spatio-temporal compressors to standard continuous-time consensus flows and distributed prime-dual flows, establishing conditions ensuring convergence. Additionally, we introduce a novel observer-based distributed primal-dual continuous flow integrated with spatio-temporal compressors, which provides broader convergence conditions. These continuous flows achieve exponential convergence to the global optimum when the objective function is strongly convex and can be discretized using Euler approximations. Finally, numerical simulations illustrate the versatility of the proposed spatio-temporal compressors and verify the convergence of algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2408.02332</p></details> |

Traditional models for time series data prediction, such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), are inefficient and generalize poorly as they cannot capture complex temporal relationships. In this paper, we present a probabilistic generative model that can be trained to capture temporal information, and that is robust to data errors. We call it Time Deep Latent Gaussian Model (tDLGM). Its novel architecture is inspired by Deep Latent Gaussian Model (DLGM). Our model is trained to minimize a loss function based on the negative log loss. One contributing factor to Time Deep Latent Gaussian Model (tDLGM) robustness is our regularizer, which accounts for data trends. Experiments conducted show that tDLGM is able to reconstruct and generate complex time series data, and that it is robust against to noise and faulty data.</p></details> | <details><summary>New r...</summary><p>New revision added a space between "for" and "Time-Series" in the title</p></details> |
| **[Spatio-Temporal Communication Compression in Distributed Prime-Dual Flows](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02332v2)** | 2024-11-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we study distributed prime-dual flows for multi-agent optimization with spatio-temporal compressions. The central aim of multi-agent optimization is for a network of agents to collaboratively solve a system-level optimization problem with local objective functions and node-to-node communication by distributed algorithms. The scalability of such algorithms crucially depends on the complexity of the communication messages, and a number of communication compressors for distributed optimization have recently been proposed in the literature. First of all, we introduce a general spatio-temporal compressor characterized by the stability of the resulting dynamical system along the vector field of the compressor. We show that several important distributed optimization compressors such as the greedy sparsifier, the uniform quantizer, and the scalarizer all fall into the category of this spatio-temporal compressor. Next, we propose two distributed prime-dual flows with the spatio-temporal compressors being applied to local node states and local error states, respectively, and prove (exponential) convergence of the node trajectories to the global optimizer for (strongly) convex cost functions. Finally, a few numerical examples are present to illustrate our theoretical results.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Agent Control Synthesis from Global Temporal Logic Tasks with Synchronous Satisfaction Requirements](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11477v3)** | 2024-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper addresses the multi-agent control problem under global temporal logic tasks, considering agents with heterogeneous capabilities. These global tasks involve not only absolute and relative temporal and spatial constraints, but also group behaviors, including task completion times, agent capabilities, and task interdependencies such as the need for synchronous execution. The global tasks are formally formulated into global signal temporal logic (STL) formulae, and a synchronous robustness metric is designed to evaluate the synchronization quality with real values. A mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) encoding method is further proposed to realize task-satisfied motion planning with high synchronicity and minimum control efforts. The encoding method uses a logarithmic number of binary variables to fully capture synchronous robustness, leading to only linear computational complexity. Simulations are conducted to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed control strategy.</p></details> | 10 pages, 4 figures |

One critical issue is bridging the gap between discrete entities in low-level observations and the abstract concepts required for effective planning. A common solution is building hierarchical agents, where VLMs serve as high-level reasoners that break down tasks into executable sub-tasks, typically specified using language. However, language suffers from the inability to communicate detailed spatial information. We propose visual-temporal context prompting, a novel communication protocol between VLMs and policy models. This protocol leverages object segmentation from past observations to guide policy-environment interactions. Using this approach, we train ROCKET-1, a low-level policy that predicts actions based on concatenated visual observations and segmentation masks, supported by real-time object tracking from SAM-2. Our method unlocks the potential of VLMs, enabling them to tackle complex tasks that demand spatial reasoning. Experiments in Minecraft show that our approach enables agents to achieve previously unattainable tasks, with a $\mathbf{76}\%$ absolute improvement in open-world interaction performance. Codes and demos are now available on the project page: https://craftjarvis.github.io/ROCKET-1.</p></details> |  |
| **[Grounding is All You Need? Dual Temporal Grounding for Video Dialog](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05767v2)** | 2024-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the realm of video dialog response generation, the understanding of video content and the temporal nuances of conversation history are paramount. While a segment of current research leans heavily on large-scale pretrained visual-language models and often overlooks temporal dynamics, another delves deep into spatial-temporal relationships within videos but demands intricate object trajectory pre-extractions and sidelines dialog temporal dynamics. This paper introduces the Dual Temporal Grounding-enhanced Video Dialog model (DTGVD), strategically designed to merge the strengths of both dominant approaches. It emphasizes dual temporal relationships by predicting dialog turn-specific temporal regions, filtering video content accordingly, and grounding responses in both video and dialog contexts. One standout feature of DTGVD is its heightened attention to chronological interplay. By recognizing and acting upon the dependencies between different dialog turns, it captures more nuanced conversational dynamics. To further bolster the alignment between video and dialog temporal dynamics, we've implemented a list-wise contrastive learning strategy. Within this framework, accurately grounded turn-clip pairings are designated as positive samples, while less precise pairings are categorized as negative. This refined classification is then funneled into our holistic end-to-end response generation mechanism. Evaluations using AVSD@DSTC-7 and AVSD@DSTC-8 datasets underscore the superiority of our methodology.</p></details> |  |
| **[Cross Space and Time: A Spatio-Temporal Unitized Model for Traffic Flow Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09251v1)** | 2024-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting spatio-temporal traffic flow presents significant challenges due to complex interactions between spatial and temporal factors. Existing approaches often address these dimensions in isolation, neglecting their critical interdependencies. In this paper, we introduce the Spatio-Temporal Unitized Model (STUM), a unified framework designed to capture both spatial and temporal dependencies while addressing spatio-temporal heterogeneity through techniques such as distribution alignment and feature fusion. It also ensures both predictive accuracy and computational efficiency. Central to STUM is the Adaptive Spatio-temporal Unitized Cell (ASTUC), which utilizes low-rank matrices to seamlessly store, update, and interact with space, time, as well as their correlations. Our framework is also modular, allowing it to integrate with various spatio-temporal graph neural networks through components such as backbone models, feature extractors, residual fusion blocks, and predictive modules to collectively enhance forecasting outcomes. Experimental results across multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that STUM consistently improves prediction performance with minimal computational cost. These findings are further supported by hyperparameter optimization, pre-training analysis, and result visualization. We provide our source code for reproducibility at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/STUM-E4F0.</p></details> |  |
| **[STARFlow: Spatial Temporal Feature Re-embedding with Attentive Learning for Real-world Scene Flow](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07032v2)** | 2024-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scene flow prediction is a crucial underlying task in understanding dynamic scenes as it offers fundamental motion information. However, contemporary scene flow methods encounter three major challenges. Firstly, flow estimation solely based on local receptive fields lacks long-dependency matching of point pairs. To address this issue, we propose global attentive flow embedding to match all-to-all point pairs in both feature space and Euclidean space, providing global initialization before local refinement. Secondly, there are deformations existing in non-rigid objects after warping, which leads to variations in the spatiotemporal relation between the consecutive frames. For a more precise estimation of residual flow, a spatial temporal feature re-embedding module is devised to acquire the sequence features after deformation. Furthermore, previous methods perform poor generalization due to the significant domain gap between the synthesized and LiDAR-scanned datasets. We leverage novel domain adaptive losses to effectively bridge the gap of motion inference from synthetic to real-world. Experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance across various datasets, with particularly outstanding results on real-world LiDAR-scanned datasets.

| **[Integrating Fuzzy Set Theory with Pandora Temporal Fault Trees for Dynamic Failure Analysis of Complex Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09717v1)** | 2024-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pandora temporal fault tree, as one notable extension of the fault tree, introduces temporal gates and temporal laws. Pandora Temporal Fault Tree(TFT) enhances the capability of fault trees and enables the modeling of system failure behavior that depends on sequences. The calculation of system failure probability in Pandora TFT relies on precise probabilistic information on component failures. However, obtaining such precise failure data can often be challenging. The data may be uncertain as historical records are used to derive failure data for system components. To mitigate this uncertainty, in this study, we proposed a method that integrates fuzzy set theory with Pandora TFT. This integration aims to enable dynamic analysis of complex systems, even in cases where quantitative failure data of components is unreliable or imprecise. The proposed work introduces the development of Fuzzy AND, Fuzzy OR, Fuzzy PAND, and Fuzzy POR logic gates for Pandora TFT. We also introduce a fuzzy importance measure for criticality analysis of basic events. All events in our analysis are assumed to have exponentially distributed failures, with their failure rates represented as triangular fuzzy numbers. We illustrate the proposed method through a case study of the Aircraft Fuel Distribution System (AFDS), highlighting its practical application and effectiveness in analyzing complex systems. The results are compared with existing results from Petri net and Bayesian network techniques to validate the findings.</p></details> |  |

Previous studies under this theory have examined myriad characteristics of recombined knowledge and their performance implications. One such feature that has received much attention is technological knowledge age. Yet, little is known about how the age of scientific knowledge influences the impact of inventions, despite the widely known catalyzing role of science in the creation of new technologies. Here we use a large corpus of patents and derive features characterizing how patents temporally search in the scientific space. We find that patents that cite scientific papers have more citations and substantially more likely to become breakthroughs. Conditional on searching in the scientific space, referencing more recent papers increases the impact of patents and the likelihood of being breakthroughs. However, this positive effect can be offset if patents cite papers whose ages exhibit a low variance. These effects are consistent across technological fields.</p></details> |  |
| **[DeBaTeR: Denoising Bipartite Temporal Graph for Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09181v1)** | 2024-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to the difficulty of acquiring large-scale explicit user feedback, implicit feedback (e.g., clicks or other interactions) is widely applied as an alternative source of data, where user-item interactions can be modeled as a bipartite graph. Due to the noisy and biased nature of implicit real-world user-item interactions, identifying and rectifying noisy interactions are vital to enhance model performance and robustness. Previous works on purifying user-item interactions in collaborative filtering mainly focus on mining the correlation between user/item embeddings and noisy interactions, neglecting the benefit of temporal patterns in determining noisy interactions. Time information, while enhancing the model utility, also bears its natural advantage in helping to determine noisy edges, e.g., if someone usually watches horror movies at night and talk shows in the morning, a record of watching a horror movie in the morning is more likely to be noisy interaction. Armed with this observation, we introduce a simple yet effective mechanism for generating time-aware user/item embeddings and propose two strategies for denoising bipartite temporal graph in recommender systems (DeBaTeR): the first is through reweighting the adjacency matrix (DeBaTeR-A), where a reliability score is defined to reweight the edges through both soft assignment and hard assignment; the second is through reweighting the loss function (DeBaTeR-L), where weights are generated to reweight user-item samples in the losses. Extensive experiments have been conducted to demonstrate the efficacy of our methods and illustrate how time information indeed helps identifying noisy edges.</p></details> |  |

We consider the problem of hierarchically decomposing the network and introduce an edge-based decomposition framework that unifies the core and truss decompositions for temporal networks while allowing us to consider the network's temporal dimension. Based on our new framework, we introduce the $(k,\Delta)$-core and $(k,\Delta)$-truss decompositions, which are generalizations of the classic $k$-core and $k$-truss decompositions for multigraphs. Moreover, we show how $(k,\Delta)$-cores and $(k,\Delta)$-trusses can be efficiently further decomposed to obtain spatially and temporally connected components. We evaluate the characteristics of our new decompositions and the efficiency of our algorithms. Moreover, we demonstrate how our $(k,\Delta)$-decompositions can be applied to analyze malicious content in a Twitter network to obtain insights that state-of-the-art baselines cannot obtain.</p></details> | Accepted at WSDM'25 |

However, this reconstruction faces unprecedented challenges due to the everincreasing communication overhead, especially for digital robot arm reconstruction. To this end, we propose a novel goal-oriented semantic communication (GSC) framework to extract the GSC information for the robot arm reconstruction task in the DT, with the aim of minimising the communication load under the strict and relaxed reconstruction error constraints. Unlike the traditional reconstruction framework that periodically transmits a reconstruction message for real-time DT reconstruction, our framework implements a feature selection (FS) algorithm to extract the semantic information from the reconstruction message, and a deep reinforcement learning-based temporal selection algorithm to selectively transmit the semantic information over time. We validate our proposed GSC framework through both Pybullet simulations and lab experiments based on the Franka Research 3 robot arm. For a range of distinct robotic tasks, simulation results show that our framework can reduce the communication load by at least 59.5% under strict reconstruction error constraints and 80% under relaxed reconstruction error constraints, compared with traditional communication framework. Also, experimental results confirm the effectiveness of our framework, where the communication load is reduced by 53% in strict constraint case and 74% in relaxed constraint case.

These sophisticated MLLMs exhibit remarkable proficiency in comprehending videos, swiftly attaining unprecedented performance levels across diverse benchmarks. However, their operation demands substantial memory and computational resources, underscoring the continued importance of traditional models in video comprehension tasks. In this paper, we introduce a novel learning paradigm termed MLLM4WTAL. This paradigm harnesses the potential of MLLM to offer temporal action key semantics and complete semantic priors for conventional Weakly-supervised Temporal Action Localization (WTAL) methods. MLLM4WTAL facilitates the enhancement of WTAL by leveraging MLLM guidance. It achieves this by integrating two distinct modules: Key Semantic Matching (KSM) and Complete Semantic Reconstruction (CSR). These modules work in tandem to effectively address prevalent issues like incomplete and over-complete outcomes common in WTAL methods. Rigorous experiments are conducted to validate the efficacy of our proposed approach in augmenting the performance of various heterogeneous WTAL models.</p></details> |  |

While recent advances in temporal grounding have led to impressive performance, they have also driven network architectures toward greater complexity, with a range of methods to (1) capture temporal relationships and (2) achieve effective multimodal fusion. In contrast, this paper explores the question: How effective can a simplified approach be? To investigate, we design SimBase, a network that leverages lightweight, one-dimensional temporal convolutional layers instead of complex temporal structures. For cross-modal interaction, SimBase only employs an element-wise product instead of intricate multimodal fusion. Remarkably, SimBase achieves state-of-the-art results on two large-scale datasets. As a simple yet powerful baseline, we hope SimBase will spark new ideas and streamline future evaluations in temporal video grounding.</p></details> | Technical report |

Robots can significantly enhance plant and temporal fruit monitoring by providing precise, high-throughput assessments that overcome the limitations of traditional manual methods. Fruit monitoring is a challenging task due to the significant variation in size, shape, orientation, and occlusion of fruits. Also, fruits may be harvested or newly grown between recording sessions. Most methods are 2D image-based and they lack the 3D structure, depth, and spatial information, which represent key aspects of fruit monitoring. 3D colored point clouds, instead, can offer this information but they introduce challenges such as their sparsity and irregularity. In this paper, we present a novel approach for temporal fruit monitoring that addresses point clouds collected in a greenhouse over time. Our method segments fruits using a learning-based instance segmentation approach directly on the point cloud. Each segmented fruit is processed by a 3D sparse convolutional neural network to extract descriptors, which are used in an attention-based matching network to associate fruits with their instances from previous data collections. Experimental results on a real dataset of strawberries demonstrate that our approach outperforms other methods for fruits re-identification over time, allowing for precise temporal fruit monitoring in real and complex scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters</p></details> |

The primary source of information for surgical phase recognition is typically video, which presents two challenges: extracting meaningful features from the video stream and effectively modeling temporal information in the sequence of visual features. For temporal modeling, attention mechanisms have gained popularity due to their ability to capture long-range dependencies. In this paper, we explore design choices for attention in existing temporal models for surgical phase recognition and propose a novel approach that uses attention more effectively and does not require hand-crafted constraints: TUNeS, an efficient and simple temporal model that incorporates self-attention at the core of a convolutional U-Net structure. In addition, we propose to train the feature extractor, a standard CNN, together with an LSTM on preferably long video segments, i.e., with long temporal context. In our experiments, almost all temporal models performed better on top of feature extractors that were trained with longer temporal context. On these contextualized features, TUNeS achieves state-of-the-art results on the Cholec80 dataset. This study offers new insights on how to use attention mechanisms to build accurate and efficient temporal models for surgical phase recognition. Implementing automatic surgical phase recognition is essential to automate the analysis and optimization of surgical workflows and to enable context-aware computer assistance during surgery, thus ultimately improving patient care.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we explore the concept of equilibrium design, where incentives are designed to obtain a desirable equilibrium that satisfies a specific temporal logic property. Our study is based on a framework where system specifications are represented as temporal logic formulae, games as quantitative concurrent game structures, and players' goals as mean-payoff objectives. We consider system specifications given by LTL and GR(1) formulae, and show that designing incentives to ensure that a given temporal logic property is satisfied on some/every Nash equilibrium of the game can be achieved in PSPACE for LTL properties and in NP/{\Sigma}P 2 for GR(1) specifications. We also examine the complexity of related decision and optimisation problems, such as optimality and uniqueness of solutions, as well as considering social welfare, and show that the complexities of these problems lie within the polynomial hierarchy. Equilibrium design can be used as an alternative solution to rational synthesis and verification problems for concurrent games with mean-payoff objectives when no solution exists or as a technique to repair concurrent games with undesirable Nash equilibria in an optimal way.</p></details> | <details><summary>The m...</summary><p>The manuscript is going to be submitted to the Journal on Logical Methods in Computer Science. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2106.10192</p></details> |

Converting sparse events to dense intensity frames faithfully has long been an ill-posed problem. Previous methods have primarily focused on converting events to video in dynamic scenes or with a moving camera. In this paper, for the first time, we realize events to dense intensity image conversion using a stationary event camera in static scenes with a transmittance adjustment device for brightness modulation. Different from traditional methods that mainly rely on event integration, the proposed Event-Based Temporal Mapping Photography (EvTemMap) measures the time of event emitting for each pixel. Then, the resulting Temporal Matrix is converted to an intensity frame with a temporal mapping neural network. At the hardware level, the proposed EvTemMap is implemented by combining a transmittance adjustment device with a DVS, named Adjustable Transmittance Dynamic Vision Sensor (AT-DVS). Additionally, we collected TemMat dataset under various conditions including low-light and high dynamic range scenes. The experimental results showcase the high dynamic range, fine-grained details, and high-grayscale resolution of the proposed EvTemMap.

First, traffic data is segmented by a sliding window to construct a feature sequence and a corresponding label sequence for network traffic. Next, the proposed spectral label generation methods, SSPE and COAP, are applied to transform the label sequence into spectral labels and the feature sequence into temporal features. Spectral labels and temporal features are used to capture and represent behavioral patterns of attacks. Finally, the constructed temporal features and spectral labels are used to train models, which subsequently detects and identifies network attack behaviors.

Assuming three processes that unfold concurrently in the translating mind, it integrates the Task Segment Framework (Munoz & Apfelthaler 2022) and the HOF taxonomy (Carl et al 2024) into a coherent architecture: uninterrupted translation production is caused by routinized/automated processes, cognitive/reflective interventions lead to longer keystroke pauses, while emotional/affective states of the mind are identified by distinctive gazing patterns. Utilizing data from the CRITT Translation Process Research Database (TPR-DB), the paper illustrates how the temporal structure of keystroke and gazing data can be related to the three assumed hidden mental processes that are believed to cause the observable data. The paper relates this embedded generative model with Robinsons (2023) ideosomatic theory of translation, opening exciting, new theoretical horizons for Cognitive Translation Studies, grounded in empirical data and evaluation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Translation of Temporal Logic for Efficient Infinite-State Reactive Synthesis (Full Version)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07078v1)** | 2024-11-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Infinite-state reactive synthesis has attracted significant attention in recent years, which has led to the emergence of novel symbolic techniques for solving infinite-state games. Temporal logics featuring variables over infinite domains offer an expressive high-level specification language for infinite-state reactive systems. Currently, the only way to translate these temporal logics into symbolic games is by naively encoding the specification to use techniques designed for the Boolean case. An inherent limitation of this approach is that it results in games in which the semantic structure of the temporal and first-order constraints present in the formula is lost. There is a clear need for techniques that leverage this information in the translation process to speed up solving the generated games. In this work, we propose the first approach that addresses this gap. Our technique constructs a monitor incorporating first-order and temporal reasoning at the formula level, enriching the constructed game with semantic information that leads to more efficient solving. We demonstrate that thanks to this, our method outperforms the state-of-the-art techniques across a range of benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is a full version of paper accepted at POPL 2025</p></details> |
| **[ENAT: Rethinking Spatial-temporal Interactions in Token-based Image Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06959v1)** | 2024-11-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, token-based generation have demonstrated their effectiveness in image synthesis. As a representative example, non-autoregressive Transformers (NATs) can generate decent-quality images in a few steps. NATs perform generation in a progressive manner, where the latent tokens of a resulting image are incrementally revealed. At each step, the unrevealed image regions are padded with mask tokens and inferred by NAT. In this paper, we delve into the mechanisms behind the effectiveness of NATs and uncover two important patterns that naturally emerge from NATs: Spatially (within a step), although mask and visible tokens are processed uniformly by NATs, the interactions between them are highly asymmetric. In specific, mask tokens mainly gather information for decoding, while visible tokens tend to primarily provide information, and their deep representations can be built only upon themselves. Temporally (across steps), the interactions between adjacent generation steps mostly concentrate on updating the representations of a few critical tokens, while the computation for the majority of tokens is generally repetitive. Driven by these findings, we propose EfficientNAT (ENAT), a NAT model that explicitly encourages these critical interactions inherent in NATs. At the spatial level, we disentangle the computations of visible and mask tokens by encoding visible tokens independently, while decoding mask tokens conditioned on the fully encoded visible tokens. At the temporal level, we prioritize the computation of the critical tokens at each step, while maximally reusing previously computed token representations to supplement necessary information. ENAT improves the performance of NATs notably with significantly reduced computational cost. Experiments on ImageNet-256, ImageNet-512 and MS-COCO validate the effectiveness of ENAT.

| **[Efficient Unsupervised Domain Adaptation Regression for Spatial-Temporal Air Quality Sensor Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06917v1)** | 2024-11-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The deployment of affordable Internet of Things (IoT) sensors for air pollution monitoring has increased in recent years due to their scalability and cost-effectiveness. However, accurately calibrating these sensors in uncontrolled environments remains a significant challenge. While expensive reference sensors can provide accurate ground truth data, they are often deployed on a limited scale due to high costs, leading to a scarcity of labeled data. In diverse urban environments, data distributions constantly shift due to varying factors such as traffic patterns, industrial activities, and weather conditions, which impact sensor readings. Consequently, traditional machine learning models -- despite their increasing deployment for environmental sensor calibration -- often struggle to provide reliable pollutant measurements across different locations due to domain shifts. To address these challenges, we propose a novel unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) method specifically tailored for regression tasks on graph-structured data. Our approach leverages Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to model the relationships between sensors. To effectively capture critical spatial-temporal interactions, we incorporate spatial-temporal graph neural networks (STGNNs), which extend GNNs by incorporating temporal dynamics. To handle the resulting larger embeddings, we propose a domain adaptation method using a closed-form solution inspired by the Tikhonov-regularized least-squares problem. This method leverages Cholesky decomposition and power iteration to align the subspaces between source and target domains. By aligning these subspaces, our approach allows low-cost IoT sensors to learn calibration parameters from expensive reference sensors. This facilitates reliable pollutant measurements in new locations without the need for additional costly equipment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatially Constrained Transformer with Efficient Global Relation Modelling for Spatio-Temporal Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06836v1)** | 2024-11-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate spatio-temporal prediction is crucial for the sustainable development of smart cities. However, current approaches often struggle to capture important spatio-temporal relationships, particularly overlooking global relations among distant city regions. Most existing techniques predominantly rely on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to capture global relations. However, CNNs exhibit neighbourhood bias, making them insufficient for capturing distant relations. To address this limitation, we propose ST-SampleNet, a novel transformer-based architecture that combines CNNs with self-attention mechanisms to capture both local and global relations effectively. Moreover, as the number of regions increases, the quadratic complexity of self-attention becomes a challenge. To tackle this issue, we introduce a lightweight region sampling strategy that prunes non-essential regions and enhances the efficiency of our approach. Furthermore, we introduce a spatially constrained position embedding that incorporates spatial neighbourhood information into the self-attention mechanism, aiding in semantic interpretation and improving the performance of ST-SampleNet. Our experimental evaluation on three real-world datasets demonstrates the effectiveness of ST-SampleNet. Additionally, our efficient variant achieves a 40% reduction in computational costs with only a marginal compromise in performance, approximately 1%.</p></details> |  |

Building on these advancements, early methods have been developed for dynamic surface reconstruction by globally optimizing entire sequences. However, reconstructing dynamic scenes with significant topology changes, emerging or disappearing objects, and rapid movements remains a substantial challenge, particularly for long sequences. To address these issues, we propose AT-GS, a novel method for reconstructing high-quality dynamic surfaces from multi-view videos through per-frame incremental optimization. To avoid local minima across frames, we introduce a unified and adaptive gradient-aware densification strategy that integrates the strengths of conventional cloning and splitting techniques. Additionally, we reduce temporal jittering in dynamic surfaces by ensuring consistency in curvature maps across consecutive frames. Our method achieves superior accuracy and temporal coherence in dynamic surface reconstruction, delivering high-fidelity space-time novel view synthesis, even in complex and challenging scenes. Extensive experiments on diverse multi-view video datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, showing clear advantages over baseline methods.

Policy evaluation is complicated in the rare event setting by the long timescale of the event and by the need for \emph{relative accuracy} in estimates of very small values. Specifically, we focus on least-squares TD (LSTD) prediction for finite state Markov chains, and show that LSTD can achieve relative accuracy far more efficiently than MC. We prove a central limit theorem for the LSTD estimator and upper bound the \emph{relative asymptotic variance} by simple quantities characterizing the connectivity of states relative to the transition probabilities between them. Using this bound, we show that, even when both the timescale of the rare event and the relative accuracy of the MC estimator are exponentially large in the number of states, LSTD maintains a fixed level of relative accuracy with a total number of observed transitions of the Markov chain that is only \emph{polynomially} large in the number of states.</p></details> | <details><summary>camer...</summary><p>camera-ready version published at NeurIPS 2024.

| **[Delayed Memory Unit: Modelling Temporal Dependency Through Delay Gate](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14982v2)** | 2024-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are widely recognized for their proficiency in modeling temporal dependencies, making them highly prevalent in sequential data processing applications. Nevertheless, vanilla RNNs are confronted with the well-known issue of gradient vanishing and exploding, posing a significant challenge for learning and establishing long-range dependencies. Additionally, gated RNNs tend to be over-parameterized, resulting in poor computational efficiency and network generalization. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel Delayed Memory Unit (DMU). The DMU incorporates a delay line structure along with delay gates into vanilla RNN, thereby enhancing temporal interaction and facilitating temporal credit assignment. Specifically, the DMU is designed to directly distribute the input information to the optimal time instant in the future, rather than aggregating and redistributing it over time through intricate network dynamics. Our proposed DMU demonstrates superior temporal modeling capabilities across a broad range of sequential modeling tasks, utilizing considerably fewer parameters than other state-of-the-art gated RNN models in applications such as speech recognition, radar gesture recognition, ECG waveform segmentation, and permuted sequential image classification.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems, 2024</p></details> |

Our approach integrates a robustness metric for Linear Temporal Logics (LTL) with the system's motion constraints, ensuring that the resulting trajectories are both optimal and executable. We introduce a cost function that recursively computes the robustness of temporal logic specifications while penalizing time and control effort, striking a balance between path feasibility and logical correctness. We validate our approach with simulations and real-world experiments in complex environments, demonstrating its effectiveness in producing robust and practical motion plans. This work represents a significant step towards expanding the applicability of motion planning algorithms to more complex, real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  |

To address these issues, we propose a novel approach that more accurately reflects human cognition. This paper introduces HERMES: temporal-coHERent long-forM understanding with Episodes and Semantics, a model that simulates episodic memory accumulation to capture action sequences and reinforces them with semantic knowledge dispersed throughout the video. Our work makes two key contributions: First, we develop an Episodic COmpressor (ECO) that efficiently aggregates crucial representations from micro to semi-macro levels, overcoming the challenge of long-range dependencies. Second, we propose a Semantics ReTRiever (SeTR) that enhances these aggregated representations with semantic information by focusing on the broader context, dramatically reducing feature dimensionality while preserving relevant macro-level information. This addresses the issues of redundancy and lack of high-level concept extraction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HERMES achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple long-video understanding benchmarks in both zero-shot and fully-supervised settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is an improved and expanded version of our EVAL-FoMo Workshop at ECCV'24 (v1 of this paper).

In temporal data, static path-based centralities like closeness or betweenness can give misleading results about the true importance of nodes in a temporal graph. To address this issue, temporal generalizations of betweenness and closeness have been defined that are based on the shortest time-respecting paths between pairs of nodes. However, a major issue of those generalizations is that the calculation of such paths is computationally expensive. Addressing this issue, we study the application of De Bruijn Graph Neural Networks (DBGNN), a time-aware graph neural network architecture, to predict temporal path-based centralities in time series data. We experimentally evaluate our approach in 13 temporal graphs from biological and social systems and show that it considerably improves the prediction of betweenness and closeness centrality compared to (i) a static Graph Convolutional Neural Network, (ii) an efficient sampling-based approximation technique for temporal betweenness, and (iii) two state-of-the-art time-aware graph learning techniques for dynamic graphs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |
| **[Enhancing the Expressivity of Temporal Graph Networks through Source-Target Identification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03596v2)** | 2024-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the successful application of Temporal Graph Networks (TGNs) for tasks such as dynamic node classification and link prediction, they still perform poorly on the task of dynamic node affinity prediction -- where the goal is to predict 'how much' two nodes will interact in the future. In fact, simple heuristic approaches such as persistent forecasts and moving averages over ground-truth labels significantly and consistently outperform TGNs. Building on this observation, we find that computing heuristics over messages is an equally competitive approach, outperforming TGN and all current temporal graph (TG) models on dynamic node affinity prediction. In this paper, we prove that no formulation of TGN can represent persistent forecasting or moving averages over messages, and propose to enhance the expressivity of TGNs by adding source-target identification to each interaction event message. We show that this modification is required to represent persistent forecasting, moving averages, and the broader class of autoregressive models over messages. Our proposed method, TGNv2, significantly outperforms TGN and all current TG models on all Temporal Graph Benchmark (TGB) dynamic node affinity prediction datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS Symmetry and Geometry in Neural Representations Workshop 2024</p></details> |
| **[Faster feasibility for dynamic flows and transshipments on temporal networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04906v1)** | 2024-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper we study flow problems on temporal networks, where edge capacities and travel times change over time. We consider a network with $n$ nodes and $m$ edges where the capacity and length of each edge is a piecewise constant function, and use $\mu=\Omega(m)$ to denote the total number of pieces in all of the $2m$ functions. Our goal is to design exact algorithms for various flow problems that run in time polynomial in the parameter $\mu$. Importantly, the algorithms we design are strongly polynomial, i.e. have no dependence on the capacities, flow value, or the time horizon of the flow process, all of which can be exponentially large relative to the other parameters; and return an integral flow when all input parameters are integral. Our main result is an algorithm for checking feasibility of a dynamic transshipment problem on temporal networks -- given multiple sources and sinks with supply and demand values, is it possible to satisfy the desired supplies and demands within a given time horizon? We develop a fast ($O(\mu^3)$ time) algorithm for this feasibility problem when the input network has a certain canonical form, by exploiting the cut structure of the associated time expanded network. We then adapt an approach of \cite{hoppe2000} to show how other flow problems on temporal networks can be reduced to the canonical format. For computing dynamic transshipments on temporal networks, this results in a $O(\mu^7)$ time algorithm, whereas the previous best integral exact algorithm runs in time $\tilde O(\mu^{19})$. We achieve similar improvements for other flow problems on temporal networks.</p></details> | 33 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Sampling-guided Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network with Temporal Smoothing for Scalable Longitudinal Data Imputation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04899v1)** | 2024-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose a novel framework, the Sampling-guided Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network (SHT-GNN), to effectively tackle the challenge of missing data imputation in longitudinal studies. Unlike traditional methods, which often require extensive preprocessing to handle irregular or inconsistent missing data, our approach accommodates arbitrary missing data patterns while maintaining computational efficiency. SHT-GNN models both observations and covariates as distinct node types, connecting observation nodes at successive time points through subject-specific longitudinal subnetworks, while covariate-observation interactions are represented by attributed edges within bipartite graphs. By leveraging subject-wise mini-batch sampling and a multi-layer temporal smoothing mechanism, SHT-GNN efficiently scales to large datasets, while effectively learning node representations and imputing missing data. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets, including the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset, demonstrate that SHT-GNN significantly outperforms existing imputation methods, even with high missing data rates. The empirical results highlight SHT-GNN's robust imputation capabilities and superior performance, particularly in the context of complex, large-scale longitudinal data.</p></details> |  |

In this work, a learning-based control approach is introduced to unlock the versatility and adaptiveness of flapping-wing flight. We propose a model-free reinforcement learning (RL)-based framework for a high degree-of-freedom (DoF) bird-inspired flapping-wing robot that allows for multimodal flight and agile trajectory tracking. Stability analysis was performed on the closed-loop system comprising of the flapping-wing system and the RL policy. Additionally, simulation results demonstrate that the RL-based controller can successfully learn complex wing trajectory patterns, achieve stable flight, switch between flight modes spontaneously, and track different trajectories under various aerodynamic conditions.</p></details> |  |
| **[RED: Effective Trajectory Representation Learning with Comprehensive Information](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15096v1)** | 2024-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory representation learning (TRL) maps trajectories to vectors that can then be used for various downstream tasks, including trajectory similarity computation, trajectory classification, and travel-time estimation. However, existing TRL methods often produce vectors that, when used in downstream tasks, yield insufficiently accurate results. A key reason is that they fail to utilize the comprehensive information encompassed by trajectories. We propose a self-supervised TRL framework, called RED, which effectively exploits multiple types of trajectory information. Overall, RED adopts the Transformer as the backbone model and masks the constituting paths in trajectories to train a masked autoencoder (MAE). In particular, RED considers the moving patterns of trajectories by employing a Road-aware masking strategy} that retains key paths of trajectories during masking, thereby preserving crucial information of the trajectories. RED also adopts a spatial-temporal-user joint Embedding scheme to encode comprehensive information when preparing the trajectories as model inputs. To conduct training, RED adopts Dual-objective task learning}: the Transformer encoder predicts the next segment in a trajectory, and the Transformer decoder reconstructs the entire trajectory. RED also considers the spatial-temporal correlations of trajectories by modifying the attention mechanism of the Transformer. We compare RED with 9 state-of-the-art TRL methods for 4 downstream tasks on 3 real-world datasets, finding that RED can usually improve the accuracy of the best-performing baseline by over 5%.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted by VLDB2025</p></details> |

However, controlling such systems using external permanent magnets (EPM) is challenging due to nonlinear magnetic interactions, especially when there are complex navigation requirements such as avoidance of sensitive tissues. In this work, we present a novel trajectory planning and control method incorporating dynamics and navigation requirements, using a single EPM fixed to a robotic arm to manipulate an internal permanent magnet (IPM). Our approach employs a constrained iterative linear quadratic regulator that considers the dynamics of the IPM to generate optimal trajectories for both the EPM and IPM. Extensive simulations and real-world experiments, motivated by capsule endoscopy operations, demonstrate the robustness of the method, showcasing resilience to external disturbances and precise control under varying conditions. The experimental results show that the IPM reaches the goal position with a maximum mean error of 0.18 cm and a standard deviation of 0.21 cm. This work introduces a unified framework for constrained trajectory optimization in magnetic manipulation, directly incorporating both the IPM's dynamics and the EPM's manipulability.</p></details> | 8 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Bi-level Trajectory Optimization on Uneven Terrains with Differentiable Wheel-Terrain Interaction Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03307v3)** | 2024-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Navigation of wheeled vehicles on uneven terrain necessitates going beyond the 2D approaches for trajectory planning. Specifically, it is essential to incorporate the full 6dof variation of vehicle pose and its associated stability cost in the planning process. To this end, most recent works aim to learn a neural network model to predict the vehicle evolution. However, such approaches are data-intensive and fraught with generalization issues. In this paper, we present a purely model-based approach that just requires the digital elevation information of the terrain. Specifically, we express the wheel-terrain interaction and 6dof pose prediction as a non-linear least squares (NLS) problem. As a result, trajectory planning can be viewed as a bi-level optimization. The inner optimization layer predicts the pose on the terrain along a given trajectory, while the outer layer deforms the trajectory itself to reduce the stability and kinematic costs of the pose. We improve the state-of-the-art in the following respects. First, we show that our NLS based pose prediction closely matches the output from a high-fidelity physics engine. This result coupled with the fact that we can query gradients of the NLS solver, makes our pose predictor, a differentiable wheel-terrain interaction model. We further leverage this differentiability to efficiently solve the proposed bi-level trajectory optimization problem. Finally, we perform extensive experiments, and comparison with a baseline to showcase the effectiveness of our approach in obtaining smooth, stable trajectories.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 7 figures, submitted to IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS 2024)</p></details> |

Existing TRL methods use either grid trajectories, capturing movement in free space, or road trajectories, capturing movement in a road network, as input. We observe that the two types of trajectories are complementary, providing either region and location information or providing road structure and movement regularity. Therefore, we propose a novel multimodal TRL method, dubbed GREEN, to jointly utilize Grid and Road trajectory Expressions for Effective representatioN learning. In particular, we transform raw GPS trajectories into both grid and road trajectories and tailor two encoders to capture their respective information. To align the two encoders such that they complement each other, we adopt a contrastive loss to encourage them to produce similar embeddings for the same raw trajectory and design a mask language model (MLM) loss to use grid trajectories to help reconstruct masked road trajectories. To learn the final trajectory representation, a dual-modal interactor is used to fuse the outputs of the two encoders via cross-attention. We compare GREEN with 7 state-of-the-art TRL methods for 3 downstream tasks, finding that GREEN consistently outperforms all baselines and improves the accuracy of the best-performing baseline by an average of 15.99\%.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted by KDD2025(August Cycle)</p></details> |

These models help aircraft detect conflict and plan avoidance maneuvers, which is especially important in Unmanned Aircraft systems (UAS) landing management due to the congested airspace near vertiports. In this paper, we propose a landing trajectory prediction model for UAS based on Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). The GAN is a prestigious neural network that has been developed for many years. In previous research, GAN has achieved many state-of-the-art results in many generation tasks. The GAN consists of one neural network generator and a neural network discriminator. Because of the learning capacity of the neural networks, the generator is capable to understand the features of the sample trajectory. The generator takes the previous trajectory as input and outputs some random status of a flight. According to the results of the experiences, the proposed model can output more accurate predictions than the baseline method(GMR) in various datasets. To evaluate the proposed model, we also create a real UAV landing dataset that includes more than 2600 trajectories of drone control manually by real pilots.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, AIAA SCITECH 2023</p></details> |

In this paper, we aim to learn the trajectory prediction model by using broad out-of-domain data to improve its performance and generalization ability. Trajectory model is designed to predict any-point trajectories in the current frame given an instruction and can provide detailed control guidance for robotic policy learning. To handle the diverse out-of-domain data distribution, we propose a sparsely-gated MoE (\textbf{Top-1} gating strategy) architecture for trajectory model, coined as \textbf{Tra-MoE}. The sparse activation design enables good balance between parameter cooperation and specialization, effectively benefiting from large-scale out-of-domain data while maintaining constant FLOPs per token. In addition, we further introduce an adaptive policy conditioning technique by learning 2D mask representations for predicted trajectories, which is explicitly aligned with image observations to guide action prediction more flexibly. We perform extensive experiments on both simulation and real-world scenarios to verify the effectiveness of Tra-MoE and adaptive policy conditioning technique. We also conduct a comprehensive empirical study to train Tra-MoE, demonstrating that our Tra-MoE consistently exhibits superior performance compared to the dense baseline model, even when the latter is scaled to match Tra-MoE's parameter count.</p></details> | 15 pages, 5 figures |
| **[FlightPatchNet: Multi-Scale Patch Network with Differential Coding for Flight Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16200v2)** | 2024-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate multi-step flight trajectory prediction plays an important role in Air Traffic Control, which can ensure the safety of air transportation. Two main issues limit the flight trajectory prediction performance of existing works. The first issue is the negative impact on prediction accuracy caused by the significant differences in data range. The second issue is that real-world flight trajectories involve underlying temporal dependencies, and existing methods fail to reveal the hidden complex temporal variations and only extract features from one single time scale. To address the above issues, we propose FlightPatchNet, a multi-scale patch network with differential coding for flight trajectory prediction. Specifically, FlightPatchNet first utilizes the differential coding to encode the original values of longitude and latitude into first-order differences and generates embeddings for all variables at each time step. Then, a global temporal attention is introduced to explore the dependencies between different time steps. To fully explore the diverse temporal patterns in flight trajectories, a multi-scale patch network is delicately designed to serve as the backbone. The multi-scale patch network exploits stacked patch mixer blocks to capture inter- and intra-patch dependencies under different time scales, and further integrates multi-scale temporal features across different scales and variables. Finally, FlightPatchNet ensembles multiple predictors to make direct multi-step prediction. Extensive experiments on ADS-B datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms the competitive baselines.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose a learning-based resource allocation scheme in an ultra-dense UAV communication network, where the GUs' service demands are time-varying with unknown distributions. We formulate the non-cooperative game among multiple co-channel UAVs as a stochastic game, where each UAV jointly optimizes its trajectory, user association, and downlink power control to maximize the expectation of its locally cumulative energy efficiency under the interference and energy constraints. To cope with the scalability issue in a large-scale network, we further formulate the problem as a mean-field game (MFG), which simplifies the interactions among the UAVs into a two-player game between a representative UAV and a mean-field. We prove the existence and uniqueness of the equilibrium for the MFG, and propose a model-free mean-field reinforcement learning algorithm named maximum entropy mean-field deep Q network (ME-MFDQN) to solve the mean-field equilibrium in both fully and partially observable scenarios. The simulation results reveal that the proposed algorithm improves the energy efficiency compared with the benchmark algorithms. Moreover, the performance can be further enhanced if the GUs' service demands exhibit higher temporal correlation or if the UAVs have wider observation capabilities over their nearby GUs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory Representation Learning on Road Networks and Grids with Spatio-Temporal Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14014v1)** | 2024-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory representation learning is a fundamental task for applications in fields including smart city, and urban planning, as it facilitates the utilization of trajectory data (e.g., vehicle movements) for various downstream applications, such as trajectory similarity computation or travel time estimation. This is achieved by learning low-dimensional representations from high-dimensional and raw trajectory data. However, existing methods for trajectory representation learning either rely on grid-based or road-based representations, which are inherently different and thus, could lose information contained in the other modality. Moreover, these methods overlook the dynamic nature of urban traffic, relying on static road network features rather than time varying traffic patterns. In this paper, we propose TIGR, a novel model designed to integrate grid and road network modalities while incorporating spatio-temporal dynamics to learn rich, general-purpose representations of trajectories. We evaluate TIGR on two realworld datasets and demonstrate the effectiveness of combining both modalities by substantially outperforming state-of-the-art methods, i.e., up to 43.22% for trajectory similarity, up to 16.65% for travel time estimation, and up to 10.16% for destination prediction.</p></details> |  |

By converting the vehicle's position and velocity information from the Cartesian coordinate system to Frenet coordinate system, this method can more accurately describe the vehicle's deviation and travel distance relative to the center line of the road. The DDPG algorithm adopts the Actor-Critic framework, uses deep neural networks for strategy and value evaluation, and combines the experience replay mechanism and target network to improve the algorithm's stability and data utilization efficiency. Experimental results show that the DDPG algorithm based on Frenet coordinate system performs well in trajectory-tracking tasks in complex environments, achieves high-precision and stable path tracking, and demonstrates its application potential in autonomous driving and intelligent transportation systems.

| **[Almost Global Trajectory Tracking for Quadrotors Using Thrust Direction Control on $\mathcal{S}^2$](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05702v2)** | 2024-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many of the existing works on quadrotor control address the trajectory tracking problem by employing a cascade design in which the translational and rotational dynamics are stabilized by two separate controllers. The stability of the cascade is often proved by employing trajectory-based arguments, most notably, integral input-to-state stability. In this paper, we follow a different route and present a control law ensuring that a composite function constructed from the translational and rotational tracking errors is a Lyapunov function for the closed-loop cascade. In particular, starting from a generic control law for the double integrator, we develop a suitable attitude control extension, by leveraging a backstepping-like procedure. Using this construction, we provide an almost global stability certificate. The proposed design employs the unit sphere $\mathcal{S}^2$ to describe the rotational degrees of freedom required for position control. This enables a simpler controller tuning and an improved tracking performance with respect to previous global solutions. The new design is demonstrated via numerical simulations and on real-world experiments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hierarchical Diffusion Policy: manipulation trajectory generation via contact guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12982v1)** | 2024-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Decision-making in robotics using denoising diffusion processes has increasingly become a hot research topic, but end-to-end policies perform poorly in tasks with rich contact and have limited controllability. This paper proposes Hierarchical Diffusion Policy (HDP), a new imitation learning method of using objective contacts to guide the generation of robot trajectories. The policy is divided into two layers: the high-level policy predicts the contact for the robot's next object manipulation based on 3D information, while the low-level policy predicts the action sequence toward the high-level contact based on the latent variables of observation and contact. We represent both level policies as conditional denoising diffusion processes, and combine behavioral cloning and Q-learning to optimize the low level policy for accurately guiding actions towards contact. We benchmark Hierarchical Diffusion Policy across 6 different tasks and find that it significantly outperforms the existing state of-the-art imitation learning method Diffusion Policy with an average improvement of 20.8%. We find that contact guidance yields significant improvements, including superior performance, greater interpretability, and stronger controllability, especially on contact-rich tasks. To further unlock the potential of HDP, this paper proposes a set of key technical contributions including snapshot gradient optimization, 3D conditioning, and prompt guidance, which improve the policy's optimization efficiency, spatial awareness, and controllability respectively. Finally, real world experiments verify that HDP can handle both rigid and deformable objects.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2303.04137 by other authors</p></details> |
| **[Bring the Heat: Rapid Trajectory Optimization with Pseudospectral Techniques and the Affine Geometric Heat Flow Equation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12962v1)** | 2024-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating optimal trajectories for high-dimensional robotic systems in a time-efficient manner while adhering to constraints is a challenging task. To address this challenge, this paper introduces PHLAME, which applies pseudospectral collocation and spatial vector algebra to efficiently solve the Affine Geometric Heat Flow (AGHF) Partial Differential Equation (PDE) for trajectory optimization. Unlike traditional PDE approaches like the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) PDE, which solve for a function over the entire state space, computing a solution to the AGHF PDE scales more efficiently because its solution is defined over a two-dimensional domain, thereby avoiding the intractability of state-space scaling. To solve the AGHF one usually applies the Method of Lines (MOL), which works by discretizing one variable of the AGHF PDE, effectively converting the PDE into a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) that can be solved using standard time-integration methods. Though powerful, this method requires a fine discretization to generate accurate solutions and still requires evaluating the AGHF PDE which can be computationally expensive for high-dimensional systems. PHLAME overcomes this deficiency by using a pseudospectral method, which reduces the number of function evaluations required to yield a high accuracy solution thereby allowing it to scale efficiently to high-dimensional robotic systems. To further increase computational speed, this paper presents analytical expressions for the AGHF and its Jacobian, both of which can be computed efficiently using rigid body dynamics algorithms. The proposed method PHLAME is tested across various dynamical systems, with and without obstacles and compared to a number of state-of-the-art techniques. PHLAME generates trajectories for a 44-dimensional state-space system in $\sim3$ seconds, much faster than current state-of-the-art techniques.</p></details> | 26 pages, 8 figures |
| **[A data driven approach to classify descriptors based on their efficiency in translating noisy trajectories into physically-relevant information](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12570v1)** | 2024-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reconstructing the physical complexity of many-body dynamical systems can be challenging. Starting from the trajectories of their constitutive units (raw data), typical approaches require selecting appropriate descriptors to convert them into time-series, which are then analyzed to extract interpretable information. However, identifying the most effective descriptor is often non-trivial. Here, we report a data-driven approach to compare the efficiency of various descriptors in extracting information from noisy trajectories and translating it into physically relevant insights. As a prototypical system with non-trivial internal complexity, we analyze molecular dynamics trajectories of an atomistic system where ice and water coexist in equilibrium near the solid/liquid transition temperature. We compare general and specific descriptors often used in aqueous systems: number of neighbors, molecular velocities, Smooth Overlap of Atomic Positions (SOAP), Local Environments and Neighbors Shuffling (LENS), Orientational Tetrahedral Order, and distance from the fifth neighbor ($d_5$). Using Onion Clustering -- an efficient unsupervised method for single-point time-series analysis -- we assess the maximum extractable information for each descriptor and rank them via a high-dimensional metric. Our results show that advanced descriptors like SOAP and LENS outperform classical ones due to higher signal-to-noise ratios. Nonetheless, even simple descriptors can rival or exceed advanced ones after local signal denoising. For example, $d_5$, initially among the weakest, becomes the most effective at resolving the system's non-local dynamical complexity after denoising. This work highlights the critical role of noise in information extraction from molecular trajectories and offers a data-driven approach to identify optimal descriptors for systems with characteristic internal complexity.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 5 figures + 3 in supporting information (at the bottom of the manuscript)</p></details> |
| **[C$^{2}$INet: Realizing Incremental Trajectory Prediction with Prior-Aware Continual Causal Intervention](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12313v1)** | 2024-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction for multi-agents in complex scenarios is crucial for applications like autonomous driving. However, existing methods often overlook environmental biases, which leads to poor generalization. Additionally, hardware constraints limit the use of large-scale data across environments, and continual learning settings exacerbate the challenge of catastrophic forgetting. To address these issues, we propose the Continual Causal Intervention (C$^{2}$INet) method for generalizable multi-agent trajectory prediction within a continual learning framework. Using variational inference, we align environment-related prior with posterior estimator of confounding factors in the latent space, thereby intervening in causal correlations that affect trajectory representation. Furthermore, we store optimal variational priors across various scenarios using a memory queue, ensuring continuous debiasing during incremental task training. The proposed C$^{2}$INet enhances adaptability to diverse tasks while preserving previous task information to prevent catastrophic forgetting. It also incorporates pruning strategies to mitigate overfitting. Comparative evaluations on three real and synthetic complex datasets against state-of-the-art methods demonstrate that our proposed method consistently achieves reliable prediction performance, effectively mitigating confounding factors unique to different scenarios. This highlights the practical value of our method for real-world applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Age of Information Minimization in UAV-Assisted Covert Communication: Trajectory and Beamforming Design](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12312v1)** | 2024-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have the potential for time-sensitive applications. Due to wireless channel variation, received data may have an expiration time, particularly in critical situations such as rescue operations, natural disasters, or the military. Age of Information (AoI) is a metric that measures the freshness of received packets to specify the validity period of information. In addition, it is necessary to guarantee the privacy of confidential information transmission through air-to-ground links against eavesdroppers. This paper investigates UAV-assisted covert communication to minimize AoI in the presence of an aerial eavesdropper for the first time. However, to ensure the eavesdropper's error detection rate, UAV-enabled beamforming employs the power-domain non-orthogonal multiple access (PD-NOMA) technique to cover the covert user by a public user. PD-NOMA technique significantly improves the user's AoI, too. The joint optimization problem contains non-convex constraints and coupled optimization variables, including UAV trajectory, beamforming design, and the user's AoI which is challenging to derive a direct solution. We have developed an efficient alternating optimization technique to address the formulated optimization problem. Numerical results demonstrate the impact of the main parameters on the performance of the proposed communication system.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Linear Differential Inclusion for Contraction Analysis to Known Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11587v1)** | 2024-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Infinitesimal contraction analysis provides exponential convergence rates between arbitrary pairs of trajectories of a system by studying the system's linearization. An essentially equivalent viewpoint arises through stability analysis of a linear differential inclusion (LDI) encompassing the incremental behavior of the system. In this note, we study contraction of a system to a particular known trajectory, deriving a new LDI characterizing the error between arbitrary trajectories and this known trajectory. As with classical contraction analysis, this new inclusion is constructed via first partial derivatives of the system's vector field, and contraction rates are obtained with familiar tools: uniform bounding of the logarithmic norm and LMI-based Lyapunov conditions. Our LDI is guaranteed to outperform a usual contraction analysis in two special circumstances: i) when the bound on the logarithmic norm arises from an interval overapproximation of the Jacobian matrix, and ii) when the norm considered is the $\ell_1$ norm. Finally, we demonstrate how the proposed approach strictly improves an existing framework for ellipsoidal reachable set computation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Decision Transformer with Diffusion-Based Trajectory Branch Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11327v1)** | 2024-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Decision Transformer (DT) can learn effective policy from offline datasets by converting the offline reinforcement learning (RL) into a supervised sequence modeling task, where the trajectory elements are generated auto-regressively conditioned on the return-to-go (RTG).However, the sequence modeling learning approach tends to learn policies that converge on the sub-optimal trajectories within the dataset, for lack of bridging data to move to better trajectories, even if the condition is set to the highest RTG.To address this issue, we introduce Diffusion-Based Trajectory Branch Generation (BG), which expands the trajectories of the dataset with branches generated by a diffusion model.The trajectory branch is generated based on the segment of the trajectory within the dataset, and leads to trajectories with higher returns.We concatenate the generated branch with the trajectory segment as an expansion of the trajectory.After expanding, DT has more opportunities to learn policies to move to better trajectories, preventing it from converging to the sub-optimal trajectories.Empirically, after processing with BG, DT outperforms state-of-the-art sequence modeling methods on D4RL benchmark, demonstrating the effectiveness of adding branches to the dataset without further modifications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Map-Free Trajectory Prediction with Map Distillation and Hierarchical Encoding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10961v1)** | 2024-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reliable motion forecasting of surrounding agents is essential for ensuring the safe operation of autonomous vehicles. Many existing trajectory prediction methods rely heavily on high-definition (HD) maps as strong driving priors. However, the availability and accuracy of these priors are not guaranteed due to substantial costs to build, localization errors of vehicles, or ongoing road constructions. In this paper, we introduce MFTP, a Map-Free Trajectory Prediction method that offers several advantages. First, it eliminates the need for HD maps during inference while still benefiting from map priors during training via knowledge distillation. Second, we present a novel hierarchical encoder that effectively extracts spatial-temporal agent features and aggregates them into multiple trajectory queries. Additionally, we introduce an iterative decoder that sequentially decodes trajectory queries to generate the final predictions. Extensive experiments show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Argoverse dataset under the map-free setting.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Estimation of Relaxed Model Parameters for Robust UAV Trajectory Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10941v1)** | 2024-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Online trajectory optimization and optimal control methods are crucial for enabling sustainable unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) services, such as agriculture, environmental monitoring, and transportation, where available actuation and energy are limited. However, optimal controllers are highly sensitive to model mismatch, which can occur due to loaded equipment, packages to be delivered, or pre-existing variability in fundamental structural and thrust-related parameters. To circumvent this problem, optimal controllers can be paired with parameter estimators to improve their trajectory planning performance and perform adaptive control. However, UAV platforms are limited in terms of onboard processing power, oftentimes making nonlinear parameter estimation too computationally expensive to consider. To address these issues, we propose a relaxed, affine-in-parameters multirotor model along with an efficient optimal parameter estimator. We convexify the nominal Moving Horizon Parameter Estimation (MHPE) problem into a linear-quadratic form (LQ-MHPE) via an affine-in-parameter relaxation on the nonlinear dynamics, resulting in fast quadratic programs (QPs) that facilitate adaptive Model Predictve Control (MPC) in real time. We compare this approach to the equivalent nonlinear estimator in Monte Carlo simulations, demonstrating a decrease in average solve time and trajectory optimality cost by 98.2% and 23.9-56.2%, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures, submitted to IEEE Sustech 2025</p></details> |
| **[Stable Continual Reinforcement Learning via Diffusion-based Trajectory Replay](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10809v1)** | 2024-11-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Given the inherent non-stationarity prevalent in real-world applications, continual Reinforcement Learning (RL) aims to equip the agent with the capability to address a series of sequentially presented decision-making tasks. Within this problem setting, a pivotal challenge revolves around \textit{catastrophic forgetting} issue, wherein the agent is prone to effortlessly erode the decisional knowledge associated with past encountered tasks when learning the new one. In recent progresses, the \textit{generative replay} methods have showcased substantial potential by employing generative models to replay data distribution of past tasks. Compared to storing the data from past tasks directly, this category of methods circumvents the growing storage overhead and possible data privacy concerns. However, constrained by the expressive capacity of generative models, existing \textit{generative replay} methods face challenges in faithfully reconstructing the data distribution of past tasks, particularly in scenarios with a myriad of tasks or high-dimensional data. Inspired by the success of diffusion models in various generative tasks, this paper introduces a novel continual RL algorithm DISTR (Diffusion-based Trajectory Replay) that employs a diffusion model to memorize the high-return trajectory distribution of each encountered task and wakeups these distributions during the policy learning on new tasks. Besides, considering the impracticality of replaying all past data each time, a prioritization mechanism is proposed to prioritize the trajectory replay of pivotal tasks in our method. Empirical experiments on the popular continual RL benchmark \texttt{Continual World} demonstrate that our proposed method obtains a favorable balance between \textit{stability} and \textit{plasticity}, surpassing various existing continual RL baselines in average success rate.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 3 figures, 1 table, inclusion at ICLR 2024 Workshop on Generative Models for Decision Making</p></details> |

However, existing methods are often tailored to specific tasks and regions, resulting in limitations related to task specificity, regional dependency, and data quality sensitivity. Addressing these challenges requires a universal human trajectory foundation model capable of generalizing and scaling across diverse tasks and geographic contexts. To this end, we propose UniTraj, a Universal human Trajectory foundation model that is task-adaptive, region-independent, and highly generalizable. To further enhance performance, we construct WorldTrace, the first large-scale, high-quality, globally distributed dataset sourced from open web platforms, encompassing 2.45 million trajectories with billions of points across 70 countries. Through multiple resampling and masking strategies designed for pre-training, UniTraj effectively overcomes geographic and task constraints, adapting to heterogeneous data quality. Extensive experiments across multiple trajectory analysis tasks and real-world datasets demonstrate that UniTraj consistently outperforms existing approaches in terms of scalability and adaptability. These results underscore the potential of UniTraj as a versatile, robust solution for a wide range of trajectory analysis applications, with WorldTrace serving as an ideal but non-exclusive foundation for training.</p></details> |  |
| **[Tenure and Research Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10575v1)** | 2024-11-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tenure is a cornerstone of the US academic system, yet its relationship to faculty research trajectories remains poorly understood. Conceptually, tenure systems may act as a selection mechanism, screening in high-output researchers; a dynamic incentive mechanism, encouraging high output prior to tenure but low output after tenure; and a creative search mechanism, encouraging tenured individuals to undertake high-risk work. Here, we integrate data from seven different sources to trace US tenure-line faculty and their research outputs at an unprecedented scale and scope, covering over 12,000 researchers across 15 disciplines. Our analysis reveals that faculty publication rates typically increase sharply during the tenure track and peak just before obtaining tenure. Post-tenure trends, however, vary across disciplines: in lab-based fields, such as biology and chemistry, research output typically remains high post-tenure, whereas in non-lab-based fields, such as mathematics and sociology, research output typically declines substantially post-tenure. Turning to creative search, faculty increasingly produce novel, high-risk research after securing tenure. However, this shift toward novelty and risk-taking comes with a decline in impact, with post-tenure research yielding fewer highly cited papers. Comparing outcomes across common career ages but different tenure years or comparing research trajectories in tenure-based and non-tenure-based research settings underscores that breaks in the research trajectories are sharply tied to the individual's tenure year. Overall, these findings provide a new empirical basis for understanding the tenure system, individual research trajectories, and the shape of scientific output.</p></details> |  |

These individuals often face earlier onset and higher prevalence of MLTCs, yet specific co-occurrence patterns remain unexplored. This study applies an unsupervised approach to characterise MLTC clusters based on shared disease trajectories using electronic health records (EHRs) from 13069 individuals with ID in Wales (2000-2021). Disease associations and temporal directionality were assessed, followed by spectral clustering to group shared trajectories. The population consisted of 52.3% males and 47.7% females, with an average of 4.5 conditions per patient. Males under 45 formed a single cluster dominated by neurological conditions (32.4%), while males above 45 had three clusters, the largest characterised circulatory (51.8%). Females under 45 formed one cluster with digestive conditions (24.6%) as most prevalent, while those aged 45 and older showed two clusters: one dominated by circulatory (34.1%), and the other by digestive (25.9%) and musculoskeletal (21.9%) system conditions. Mental illness, epilepsy, and reflux were common across groups. These clusters offer insights into disease progression in individuals with ID, informing targeted interventions and personalised healthcare strategies.</p></details> |  |

Traditional methods rely on the use of LSTM, GRU networks, and even Transformer architectures for the prediction of spatio-temporal series. This study proposes a viable alternative for predicting these trajectories using only GNSS positions. It considers this spatio-temporal problem as a natural language processing problem. The latitude/longitude coordinates of AIS messages are transformed into cell identifiers using the H3 index. Thanks to the pseudo-octal representation, it becomes easier for language models to learn the spatial hierarchy of the H3 index. The method is compared with a classical Kalman filter, widely used in the maritime domain, and introduces the Fr\'echet distance as the main evaluation metric. We show that it is possible to predict ship trajectories quite precisely up to 8 hours ahead with 30 minutes of context, using solely GNSS positions, without relying on any additional information such as speed, course, or external conditions - unlike many traditional methods. We demonstrate that this alternative works well enough to predict trajectories worldwide.</p></details> | 28 pages, 18 figures |

Unlike previous works that primarily address multiple-input single-output (MISO) systems with Gaussian inputs, we investigate a more realistic scenario involving multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems with finite-alphabet inputs. To tackle the challenging and inherently non-convex problem, we propose an efficient solution algorithm that leverages successive convex approximation and alternating optimization techniques. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, demonstrating its capability to optimize system performance.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing approaches have overlooked the potential of these environments, focusing instead on static contexts without considering userspecific factors. Employing the CREATTIVE3D dataset, our work models trajectories recorded in virtual reality (VR) scenes for diverse situations including road-crossing tasks with user interactions and simulated visual impairments. We propose Diverse Context VR Human Motion Prediction (DiVR), a cross-modal transformer based on the Perceiver architecture that integrates both static and dynamic scene context using a heterogeneous graph convolution network. We conduct extensive experiments comparing DiVR against existing architectures including MLP, LSTM, and transformers with gaze and point cloud context. Additionally, we also stress test our model's generalizability across different users, tasks, and scenes. Results show that DiVR achieves higher accuracy and adaptability compared to other models and to static graphs. This work highlights the advantages of using VR datasets for context-aware human trajectory modeling, with potential applications in enhancing user experiences in the metaverse.

The proposed method takes point cloud as input and efficiently constructs a multi-level map using triangular patches as the basic elements. A kinematic path search is adopted on the patches, where motion primitives on different patches combine to form the global min-time cost initial trajectory. We use a same-level expansion method to locate the nearest obstacle for each trajectory waypoint and construct an objective function with curvature, smoothness and obstacle terms for optimization. We evaluate the method on several complex 3D point cloud maps. Compared to existing methods, our method demonstrates higher robustness to point cloud noise, enabling the generation of high quality trajectory while maintaining high computational efficiency.

However, current IRL works cannot learn incrementally from an ongoing trajectory because they have to wait to collect at least one complete trajectory to learn. To bridge the gap, this paper considers the problem of learning a reward function and a corresponding policy while observing the initial state-action pair of an ongoing trajectory and keeping updating the learned reward and policy when new state-action pairs of the ongoing trajectory are observed. We formulate this problem as an online bi-level optimization problem where the upper level dynamically adjusts the learned reward according to the newly observed state-action pairs with the help of a meta-regularization term, and the lower level learns the corresponding policy. We propose a novel algorithm to solve this problem and guarantee that the algorithm achieves sub-linear local regret $O(\sqrt{T}+\log T+\sqrt{T}\log T)$. If the reward function is linear, we prove that the proposed algorithm achieves sub-linear regret $O(\log T)$. Experiments are used to validate the proposed algorithm.</p></details> |  |

It is common to map trajectories to vectors, called embeddings, before subsequent analyses. Thus, the qualities of embeddings are very important. Methods for pre-training embeddings, which leverage unlabeled trajectories for training universal embeddings, have shown promising applicability across different tasks, thus attracting considerable interest. However, research progress on this topic faces two key challenges: a lack of a comprehensive overview of existing methods, resulting in several related methods not being well-recognized, and the absence of a unified pipeline, complicating the development of new methods and the analysis of methods. We present UniTE, a survey and a unified pipeline for this domain. In doing so, we present a comprehensive list of existing methods for pre-training trajectory embeddings, which includes methods that either explicitly or implicitly employ pre-training techniques. Further, we present a unified and modular pipeline with publicly available underlying code, simplifying the process of constructing and evaluating methods for pre-training trajectory embeddings. Additionally, we contribute a selection of experimental results using the proposed pipeline on real-world datasets.

| **[Tracing the Roots: Leveraging Temporal Dynamics in Diffusion Trajectories for Origin Attribution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07449v1)** | 2024-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have revolutionized image synthesis, garnering significant research interest in recent years. Diffusion is an iterative algorithm in which samples are generated step-by-step, starting from pure noise. This process introduces the notion of diffusion trajectories, i.e., paths from the standard Gaussian distribution to the target image distribution. In this context, we study discriminative algorithms operating on these trajectories. Specifically, given a pre-trained diffusion model, we consider the problem of classifying images as part of the training dataset, generated by the model or originating from an external source. Our approach demonstrates the presence of patterns across steps that can be leveraged for classification. We also conduct ablation studies, which reveal that using higher-order gradient features to characterize the trajectories leads to significant performance gains and more robust algorithms.</p></details> |  |
| **['Explaining RL Decisions with Trajectories': A Reproducibility Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07200v1)** | 2024-11-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work investigates the reproducibility of the paper 'Explaining RL decisions with trajectories'. The original paper introduces a novel approach in explainable reinforcement learning based on the attribution decisions of an agent to specific clusters of trajectories encountered during training. We verify the main claims from the paper, which state that (i) training on less trajectories induces a lower initial state value, (ii) trajectories in a cluster present similar high-level patterns, (iii) distant trajectories influence the decision of an agent, and (iv) humans correctly identify the attributed trajectories to the decision of the agent. We recover the environments used by the authors based on the partial original code they provided for one of the environments (Grid-World), and implemented the remaining from scratch (Seaquest, HalfCheetah, Breakout and Q*Bert). While we confirm that (i), (ii), and (iii) partially hold, we extend on the largely qualitative experiments from the authors by introducing a quantitative metric to further support (iii), and new experiments and visual results for (i). Moreover, we investigate the use of different clustering algorithms and encoder architectures to further support (ii). We could not support (iv), given the limited extent of the original experiments. We conclude that, while some of the claims can be supported, further investigations and experiments could be of interest. We recognise the novelty of the work from the authors and hope that our work paves the way for clearer and more transparent approaches.</p></details> |  |

The base transcription algorithm for which we establish the refinement algorithm is a direct multiple shooting technique -- $\mathsf{QuITO}$ $\textsf{v.2}$ (Quasi-Interpolation based Trajectory Optimization). The mesh refinement technique consists of two steps -- localization of certain irregular regions in an optimal control trajectory via wavelets, followed by a targeted $h$-refinement approach around such regions of irregularity. Theoretical approximation guarantees on uniform grids are presented for optimal controls with certain regularity properties, along with guarantees of localization of change points by wavelet transform. Numerical illustrations are provided for control profiles involving discontinuities to show the effectiveness of the localization and refinement strategy. We also announce, and make freely available, a new software package based on $\mathsf{QuITO}$ $\textsf{v.2}$ along with all its functionalities for completeness.

This interest necessitates accurate initial orbit determination (IOD) and orbit prediction (OP) in this domain, which faces significant challenges such as severe nonlinearity, sensitivity to initial conditions, large state-space volume, and sparse, faint, and unreliable measurements. This paper explores the capability of data-driven Koopman operator-based approximations for OP in these scenarios. Three stable periodic trajectories from distinct cislunar families are analyzed. The analysis includes theoretical justification for using a linear time-invariant system as the data-driven surrogate. This theoretical framework is supported by experimental validation. Furthermore, the accuracy is assessed by comparing the spectral content captured to period estimates derived from the fast Fourier transform (FFT) and Poincare-like sections.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2401.13784</p></details> |

Our approach integrates a robustness metric for Linear Temporal Logics (LTL) with the system's motion constraints, ensuring that the resulting trajectories are both optimal and executable. We introduce a cost function that recursively computes the robustness of temporal logic specifications while penalizing time and control effort, striking a balance between path feasibility and logical correctness. We validate our approach with simulations and real-world experiments in complex environments, demonstrating its effectiveness in producing robust and practical motion plans.

| **[Online Omnidirectional Jumping Trajectory Planning for Quadrupedal Robots on Uneven Terrains](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04494v2)** | 2024-11-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Natural terrain complexity often necessitates agile movements like jumping in animals to improve traversal efficiency. To enable similar capabilities in quadruped robots, complex real-time jumping maneuvers are required. Current research does not adequately address the problem of online omnidirectional jumping and neglects the robot's kinodynamic constraints during trajectory generation. This paper proposes a general and complete cascade online optimization framework for omnidirectional jumping for quadruped robots. Our solution systematically encompasses jumping trajectory generation, a trajectory tracking controller, and a landing controller. It also incorporates environmental perception to navigate obstacles that standard locomotion cannot bypass, such as jumping from high platforms. We introduce a novel jumping plane to parameterize omnidirectional jumping motion and formulate a tightly coupled optimization problem accounting for the kinodynamic constraints, simultaneously optimizing CoM trajectory, Ground Reaction Forces (GRFs), and joint states. To meet the online requirements, we propose an accelerated evolutionary algorithm as the trajectory optimizer to address the complexity of kinodynamic constraints. To ensure stability and accuracy in environmental perception post-landing, we introduce a coarse-to-fine relocalization method that combines global Branch and Bound (BnB) search with Maximum a Posteriori (MAP) estimation for precise positioning during navigation and jumping. The proposed framework achieves jump trajectory generation in approximately 0.1 seconds with a warm start and has been successfully validated on two quadruped robots on uneven terrains. Additionally, we extend the framework's versatility to humanoid robots.</p></details> | Submitted to IJRR |

Traditional data-driven approaches often handle these tasks separately with specialized models. We introduce TranSPORTmer, a unified transformer-based framework capable of addressing all these tasks, showcasing its application to the intricate dynamics of multi-agent sports scenarios like soccer and basketball. Using Set Attention Blocks, TranSPORTmer effectively captures temporal dynamics and social interactions in an equivariant manner. The model's tasks are guided by an input mask that conceals missing or yet-to-be-predicted observations. Additionally, we introduce a CLS extra agent to classify states along soccer trajectories, including passes, possessions, uncontrolled states, and out-of-play intervals, contributing to an enhancement in modeling trajectories. Evaluations on soccer and basketball datasets show that TranSPORTmer outperforms state-of-the-art task-specific models in player forecasting, player forecasting-imputation, ball inference, and ball imputation. https://youtu.be/8VtSRm8oGoE</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACCV 2024</p></details> |

As a first step, we train a backup policy to generate evasive movements from arbitrary initial robot states using model-free reinforcement learning. When learning policies for other tasks, the backup policy can be used to estimate the potential risk of a collision and to offer an alternative action if the estimated risk is considered too high. No matter which action is selected, our action space ensures that the kinematic limits of the robot joints are not violated. We analyze and evaluate two different methods for estimating the risk of a collision. A physics simulation performed in the background is computationally expensive but provides the best results in deterministic environments. If a data-based risk estimator is used instead, the computational effort is significantly reduced, but an additional source of error is introduced. For evaluation, we successfully learn a reaching task and a basketball task while keeping the risk of collisions low. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach for deterministic and stochastic environments, including a human-robot scenario and a ball environment, where no state can be considered permanently safe. By conducting experiments with a real robot, we show that our approach can generate safe trajectories in real time.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L); 8 pages; 7 figures</p></details> |

However, adjusting specific elements in generated videos, such as object motion or camera movement, is often a tedious process of trial and error, e.g., involving re-generating videos with different random seeds. Recent techniques address this issue by fine-tuning a pre-trained model to follow conditioning signals, such as bounding boxes or point trajectories. Yet, this fine-tuning procedure can be computationally expensive, and it requires datasets with annotated object motion, which can be difficult to procure. In this work, we introduce SG-I2V, a framework for controllable image-to-video generation that is self-guided$\unicode{x2013}$offering zero-shot control by relying solely on the knowledge present in a pre-trained image-to-video diffusion model without the need for fine-tuning or external knowledge.

| **[Optimal Flow Matching: Learning Straight Trajectories in Just One Step](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13117v3)** | 2024-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Over the several recent years, there has been a boom in development of Flow Matching (FM) methods for generative modeling. One intriguing property pursued by the community is the ability to learn flows with straight trajectories which realize the Optimal Transport (OT) displacements. Straightness is crucial for the fast integration (inference) of the learned flow's paths. Unfortunately, most existing flow straightening methods are based on non-trivial iterative FM procedures which accumulate the error during training or exploit heuristics based on minibatch OT. To address these issues, we develop and theoretically justify the novel \textbf{Optimal Flow Matching} (OFM) approach which allows recovering the straight OT displacement for the quadratic transport in just one FM step. The main idea of our approach is the employment of vector field for FM which are parameterized by convex functions.</p></details> |  |

Predicting future movement enables cameras to automatically track and predict a player's future trajectory without human intervention. Predicting future human movement in the context of complex physical tasks is also intellectually satisfying. Swift advancements in sports analytics and the wide availability of videos for tennis have inspired us to propose a novel method called Pose2Trajectory, which predicts a tennis player's future trajectory as a sequence derived from their body joints' data and ball position. Demonstrating impressive accuracy, our approach capitalizes on body joint information to provide a comprehensive understanding of the human body's geometry and motion, thereby enhancing the prediction of the player's trajectory. We use encoder-decoder Transformer architecture trained on the joints and trajectory information of the players with ball positions. The predicted sequence can provide information to help close-up cameras to keep tracking the tennis player, following centroid coordinates. We generate a high-quality dataset from multiple videos to assist tennis player movement prediction using object detection and human pose estimation methods. It contains bounding boxes and joint information for tennis players and ball positions in singles tennis games. Our method shows promising results in predicting the tennis player's movement trajectory with different sequence prediction lengths using the joints and trajectory information with the ball position.</p></details> |  |
| **[TrajGPT: Controlled Synthetic Trajectory Generation Using a Multitask Transformer-Based Spatiotemporal Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04381v1)** | 2024-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human mobility modeling from GPS-trajectories and synthetic trajectory generation are crucial for various applications, such as urban planning, disaster management and epidemiology. Both of these tasks often require filling gaps in a partially specified sequence of visits - a new problem that we call "controlled" synthetic trajectory generation. Existing methods for next-location prediction or synthetic trajectory generation cannot solve this problem as they lack the mechanisms needed to constrain the generated sequences of visits. Moreover, existing approaches (1) frequently treat space and time as independent factors, an assumption that fails to hold true in real-world scenarios, and (2) suffer from challenges in accuracy of temporal prediction as they fail to deal with mixed distributions and the inter-relationships of different modes with latent variables (e.g., day-of-the-week). These limitations become even more pronounced when the task involves filling gaps within sequences instead of solely predicting the next visit. We introduce TrajGPT, a transformer-based, multi-task, joint spatiotemporal generative model to address these issues. Taking inspiration from large language models, TrajGPT poses the problem of controlled trajectory generation as that of text infilling in natural language. TrajGPT integrates the spatial and temporal models in a transformer architecture through a Bayesian probability model that ensures that the gaps in a visit sequence are filled in a spatiotemporally consistent manner. Our experiments on public and private datasets demonstrate that TrajGPT not only excels in controlled synthetic visit generation but also outperforms competing models in next-location prediction tasks - Relatively, TrajGPT achieves a 26-fold improvement in temporal accuracy while retaining more than 98% of spatial accuracy on average.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 3 figures, 32nd ACM SIGSPATIAL International Conference on Advances in Geographic Information Systems (ACM SIGSPATIAL 2024)</p></details> |

Data augmentation techniques, such as noise injection and data synthesizing, aim to improve Q-function approximation by smoothing the learned state-action region. However, these methods often fall short of directly improving the quality of offline datasets, leading to suboptimal results. In response, we introduce GTA, Generative Trajectory Augmentation, a novel generative data augmentation approach designed to enrich offline data by augmenting trajectories to be both high-rewarding and dynamically plausible. GTA applies a diffusion model within the data augmentation framework. GTA partially noises original trajectories and then denoises them with classifier-free guidance via conditioning on amplified return value. Our results show that GTA, as a general data augmentation strategy, enhances the performance of widely used offline RL algorithms across various tasks with unique challenges. Furthermore, we conduct a quality analysis of data augmented by GTA and demonstrate that GTA improves the quality of the data.

While prior research has typically focused on either prediction or generation, our approach unifies these tasks to provide a versatile framework and achieve state-of-the-art performance. While diffusion models excel in trajectory generation, their iterative sampling process is computationally intensive, hindering robotic systems' dynamic capabilities. We introduce Trajectory Conditional Flow Matching (T-CFM), a novel approach using flow matching techniques to learn a solver time-varying vector field for efficient, fast trajectory generation. T-CFM demonstrates effectiveness in adversarial tracking, real-world aircraft trajectory forecasting, and long-horizon planning, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines with 35% higher predictive accuracy and 142% improved planning performance. Crucially, T-CFM achieves up to 100$\times$ speed-up compared to diffusion models without sacrificing accuracy, enabling real-time decision making in robotics.

The convex cover consists of a set of polytopes such that the union of the polytopes represents obstacle-free space, allowing us to find trajectories for robots that lie within the convex cover. In order to find the SFC that facilitates optimal trajectory generation, we iteratively find overlapping polytopes of maximum volumes that include specified waypoints initialized by a geometric or kinematic planner. Constraints at waypoints appear in two alternating stages of a joint optimization problem, which is solved by a method inspired by the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) with partially distributed variables. We validate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm using a range of parameterized environments and show its applications for two-stage motion planning.</p></details> |  |

However, extensive demonstrations are required for policy robustness and generalization. To reduce the demonstration reliance, we leverage spatial symmetry and propose ET-SEED, an efficient trajectory-level SE(3) equivariant diffusion model for generating action sequences in complex robot manipulation tasks. Further, previous equivariant diffusion models require the per-step equivariance in the Markov process, making it difficult to learn policy under such strong constraints. We theoretically extend equivariant Markov kernels and simplify the condition of equivariant diffusion process, thereby significantly improving training efficiency for trajectory-level SE(3) equivariant diffusion policy in an end-to-end manner. We evaluate ET-SEED on representative robotic manipulation tasks, involving rigid body, articulated and deformable object.

In this study, we propose an efficient and robust low-rank model for precise spatiotemporal traffic speed state estimation (TSE) using lowpenetration vehicle trajectory data. Leveraging traffic wave priors, an oblique grid-based matrix is first designed to transform the inherent dependencies of spatiotemporal traffic states into the algebraic low-rankness of a matrix. Then, with the enhanced traffic state low-rankness in the oblique matrix, a low-rank matrix completion method is tailored to explicitly capture spatiotemporal traffic propagation characteristics and precisely reconstruct traffic states. In addition, an anomaly-tolerant module based on a sparse matrix is developed to accommodate corrupted data input and thereby improve the TSE model robustness. Notably, driven by the understanding of traffic waves, the computational complexity of the proposed efficient method is only correlated with the problem size itself, not with dataset size and hyperparameter selection prevalent in existing studies. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness, robustness, and efficiency of the proposed model. The performance of the proposed method achieves up to a 12% improvement in Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) in the TSE scenarios and an 18% improvement in RMSE in the robust TSE scenarios, and it runs more than 20 times faster than the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.</p></details> | accepted by T-ITS |

However, current robotic-assisted physiotherapy methods struggle including biomechanical metrics in their control algorithms, crucial for safe and effective therapy. This paper introduces BATON, a Biomechanics-Aware Trajectory Optimization approach to robotic Navigation of human musculoskeletal loads. The method integrates a high-fidelity musculoskeletal model of the human shoulder into real-time control of robot-patient interaction during rotator cuff tendon rehabilitation.

Automatic flight trajectory planning faces challenges such as high computational effort and a lack of precision. Hence, when low computational effort or precise control is required, programming the flight route trajectory manually might be preferable. However, this requires in-depth knowledge of how to accurately plan flight trajectories in three-dimensional space. We propose planning quadrocopter flight trajectories manually using the Programming by Demonstration (PbD) approach -- simply drawing the trajectory in the three-dimensional space by hand. This simplifies the planning process and reduces the level of in-depth knowledge required. We implemented the approach in the context of the Quadcopter Lab at Ulm University. In order to evaluate our approach, we compare the precision and accuracy of the trajectories drawn by a user using our approach as well as the required time with those manually programmed using a domain specific language. The evaluation shows that the Drawjectory workflow is, on average, 78.7 seconds faster without a significant loss of precision, shown by an average deviation 6.67 cm.</p></details> |  |
| **[Revisiting CNNs for Trajectory Similarity Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19761v2)** | 2024-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Similarity search is a fundamental but expensive operator in querying trajectory data, due to its quadratic complexity of distance computation. To mitigate the computational burden for long trajectories, neural networks have been widely employed for similarity learning and each trajectory is encoded as a high-dimensional vector for similarity search with linear complexity. Given the sequential nature of trajectory data, previous efforts have been primarily devoted to the utilization of RNNs or Transformers. In this paper, we argue that the common practice of treating trajectory as sequential data results in excessive attention to capturing long-term global dependency between two sequences. Instead, our investigation reveals the pivotal role of local similarity, prompting a revisit of simple CNNs for trajectory similarity learning. We introduce ConvTraj, incorporating both 1D and 2D convolutions to capture sequential and geo-distribution features of trajectories, respectively. In addition, we conduct a series of theoretical analyses to justify the effectiveness of ConvTraj. Experimental results on four real-world large-scale datasets demonstrate that ConvTraj achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in trajectory similarity search. Owing to the simple network structure of ConvTraj, the training and inference speed on the Porto dataset with 1.6 million trajectories are increased by at least $240$x and $2.16$x, respectively.

Asteroids are often discovered using optical telescopes and their trajectories are calculated from images, resulting in an inherent asymmetric uncertainty in their position and velocity. Consequently, we typically cannot determine the exact trajectory of an asteroid, and an ensemble of trajectories must be generated to estimate an asteroid's movement over time. When propagating these ensembles over decades, it is challenging to visualize the varying paths and determine their potential impact on Earth, which could cause catastrophic damage. NEOviz equips experts with the necessary tools to effectively analyze the existing catalog of asteroid observations. In particular, we present a novel approach for visualizing the 3D uncertainty region through which an asteroid travels, while providing accurate spatial context in relation to system-critical infrastructure such as Earth, the Moon, and artificial satellites. Furthermore, we use NEOviz to visualize the divergence of asteroid trajectories, capturing high-variance events in an asteroid's orbital properties. For potential impactors, we combine the 3D visualization with an uncertainty-aware impact map to illustrate the potential risks to human populations. NEOviz was developed with continuous input from members of the planetary defense community through a participatory design process. It is exemplified in three real-world use cases and evaluated via expert feedback interviews.</p></details> |  |

We employ state-of-the-art computer vision and deep learning to create an end-to-end pipeline that enhances vehicle detection, tracking, and trajectory stabilization. Conducted in the Songdo International Business District, South Korea, the study used a multi-drone experiment over 20 intersections, capturing approximately 12TB of 4K video data over four days. We developed a novel track stabilization method that uses detected vehicle bounding boxes as exclusion masks during image registration, which, combined with advanced georeferencing techniques, accurately transforms vehicle coordinates into real-world geographical data. Additionally, our framework includes robust vehicle dimension estimation and detailed road segmentation for in-depth traffic analysis. The framework produced two high-quality datasets: the Songdo Traffic dataset, comprising nearly 1 million unique vehicle trajectories, and the Songdo Vision dataset, containing over 5,000 human-annotated frames with about 300,000 vehicle instances in four classes. Comparisons between drone-derived data and high-precision sensor data from an instrumented probe vehicle highlight the accuracy and consistency of our framework's extraction in dense urban settings.

| **[Hyper-SD: Trajectory Segmented Consistency Model for Efficient Image Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13686v3)** | 2024-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, a series of diffusion-aware distillation algorithms have emerged to alleviate the computational overhead associated with the multi-step inference process of Diffusion Models (DMs). Current distillation techniques often dichotomize into two distinct aspects: i) ODE Trajectory Preservation; and ii) ODE Trajectory Reformulation. However, these approaches suffer from severe performance degradation or domain shifts. To address these limitations, we propose Hyper-SD, a novel framework that synergistically amalgamates the advantages of ODE Trajectory Preservation and Reformulation, while maintaining near-lossless performance during step compression. Firstly, we introduce Trajectory Segmented Consistency Distillation to progressively perform consistent distillation within pre-defined time-step segments, which facilitates the preservation of the original ODE trajectory from a higher-order perspective. Secondly, we incorporate human feedback learning to boost the performance of the model in a low-step regime and mitigate the performance loss incurred by the distillation process. Thirdly, we integrate score distillation to further improve the low-step generation capability of the model and offer the first attempt to leverage a unified LoRA to support the inference process at all steps. Extensive experiments and user studies demonstrate that Hyper-SD achieves SOTA performance from 1 to 8 inference steps for both SDXL and SD1.5. For example, Hyper-SDXL surpasses SDXL-Lightning by +0.68 in CLIP Score and +0.51 in Aes Score in the 1-step inference.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2024 (Camera-Ready Version).

Principal component analysis (PCA) is applied to trajectory data consisting of $n_s = 4,000,000$ datapoints, of the FPUT $\beta$ model with $N = 32$ coupled oscillators, revealing a critical relationship between $m^{\ast}$ and the model's nonlinear strength. For weak nonlinearities, $m^{\ast} \ll n$, where $n = 2N$. In contrast, for strong nonlinearities, $m^{\ast} \rightarrow n - 1$, consistently with the ergodic hypothesis. Furthermore, one of the potential limitations of PCA is addressed through an analysis with t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding ($t$-SNE). Accordingly, we found strong evidence suggesting that the datapoints lie near or on a curved low-dimensional manifold for weak nonlinearities.</p></details> | 20 pages, 18 figures |

The number of features is comparable to the sample size and errors may be heavy-tailed. We introduce estimators that precisely track the generalization error of the iterates along the trajectory of the iterative algorithm. These estimators are provably consistent under suitable conditions. The results are illustrated through several examples, including Huber regression, pseudo-Huber regression, and their penalized variants with non-smooth regularizer. We provide explicit generalization error estimates for iterates generated from GD and SGD, or from proximal SGD in the presence of a non-smooth regularizer. The proposed risk estimates serve as effective proxies for the actual generalization error, allowing us to determine the optimal stopping iteration that minimizes the generalization error. Extensive simulations confirm the effectiveness of the proposed generalization error estimates.</p></details> | <details><summary>Camer...</summary><p>Camera-ready version of NeurIPS 2024 paper</p></details> |

Despite intensive research on driver behavior prediction, existing approaches typically overlook the interactions between AVs and HDVs assuming that HDV trajectories are not affected by AV actions. To address this gap, we present a transformer-transfer learning-based interaction-aware trajectory predictor for safe motion planning of autonomous driving, focusing on a vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) interaction scenario consisting of an AV and an HDV. Specifically, we construct a transformer-based interaction-aware trajectory predictor using widely available datasets of HDV trajectory data and further transfer the learned predictor using a small set of AV-HDV interaction data. Then, to better incorporate the proposed trajectory predictor into the motion planning module of AVs, we introduce an uncertainty quantification method to characterize the errors of the predictor, which are integrated into the path-planning process. Our experimental results demonstrate the value of explicitly considering interactions and handling uncertainties.</p></details> |  |

Current graph-based routing pipelines, while effective, involve substantial costs in constructing, maintaining, and updating road network graphs to reflect real-time conditions. In this study, we propose a new trajectory-based routing paradigm that bypasses current workflows by directly utilizing raw trajectory data to compute efficient routes. Our method, named TrajRoute, uniquely "follows" historical trajectories from a source to a destination, constructing paths that reflect actual driver behavior and implicit preferences. To supplement areas with sparse trajectory data, the road network is also incorporated into TrajRoute's index, and tunable parameters are introduced to control the balance between road segments and trajectories, ensuring a unified and adaptable routing approach. We experimentally verify our approach by comparing it to an existing online routing service. Our results demonstrate that as the number of trajectories covering the road network increases, TrajRoute produces increasingly accurate travel time and route length estimates while gradually eliminating the need to downgrade to the road network. This highlights the potential of simpler, data-driven pipelines for routing, offering lower-maintenance alternatives to conventional systems.</p></details> |  |

To bolster the adoption of the continuous-time paradigm, we propose a so-called Gaussian Process Trajectory Representation (GPTR) framework for continuous-time motion estimation (CTME) tasks. Our approach stands out by employing a third-order random jerk model, featuring closed-form expressions for both rotational and translational state derivatives. This model provides smooth, continuous trajectory representations that are crucial for precise estimation of complex motion. To support the wider robotics and computer vision communities, we have made the source code for GPTR available as a light-weight header-only library. This format was chosen for its ease of integration, allowing developers to incorporate GPTR into existing systems without needing extensive code modifications. Moreover, we also provide a set of optimization examples with LiDAR, camera, IMU, UWB factors, and closed-form analytical Jacobians under the proposed GP framework. Our experiments demonstrate the efficacy and efficiency of GP-based trajectory representation in various motion estimation tasks, and the examples can serve as the prototype to help researchers quickly develop future applications such as batch optimization, calibration, sensor fusion, trajectory planning, etc., with continuous-time trajectory representation.

The key idea is to capture each task by an object-centric representation, specifically the SE(3) object pose trajectory relative to the target. This approach decouples embodiment actions from sensory inputs, facilitating learning from various demonstration types, including both action-based and action-less human hand demonstrations, as well as cross-embodiment generalization. Additionally, object pose trajectories inherently capture planning constraints from demonstrations without the need for manually crafted rules. To guide the robot in executing the task, the object trajectory is used to condition a diffusion policy. We show improvement compared to prior work on RLBench simulated tasks. In real-world evaluation, using only eight demonstrations shot on an iPhone, our approach completed all tasks while fully complying with task constraints.

At the heart of RopeTP is a hierarchical attention mechanism that significantly improves context awareness, which is essential for accurately inferring the posture of occluded body parts. This is achieved by exploiting the relationships with visible anatomical structures, enhancing the accuracy of local pose estimations. The improved robustness of these local estimations allows for the reconstruction of precise and stable global trajectories. Additionally, RopeTP incorporates a diffusion trajectory model that predicts realistic human motion from local pose sequences. This model ensures that the generated trajectories are not only consistent with observed local actions but also unfold naturally over time, thereby improving the realism and stability of 3D human motion reconstruction. Extensive experimental validation shows that RopeTP surpasses current methods on two benchmark datasets, particularly excelling in scenarios with occlusions. It also outperforms methods that rely on SLAM for initial camera estimates and extensive optimization, delivering more accurate and realistic trajectories.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by WACV 2025 (Round 1)</p></details> |

Significant progress has been made in the past decade thanks to the availability of pedestrian trajectory datasets, which enable trajectory prediction methods to learn from pedestrians' past movements and predict future trajectories. However, these datasets and methods typically assume that the observed trajectory sequence is complete, ignoring real-world issues such as sensor failure, occlusion, and limited fields of view that can result in missing values in observed trajectories. To address this challenge, we present TrajImpute, a pedestrian trajectory prediction dataset that simulates missing coordinates in the observed trajectory, enhancing real-world applicability. TrajImpute maintains a uniform distribution of missing data within the observed trajectories. In this work, we comprehensively examine several imputation methods to reconstruct the missing coordinates and benchmark them for imputing pedestrian trajectories. Furthermore, we provide a thorough analysis of recent trajectory prediction methods and evaluate the performance of these models on the imputed trajectories. Our experimental evaluation of the imputation and trajectory prediction methods offers several valuable insights. Our dataset provides a foundational resource for future research on imputation-aware pedestrian trajectory prediction, potentially accelerating the deployment of these methods in real-world applications.

We begin by introducing the Quantile Attention-Fourier Deep Operator Network (QAF-DeepONet), designed to capture the complex dynamics of voltage trajectories and reliably estimate quantiles of the target trajectory without any distributional assumptions. The proposed operator regression model maps the observed portion of the voltage trajectory to its unobserved post-fault trajectory. Our methodology employs a pre-training and fine-tuning process to address the challenge of limited data availability. To ensure data privacy in learning the pre-trained model, we use merging via federated learning with data from neighboring buses, enabling the model to learn the underlying voltage dynamics from such buses without directly sharing their data. After pre-training, we fine-tune the model with data from the target bus, allowing it to adapt to unique dynamics and operating conditions. Finally, we integrate conformal prediction into the fine-tuned model to ensure coverage guarantees for the predicted intervals. We evaluated the performance of the proposed methodology using the New England 39-bus test system considering detailed models of voltage and frequency controllers. Two metrics, Prediction Interval Coverage Probability (PICP) and Prediction Interval Normalized Average Width (PINAW), are used to numerically assess the model's performance in predicting intervals. The results show that the proposed approach offers practical and reliable uncertainty quantification in predicting the interval of post-fault voltage trajectories.</p></details> |  |

Existing research mainly focuses on leveraging single-frame cooperative information to enhance the limited perception capability of the ego vehicle, while underutilizing the motion and interaction context of traffic participants observed from cooperative devices. In this paper, we propose a forecasting-oriented representation paradigm to utilize motion and interaction features from cooperative information. Specifically, we present V2X-Graph, a representative framework to achieve interpretable and end-to-end trajectory feature fusion for cooperative motion forecasting. V2X-Graph is evaluated on V2X-Seq in vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) scenarios. To further evaluate on vehicle-to-everything (V2X) scenario, we construct the first real-world V2X motion forecasting dataset V2X-Traj, which contains multiple autonomous vehicles and infrastructure in every scenario. Experimental results on both V2X-Seq and V2X-Traj show the advantage of our method. We hope both V2X-Graph and V2X-Traj will benefit the further development of cooperative motion forecasting.

While most existing methods consider this as a discrete problem, popularity actually evolves continuously, exhibiting rich dynamic properties such as change rates and growth patterns. In this paper, we argue that popularity trajectory prediction is more practical, as it aims to forecast the entire trajectory of how popularity unfolds over arbitrary future time. This approach offers insights into both instantaneous popularity and the underlying dynamic properties. However, traditional methods for popularity trajectory prediction primarily rely on specific diffusion mechanism assumptions, which may not align well with real-world dynamics and compromise their performance. To address these limitations, we propose NODEPT, a novel approach based on neural ordinary differential equations (ODEs) for popularity trajectory prediction. NODEPT models the continuous dynamics of the underlying diffusion system using neural ODEs. We first employ an encoder to initialize the latent state representations of information cascades, consisting of two representation learning modules that capture the co-evolution structural characteristics and temporal patterns of cascades from different perspectives. More importantly, we then introduce an ODE-based generative module that learns the dynamics of the diffusion system in the latent space. Finally, a decoder transforms the latent state into the prediction of the future popularity trajectory. Our experimental results on three real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority and rationality of the proposed NODEPT method.</p></details> | <details><summary>The t...</summary><p>The time complexity analysis in section 4.4 contains error; we overlooked the impact of the memory module</p></details> |

However, for most problems of interest, MPC relies on the recursive solution of highly non-convex trajectory optimization problems, leading to high computational complexity and strong dependency on initialization. In this work, we present a unified framework to combine the main strengths of optimization-based and learning-based methods for MPC. Our approach entails embedding high-capacity, transformer-based neural network models within the optimization process for trajectory generation, whereby the transformer provides a near-optimal initial guess, or target plan, to a non-convex optimization problem. Our experiments, performed in simulation and the real world onboard a free flyer platform, demonstrate the capabilities of our framework to improve MPC convergence and runtime. Compared to purely optimization-based approaches, results show that our approach can improve trajectory generation performance by up to 75%, reduce the number of solver iterations by up to 45%, and improve overall MPC runtime by 7x without loss in performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 7 figures.

We study generative modeling for planning with datasets repurposed from offline reinforcement learning. Specifically, we identify temporal consistency in the absence of step-wise rewards as one key technical challenge. We introduce the Latent Plan Transformer (LPT), a novel model that leverages a latent variable to connect a Transformer-based trajectory generator and the final return. LPT can be learned with maximum likelihood estimation on trajectory-return pairs. In learning, posterior sampling of the latent variable naturally integrates sub-trajectories to form a consistent abstraction despite the finite context. At test time, the latent variable is inferred from an expected return before policy execution, realizing the idea of planning as inference. Our experiments demonstrate that LPT can discover improved decisions from sub-optimal trajectories, achieving competitive performance across several benchmarks, including Gym-Mujoco, Franka Kitchen, Maze2D, and Connect Four. It exhibits capabilities in nuanced credit assignments, trajectory stitching, and adaptation to environmental contingencies. These results validate that latent variable inference can be a strong alternative to step-wise reward prompting.</p></details> |  |

Trajectory optimization is a powerful and widely used algorithm in control, parameterized by a cost and a dynamics function. The key to our approach is to leverage the recent progress in differentiable trajectory optimization, which enables computing the gradients of the loss with respect to the parameters of trajectory optimization. As a result, the cost and dynamics functions of trajectory optimization can be learned end-to-end. DiffTORI addresses the ``objective mismatch'' issue of prior model-based RL algorithms, as the dynamics model in DiffTORI is learned to directly maximize task performance by differentiating the policy gradient loss through the trajectory optimization process. We further benchmark DiffTORI for imitation learning on standard robotic manipulation task suites with high-dimensional sensory observations and compare our method to feed-forward policy classes as well as Energy-Based Models (EBM) and Diffusion.

Traditional optimization methods for trajectory tracking face significant computational challenges and lack robustness in dynamic environments.

The proposed system features two RL agents: one for predicting UAV velocities to follow a reference trajectory and another for managing collision avoidance in the presence of obstacles. This architecture ensures real-time performance and adaptability to uncertainties. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach through simulated and real-world experiments, highlighting improvements over state-of-the-art RL and optimization-based methods. Additionally, a curriculum learning paradigm is employed to scale the algorithms to more complex environments, ensuring robust trajectory tracking and obstacle avoidance in both static and dynamic scenarios.</p></details> |  |

However, existing TRL methods often produce vectors that, when used in downstream tasks, yield insufficiently accurate results. A key reason is that they fail to utilize the comprehensive information encompassed by trajectories. We propose a self-supervised TRL framework, called RED, which effectively exploits multiple types of trajectory information. Overall, RED adopts the Transformer as the backbone model and masks the constituting paths in trajectories to train a masked autoencoder (MAE). In particular, RED considers the moving patterns of trajectories by employing a Road-aware masking strategy} that retains key paths of trajectories during masking, thereby preserving crucial information of the trajectories. RED also adopts a spatial-temporal-user joint Embedding scheme to encode comprehensive information when preparing the trajectories as model inputs. To conduct training, RED adopts Dual-objective task learning}: the Transformer encoder predicts the next segment in a trajectory, and the Transformer decoder reconstructs the entire trajectory. RED also considers the spatial-temporal correlations of trajectories by modifying the attention mechanism of the Transformer. We compare RED with 9 state-of-the-art TRL methods for 4 downstream tasks on 3 real-world datasets, finding that RED can usually improve the accuracy of the best-performing baseline by over 5%.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted by VLDB2025</p></details> |

However, controlling such systems using external permanent magnets (EPM) is challenging due to nonlinear magnetic interactions, especially when there are complex navigation requirements such as avoidance of sensitive tissues. In this work, we present a novel trajectory planning and control method incorporating dynamics and navigation requirements, using a single EPM fixed to a robotic arm to manipulate an internal permanent magnet (IPM). Our approach employs a constrained iterative linear quadratic regulator that considers the dynamics of the IPM to generate optimal trajectories for both the EPM and IPM. Extensive simulations and real-world experiments, motivated by capsule endoscopy operations, demonstrate the robustness of the method, showcasing resilience to external disturbances and precise control under varying conditions. The experimental results show that the IPM reaches the goal position with a maximum mean error of 0.18 cm and a standard deviation of 0.21 cm. This work introduces a unified framework for constrained trajectory optimization in magnetic manipulation, directly incorporating both the IPM's dynamics and the EPM's manipulability.</p></details> | 8 pages, 6 figures |

Specifically, it is essential to incorporate the full 6dof variation of vehicle pose and its associated stability cost in the planning process. To this end, most recent works aim to learn a neural network model to predict the vehicle evolution. However, such approaches are data-intensive and fraught with generalization issues. In this paper, we present a purely model-based approach that just requires the digital elevation information of the terrain. Specifically, we express the wheel-terrain interaction and 6dof pose prediction as a non-linear least squares (NLS) problem. As a result, trajectory planning can be viewed as a bi-level optimization. The inner optimization layer predicts the pose on the terrain along a given trajectory, while the outer layer deforms the trajectory itself to reduce the stability and kinematic costs of the pose. We improve the state-of-the-art in the following respects. First, we show that our NLS based pose prediction closely matches the output from a high-fidelity physics engine. This result coupled with the fact that we can query gradients of the NLS solver, makes our pose predictor, a differentiable wheel-terrain interaction model. We further leverage this differentiability to efficiently solve the proposed bi-level trajectory optimization problem. Finally, we perform extensive experiments, and comparison with a baseline to showcase the effectiveness of our approach in obtaining smooth, stable trajectories.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 7 figures, submitted to IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS 2024)</p></details> |

Existing TRL methods use either grid trajectories, capturing movement in free space, or road trajectories, capturing movement in a road network, as input. We observe that the two types of trajectories are complementary, providing either region and location information or providing road structure and movement regularity. Therefore, we propose a novel multimodal TRL method, dubbed GREEN, to jointly utilize Grid and Road trajectory Expressions for Effective representatioN learning. In particular, we transform raw GPS trajectories into both grid and road trajectories and tailor two encoders to capture their respective information. To align the two encoders such that they complement each other, we adopt a contrastive loss to encourage them to produce similar embeddings for the same raw trajectory and design a mask language model (MLM) loss to use grid trajectories to help reconstruct masked road trajectories. To learn the final trajectory representation, a dual-modal interactor is used to fuse the outputs of the two encoders via cross-attention. We compare GREEN with 7 state-of-the-art TRL methods for 3 downstream tasks, finding that GREEN consistently outperforms all baselines and improves the accuracy of the best-performing baseline by an average of 15.99\%.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted by KDD2025(August Cycle)</p></details> |

| **[Tra-MoE: Learning Trajectory Prediction Model from Multiple Domains for Adaptive Policy Conditioning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14519v1)** | 2024-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning from multiple domains is a primary factor that influences the generalization of a single unified robot system. In this paper, we aim to learn the trajectory prediction model by using broad out-of-domain data to improve its performance and generalization ability. Trajectory model is designed to predict any-point trajectories in the current frame given an instruction and can provide detailed control guidance for robotic policy learning. To handle the diverse out-of-domain data distribution, we propose a sparsely-gated MoE (\textbf{Top-1} gating strategy) architecture for trajectory model, coined as \textbf{Tra-MoE}. The sparse activation design enables good balance between parameter cooperation and specialization, effectively benefiting from large-scale out-of-domain data while maintaining constant FLOPs per token. In addition, we further introduce an adaptive policy conditioning technique by learning 2D mask representations for predicted trajectories, which is explicitly aligned with image observations to guide action prediction more flexibly. We perform extensive experiments on both simulation and real-world scenarios to verify the effectiveness of Tra-MoE and adaptive policy conditioning technique. We also conduct a comprehensive empirical study to train Tra-MoE, demonstrating that our Tra-MoE consistently exhibits superior performance compared to the dense baseline model, even when the latter is scaled to match Tra-MoE's parameter count.</p></details> | 15 pages, 5 figures |
| **[FlightPatchNet: Multi-Scale Patch Network with Differential Coding for Flight Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16200v2)** | 2024-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate multi-step flight trajectory prediction plays an important role in Air Traffic Control, which can ensure the safety of air transportation. Two main issues limit the flight trajectory prediction performance of existing works. The first issue is the negative impact on prediction accuracy caused by the significant differences in data range. The second issue is that real-world flight trajectories involve underlying temporal dependencies, and existing methods fail to reveal the hidden complex temporal variations and only extract features from one single time scale. To address the above issues, we propose FlightPatchNet, a multi-scale patch network with differential coding for flight trajectory prediction. Specifically, FlightPatchNet first utilizes the differential coding to encode the original values of longitude and latitude into first-order differences and generates embeddings for all variables at each time step. Then, a global temporal attention is introduced to explore the dependencies between different time steps. To fully explore the diverse temporal patterns in flight trajectories, a multi-scale patch network is delicately designed to serve as the backbone. The multi-scale patch network exploits stacked patch mixer blocks to capture inter- and intra-patch dependencies under different time scales, and further integrates multi-scale temporal features across different scales and variables. Finally, FlightPatchNet ensembles multiple predictors to make direct multi-step prediction. Extensive experiments on ADS-B datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms the competitive baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamic Trajectory and Power Control in Ultra-Dense UAV Networks: A Mean-Field Reinforcement Learning Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14052v1)** | 2024-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In ultra-dense unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) networks, it is challenging to coordinate the resource allocation and interference management among large-scale UAVs, for providing flexible and efficient service coverage to the ground users (GUs). In this paper, we propose a learning-based resource allocation scheme in an ultra-dense UAV communication network, where the GUs' service demands are time-varying with unknown distributions. We formulate the non-cooperative game among multiple co-channel UAVs as a stochastic game, where each UAV jointly optimizes its trajectory, user association, and downlink power control to maximize the expectation of its locally cumulative energy efficiency under the interference and energy constraints. To cope with the scalability issue in a large-scale network, we further formulate the problem as a mean-field game (MFG), which simplifies the interactions among the UAVs into a two-player game between a representative UAV and a mean-field. We prove the existence and uniqueness of the equilibrium for the MFG, and propose a model-free mean-field reinforcement learning algorithm named maximum entropy mean-field deep Q network (ME-MFDQN) to solve the mean-field equilibrium in both fully and partially observable scenarios. The simulation results reveal that the proposed algorithm improves the energy efficiency compared with the benchmark algorithms. Moreover, the performance can be further enhanced if the GUs' service demands exhibit higher temporal correlation or if the UAVs have wider observation capabilities over their nearby GUs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory Representation Learning on Road Networks and Grids with Spatio-Temporal Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14014v1)** | 2024-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory representation learning is a fundamental task for applications in fields including smart city, and urban planning, as it facilitates the utilization of trajectory data (e.g., vehicle movements) for various downstream applications, such as trajectory similarity computation or travel time estimation. This is achieved by learning low-dimensional representations from high-dimensional and raw trajectory data. However, existing methods for trajectory representation learning either rely on grid-based or road-based representations, which are inherently different and thus, could lose information contained in the other modality. Moreover, these methods overlook the dynamic nature of urban traffic, relying on static road network features rather than time varying traffic patterns. In this paper, we propose TIGR, a novel model designed to integrate grid and road network modalities while incorporating spatio-temporal dynamics to learn rich, general-purpose representations of trajectories. We evaluate TIGR on two realworld datasets and demonstrate the effectiveness of combining both modalities by substantially outperforming state-of-the-art methods, i.e., up to 43.22% for trajectory similarity, up to 16.65% for travel time estimation, and up to 10.16% for destination prediction.</p></details> |  |

By converting the vehicle's position and velocity information from the Cartesian coordinate system to Frenet coordinate system, this method can more accurately describe the vehicle's deviation and travel distance relative to the center line of the road. The DDPG algorithm adopts the Actor-Critic framework, uses deep neural networks for strategy and value evaluation, and combines the experience replay mechanism and target network to improve the algorithm's stability and data utilization efficiency. Experimental results show that the DDPG algorithm based on Frenet coordinate system performs well in trajectory-tracking tasks in complex environments, achieves high-precision and stable path tracking, and demonstrates its application potential in autonomous driving and intelligent transportation systems.

| **[Almost Global Trajectory Tracking for Quadrotors Using Thrust Direction Control on $\mathcal{S}^2$](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05702v2)** | 2024-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many of the existing works on quadrotor control address the trajectory tracking problem by employing a cascade design in which the translational and rotational dynamics are stabilized by two separate controllers. The stability of the cascade is often proved by employing trajectory-based arguments, most notably, integral input-to-state stability. In this paper, we follow a different route and present a control law ensuring that a composite function constructed from the translational and rotational tracking errors is a Lyapunov function for the closed-loop cascade. In particular, starting from a generic control law for the double integrator, we develop a suitable attitude control extension, by leveraging a backstepping-like procedure. Using this construction, we provide an almost global stability certificate. The proposed design employs the unit sphere $\mathcal{S}^2$ to describe the rotational degrees of freedom required for position control. This enables a simpler controller tuning and an improved tracking performance with respect to previous global solutions. The new design is demonstrated via numerical simulations and on real-world experiments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hierarchical Diffusion Policy: manipulation trajectory generation via contact guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12982v1)** | 2024-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Decision-making in robotics using denoising diffusion processes has increasingly become a hot research topic, but end-to-end policies perform poorly in tasks with rich contact and have limited controllability. This paper proposes Hierarchical Diffusion Policy (HDP), a new imitation learning method of using objective contacts to guide the generation of robot trajectories. The policy is divided into two layers: the high-level policy predicts the contact for the robot's next object manipulation based on 3D information, while the low-level policy predicts the action sequence toward the high-level contact based on the latent variables of observation and contact. We represent both level policies as conditional denoising diffusion processes, and combine behavioral cloning and Q-learning to optimize the low level policy for accurately guiding actions towards contact. We benchmark Hierarchical Diffusion Policy across 6 different tasks and find that it significantly outperforms the existing state of-the-art imitation learning method Diffusion Policy with an average improvement of 20.8%. We find that contact guidance yields significant improvements, including superior performance, greater interpretability, and stronger controllability, especially on contact-rich tasks. To further unlock the potential of HDP, this paper proposes a set of key technical contributions including snapshot gradient optimization, 3D conditioning, and prompt guidance, which improve the policy's optimization efficiency, spatial awareness, and controllability respectively. Finally, real world experiments verify that HDP can handle both rigid and deformable objects.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2303.04137 by other authors</p></details> |
| **[Bring the Heat: Rapid Trajectory Optimization with Pseudospectral Techniques and the Affine Geometric Heat Flow Equation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12962v1)** | 2024-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating optimal trajectories for high-dimensional robotic systems in a time-efficient manner while adhering to constraints is a challenging task. To address this challenge, this paper introduces PHLAME, which applies pseudospectral collocation and spatial vector algebra to efficiently solve the Affine Geometric Heat Flow (AGHF) Partial Differential Equation (PDE) for trajectory optimization. Unlike traditional PDE approaches like the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) PDE, which solve for a function over the entire state space, computing a solution to the AGHF PDE scales more efficiently because its solution is defined over a two-dimensional domain, thereby avoiding the intractability of state-space scaling. To solve the AGHF one usually applies the Method of Lines (MOL), which works by discretizing one variable of the AGHF PDE, effectively converting the PDE into a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) that can be solved using standard time-integration methods. Though powerful, this method requires a fine discretization to generate accurate solutions and still requires evaluating the AGHF PDE which can be computationally expensive for high-dimensional systems. PHLAME overcomes this deficiency by using a pseudospectral method, which reduces the number of function evaluations required to yield a high accuracy solution thereby allowing it to scale efficiently to high-dimensional robotic systems. To further increase computational speed, this paper presents analytical expressions for the AGHF and its Jacobian, both of which can be computed efficiently using rigid body dynamics algorithms. The proposed method PHLAME is tested across various dynamical systems, with and without obstacles and compared to a number of state-of-the-art techniques. PHLAME generates trajectories for a 44-dimensional state-space system in $\sim3$ seconds, much faster than current state-of-the-art techniques.</p></details> | 26 pages, 8 figures |
| **[A data driven approach to classify descriptors based on their efficiency in translating noisy trajectories into physically-relevant information](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12570v1)** | 2024-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reconstructing the physical complexity of many-body dynamical systems can be challenging. Starting from the trajectories of their constitutive units (raw data), typical approaches require selecting appropriate descriptors to convert them into time-series, which are then analyzed to extract interpretable information. However, identifying the most effective descriptor is often non-trivial. Here, we report a data-driven approach to compare the efficiency of various descriptors in extracting information from noisy trajectories and translating it into physically relevant insights. As a prototypical system with non-trivial internal complexity, we analyze molecular dynamics trajectories of an atomistic system where ice and water coexist in equilibrium near the solid/liquid transition temperature. We compare general and specific descriptors often used in aqueous systems: number of neighbors, molecular velocities, Smooth Overlap of Atomic Positions (SOAP), Local Environments and Neighbors Shuffling (LENS), Orientational Tetrahedral Order, and distance from the fifth neighbor ($d_5$). Using Onion Clustering -- an efficient unsupervised method for single-point time-series analysis -- we assess the maximum extractable information for each descriptor and rank them via a high-dimensional metric. Our results show that advanced descriptors like SOAP and LENS outperform classical ones due to higher signal-to-noise ratios. Nonetheless, even simple descriptors can rival or exceed advanced ones after local signal denoising. For example, $d_5$, initially among the weakest, becomes the most effective at resolving the system's non-local dynamical complexity after denoising. This work highlights the critical role of noise in information extraction from molecular trajectories and offers a data-driven approach to identify optimal descriptors for systems with characteristic internal complexity.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 5 figures + 3 in supporting information (at the bottom of the manuscript)</p></details> |
| **[C$^{2}$INet: Realizing Incremental Trajectory Prediction with Prior-Aware Continual Causal Intervention](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12313v1)** | 2024-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction for multi-agents in complex scenarios is crucial for applications like autonomous driving. However, existing methods often overlook environmental biases, which leads to poor generalization. Additionally, hardware constraints limit the use of large-scale data across environments, and continual learning settings exacerbate the challenge of catastrophic forgetting. To address these issues, we propose the Continual Causal Intervention (C$^{2}$INet) method for generalizable multi-agent trajectory prediction within a continual learning framework. Using variational inference, we align environment-related prior with posterior estimator of confounding factors in the latent space, thereby intervening in causal correlations that affect trajectory representation. Furthermore, we store optimal variational priors across various scenarios using a memory queue, ensuring continuous debiasing during incremental task training. The proposed C$^{2}$INet enhances adaptability to diverse tasks while preserving previous task information to prevent catastrophic forgetting. It also incorporates pruning strategies to mitigate overfitting. Comparative evaluations on three real and synthetic complex datasets against state-of-the-art methods demonstrate that our proposed method consistently achieves reliable prediction performance, effectively mitigating confounding factors unique to different scenarios. This highlights the practical value of our method for real-world applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Age of Information Minimization in UAV-Assisted Covert Communication: Trajectory and Beamforming Design](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12312v1)** | 2024-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have the potential for time-sensitive applications. Due to wireless channel variation, received data may have an expiration time, particularly in critical situations such as rescue operations, natural disasters, or the military. Age of Information (AoI) is a metric that measures the freshness of received packets to specify the validity period of information. In addition, it is necessary to guarantee the privacy of confidential information transmission through air-to-ground links against eavesdroppers. This paper investigates UAV-assisted covert communication to minimize AoI in the presence of an aerial eavesdropper for the first time. However, to ensure the eavesdropper's error detection rate, UAV-enabled beamforming employs the power-domain non-orthogonal multiple access (PD-NOMA) technique to cover the covert user by a public user. PD-NOMA technique significantly improves the user's AoI, too. The joint optimization problem contains non-convex constraints and coupled optimization variables, including UAV trajectory, beamforming design, and the user's AoI which is challenging to derive a direct solution. We have developed an efficient alternating optimization technique to address the formulated optimization problem. Numerical results demonstrate the impact of the main parameters on the performance of the proposed communication system.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Linear Differential Inclusion for Contraction Analysis to Known Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11587v1)** | 2024-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Infinitesimal contraction analysis provides exponential convergence rates between arbitrary pairs of trajectories of a system by studying the system's linearization. An essentially equivalent viewpoint arises through stability analysis of a linear differential inclusion (LDI) encompassing the incremental behavior of the system. In this note, we study contraction of a system to a particular known trajectory, deriving a new LDI characterizing the error between arbitrary trajectories and this known trajectory. As with classical contraction analysis, this new inclusion is constructed via first partial derivatives of the system's vector field, and contraction rates are obtained with familiar tools: uniform bounding of the logarithmic norm and LMI-based Lyapunov conditions. Our LDI is guaranteed to outperform a usual contraction analysis in two special circumstances: i) when the bound on the logarithmic norm arises from an interval overapproximation of the Jacobian matrix, and ii) when the norm considered is the $\ell_1$ norm. Finally, we demonstrate how the proposed approach strictly improves an existing framework for ellipsoidal reachable set computation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Decision Transformer with Diffusion-Based Trajectory Branch Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11327v1)** | 2024-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Decision Transformer (DT) can learn effective policy from offline datasets by converting the offline reinforcement learning (RL) into a supervised sequence modeling task, where the trajectory elements are generated auto-regressively conditioned on the return-to-go (RTG).However, the sequence modeling learning approach tends to learn policies that converge on the sub-optimal trajectories within the dataset, for lack of bridging data to move to better trajectories, even if the condition is set to the highest RTG.To address this issue, we introduce Diffusion-Based Trajectory Branch Generation (BG), which expands the trajectories of the dataset with branches generated by a diffusion model.The trajectory branch is generated based on the segment of the trajectory within the dataset, and leads to trajectories with higher returns.We concatenate the generated branch with the trajectory segment as an expansion of the trajectory.After expanding, DT has more opportunities to learn policies to move to better trajectories, preventing it from converging to the sub-optimal trajectories.Empirically, after processing with BG, DT outperforms state-of-the-art sequence modeling methods on D4RL benchmark, demonstrating the effectiveness of adding branches to the dataset without further modifications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Map-Free Trajectory Prediction with Map Distillation and Hierarchical Encoding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10961v1)** | 2024-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reliable motion forecasting of surrounding agents is essential for ensuring the safe operation of autonomous vehicles. Many existing trajectory prediction methods rely heavily on high-definition (HD) maps as strong driving priors. However, the availability and accuracy of these priors are not guaranteed due to substantial costs to build, localization errors of vehicles, or ongoing road constructions. In this paper, we introduce MFTP, a Map-Free Trajectory Prediction method that offers several advantages. First, it eliminates the need for HD maps during inference while still benefiting from map priors during training via knowledge distillation. Second, we present a novel hierarchical encoder that effectively extracts spatial-temporal agent features and aggregates them into multiple trajectory queries. Additionally, we introduce an iterative decoder that sequentially decodes trajectory queries to generate the final predictions. Extensive experiments show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Argoverse dataset under the map-free setting.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Estimation of Relaxed Model Parameters for Robust UAV Trajectory Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10941v1)** | 2024-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Online trajectory optimization and optimal control methods are crucial for enabling sustainable unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) services, such as agriculture, environmental monitoring, and transportation, where available actuation and energy are limited. However, optimal controllers are highly sensitive to model mismatch, which can occur due to loaded equipment, packages to be delivered, or pre-existing variability in fundamental structural and thrust-related parameters. To circumvent this problem, optimal controllers can be paired with parameter estimators to improve their trajectory planning performance and perform adaptive control. However, UAV platforms are limited in terms of onboard processing power, oftentimes making nonlinear parameter estimation too computationally expensive to consider. To address these issues, we propose a relaxed, affine-in-parameters multirotor model along with an efficient optimal parameter estimator. We convexify the nominal Moving Horizon Parameter Estimation (MHPE) problem into a linear-quadratic form (LQ-MHPE) via an affine-in-parameter relaxation on the nonlinear dynamics, resulting in fast quadratic programs (QPs) that facilitate adaptive Model Predictve Control (MPC) in real time. We compare this approach to the equivalent nonlinear estimator in Monte Carlo simulations, demonstrating a decrease in average solve time and trajectory optimality cost by 98.2% and 23.9-56.2%, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures, submitted to IEEE Sustech 2025</p></details> |
| **[Stable Continual Reinforcement Learning via Diffusion-based Trajectory Replay](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10809v1)** | 2024-11-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Given the inherent non-stationarity prevalent in real-world applications, continual Reinforcement Learning (RL) aims to equip the agent with the capability to address a series of sequentially presented decision-making tasks. Within this problem setting, a pivotal challenge revolves around \textit{catastrophic forgetting} issue, wherein the agent is prone to effortlessly erode the decisional knowledge associated with past encountered tasks when learning the new one. In recent progresses, the \textit{generative replay} methods have showcased substantial potential by employing generative models to replay data distribution of past tasks. Compared to storing the data from past tasks directly, this category of methods circumvents the growing storage overhead and possible data privacy concerns. However, constrained by the expressive capacity of generative models, existing \textit{generative replay} methods face challenges in faithfully reconstructing the data distribution of past tasks, particularly in scenarios with a myriad of tasks or high-dimensional data. Inspired by the success of diffusion models in various generative tasks, this paper introduces a novel continual RL algorithm DISTR (Diffusion-based Trajectory Replay) that employs a diffusion model to memorize the high-return trajectory distribution of each encountered task and wakeups these distributions during the policy learning on new tasks. Besides, considering the impracticality of replaying all past data each time, a prioritization mechanism is proposed to prioritize the trajectory replay of pivotal tasks in our method. Empirical experiments on the popular continual RL benchmark \texttt{Continual World} demonstrate that our proposed method obtains a favorable balance between \textit{stability} and \textit{plasticity}, surpassing various existing continual RL baselines in average success rate.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 3 figures, 1 table, inclusion at ICLR 2024 Workshop on Generative Models for Decision Making</p></details> |

However, existing methods are often tailored to specific tasks and regions, resulting in limitations related to task specificity, regional dependency, and data quality sensitivity. Addressing these challenges requires a universal human trajectory foundation model capable of generalizing and scaling across diverse tasks and geographic contexts. To this end, we propose UniTraj, a Universal human Trajectory foundation model that is task-adaptive, region-independent, and highly generalizable. To further enhance performance, we construct WorldTrace, the first large-scale, high-quality, globally distributed dataset sourced from open web platforms, encompassing 2.45 million trajectories with billions of points across 70 countries. Through multiple resampling and masking strategies designed for pre-training, UniTraj effectively overcomes geographic and task constraints, adapting to heterogeneous data quality. Extensive experiments across multiple trajectory analysis tasks and real-world datasets demonstrate that UniTraj consistently outperforms existing approaches in terms of scalability and adaptability. These results underscore the potential of UniTraj as a versatile, robust solution for a wide range of trajectory analysis applications, with WorldTrace serving as an ideal but non-exclusive foundation for training.</p></details> |  |
| **[Tenure and Research Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10575v1)** | 2024-11-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tenure is a cornerstone of the US academic system, yet its relationship to faculty research trajectories remains poorly understood. Conceptually, tenure systems may act as a selection mechanism, screening in high-output researchers; a dynamic incentive mechanism, encouraging high output prior to tenure but low output after tenure; and a creative search mechanism, encouraging tenured individuals to undertake high-risk work. Here, we integrate data from seven different sources to trace US tenure-line faculty and their research outputs at an unprecedented scale and scope, covering over 12,000 researchers across 15 disciplines. Our analysis reveals that faculty publication rates typically increase sharply during the tenure track and peak just before obtaining tenure. Post-tenure trends, however, vary across disciplines: in lab-based fields, such as biology and chemistry, research output typically remains high post-tenure, whereas in non-lab-based fields, such as mathematics and sociology, research output typically declines substantially post-tenure. Turning to creative search, faculty increasingly produce novel, high-risk research after securing tenure. However, this shift toward novelty and risk-taking comes with a decline in impact, with post-tenure research yielding fewer highly cited papers. Comparing outcomes across common career ages but different tenure years or comparing research trajectories in tenure-based and non-tenure-based research settings underscores that breaks in the research trajectories are sharply tied to the individual's tenure year. Overall, these findings provide a new empirical basis for understanding the tenure system, individual research trajectories, and the shape of scientific output.</p></details> |  |

These individuals often face earlier onset and higher prevalence of MLTCs, yet specific co-occurrence patterns remain unexplored. This study applies an unsupervised approach to characterise MLTC clusters based on shared disease trajectories using electronic health records (EHRs) from 13069 individuals with ID in Wales (2000-2021). Disease associations and temporal directionality were assessed, followed by spectral clustering to group shared trajectories. The population consisted of 52.3% males and 47.7% females, with an average of 4.5 conditions per patient. Males under 45 formed a single cluster dominated by neurological conditions (32.4%), while males above 45 had three clusters, the largest characterised circulatory (51.8%). Females under 45 formed one cluster with digestive conditions (24.6%) as most prevalent, while those aged 45 and older showed two clusters: one dominated by circulatory (34.1%), and the other by digestive (25.9%) and musculoskeletal (21.9%) system conditions. Mental illness, epilepsy, and reflux were common across groups. These clusters offer insights into disease progression in individuals with ID, informing targeted interventions and personalised healthcare strategies.</p></details> |  |

Traditional methods rely on the use of LSTM, GRU networks, and even Transformer architectures for the prediction of spatio-temporal series. This study proposes a viable alternative for predicting these trajectories using only GNSS positions. It considers this spatio-temporal problem as a natural language processing problem. The latitude/longitude coordinates of AIS messages are transformed into cell identifiers using the H3 index. Thanks to the pseudo-octal representation, it becomes easier for language models to learn the spatial hierarchy of the H3 index. The method is compared with a classical Kalman filter, widely used in the maritime domain, and introduces the Fr\'echet distance as the main evaluation metric. We show that it is possible to predict ship trajectories quite precisely up to 8 hours ahead with 30 minutes of context, using solely GNSS positions, without relying on any additional information such as speed, course, or external conditions - unlike many traditional methods. We demonstrate that this alternative works well enough to predict trajectories worldwide.</p></details> | 28 pages, 18 figures |

This paper focuses on the integrated design of UAV trajectories and the precoders at both the transmitter and UAV in a UAV-assisted relay communication system, accounting for transmit power constraints and UAV flight limitations. Unlike previous works that primarily address multiple-input single-output (MISO) systems with Gaussian inputs, we investigate a more realistic scenario involving multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems with finite-alphabet inputs. To tackle the challenging and inherently non-convex problem, we propose an efficient solution algorithm that leverages successive convex approximation and alternating optimization techniques. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, demonstrating its capability to optimize system performance.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing approaches have overlooked the potential of these environments, focusing instead on static contexts without considering userspecific factors. Employing the CREATTIVE3D dataset, our work models trajectories recorded in virtual reality (VR) scenes for diverse situations including road-crossing tasks with user interactions and simulated visual impairments. We propose Diverse Context VR Human Motion Prediction (DiVR), a cross-modal transformer based on the Perceiver architecture that integrates both static and dynamic scene context using a heterogeneous graph convolution network. We conduct extensive experiments comparing DiVR against existing architectures including MLP, LSTM, and transformers with gaze and point cloud context. Additionally, we also stress test our model's generalizability across different users, tasks, and scenes. Results show that DiVR achieves higher accuracy and adaptability compared to other models and to static graphs. This work highlights the advantages of using VR datasets for context-aware human trajectory modeling, with potential applications in enhancing user experiences in the metaverse.

A kinematic path search is adopted on the patches, where motion primitives on different patches combine to form the global min-time cost initial trajectory. We use a same-level expansion method to locate the nearest obstacle for each trajectory waypoint and construct an objective function with curvature, smoothness and obstacle terms for optimization. We evaluate the method on several complex 3D point cloud maps. Compared to existing methods, our method demonstrates higher robustness to point cloud noise, enabling the generation of high quality trajectory while maintaining high computational efficiency. Our code will be publicly available at https://github.com/ck-tian/MLMC-planner.</p></details> |  |
| **[In-Trajectory Inverse Reinforcement Learning: Learn Incrementally Before An Ongoing Trajectory Terminates](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15612v2)** | 2024-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) aims to learn a reward function and a corresponding policy that best fit the demonstrated trajectories of an expert. However, current IRL works cannot learn incrementally from an ongoing trajectory because they have to wait to collect at least one complete trajectory to learn. To bridge the gap, this paper considers the problem of learning a reward function and a corresponding policy while observing the initial state-action pair of an ongoing trajectory and keeping updating the learned reward and policy when new state-action pairs of the ongoing trajectory are observed. We formulate this problem as an online bi-level optimization problem where the upper level dynamically adjusts the learned reward according to the newly observed state-action pairs with the help of a meta-regularization term, and the lower level learns the corresponding policy. We propose a novel algorithm to solve this problem and guarantee that the algorithm achieves sub-linear local regret $O(\sqrt{T}+\log T+\sqrt{T}\log T)$. If the reward function is linear, we prove that the proposed algorithm achieves sub-linear regret $O(\log T)$. Experiments are used to validate the proposed algorithm.</p></details> |  |
| **[UniTE: A Survey and Unified Pipeline for Pre-training Spatiotemporal Trajectory Embeddings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12550v2)** | 2024-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatiotemporal trajectories are sequences of timestamped locations, which enable a variety of analyses that in turn enable important real-world applications. It is common to map trajectories to vectors, called embeddings, before subsequent analyses. Thus, the qualities of embeddings are very important. Methods for pre-training embeddings, which leverage unlabeled trajectories for training universal embeddings, have shown promising applicability across different tasks, thus attracting considerable interest. However, research progress on this topic faces two key challenges: a lack of a comprehensive overview of existing methods, resulting in several related methods not being well-recognized, and the absence of a unified pipeline, complicating the development of new methods and the analysis of methods. We present UniTE, a survey and a unified pipeline for this domain. In doing so, we present a comprehensive list of existing methods for pre-training trajectory embeddings, which includes methods that either explicitly or implicitly employ pre-training techniques. Further, we present a unified and modular pipeline with publicly available underlying code, simplifying the process of constructing and evaluating methods for pre-training trajectory embeddings. Additionally, we contribute a selection of experimental results using the proposed pipeline on real-world datasets. Implementation of the pipeline is publicly available at https://github.com/Logan-Lin/UniTE.</p></details> |  |
| **[Cross-Domain Transfer Learning using Attention Latent Features for Multi-Agent Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06087v2)** | 2024-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the advancements of sensor hardware, traffic infrastructure and deep learning architectures, trajectory prediction of vehicles has established a solid foundation in intelligent transportation systems. However, existing solutions are often tailored to specific traffic networks at particular time periods. Consequently, deep learning models trained on one network may struggle to generalize effectively to unseen networks. To address this, we proposed a novel spatial-temporal trajectory prediction framework that performs cross-domain adaption on the attention representation of a Transformer-based model. A graph convolutional network is also integrated to construct dynamic graph feature embeddings that accurately model the complex spatial-temporal interactions between the multi-agent vehicles across multiple traffic domains. The proposed framework is validated on two case studies involving the cross-city and cross-period settings. Experimental results show that our proposed framework achieves superior trajectory prediction and domain adaptation performances over the state-of-the-art models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics 2024</p></details> |

Diffusion is an iterative algorithm in which samples are generated step-by-step, starting from pure noise. This process introduces the notion of diffusion trajectories, i.e., paths from the standard Gaussian distribution to the target image distribution. In this context, we study discriminative algorithms operating on these trajectories. Specifically, given a pre-trained diffusion model, we consider the problem of classifying images as part of the training dataset, generated by the model or originating from an external source. Our approach demonstrates the presence of patterns across steps that can be leveraged for classification. We also conduct ablation studies, which reveal that using higher-order gradient features to characterize the trajectories leads to significant performance gains and more robust algorithms.</p></details> |  |

The original paper introduces a novel approach in explainable reinforcement learning based on the attribution decisions of an agent to specific clusters of trajectories encountered during training. We verify the main claims from the paper, which state that (i) training on less trajectories induces a lower initial state value, (ii) trajectories in a cluster present similar high-level patterns, (iii) distant trajectories influence the decision of an agent, and (iv) humans correctly identify the attributed trajectories to the decision of the agent. We recover the environments used by the authors based on the partial original code they provided for one of the environments (Grid-World), and implemented the remaining from scratch (Seaquest, HalfCheetah, Breakout and Q*Bert). While we confirm that (i), (ii), and (iii) partially hold, we extend on the largely qualitative experiments from the authors by introducing a quantitative metric to further support (iii), and new experiments and visual results for (i). Moreover, we investigate the use of different clustering algorithms and encoder architectures to further support (ii). We could not support (iv), given the limited extent of the original experiments. We conclude that, while some of the claims can be supported, further investigations and experiments could be of interest. We recognise the novelty of the work from the authors and hope that our work paves the way for clearer and more transparent approaches.</p></details> |  |

The base transcription algorithm for which we establish the refinement algorithm is a direct multiple shooting technique -- $\mathsf{QuITO}$ $\textsf{v.2}$ (Quasi-Interpolation based Trajectory Optimization). The mesh refinement technique consists of two steps -- localization of certain irregular regions in an optimal control trajectory via wavelets, followed by a targeted $h$-refinement approach around such regions of irregularity. Theoretical approximation guarantees on uniform grids are presented for optimal controls with certain regularity properties, along with guarantees of localization of change points by wavelet transform. Numerical illustrations are provided for control profiles involving discontinuities to show the effectiveness of the localization and refinement strategy. We also announce, and make freely available, a new software package based on $\mathsf{QuITO}$ $\textsf{v.2}$ along with all its functionalities for completeness.

This interest necessitates accurate initial orbit determination (IOD) and orbit prediction (OP) in this domain, which faces significant challenges such as severe nonlinearity, sensitivity to initial conditions, large state-space volume, and sparse, faint, and unreliable measurements. This paper explores the capability of data-driven Koopman operator-based approximations for OP in these scenarios. Three stable periodic trajectories from distinct cislunar families are analyzed. The analysis includes theoretical justification for using a linear time-invariant system as the data-driven surrogate. This theoretical framework is supported by experimental validation. Furthermore, the accuracy is assessed by comparing the spectral content captured to period estimates derived from the fast Fourier transform (FFT) and Poincare-like sections.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2401.13784</p></details> |

Our approach integrates a robustness metric for Linear Temporal Logics (LTL) with the system's motion constraints, ensuring that the resulting trajectories are both optimal and executable. We introduce a cost function that recursively computes the robustness of temporal logic specifications while penalizing time and control effort, striking a balance between path feasibility and logical correctness. We validate our approach with simulations and real-world experiments in complex environments, demonstrating its effectiveness in producing robust and practical motion plans. This work represents a significant step towards expanding the applicability of motion planning algorithms to more complex, real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Online Omnidirectional Jumping Trajectory Planning for Quadrupedal Robots on Uneven Terrains](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04494v2)** | 2024-11-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Natural terrain complexity often necessitates agile movements like jumping in animals to improve traversal efficiency. To enable similar capabilities in quadruped robots, complex real-time jumping maneuvers are required. Current research does not adequately address the problem of online omnidirectional jumping and neglects the robot's kinodynamic constraints during trajectory generation. This paper proposes a general and complete cascade online optimization framework for omnidirectional jumping for quadruped robots. Our solution systematically encompasses jumping trajectory generation, a trajectory tracking controller, and a landing controller. It also incorporates environmental perception to navigate obstacles that standard locomotion cannot bypass, such as jumping from high platforms. We introduce a novel jumping plane to parameterize omnidirectional jumping motion and formulate a tightly coupled optimization problem accounting for the kinodynamic constraints, simultaneously optimizing CoM trajectory, Ground Reaction Forces (GRFs), and joint states. To meet the online requirements, we propose an accelerated evolutionary algorithm as the trajectory optimizer to address the complexity of kinodynamic constraints. To ensure stability and accuracy in environmental perception post-landing, we introduce a coarse-to-fine relocalization method that combines global Branch and Bound (BnB) search with Maximum a Posteriori (MAP) estimation for precise positioning during navigation and jumping. The proposed framework achieves jump trajectory generation in approximately 0.1 seconds with a warm start and has been successfully validated on two quadruped robots on uneven terrains. Additionally, we extend the framework's versatility to humanoid robots.</p></details> | Submitted to IJRR |

Traditional data-driven approaches often handle these tasks separately with specialized models. We introduce TranSPORTmer, a unified transformer-based framework capable of addressing all these tasks, showcasing its application to the intricate dynamics of multi-agent sports scenarios like soccer and basketball. Using Set Attention Blocks, TranSPORTmer effectively captures temporal dynamics and social interactions in an equivariant manner. The model's tasks are guided by an input mask that conceals missing or yet-to-be-predicted observations. Additionally, we introduce a CLS extra agent to classify states along soccer trajectories, including passes, possessions, uncontrolled states, and out-of-play intervals, contributing to an enhancement in modeling trajectories. Evaluations on soccer and basketball datasets show that TranSPORTmer outperforms state-of-the-art task-specific models in player forecasting, player forecasting-imputation, ball inference, and ball imputation. https://youtu.be/8VtSRm8oGoE</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACCV 2024</p></details> |

As a first step, we train a backup policy to generate evasive movements from arbitrary initial robot states using model-free reinforcement learning. When learning policies for other tasks, the backup policy can be used to estimate the potential risk of a collision and to offer an alternative action if the estimated risk is considered too high. No matter which action is selected, our action space ensures that the kinematic limits of the robot joints are not violated. We analyze and evaluate two different methods for estimating the risk of a collision. A physics simulation performed in the background is computationally expensive but provides the best results in deterministic environments. If a data-based risk estimator is used instead, the computational effort is significantly reduced, but an additional source of error is introduced. For evaluation, we successfully learn a reaching task and a basketball task while keeping the risk of collisions low. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach for deterministic and stochastic environments, including a human-robot scenario and a ball environment, where no state can be considered permanently safe. By conducting experiments with a real robot, we show that our approach can generate safe trajectories in real time.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L); 8 pages; 7 figures</p></details> |

However, adjusting specific elements in generated videos, such as object motion or camera movement, is often a tedious process of trial and error, e.g., involving re-generating videos with different random seeds. Recent techniques address this issue by fine-tuning a pre-trained model to follow conditioning signals, such as bounding boxes or point trajectories. Yet, this fine-tuning procedure can be computationally expensive, and it requires datasets with annotated object motion, which can be difficult to procure. In this work, we introduce SG-I2V, a framework for controllable image-to-video generation that is self-guided$\unicode{x2013}$offering zero-shot control by relying solely on the knowledge present in a pre-trained image-to-video diffusion model without the need for fine-tuning or external knowledge.

| **[Optimal Flow Matching: Learning Straight Trajectories in Just One Step](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13117v3)** | 2024-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Over the several recent years, there has been a boom in development of Flow Matching (FM) methods for generative modeling. One intriguing property pursued by the community is the ability to learn flows with straight trajectories which realize the Optimal Transport (OT) displacements. Straightness is crucial for the fast integration (inference) of the learned flow's paths. Unfortunately, most existing flow straightening methods are based on non-trivial iterative FM procedures which accumulate the error during training or exploit heuristics based on minibatch OT. To address these issues, we develop and theoretically justify the novel \textbf{Optimal Flow Matching} (OFM) approach which allows recovering the straight OT displacement for the quadratic transport in just one FM step. The main idea of our approach is the employment of vector field for FM which are parameterized by convex functions.</p></details> |  |

Predicting future movement enables cameras to automatically track and predict a player's future trajectory without human intervention. Predicting future human movement in the context of complex physical tasks is also intellectually satisfying. Swift advancements in sports analytics and the wide availability of videos for tennis have inspired us to propose a novel method called Pose2Trajectory, which predicts a tennis player's future trajectory as a sequence derived from their body joints' data and ball position. Demonstrating impressive accuracy, our approach capitalizes on body joint information to provide a comprehensive understanding of the human body's geometry and motion, thereby enhancing the prediction of the player's trajectory. We use encoder-decoder Transformer architecture trained on the joints and trajectory information of the players with ball positions. The predicted sequence can provide information to help close-up cameras to keep tracking the tennis player, following centroid coordinates. We generate a high-quality dataset from multiple videos to assist tennis player movement prediction using object detection and human pose estimation methods. It contains bounding boxes and joint information for tennis players and ball positions in singles tennis games. Our method shows promising results in predicting the tennis player's movement trajectory with different sequence prediction lengths using the joints and trajectory information with the ball position.</p></details> |  |

Both of these tasks often require filling gaps in a partially specified sequence of visits - a new problem that we call "controlled" synthetic trajectory generation. Existing methods for next-location prediction or synthetic trajectory generation cannot solve this problem as they lack the mechanisms needed to constrain the generated sequences of visits. Moreover, existing approaches (1) frequently treat space and time as independent factors, an assumption that fails to hold true in real-world scenarios, and (2) suffer from challenges in accuracy of temporal prediction as they fail to deal with mixed distributions and the inter-relationships of different modes with latent variables (e.g., day-of-the-week). These limitations become even more pronounced when the task involves filling gaps within sequences instead of solely predicting the next visit. We introduce TrajGPT, a transformer-based, multi-task, joint spatiotemporal generative model to address these issues. Taking inspiration from large language models, TrajGPT poses the problem of controlled trajectory generation as that of text infilling in natural language. TrajGPT integrates the spatial and temporal models in a transformer architecture through a Bayesian probability model that ensures that the gaps in a visit sequence are filled in a spatiotemporally consistent manner. Our experiments on public and private datasets demonstrate that TrajGPT not only excels in controlled synthetic visit generation but also outperforms competing models in next-location prediction tasks - Relatively, TrajGPT achieves a 26-fold improvement in temporal accuracy while retaining more than 98% of spatial accuracy on average.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 3 figures, 32nd ACM SIGSPATIAL International Conference on Advances in Geographic Information Systems (ACM SIGSPATIAL 2024)</p></details> |

Data augmentation techniques, such as noise injection and data synthesizing, aim to improve Q-function approximation by smoothing the learned state-action region. However, these methods often fall short of directly improving the quality of offline datasets, leading to suboptimal results. In response, we introduce GTA, Generative Trajectory Augmentation, a novel generative data augmentation approach designed to enrich offline data by augmenting trajectories to be both high-rewarding and dynamically plausible. GTA applies a diffusion model within the data augmentation framework. GTA partially noises original trajectories and then denoises them with classifier-free guidance via conditioning on amplified return value. Our results show that GTA, as a general data augmentation strategy, enhances the performance of widely used offline RL algorithms across various tasks with unique challenges.

While prior research has typically focused on either prediction or generation, our approach unifies these tasks to provide a versatile framework and achieve state-of-the-art performance.

The convex cover consists of a set of polytopes such that the union of the polytopes represents obstacle-free space, allowing us to find trajectories for robots that lie within the convex cover. In order to find the SFC that facilitates optimal trajectory generation, we iteratively find overlapping polytopes of maximum volumes that include specified waypoints initialized by a geometric or kinematic planner. Constraints at waypoints appear in two alternating stages of a joint optimization problem, which is solved by a method inspired by the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) with partially distributed variables. We validate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm using a range of parameterized environments and show its applications for two-stage motion planning.</p></details> |  |

However, extensive demonstrations are required for policy robustness and generalization. To reduce the demonstration reliance, we leverage spatial symmetry and propose ET-SEED, an efficient trajectory-level SE(3) equivariant diffusion model for generating action sequences in complex robot manipulation tasks. Further, previous equivariant diffusion models require the per-step equivariance in the Markov process, making it difficult to learn policy under such strong constraints. We theoretically extend equivariant Markov kernels and simplify the condition of equivariant diffusion process, thereby significantly improving training efficiency for trajectory-level SE(3) equivariant diffusion policy in an end-to-end manner. We evaluate ET-SEED on representative robotic manipulation tasks, involving rigid body, articulated and deformable object.

In this study, we propose an efficient and robust low-rank model for precise spatiotemporal traffic speed state estimation (TSE) using lowpenetration vehicle trajectory data. Leveraging traffic wave priors, an oblique grid-based matrix is first designed to transform the inherent dependencies of spatiotemporal traffic states into the algebraic low-rankness of a matrix. Then, with the enhanced traffic state low-rankness in the oblique matrix, a low-rank matrix completion method is tailored to explicitly capture spatiotemporal traffic propagation characteristics and precisely reconstruct traffic states. In addition, an anomaly-tolerant module based on a sparse matrix is developed to accommodate corrupted data input and thereby improve the TSE model robustness. Notably, driven by the understanding of traffic waves, the computational complexity of the proposed efficient method is only correlated with the problem size itself, not with dataset size and hyperparameter selection prevalent in existing studies. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness, robustness, and efficiency of the proposed model. The performance of the proposed method achieves up to a 12% improvement in Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) in the TSE scenarios and an 18% improvement in RMSE in the robust TSE scenarios, and it runs more than 20 times faster than the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.</p></details> | accepted by T-ITS |

However, current robotic-assisted physiotherapy methods struggle including biomechanical metrics in their control algorithms, crucial for safe and effective therapy. This paper introduces BATON, a Biomechanics-Aware Trajectory Optimization approach to robotic Navigation of human musculoskeletal loads. The method integrates a high-fidelity musculoskeletal model of the human shoulder into real-time control of robot-patient interaction during rotator cuff tendon rehabilitation.

Automatic flight trajectory planning faces challenges such as high computational effort and a lack of precision. Hence, when low computational effort or precise control is required, programming the flight route trajectory manually might be preferable. However, this requires in-depth knowledge of how to accurately plan flight trajectories in three-dimensional space. We propose planning quadrocopter flight trajectories manually using the Programming by Demonstration (PbD) approach -- simply drawing the trajectory in the three-dimensional space by hand. This simplifies the planning process and reduces the level of in-depth knowledge required. We implemented the approach in the context of the Quadcopter Lab at Ulm University. In order to evaluate our approach, we compare the precision and accuracy of the trajectories drawn by a user using our approach as well as the required time with those manually programmed using a domain specific language.

To mitigate the computational burden for long trajectories, neural networks have been widely employed for similarity learning and each trajectory is encoded as a high-dimensional vector for similarity search with linear complexity. Given the sequential nature of trajectory data, previous efforts have been primarily devoted to the utilization of RNNs or Transformers. In this paper, we argue that the common practice of treating trajectory as sequential data results in excessive attention to capturing long-term global dependency between two sequences. Instead, our investigation reveals the pivotal role of local similarity, prompting a revisit of simple CNNs for trajectory similarity learning. We introduce ConvTraj, incorporating both 1D and 2D convolutions to capture sequential and geo-distribution features of trajectories, respectively. In addition, we conduct a series of theoretical analyses to justify the effectiveness of ConvTraj. Experimental results on four real-world large-scale datasets demonstrate that ConvTraj achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in trajectory similarity search. Owing to the simple network structure of ConvTraj, the training and inference speed on the Porto dataset with 1.6 million trajectories are increased by at least $240$x and $2.16$x, respectively.

Asteroids are often discovered using optical telescopes and their trajectories are calculated from images, resulting in an inherent asymmetric uncertainty in their position and velocity. Consequently, we typically cannot determine the exact trajectory of an asteroid, and an ensemble of trajectories must be generated to estimate an asteroid's movement over time. When propagating these ensembles over decades, it is challenging to visualize the varying paths and determine their potential impact on Earth, which could cause catastrophic damage. NEOviz equips experts with the necessary tools to effectively analyze the existing catalog of asteroid observations. In particular, we present a novel approach for visualizing the 3D uncertainty region through which an asteroid travels, while providing accurate spatial context in relation to system-critical infrastructure such as Earth, the Moon, and artificial satellites. Furthermore, we use NEOviz to visualize the divergence of asteroid trajectories, capturing high-variance events in an asteroid's orbital properties. For potential impactors, we combine the 3D visualization with an uncertainty-aware impact map to illustrate the potential risks to human populations. NEOviz was developed with continuous input from members of the planetary defense community through a participatory design process. It is exemplified in three real-world use cases and evaluated via expert feedback interviews.</p></details> |  |

We employ state-of-the-art computer vision and deep learning to create an end-to-end pipeline that enhances vehicle detection, tracking, and trajectory stabilization. Conducted in the Songdo International Business District, South Korea, the study used a multi-drone experiment over 20 intersections, capturing approximately 12TB of 4K video data over four days. We developed a novel track stabilization method that uses detected vehicle bounding boxes as exclusion masks during image registration, which, combined with advanced georeferencing techniques, accurately transforms vehicle coordinates into real-world geographical data. Additionally, our framework includes robust vehicle dimension estimation and detailed road segmentation for in-depth traffic analysis. The framework produced two high-quality datasets: the Songdo Traffic dataset, comprising nearly 1 million unique vehicle trajectories, and the Songdo Vision dataset, containing over 5,000 human-annotated frames with about 300,000 vehicle instances in four classes. Comparisons between drone-derived data and high-precision sensor data from an instrumented probe vehicle highlight the accuracy and consistency of our framework's extraction in dense urban settings. By publicly releasing these datasets and the pipeline source code, this work sets new benchmarks for data quality, reproducibility, and scalability in traffic research. Results demonstrate the potential of integrating drone technology with advanced computer vision for precise, cost-effective urban traffic monitoring, providing valuable resources for the research community to develop intelligent transportation systems and improve traffic management strategies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hyper-SD: Trajectory Segmented Consistency Model for Efficient Image Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13686v3)** | 2024-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, a series of diffusion-aware distillation algorithms have emerged to alleviate the computational overhead associated with the multi-step inference process of Diffusion Models (DMs). Current distillation techniques often dichotomize into two distinct aspects: i) ODE Trajectory Preservation; and ii) ODE Trajectory Reformulation. However, these approaches suffer from severe performance degradation or domain shifts. To address these limitations, we propose Hyper-SD, a novel framework that synergistically amalgamates the advantages of ODE Trajectory Preservation and Reformulation, while maintaining near-lossless performance during step compression. Firstly, we introduce Trajectory Segmented Consistency Distillation to progressively perform consistent distillation within pre-defined time-step segments, which facilitates the preservation of the original ODE trajectory from a higher-order perspective. Secondly, we incorporate human feedback learning to boost the performance of the model in a low-step regime and mitigate the performance loss incurred by the distillation process. Thirdly, we integrate score distillation to further improve the low-step generation capability of the model and offer the first attempt to leverage a unified LoRA to support the inference process at all steps. Extensive experiments and user studies demonstrate that Hyper-SD achieves SOTA performance from 1 to 8 inference steps for both SDXL and SD1.5. For example, Hyper-SDXL surpasses SDXL-Lightning by +0.68 in CLIP Score and +0.51 in Aes Score in the 1-step inference.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2024 (Camera-Ready Version).

Principal component analysis (PCA) is applied to trajectory data consisting of $n_s = 4,000,000$ datapoints, of the FPUT $\beta$ model with $N = 32$ coupled oscillators, revealing a critical relationship between $m^{\ast}$ and the model's nonlinear strength. For weak nonlinearities, $m^{\ast} \ll n$, where $n = 2N$. In contrast, for strong nonlinearities, $m^{\ast} \rightarrow n - 1$, consistently with the ergodic hypothesis. Furthermore, one of the potential limitations of PCA is addressed through an analysis with t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding ($t$-SNE). Accordingly, we found strong evidence suggesting that the datapoints lie near or on a curved low-dimensional manifold for weak nonlinearities.</p></details> | 20 pages, 18 figures |

The number of features is comparable to the sample size and errors may be heavy-tailed. We introduce estimators that precisely track the generalization error of the iterates along the trajectory of the iterative algorithm. These estimators are provably consistent under suitable conditions. The results are illustrated through several examples, including Huber regression, pseudo-Huber regression, and their penalized variants with non-smooth regularizer. We provide explicit generalization error estimates for iterates generated from GD and SGD, or from proximal SGD in the presence of a non-smooth regularizer. The proposed risk estimates serve as effective proxies for the actual generalization error, allowing us to determine the optimal stopping iteration that minimizes the generalization error. Extensive simulations confirm the effectiveness of the proposed generalization error estimates.</p></details> | <details><summary>Camer...</summary><p>Camera-ready version of NeurIPS 2024 paper</p></details> |
| **[Interaction-Aware Trajectory Prediction for Safe Motion Planning in Autonomous Driving: A Transformer-Transfer Learning Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01475v1)** | 2024-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A critical aspect of safe and efficient motion planning for autonomous vehicles (AVs) is to handle the complex and uncertain behavior of surrounding human-driven vehicles (HDVs). Despite intensive research on driver behavior prediction, existing approaches typically overlook the interactions between AVs and HDVs assuming that HDV trajectories are not affected by AV actions. To address this gap, we present a transformer-transfer learning-based interaction-aware trajectory predictor for safe motion planning of autonomous driving, focusing on a vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) interaction scenario consisting of an AV and an HDV. Specifically, we construct a transformer-based interaction-aware trajectory predictor using widely available datasets of HDV trajectory data and further transfer the learned predictor using a small set of AV-HDV interaction data. Then, to better incorporate the proposed trajectory predictor into the motion planning module of AVs, we introduce an uncertainty quantification method to characterize the errors of the predictor, which are integrated into the path-planning process. Our experimental results demonstrate the value of explicitly considering interactions and handling uncertainties.</p></details> |  |

Current graph-based routing pipelines, while effective, involve substantial costs in constructing, maintaining, and updating road network graphs to reflect real-time conditions. In this study, we propose a new trajectory-based routing paradigm that bypasses current workflows by directly utilizing raw trajectory data to compute efficient routes. Our method, named TrajRoute, uniquely "follows" historical trajectories from a source to a destination, constructing paths that reflect actual driver behavior and implicit preferences. To supplement areas with sparse trajectory data, the road network is also incorporated into TrajRoute's index, and tunable parameters are introduced to control the balance between road segments and trajectories, ensuring a unified and adaptable routing approach. We experimentally verify our approach by comparing it to an existing online routing service. Our results demonstrate that as the number of trajectories covering the road network increases, TrajRoute produces increasingly accurate travel time and route length estimates while gradually eliminating the need to downgrade to the road network. This highlights the potential of simpler, data-driven pipelines for routing, offering lower-maintenance alternatives to conventional systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[GPTR: Gaussian Process Trajectory Representation for Continuous-Time Motion Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22931v3)** | 2024-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Continuous-time trajectory representation has gained significant popularity in recent years, as it offers an elegant formulation that allows the fusion of a larger number of sensors and sensing modalities, overcoming limitations of traditional discrete-time frameworks. To bolster the adoption of the continuous-time paradigm, we propose a so-called Gaussian Process Trajectory Representation (GPTR) framework for continuous-time motion estimation (CTME) tasks. Our approach stands out by employing a third-order random jerk model, featuring closed-form expressions for both rotational and translational state derivatives. This model provides smooth, continuous trajectory representations that are crucial for precise estimation of complex motion. To support the wider robotics and computer vision communities, we have made the source code for GPTR available as a light-weight header-only library. This format was chosen for its ease of integration, allowing developers to incorporate GPTR into existing systems without needing extensive code modifications. Moreover, we also provide a set of optimization examples with LiDAR, camera, IMU, UWB factors, and closed-form analytical Jacobians under the proposed GP framework. Our experiments demonstrate the efficacy and efficiency of GP-based trajectory representation in various motion estimation tasks, and the examples can serve as the prototype to help researchers quickly develop future applications such as batch optimization, calibration, sensor fusion, trajectory planning, etc., with continuous-time trajectory representation.

The key idea is to capture each task by an object-centric representation, specifically the SE(3) object pose trajectory relative to the target. This approach decouples embodiment actions from sensory inputs, facilitating learning from various demonstration types, including both action-based and action-less human hand demonstrations, as well as cross-embodiment generalization. Additionally, object pose trajectories inherently capture planning constraints from demonstrations without the need for manually crafted rules. To guide the robot in executing the task, the object trajectory is used to condition a diffusion policy. We show improvement compared to prior work on RLBench simulated tasks. In real-world evaluation, using only eight demonstrations shot on an iPhone, our approach completed all tasks while fully complying with task constraints.

At the heart of RopeTP is a hierarchical attention mechanism that significantly improves context awareness, which is essential for accurately inferring the posture of occluded body parts. This is achieved by exploiting the relationships with visible anatomical structures, enhancing the accuracy of local pose estimations. The improved robustness of these local estimations allows for the reconstruction of precise and stable global trajectories. Additionally, RopeTP incorporates a diffusion trajectory model that predicts realistic human motion from local pose sequences. This model ensures that the generated trajectories are not only consistent with observed local actions but also unfold naturally over time, thereby improving the realism and stability of 3D human motion reconstruction. Extensive experimental validation shows that RopeTP surpasses current methods on two benchmark datasets, particularly excelling in scenarios with occlusions. It also outperforms methods that rely on SLAM for initial camera estimates and extensive optimization, delivering more accurate and realistic trajectories.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by WACV 2025 (Round 1)</p></details> |

Significant progress has been made in the past decade thanks to the availability of pedestrian trajectory datasets, which enable trajectory prediction methods to learn from pedestrians' past movements and predict future trajectories. However, these datasets and methods typically assume that the observed trajectory sequence is complete, ignoring real-world issues such as sensor failure, occlusion, and limited fields of view that can result in missing values in observed trajectories. To address this challenge, we present TrajImpute, a pedestrian trajectory prediction dataset that simulates missing coordinates in the observed trajectory, enhancing real-world applicability. TrajImpute maintains a uniform distribution of missing data within the observed trajectories. In this work, we comprehensively examine several imputation methods to reconstruct the missing coordinates and benchmark them for imputing pedestrian trajectories. Furthermore, we provide a thorough analysis of recent trajectory prediction methods and evaluate the performance of these models on the imputed trajectories. Our experimental evaluation of the imputation and trajectory prediction methods offers several valuable insights. Our dataset provides a foundational resource for future research on imputation-aware pedestrian trajectory prediction, potentially accelerating the deployment of these methods in real-world applications.

We begin by introducing the Quantile Attention-Fourier Deep Operator Network (QAF-DeepONet), designed to capture the complex dynamics of voltage trajectories and reliably estimate quantiles of the target trajectory without any distributional assumptions. The proposed operator regression model maps the observed portion of the voltage trajectory to its unobserved post-fault trajectory. Our methodology employs a pre-training and fine-tuning process to address the challenge of limited data availability. To ensure data privacy in learning the pre-trained model, we use merging via federated learning with data from neighboring buses, enabling the model to learn the underlying voltage dynamics from such buses without directly sharing their data. After pre-training, we fine-tune the model with data from the target bus, allowing it to adapt to unique dynamics and operating conditions. Finally, we integrate conformal prediction into the fine-tuned model to ensure coverage guarantees for the predicted intervals. We evaluated the performance of the proposed methodology using the New England 39-bus test system considering detailed models of voltage and frequency controllers. Two metrics, Prediction Interval Coverage Probability (PICP) and Prediction Interval Normalized Average Width (PINAW), are used to numerically assess the model's performance in predicting intervals. The results show that the proposed approach offers practical and reliable uncertainty quantification in predicting the interval of post-fault voltage trajectories.</p></details> |  |

Existing research mainly focuses on leveraging single-frame cooperative information to enhance the limited perception capability of the ego vehicle, while underutilizing the motion and interaction context of traffic participants observed from cooperative devices. In this paper, we propose a forecasting-oriented representation paradigm to utilize motion and interaction features from cooperative information. Specifically, we present V2X-Graph, a representative framework to achieve interpretable and end-to-end trajectory feature fusion for cooperative motion forecasting. V2X-Graph is evaluated on V2X-Seq in vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) scenarios. To further evaluate on vehicle-to-everything (V2X) scenario, we construct the first real-world V2X motion forecasting dataset V2X-Traj, which contains multiple autonomous vehicles and infrastructure in every scenario. Experimental results on both V2X-Seq and V2X-Traj show the advantage of our method. We hope both V2X-Graph and V2X-Traj will benefit the further development of cooperative motion forecasting.

While most existing methods consider this as a discrete problem, popularity actually evolves continuously, exhibiting rich dynamic properties such as change rates and growth patterns. In this paper, we argue that popularity trajectory prediction is more practical, as it aims to forecast the entire trajectory of how popularity unfolds over arbitrary future time. This approach offers insights into both instantaneous popularity and the underlying dynamic properties. However, traditional methods for popularity trajectory prediction primarily rely on specific diffusion mechanism assumptions, which may not align well with real-world dynamics and compromise their performance. To address these limitations, we propose NODEPT, a novel approach based on neural ordinary differential equations (ODEs) for popularity trajectory prediction. NODEPT models the continuous dynamics of the underlying diffusion system using neural ODEs. We first employ an encoder to initialize the latent state representations of information cascades, consisting of two representation learning modules that capture the co-evolution structural characteristics and temporal patterns of cascades from different perspectives. More importantly, we then introduce an ODE-based generative module that learns the dynamics of the diffusion system in the latent space. Finally, a decoder transforms the latent state into the prediction of the future popularity trajectory. Our experimental results on three real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority and rationality of the proposed NODEPT method.</p></details> | <details><summary>The t...</summary><p>The time complexity analysis in section 4.4 contains error; we overlooked the impact of the memory module</p></details> |

However, for most problems of interest, MPC relies on the recursive solution of highly non-convex trajectory optimization problems, leading to high computational complexity and strong dependency on initialization. In this work, we present a unified framework to combine the main strengths of optimization-based and learning-based methods for MPC. Our approach entails embedding high-capacity, transformer-based neural network models within the optimization process for trajectory generation, whereby the transformer provides a near-optimal initial guess, or target plan, to a non-convex optimization problem. Our experiments, performed in simulation and the real world onboard a free flyer platform, demonstrate the capabilities of our framework to improve MPC convergence and runtime. Compared to purely optimization-based approaches, results show that our approach can improve trajectory generation performance by up to 75%, reduce the number of solver iterations by up to 45%, and improve overall MPC runtime by 7x without loss in performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 7 figures.

We study generative modeling for planning with datasets repurposed from offline reinforcement learning. Specifically, we identify temporal consistency in the absence of step-wise rewards as one key technical challenge. We introduce the Latent Plan Transformer (LPT), a novel model that leverages a latent variable to connect a Transformer-based trajectory generator and the final return. LPT can be learned with maximum likelihood estimation on trajectory-return pairs. In learning, posterior sampling of the latent variable naturally integrates sub-trajectories to form a consistent abstraction despite the finite context. At test time, the latent variable is inferred from an expected return before policy execution, realizing the idea of planning as inference. Our experiments demonstrate that LPT can discover improved decisions from sub-optimal trajectories, achieving competitive performance across several benchmarks, including Gym-Mujoco, Franka Kitchen, Maze2D, and Connect Four. It exhibits capabilities in nuanced credit assignments, trajectory stitching, and adaptation to environmental contingencies. These results validate that latent variable inference can be a strong alternative to step-wise reward prompting.</p></details> |  |

Trajectory optimization is a powerful and widely used algorithm in control, parameterized by a cost and a dynamics function. The key to our approach is to leverage the recent progress in differentiable trajectory optimization, which enables computing the gradients of the loss with respect to the parameters of trajectory optimization. As a result, the cost and dynamics functions of trajectory optimization can be learned end-to-end. DiffTORI addresses the ``objective mismatch'' issue of prior model-based RL algorithms, as the dynamics model in DiffTORI is learned to directly maximize task performance by differentiating the policy gradient loss through the trajectory optimization process. We further benchmark DiffTORI for imitation learning on standard robotic manipulation task suites with high-dimensional sensory observations and compare our method to feed-forward policy classes as well as Energy-Based Models (EBM) and Diffusion.

Traditional optimization methods for trajectory tracking face significant computational challenges and lack robustness in dynamic environments. Our approach employs deep reinforcement learning (RL) to overcome these limitations, leveraging 3D pointcloud data to perceive the environment without relying on memory-intensive obstacle representations like occupancy grids. The proposed system features two RL agents: one for predicting UAV velocities to follow a reference trajectory and another for managing collision avoidance in the presence of obstacles. This architecture ensures real-time performance and adaptability to uncertainties. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach through simulated and real-world experiments, highlighting improvements over state-of-the-art RL and optimization-based methods. Additionally, a curriculum learning paradigm is employed to scale the algorithms to more complex environments, ensuring robust trajectory tracking and obstacle avoidance in both static and dynamic scenarios.</p></details> |  |

These developments bring significant demands for structured generation in LLM inference. Context-free grammar is a flexible approach to enable structured generation via constrained decoding. However, executing context-free grammar requires going through several stack states over all tokens in vocabulary during runtime, bringing non-negligible overhead for structured generation. In this paper, we propose XGrammar, a flexible and efficient structure generation engine for large language models. XGrammar accelerates context-free grammar execution by dividing the vocabulary into context-independent tokens that can be prechecked and context-dependent tokens that need to be interpreted during runtime. We further build transformations to expand the grammar context and reduce the number of context-independent tokens. Additionally, we build an efficient persistent stack to accelerate the context-dependent token checks. Finally, we co-design the grammar engine with LLM inference engine to overlap grammar computation with GPU executions. Evaluation results show that XGrammar can achieve up to 100x speedup over existing solutions. Combined with an LLM inference engine, it can generate near-zero overhead structure generation in end-to-end low-LLM serving.</p></details> |  |

We empirically observe that, unlike single image inputs, VLLMs typically attend visual tokens from different frames at different decoding iterations, making a one-shot pruning strategy prone to removing important tokens by mistake. Motivated by this, we present DyCoke, a training-free token compression method to optimize token representation and accelerate VLLMs. DyCoke incorporates a plug-and-play temporal compression module to minimize temporal redundancy by merging redundant tokens across frames, and applies dynamic KV cache reduction to prune spatially redundant tokens selectively. It ensures high-quality inference by dynamically retaining the critical tokens at each decoding step. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that DyCoke can outperform the prior SoTA counterparts, achieving 1.5X inference speedup, 1.4X memory reduction against the baseline VLLM, while still improving the performance, with no training.</p></details> | 12 pages, 6 figures |

We are interested in capturing 4D shapes whose topology changes largely over time. We encounter that the straightforward extension of the existing 3D-based method to the desired 4D case performs poorly. In this work, we address the challenges in extending 3D neural evolution to 4D under large topological changes by proposing two novel modifications. More precisely, we introduce (i) a new architecture to discretize and encode the deformation and learn the SDF and (ii) a technique to impose the temporal consistency. (iii) Also, we propose a rendering scheme for color prediction based on Gaussian splatting. Furthermore, to facilitate learning directly from 2D images, we propose a learning framework that can disentangle the geometry and appearance from RGB images. This method of disentanglement, while also useful for the 4D evolution problem that we are concentrating on, is also novel and valid for static scenes. Our extensive experiments on various data provide awesome results and, most importantly, open a new approach toward reconstructing challenging scenes with significant topological changes and deformations.

Utilizing gpt-4o-mini, a cost-effective alternative to larger commercial LLMs, three methods, Word+Review, Review+Word, and Supply-Word, were each used to synthesize 1000 product reviews. The generated datasets were assessed for sentiment alignment, textual diversity, and data generation cost. Results demonstrated high sentiment alignment across all methods, with Pearson correlations ranging from 0.93 to 0.97. Supply-Word exhibited the highest diversity and coverage of PDT terms, although with increased generation costs. Despite minor biases toward positive sentiments, in situations with limited test data, LLM-generated synthetic data offers significant advantages, including scalability, cost savings, and flexibility in dataset production.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 2 figures, 6 tables, updated author list</p></details> |

An important example is the Zig-Zag process of [Ann. Stats. 47 (2019) 1288 - 1320] where clever sub-sampling has been shown to produce an essentially independent sample at a cost that does not scale with the size of the data. However, sub-sampling also leads to slower convergence and poor mixing of the process, a behaviour which questions the promised scalability of the algorithm. We provide a large sample scaling analysis of the Zig-Zag process and its sub-sampling versions in settings of parametric Bayesian inference. In the transient phase of the algorithm, we show that the Zig-Zag trajectories are well approximated by the solution to a system of ODEs. These ODEs possess a drift in the direction of decreasing KL-divergence between the assumed model and the true distribution and are explicitly characterized in the paper. In the stationary phase, we give weak convergence results for different versions of the Zig-Zag process. Based on our results, we estimate that for large data sets of size n, using suitable control variates with sub-sampling in Zig-Zag, the algorithm costs O(1) to obtain an essentially independent sample; a computational speed-up of O(n) over the canonical version of Zig-Zag and other traditional MCMC methods</p></details> | <details><summary>47 pa...</summary><p>47 pages, 7 figues, 1 table</p></details> |

One question that arises is how we, as humans, can understand their internal neural representations. This paper takes an initial step towards addressing this question by presenting a versatile framework to identify and interpret the semantics within LMMs. Specifically, 1) we first apply a Sparse Autoencoder(SAE) to disentangle the representations into human understandable features. 2) We then present an automatic interpretation framework to interpreted the open-semantic features learned in SAE by the LMMs themselves. We employ this framework to analyze the LLaVA-NeXT-8B model using the LLaVA-OV-72B model, demonstrating that these features can effectively steer the model's behavior. Our results contribute to a deeper understanding of why LMMs excel in specific tasks, including EQ tests, and illuminate the nature of their mistakes along with potential strategies for their rectification. These findings offer new insights into the internal mechanisms of LMMs and suggest parallels with the cognitive processes of the human brain.</p></details> |  |

Such a demand growth has significantly surpassed the improvement of corresponding chip designs. With the advancement of fabrication and integration technologies, designers have been developing Wafer-Scale Chips~(WSCs) to scale up and exploit the limits of computation density, memory capacity, and communication bandwidth at the level of a single chip. Existing solutions have demonstrated the significant advantages of WSCs over traditional designs, showing potential to effectively support LLM workloads. Despite the benefits, exploring the early-stage design space of WSCs for LLMs is a crucial yet challenging task due to the enormous and complicated design space, time-consuming evaluation methods, and inefficient exploration strategies. To address these challenges, we propose Theseus, an efficient WSC design space exploration framework for LLMs. We construct the design space of WSCs with various constraints considering the unique characteristics of WSCs. We propose efficient evaluation methodologies for large-scale NoC-based WSCs and introduce multi-fidelity Bayesian optimization to efficiently explore the design space. Evaluation results demonstrate the efficiency of Theseus that the searched Pareto optimal results outperform GPU cluster and existing WSC designs by up to 62.8\%/73.7\% in performance and 38.6\%/42.4\% in power consumption for LLM training, while improving up to 23.2$\times$ and 15.7$\times$ for the performance and power of inference tasks. Furthermore, we conduct case studies to address the design tradeoffs in WSCs and provide insights to facilitate WSC designs for LLMs.</p></details> |  |

Abstract screening is a labour-intensive component of systematic review involving repetitive application of inclusion and exclusion criteria on a large volume of studies identified by a literature search. Here, LLMs (GPT-3.5 Turbo, GPT-4 Turbo, GPT-4o, Llama 3 70B, Gemini 1.5 Pro, and Claude Sonnet 3.5) were trialled on systematic reviews in a full issue of the Cochrane Library to evaluate their accuracy in zero-shot binary classification for abstract screening. Trials over a subset of 800 records identified optimal prompting strategies and demonstrated superior performance of LLMs to human researchers in terms of sensitivity (LLM-max = 1.000, human-max = 0.775), precision (LLM-max = 0.927, human-max = 0.911), and balanced accuracy (LLM-max = 0.904, human-max = 0.865). The best performing LLM-prompt combinations were trialled across every replicated search result (n = 119,691), and exhibited consistent sensitivity (range 0.756-1.000) but diminished precision (range 0.004-0.096). 66 LLM-human and LLM-LLM ensembles exhibited perfect sensitivity with a maximal precision of 0.458, with less observed performance drop in larger trials. Significant variation in performance was observed between reviews, highlighting the importance of domain-specific validation before deployment. LLMs may reduce the human labour cost of systematic review with maintained or improved accuracy and sensitivity. Systematic review is the foundation of evidence synthesis across academic disciplines, including evidence-based medicine, and LLMs may increase the efficiency and quality of this mode of research.</p></details> | <details><summary>RS an...</summary><p>RS and AJT are joint-first authors</p></details> |

The advent of generative AI and large language models (LLMs) promises to revolutionize this process by assisting researchers in several tedious tasks, one of them being the generation of effective Boolean queries that will select the publications to consider including in a review. This paper presents an extensive study of Boolean query generation using LLMs for systematic reviews, reproducing and extending the work of Wang et al. and Alaniz et al. Our study investigates the replicability and reliability of results achieved using ChatGPT and compares its performance with open-source alternatives like Mistral and Zephyr to provide a more comprehensive analysis of LLMs for query generation. Therefore, we implemented a pipeline, which automatically creates a Boolean query for a given review topic by using a previously defined LLM, retrieves all documents for this query from the PubMed database and then evaluates the results. With this pipeline we first assess whether the results obtained using ChatGPT for query generation are reproducible and consistent. We then generalize our results by analyzing and evaluating open-source models and evaluating their efficacy in generating Boolean queries. Finally, we conduct a failure analysis to identify and discuss the limitations and shortcomings of using LLMs for Boolean query generation. This examination helps to understand the gaps and potential areas for improvement in the application of LLMs to information retrieval tasks. Our findings highlight the strengths, limitations, and potential of LLMs in the domain of information retrieval and literature review automation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Engagement-Driven Content Generation with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13187v3)** | 2024-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit significant persuasion capabilities in one-on-one interactions, but their influence within social networks remains underexplored. This study investigates the potential social impact of LLMs in these environments, where interconnected users and complex opinion dynamics pose unique challenges. In particular, we address the following research question: can LLMs learn to generate meaningful content that maximizes user engagement on social networks? To answer this question, we define a pipeline to guide the LLM-based content generation which employs reinforcement learning with simulated feedback. In our framework, the reward is based on an engagement model borrowed from the literature on opinion dynamics and information propagation. Moreover, we force the text generated by the LLM to be aligned with a given topic and to satisfy a minimum fluency requirement. Using our framework, we analyze the capabilities and limitations of LLMs in tackling the given task, specifically considering the relative positions of the LLM as an agent within the social network and the distribution of opinions in the network on the given topic. Our findings show the full potential of LLMs in creating social engagement. Notable properties of our approach are that the learning procedure is adaptive to the opinion distribution of the underlying network and agnostic to the specifics of the engagement model, which is embedded as a plug-and-play component. In this regard, our approach can be easily refined for more complex engagement tasks and interventions in computational social science. The code used for the experiments is publicly available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/EDCG/.</p></details> |  |
| **[Leveraging Large Language Models to Measure Gender Representation Bias in Gendered Language Corpora](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13677v2)** | 2024-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Gender bias in text corpora that are used for a variety of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, such as for training large language models (LLMs), can lead to the perpetuation and amplification of societal inequalities. This phenomenon is particularly pronounced in gendered languages like Spanish or French, where grammatical structures inherently encode gender, making the bias analysis more challenging. A first step in quantifying gender bias in text entails computing biases in gender representation, i.e., differences in the prevalence of words referring to males vs. females. Existing methods to measure gender representation bias in text corpora have mainly been proposed for English and do not generalize to gendered languages due to the intrinsic linguistic differences between English and gendered languages. This paper introduces a novel methodology that leverages the contextual understanding capabilities of LLMs to quantitatively measure gender representation bias in Spanish corpora. By utilizing LLMs to identify and classify gendered nouns and pronouns in relation to their reference to human entities, our approach provides a robust analysis of gender representation bias in gendered languages. We empirically validate our method on four widely-used benchmark datasets, uncovering significant gender prevalence disparities with a male-to-female ratio ranging from 4:1 to 6:1. These findings demonstrate the value of our methodology for bias quantification in gendered language corpora and suggest its application in NLP, contributing to the development of more equitable language technologies.</p></details> |  |

However, both modalities have shortcomings in holistically capturing the appearance and geometry of objects. Meanwhile, Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs), which encode information within the weights of a simple Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), have emerged as an increasingly widespread modality that simultaneously encodes the geometry and photorealistic appearance of objects. This paper investigates the feasibility and effectiveness of ingesting NeRF into MLLM. We create LLaNA, the first general-purpose NeRF-language assistant capable of performing new tasks such as NeRF captioning and Q\&A. Notably, our method directly processes the weights of the NeRF's MLP to extract information about the represented objects without the need to render images or materialize 3D data structures. Moreover, we build a dataset of NeRFs with text annotations for various NeRF-language tasks with no human intervention. Based on this dataset, we develop a benchmark to evaluate the NeRF understanding capability of our method. Results show that processing NeRF weights performs favourably against extracting 2D or 3D representations from NeRFs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review.

An Evaluation Benchmark for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14842v1)** | 2024-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Adversarial audio attacks pose a significant threat to the growing use of large language models (LLMs) in voice-based human-machine interactions. While existing research has primarily focused on model-specific adversarial methods, real-world applications demand a more generalizable and universal approach to audio adversarial attacks. In this paper, we introduce the Chat-Audio Attacks (CAA) benchmark including four distinct types of audio attacks, which aims to explore the the vulnerabilities of LLMs to these audio attacks in conversational scenarios. To evaluate the robustness of LLMs, we propose three evaluation strategies: Standard Evaluation, utilizing traditional metrics to quantify model performance under attacks; GPT-4o-Based Evaluation, which simulates real-world conversational complexities; and Human Evaluation, offering insights into user perception and trust. We evaluate six state-of-the-art LLMs with voice interaction capabilities, including Gemini-1.5-Pro, GPT-4o, and others, using three distinct evaluation methods on the CAA benchmark. Our comprehensive analysis reveals the impact of four types of audio attacks on the performance of these models, demonstrating that GPT-4o exhibits the highest level of resilience.</p></details> |  |

These models are increasingly capable of tackling abstract visual tasks. Geometric structures, particularly graphs with their inherent flexibility and complexity, serve as an excellent benchmark for evaluating these models' predictive capabilities. While human observers can readily identify subtle visual details and perform accurate analyses, our investigation reveals that state-of-the-art LVLMs exhibit consistent limitations in specific visual graph scenarios, especially when confronted with stylistic variations. In response to these challenges, we introduce VisGraphVar (Visual Graph Variability), a customizable benchmark generator able to produce graph images for seven distinct task categories (detection, classification, segmentation, pattern recognition, link prediction, reasoning, matching), designed to systematically evaluate the strengths and limitations of individual LVLMs. We use VisGraphVar to produce 990 graph images and evaluate six LVLMs, employing two distinct prompting strategies, namely zero-shot and chain-of-thought. The findings demonstrate that variations in visual attributes of images (e.g., node labeling and layout) and the deliberate inclusion of visual imperfections, such as overlapping nodes, significantly affect model performance. This research emphasizes the importance of a comprehensive evaluation across graph-related tasks, extending beyond reasoning alone. VisGraphVar offers valuable insights to guide the development of more reliable and robust systems capable of performing advanced visual graph analysis.</p></details> |  |

A prime example is the recently debated "reversal curse", which surfaces when models, having been trained on the fact "A is B", struggle to generalize this knowledge to infer that "B is A". In this paper, we examine the manifestation of the reversal curse across various tasks and delve into both the generalization abilities and the problem-solving mechanisms of LLMs. This investigation leads to a series of significant insights: (1) LLMs are able to generalize to "B is A" when both A and B are presented in the context as in the case of a multiple-choice question. (2) This generalization ability is highly correlated to the structure of the fact "A is B" in the training documents. For example, this generalization only applies to biographies structured in "[Name] is [Description]" but not to "[Description] is [Name]". (3) We propose and verify the hypothesis that LLMs possess an inherent bias in fact recalling during knowledge application, which explains and underscores the importance of the document structure to successful learning. (4) The negative impact of this bias on the downstream performance of LLMs can hardly be mitigated through training alone. These findings offer a novel perspective on interpreting LLMs' generalization through their intrinsic mechanisms and provide insights for developing more effective learning methods.

Existing video question-answering (VideoQA) datasets often rely on costly manual annotations with insufficient granularity or automatic construction methods with redundant frame-by-frame analysis, limiting their scalability and effectiveness for complex reasoning. To address these challenges, we introduce VideoEspresso, a novel dataset that features VideoQA pairs preserving essential spatial details and temporal coherence, along with multimodal annotations of intermediate reasoning steps. Our construction pipeline employs a semantic-aware method to reduce redundancy, followed by generating QA pairs using GPT-4o. We further develop video Chain-of-Thought (CoT) annotations to enrich reasoning processes, guiding GPT-4o in extracting logical relationships from QA pairs and video content. To exploit the potential of high-quality VideoQA pairs, we propose a Hybrid LVLMs Collaboration framework, featuring a Frame Selector and a two-stage instruction fine-tuned reasoning LVLM. This framework adaptively selects core frames and performs CoT reasoning using multimodal evidence. Evaluated on our proposed benchmark with 14 tasks against 9 popular LVLMs, our method outperforms existing baselines on most tasks, demonstrating superior video reasoning capabilities.

However, training such large-scale models usually requires substantial computation and storage, which poses barriers for general users with consumer-level computers. Motivated by this observation, in this paper we investigate how to achieve competitive performance on only one Nvidia RTX3090 GPU and with one terabyte for storing dataset. On one hand, we simplify the transformer block structure and combine Weight Inheritance with multi-stage Knowledge Distillation (WIKD), thereby reducing the parameters and improving the inference speed during training along with deployment. On the other hand, confronted with the convergence challenge posed by small dataset, we generate synthetic captions for each sample as data augmentation, and devise a novel Pair Matching (PM) loss to fully exploit the distinguishment among positive and negative image-text pairs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model can achieve a new state-of-the-art datascale-parameter-accuracy tradeoff, which could further popularize the CLIP model in the related research community.</p></details> |  |

A promising approach is to enforce safety constraints through Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). For such constrained RLHF, typical Lagrangian-based primal-dual policy optimization methods are computationally expensive and often unstable. This paper presents a perspective of dualization that reduces constrained alignment to an equivalent unconstrained alignment problem. We do so by pre-optimizing a smooth and convex dual function that has a closed form. This shortcut eliminates the need for cumbersome primal-dual policy iterations, greatly reducing the computational burden and improving training stability. Our strategy leads to two practical algorithms in model-based and preference-based settings (MoCAN and PeCAN, respectively). A broad range of experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and merits of our algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>32 pa...</summary><p>32 pages, 6 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |

In this work, we focus on a unified and robust evaluation of \textbf{vision perception} abilities, the foundational skill of MLLMs. We find that existing perception benchmarks, each focusing on different question types, domains, and evaluation metrics, introduce significant evaluation variance, complicating comprehensive assessments of perception abilities when relying on any single benchmark. To address this, we introduce \textbf{AbilityLens}, a unified benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs across six key perception abilities, focusing on both accuracy and stability, with each ability encompassing diverse question types, domains, and metrics. With the assistance of AbilityLens, we: (1) identify the strengths and weaknesses of current models, highlighting stability patterns and revealing a notable performance gap between open-source and closed-source models; (2) introduce an online evaluation mode, which uncovers interesting ability conflict and early convergence phenomena during MLLM training; and (3) design a simple ability-specific model merging method that combines the best ability checkpoint from early training stages, effectively mitigating performance decline due to ability conflict.

We examine both conventional fine-tuning and emergent in-context learning methods, systematically varying strategies of prompt engineering across widely used LLMs and their variants (e.g., GPT4, Mistral, and Llama3, etc.). Specifically, we varied prompt template design, shot sampling methods, and shot quantity to detect stance on HPV vaccination. Our findings reveal that 1) in general, in-context learning outperforms fine-tuning in stance detection for HPV vaccine social media content; 2) increasing shot quantity does not necessarily enhance performance across models; and 3) different LLMs and their variants present differing sensitivity to in-context learning conditions. We uncovered that the optimal in-context learning configuration for stance detection on HPV vaccine tweets involves six stratified shots paired with detailed contextual prompts. This study highlights the potential and provides an applicable approach for applying LLMs to research on social media stance and skepticism detection.</p></details> |  |

Recently, large language models (LLMs) have been applied in recommender systems due to their emergence abilities. While leveraging semantic information from LLMs has shown some improvements in the performance of recommender systems, two notable limitations persist in these studies. First, LLM-enhanced recommender systems encounter challenges in extracting valuable information from lifelong user behavior sequences within textual contexts for recommendation tasks. Second, the inherent variability in human behaviors leads to a constant stream of new behaviors and irregularly fluctuating user interests. This characteristic imposes two significant challenges on existing models. On the one hand, it presents difficulties for LLMs in effectively capturing the dynamic shifts in user interests within these sequences, and on the other hand, there exists the issue of substantial computational overhead if the LLMs necessitate recurrent calls upon each update to the user sequences. In this work, we propose Lifelong User Behavior Modeling (LIBER) based on large language models, which includes three modules: (1) User Behavior Streaming Partition (UBSP), (2) User Interest Learning (UIL), and (3) User Interest Fusion (UIF). Initially, UBSP is employed to condense lengthy user behavior sequences into shorter partitions in an incremental paradigm, facilitating more efficient processing. Subsequently, UIL leverages LLMs in a cascading way to infer insights from these partitions. Finally, UIF integrates the textual outputs generated by the aforementioned processes to construct a comprehensive representation, which can be incorporated by any recommendation model to enhance performance. LIBER has been deployed on Huawei's music recommendation service and achieved substantial improvements in users' play count and play time by 3.01% and 7.69%.</p></details> |  |

Stationary Gaussian process emulators, with their accompanying uncertainty quantification, are popular surrogates for computer models. However, many computer models are not well represented by stationary Gaussian processes models. Deep Gaussian processes have been shown to be capable of capturing non-stationary behaviors and abrupt regime changes in the computer model response. In this paper, we explore the properties of two deep Gaussian process formulations within the context of computer model emulation. For one of these formulations, we introduce a new parameter that controls the amount of smoothness in the deep Gaussian process layers. We adapt a stochastic variational approach to inference for this model, allowing for prior specification and posterior exploration of the smoothness of the response surface. Our approach can be applied to a large class of computer models, and scales to arbitrarily large simulation designs. The proposed methodology was motivated by the need to emulate an astrophysical model of the formation of binary black hole mergers.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages, 16 figures, 38 pages including Supplementary Materials</p></details> |

However, they are often general-purpose models that lack the specialized knowledge needed to tackle the unique challenges of this sector, such as the intricate physics and chemistry of semiconductor devices and processes. SemiKong, the first industry-specific LLM for the semiconductor domain, provides a foundation that can be used to develop tailored proprietary models. With SemiKong 1.0, we aim to develop a foundational model capable of understanding etching problems at an expert level. Our key contributions include (a) curating a comprehensive corpus of semiconductor-related texts, (b) creating a foundational model with in-depth semiconductor knowledge, and (c) introducing a framework for integrating expert knowledge, thereby advancing the evaluation process of domain-specific AI models. Through fine-tuning a pre-trained LLM using our curated dataset, we have shown that SemiKong outperforms larger, general-purpose LLMs in various semiconductor manufacturing and design tasks. Our extensive experiments underscore the importance of developing domain-specific LLMs as a foundation for company- or tool-specific proprietary models, paving the way for further research and applications in the semiconductor domain.

This attribute particularly appeals to the lossless image compression community, given the increasing need to compress high-resolution images in the current streaming media era. Consequently, a spontaneous envision emerges: Can the compression performance of the LLM elevate lossless image compression to new heights? However, our findings indicate that the naive application of LLM-based lossless image compressors suffers from a considerable performance gap compared with existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) codecs on common benchmark datasets. In light of this, we are dedicated to fulfilling the unprecedented intelligence (compression) capacity of the LLM for lossless image compression tasks, thereby bridging the gap between theoretical and practical compression performance. Specifically, we propose P$^{2}$-LLM, a next-pixel prediction-based LLM, which integrates various elaborated insights and methodologies, \textit{e.g.,} pixel-level priors, the in-context ability of LLM, and a pixel-level semantic preservation strategy, to enhance the understanding capacity of pixel sequences for better next-pixel predictions. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that P$^{2}$-LLM can beat SOTA classical and learned codecs.</p></details> |  |

We developed an experimental framework using Big Five personality surveys and uncovered a previously undetected social desirability bias in a wide range of LLMs. By systematically varying the number of questions LLMs were exposed to, we demonstrate their ability to infer when they are being evaluated. When personality evaluation is inferred, LLMs skew their scores towards the desirable ends of trait dimensions (i.e., increased extraversion, decreased neuroticism, etc). This bias exists in all tested models, including GPT-4/3.5, Claude 3, Llama 3, and PaLM-2. Bias levels appear to increase in more recent models, with GPT-4's survey responses changing by 1.20 (human) standard deviations and Llama 3's by 0.98 standard deviations-very large effects. This bias is robust to randomization of question order and paraphrasing. Reverse-coding all the questions decreases bias levels but does not eliminate them, suggesting that this effect cannot be attributed to acquiescence bias. Our findings reveal an emergent social desirability bias and suggest constraints on profiling LLMs with psychometric tests and on using LLMs as proxies for human participants.</p></details> | <details><summary>3 pag...</summary><p>3 pages, 2 figures, accepted at PNAS Nexus</p></details> |

To address this issue, the recently proposed Memory-efficient Zeroth-order (MeZO) methods attempt to fine-tune LLMs using only forward passes, thereby avoiding the need for a backpropagation graph. However, significant performance drops and a high risk of divergence have limited their widespread adoption. In this paper, we propose the Adaptive Zeroth-order Tensor-Train Adaption (AdaZeta) framework, specifically designed to improve the performance and convergence of the ZO methods. To enhance dimension-dependent ZO estimation accuracy, we introduce a fast-forward, low-parameter tensorized adapter. To tackle the frequently observed divergence issue in large-scale ZO fine-tuning tasks, we propose an adaptive query number schedule that guarantees convergence. Detailed theoretical analysis and extensive experimental results on Roberta-Large and Llama-2-7B models substantiate the efficacy of our AdaZeta framework in terms of accuracy, memory efficiency, and convergence speed.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in EMNLP 2024</p></details> |

Despite various efforts to improve LLM reasoning, high-quality long-chain reasoning data and optimized training pipelines still remain inadequately explored in vision-language tasks. In this paper, we present Insight-V, an early effort to 1) scalably produce long and robust reasoning data for complex multi-modal tasks, and 2) an effective training pipeline to enhance the reasoning capabilities of multi-modal large language models (MLLMs). Specifically, to create long and structured reasoning data without human labor, we design a two-step pipeline with a progressive strategy to generate sufficiently long and diverse reasoning paths and a multi-granularity assessment method to ensure data quality. We observe that directly supervising MLLMs with such long and complex reasoning data will not yield ideal reasoning ability. To tackle this problem, we design a multi-agent system consisting of a reasoning agent dedicated to performing long-chain reasoning and a summary agent trained to judge and summarize reasoning results. We further incorporate an iterative DPO algorithm to enhance the reasoning agent's generation stability and quality. Based on the popular LLaVA-NeXT model and our stronger base MLLM, we demonstrate significant performance gains across challenging multi-modal benchmarks requiring visual reasoning. Benefiting from our multi-agent system, Insight-V can also easily maintain or improve performance on perception-focused multi-modal tasks.</p></details> |  |

These challenges often arise in image processing tasks due to unknown defects in the forward process that may result in varying degrees of inexactness in the forward model. Moreover, for many large-scale problems, computing the square root or inverse of the prior covariance matrix is infeasible such as when the covariance kernel is defined on irregular grids or is accessible only through matrix-vector products. This paper introduces an efficient approach by developing an inexact generalized Golub-Kahan decomposition that can incorporate varying degrees of inexactness in the forward model to solve large-scale generalized Tikhonov regularized problems. Further, a hybrid iterative projection scheme is developed to automatically select Tikhonov regularization parameters. Numerical experiments on simulated tomography reconstructions demonstrate the stability and effectiveness of this novel hybrid approach.</p></details> |  |

Building on recent advancements in autoregressive pre-training of vision models, we extend this framework to a multimodal setting, i.e., images and text. In this paper, we present AIMV2, a family of generalist vision encoders characterized by a straightforward pre-training process, scalability, and remarkable performance across a range of downstream tasks. This is achieved by pairing the vision encoder with a multimodal decoder that autoregressively generates raw image patches and text tokens. Our encoders excel not only in multimodal evaluations but also in vision benchmarks such as localization, grounding, and classification. Notably, our AIMV2-3B encoder achieves 89.5% accuracy on ImageNet-1k with a frozen trunk. Furthermore, AIMV2 consistently outperforms state-of-the-art contrastive models (e.g., CLIP, SigLIP) in multimodal image understanding across diverse settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://github.com/apple/ml-aim</p></details> |

Unlike methods that reconstruct from videos, multi-view images, or predefined 3D templates, single-view reconstruction faces significant challenges due to inherent ambiguities and occlusions. These challenges are further amplified by the diverse nature of hand poses and the vast variety of object shapes and sizes. Our key insight is that current foundational models for segmentation, inpainting, and 3D reconstruction robustly generalize to in-the-wild images, which could provide strong visual and geometric priors for reconstructing hand-object interactions. Specifically, given a single image, we first design a novel pipeline to estimate the underlying hand pose and object shape using off-the-shelf large models. Furthermore, with the initial reconstruction, we employ a prior-guided optimization scheme, which optimizes hand pose to comply with 3D physical constraints and the 2D input image content. We perform experiments across several datasets and show that our method consistently outperforms baselines and faithfully reconstructs a diverse set of hand-object interactions.

| **[Looking Beyond Text: Reducing Language bias in Large Vision-Language Models via Multimodal Dual-Attention and Soft-Image Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14279v1)** | 2024-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have achieved impressive results in various vision-language tasks. However, despite showing promising performance, LVLMs suffer from hallucinations caused by language bias, leading to diminished focus on images and ineffective visual comprehension. We identify two primary reasons for this bias: 1. Different scales of training data between the pretraining stage of LLM and multimodal alignment stage. 2. The learned inference bias due to short-term dependency of text data. Therefore, we propose LACING, a systemic framework designed to address the language bias of LVLMs with muLtimodal duAl-attention meChanIsm (MDA) aNd soft-image Guidance (IFG). Specifically, MDA introduces a parallel dual-attention mechanism that enhances the integration of visual inputs across the model. IFG introduces a learnable soft visual prompt during training and inference to replace visual inputs, designed to compel LVLMs to prioritize text inputs. Then, IFG further proposes a novel decoding strategy using the soft visual prompt to mitigate the model's over-reliance on adjacent text inputs. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our method effectively debiases LVLMs from their language bias, enhancing visual comprehension and reducing hallucinations without requiring additional training resources or data.

| **[Knowledge Graphs, Large Language Models, and Hallucinations: An NLP Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14258v1)** | 2024-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized Natural Language Processing (NLP) based applications including automated text generation, question answering, chatbots, and others. However, they face a significant challenge: hallucinations, where models produce plausible-sounding but factually incorrect responses. This undermines trust and limits the applicability of LLMs in different domains. Knowledge Graphs (KGs), on the other hand, provide a structured collection of interconnected facts represented as entities (nodes) and their relationships (edges). In recent research, KGs have been leveraged to provide context that can fill gaps in an LLM understanding of certain topics offering a promising approach to mitigate hallucinations in LLMs, enhancing their reliability and accuracy while benefiting from their wide applicability. Nonetheless, it is still a very active area of research with various unresolved open problems. In this paper, we discuss these open challenges covering state-of-the-art datasets and benchmarks as well as methods for knowledge integration and evaluating hallucinations. In our discussion, we consider the current use of KGs in LLM systems and identify future directions within each of these challenges.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 2 Figures, 1 Table</p></details> |

However, the unknown and diverse forgery techniques, varied facial features and complex environmental factors pose significant challenges for face forgery analysis. Existing datasets lack descriptive annotations of these aspects, making it difficult for models to distinguish between real and forged faces using only visual information amid various confounding factors. In addition, existing methods fail to yield user-friendly and explainable results, hindering the understanding of the model's decision-making process. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel Open-World Face Forgery Analysis VQA (OW-FFA-VQA) task and its corresponding benchmark. To tackle this task, we first establish a dataset featuring a diverse collection of real and forged face images with essential descriptions and reliable forgery reasoning. Based on this dataset, we introduce FFAA: Face Forgery Analysis Assistant, consisting of a fine-tuned Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) and Multi-answer Intelligent Decision System (MIDS). By integrating hypothetical prompts with MIDS, the impact of fuzzy classification boundaries is effectively mitigated, enhancing model robustness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method not only provides user-friendly and explainable results but also significantly boosts accuracy and robustness compared to previous methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 21 figures; project page: https://ffaa-vl.github.io</p></details> |
| **[FoPru: Focal Pruning for Efficient Large Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14164v1)** | 2024-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) represent a significant advancement toward achieving superior multimodal capabilities by enabling powerful Large Language Models (LLMs) to understand visual input. Typically, LVLMs utilize visual encoders, such as CLIP, to transform images into visual tokens, which are then aligned with textual tokens through projection layers before being input into the LLM for inference. Although existing LVLMs have achieved significant success, their inference efficiency is still limited by the substantial number of visual tokens and the potential redundancy among them. To mitigate this issue, we propose Focal Pruning (FoPru), a training-free method that prunes visual tokens based on the attention-based token significance derived from the vision encoder. Specifically, we introduce two alternative pruning strategies: 1) the rank strategy, which leverages all token significance scores to retain more critical tokens in a global view; 2) the row strategy, which focuses on preserving continuous key information in images from a local perspective. Finally, the selected tokens are reordered to maintain their original positional relationships. Extensive experiments across various LVLMs and multimodal datasets demonstrate that our method can prune a large number of redundant tokens while maintaining high accuracy, leading to significant improvements in inference efficiency.</p></details> | 11 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Towards a Middleware for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14513v1)** | 2024-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models have gained widespread popularity for their ability to process natural language inputs and generate insights derived from their training data, nearing the qualities of true artificial intelligence. This advancement has prompted enterprises worldwide to integrate LLMs into their services. So far, this effort is dominated by commercial cloud-based solutions like OpenAI's ChatGPT and Microsoft Azure. As the technology matures, however, there is a strong incentive for independence from major cloud providers through self-hosting "LLM as a Service", driven by privacy, cost, and customization needs. In practice, hosting LLMs independently presents significant challenges due to their complexity and integration issues with existing systems. In this paper, we discuss our vision for a forward-looking middleware system architecture that facilitates the deployment and adoption of LLMs in enterprises, even for advanced use cases in which we foresee LLMs to serve as gateways to a complete application ecosystem and, to some degree, absorb functionality traditionally attributed to the middleware.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning from "Silly" Questions Improves Large Language Models, But Only Slightly](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14121v1)** | 2024-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Constructing high-quality Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) datasets is critical for the training of large language models (LLMs). Recent studies have shown that using data from a specific source, Ruozhiba, a Chinese website where users ask "silly" questions to better understand certain topics, can lead to better fine-tuning performance. This paper aims to explore some hidden factors: the potential interpretations of its success and a large-scale evaluation of the performance. First, we leverage GPT-4 to analyze the successful cases of Ruozhiba questions from the perspective of education, psychology, and cognitive science, deriving a set of explanatory rules. Then, we construct fine-tuning datasets by applying these rules to the MMLU training set. Surprisingly, our results indicate that rules can significantly improve model performance in certain tasks, while potentially diminishing performance on others. For example, SFT data generated following the "Counterintuitive Thinking" rule can achieve approximately a 5% improvement on the "Global Facts" task, whereas the "Blurring the Conceptual Boundaries" rule leads to a performance drop of 6.14% on the "Econometrics" task. In addition, for specific tasks, different rules tend to have a consistent impact on model performance. This suggests that the differences between the extracted rules are not as significant, and the effectiveness of the rules is relatively consistent across tasks. Our research highlights the importance of considering task diversity and rule applicability when constructing SFT datasets to achieve more comprehensive performance improvements.</p></details> | 27 pages, 14 figures |

Recently, mesh-based road surface reconstruction algorithms have shown promising reconstruction results. However, these mesh-based methods suffer from slow speed and poor reconstruction quality. To address these limitations, we propose a novel large-scale road surface reconstruction approach with meshgrid Gaussian, named RoGs. Specifically, we model the road surface by placing Gaussian surfels in the vertices of a uniformly distributed square mesh, where each surfel stores color, semantic, and geometric information. This square mesh-based layout covers the entire road with fewer Gaussian surfels and reduces the overlap between Gaussian surfels during training. In addition, because the road surface has no thickness, 2D Gaussian surfel is more consistent with the physical reality of the road surface than 3D Gaussian sphere. Then, unlike previous initialization methods that rely on point clouds, we introduce a vehicle pose-based initialization method to initialize the height and rotation of the Gaussian surfel. Thanks to this meshgrid Gaussian modeling and pose-based initialization, our method achieves significant speedups while improving reconstruction quality. We obtain excellent results in reconstruction of road surfaces in a variety of challenging real-world scenes.</p></details> |  |

Structured pruning reduces model size and speeds up inference but often causes uneven degradation across domains, leading to biased performance. To address this, we propose DRPruning, which incorporates distributionally robust optimization to restore balanced performance across domains, along with further improvements to enhance robustness. Experiments in monolingual and multilingual settings show that our method surpasses similarly sized models in pruning and continued pretraining over perplexity, downstream tasks, and instruction tuning. We further provide analysis demonstrating the robustness of our method towards various domains and distribution shifts. Furthermore, our method automatically determines optimal reference losses and data ratios, suggesting potential for broader applications.

Typically, cultural datasets and benchmarks are constructed either by extracting subsets of existing datasets or by aggregating from platforms such as Wikipedia and social media. However, these approaches are highly dependent on real-world data and human annotations, making them costly and difficult to scale. Inspired by cognitive theories on social communication, this paper introduces CulturePark, an LLM-powered multi-agent communication framework for cultural data collection. CulturePark simulates cross-cultural human communication with LLM-based agents playing roles in different cultures. It generates high-quality cross-cultural dialogues encapsulating human beliefs, norms, and customs. Using CulturePark, we generated 41,000 cultural samples to fine-tune eight culture-specific LLMs. We evaluated these models across three downstream tasks: content moderation, cultural alignment, and cultural education. Results show that for content moderation, our GPT-3.5-based models either match or outperform GPT-4 on datasets. Regarding cultural alignment, our models surpass GPT-4 on Hofstede's VSM 13 framework. Furthermore, for cultural education of human participants, our models demonstrate superior outcomes in both learning efficacy and user experience compared to GPT-4. CulturePark proves an important step in addressing cultural bias and advancing the democratization of AI, highlighting the critical role of culturally inclusive data in model training.

However, long video processing and precise moment retrieval remain challenging due to LLMs' limited context size and coarse frame extraction. We propose the Large Language-and-Vision Assistant for Moment Retrieval (LLaVA-MR), which enables accurate moment retrieval and contextual grounding in videos using MLLMs. LLaVA-MR combines Dense Frame and Time Encoding (DFTE) for spatial-temporal feature extraction, Informative Frame Selection (IFS) for capturing brief visual and motion patterns, and Dynamic Token Compression (DTC) to manage LLM context limitations. Evaluations on benchmarks like Charades-STA and QVHighlights demonstrate that LLaVA-MR outperforms 11 state-of-the-art methods, achieving an improvement of 1.82% in R1@0.5 and 1.29% in mAP@0.5 on the QVHighlights dataset.

| **[Planning-Driven Programming: A Large Language Model Programming Workflow](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14503v1)** | 2024-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The strong performance of large language models (LLMs) on natural language processing tasks raises extensive discussion on their application to code generation. Recent work suggests multiple sampling approaches to improve initial code generation accuracy or program repair approaches to refine the code. However, these methods suffer from LLMs' inefficiencies and limited reasoning capacity. In this work, we propose an LLM programming workflow (LPW) designed to improve both initial code generation and subsequent refinements within a structured two-phase workflow. Specifically, in the solution generation phase, the LLM first outlines a solution plan that decomposes the problem into manageable sub-problems and then verifies the generated solution plan through visible test cases. Subsequently, in the code implementation phase, the LLM initially drafts a code according to the solution plan and its verification. If the generated code fails the visible tests, the plan verification serves as the intended natural language solution to inform the refinement process for correcting bugs. We further introduce SLPW, a sampling variant of LPW, which initially generates multiple solution plans and plan verifications, produces a program for each plan and its verification, and refines each program as necessary until one successfully passes the visible tests. Compared to the state-of-the-art methods across various existing LLMs, our experimental results show that LPW significantly improves the Pass@1 accuracy by up to 16.4% on well-established text-to-code generation benchmarks, especially with a notable improvement of around 10% on challenging benchmarks. Additionally, SLPW demonstrates up to a 5.6% improvement over LPW and sets new state-of-the-art Pass@1 accuracy on various benchmarks, e.g., 98.2% on HumanEval, 84.8% on MBPP, 64.0% on APPS, and 35.3% on CodeContest, using GPT-4o as the backbone.</p></details> |  |
| **[Pro-Prophet: A Systematic Load Balancing Method for Efficient Parallel Training of Large-scale MoE Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10003v2)** | 2024-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The size of deep learning models has been increasing to enhance model quality. The linear increase in training computation budget with model size means that training an extremely large-scale model is exceedingly time-consuming. Recently, the Mixture of Expert (MoE) has drawn significant attention as it can scale models to extra-large sizes with a stable computation budget. However, inefficient distributed training of large-scale MoE models hinders their broader application. Specifically, a considerable dynamic load imbalance occurs among devices during training, significantly reducing throughput. Several load-balancing works have been proposed to address the challenge. System-level solutions draw more attention for their hardware affinity and non-disruption of model convergence compared to algorithm-level ones. However, they are troubled by high communication costs and poor communication-computation overlapping. To address these challenges, we propose a systematic load-balancing method, Pro-Prophet, which consists of a planner and a scheduler for efficient parallel training of large-scale MoE models. To adapt to the dynamic load imbalance, we profile training statistics and use them to design Pro-Prophet. For lower communication volume, Pro-Prophet planner determines a series of lightweight load-balancing strategies and efficiently searches for a communication-efficient one for training based on the statistics. For sufficient overlapping of communication and computation, Pro-Prophet scheduler schedules the data-dependent operations based on the statistics and operation features, further improving the training throughput. Experimental results indicate that Pro-Prophet achieves up to 2.66x speedup compared to Deepspeed-MoE and FasterMoE. Additionally, Pro-Prophet achieves a load-balancing enhancement of up to 11.01x when compared to FasterMoE.</p></details> |  |

Recent works leverage image-caption datasets to train MLLMs, achieving state-of-the-art performance on image-to-text tasks. However, there are few studies exploring which layers of MLLMs make the most effort to the global image information, which plays vital roles in multimodal comprehension and generation. In this study, we find that the intermediate layers of models can encode more global semantic information, whose representation vectors perform better on visual-language entailment tasks, rather than the topmost layers. We further probe models regarding local semantic representations through object recognition tasks. We find that the topmost layers may excessively focus on local information, leading to a diminished ability to encode global information.

| **[Robust Detection of Watermarks for Large Language Models Under Human Edits](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13868v1)** | 2024-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Watermarking has offered an effective approach to distinguishing text generated by large language models (LLMs) from human-written text. However, the pervasive presence of human edits on LLM-generated text dilutes watermark signals, thereby significantly degrading detection performance of existing methods. In this paper, by modeling human edits through mixture model detection, we introduce a new method in the form of a truncated goodness-of-fit test for detecting watermarked text under human edits, which we refer to as Tr-GoF. We prove that the Tr-GoF test achieves optimality in robust detection of the Gumbel-max watermark in a certain asymptotic regime of substantial text modifications and vanishing watermark signals. Importantly, Tr-GoF achieves this optimality \textit{adaptively} as it does not require precise knowledge of human edit levels or probabilistic specifications of the LLMs, in contrast to the optimal but impractical (Neyman--Pearson) likelihood ratio test. Moreover, we establish that the Tr-GoF test attains the highest detection efficiency rate in a certain regime of moderate text modifications. In stark contrast, we show that sum-based detection rules, as employed by existing methods, fail to achieve optimal robustness in both regimes because the additive nature of their statistics is less resilient to edit-induced noise. Finally, we demonstrate the competitive and sometimes superior empirical performance of the Tr-GoF test on both synthetic data and open-source LLMs in the OPT and LLaMA families.</p></details> |  |
| **[Disentangling Memory and Reasoning Ability in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13504v2)** | 2024-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance in handling complex tasks requiring both extensive knowledge and reasoning abilities. However, the existing LLM inference pipeline operates as an opaque process without explicit separation between knowledge retrieval and reasoning steps, making the model's decision-making process unclear and disorganized. This ambiguity can lead to issues such as hallucinations and knowledge forgetting, which significantly impact the reliability of LLMs in high-stakes domains. In this paper, we propose a new inference paradigm that decomposes the complex inference process into two distinct and clear actions: (1) memory recall: which retrieves relevant knowledge, and (2) reasoning: which performs logical steps based on the recalled knowledge. To facilitate this decomposition, we introduce two special tokens memory and reason, guiding the model to distinguish between steps that require knowledge retrieval and those that involve reasoning. Our experiment results show that this decomposition not only improves model performance but also enhances the interpretability of the inference process, enabling users to identify sources of error and refine model responses effectively.

However, recent studies have brought to light instances of bias inherent within these LLMs, presenting a critical issue that demands attention. In our research, we delve deeper into the intricate challenge of harmonising accuracy and fairness in the enhancement of LLMs. While improving accuracy can indeed enhance overall LLM performance, it often occurs at the expense of fairness. Overemphasising optimisation of one metric invariably leads to a significant degradation of the other. This underscores the necessity of taking into account multiple considerations during the design and optimisation phases of LLMs. Therefore, we advocate for reformulating the LLM training process as a multi-objective learning task. Our investigation reveals that multi-objective evolutionary learning (MOEL) methodologies offer promising avenues for tackling this challenge. Our MOEL framework enables the simultaneous optimisation of both accuracy and fairness metrics, resulting in a Pareto-optimal set of LLMs. In summary, our study sheds valuable lights on the delicate equilibrium between accuracy and fairness within LLMs, which is increasingly significant for their real-world applications. By harnessing MOEL, we present a promising pathway towards fairer and more efficacious AI technologies.</p></details> | 9 pages |
| **[A Closer Look at Machine Unlearning for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08109v2)** | 2024-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) may memorize sensitive or copyrighted content, raising privacy and legal concerns. Due to the high cost of retraining from scratch, researchers attempt to employ machine unlearning to remove specific content from LLMs while preserving the overall performance. In this paper, we discuss several issues in machine unlearning for LLMs and provide our insights on possible approaches. To address the issue of inadequate evaluation of model outputs after unlearning, we introduce three additional metrics to evaluate token diversity, sentence semantics, and factual correctness. We then categorize unlearning methods into untargeted and targeted, and discuss their issues respectively. Specifically, the behavior that untargeted unlearning attempts to approximate is unpredictable and may involve hallucinations, and existing regularization is insufficient for targeted unlearning. To alleviate these issues, we propose using the objective of maximizing entropy (ME) for untargeted unlearning and incorporate answer preservation (AP) loss as regularization for targeted unlearning. Experimental results across three scenarios, i.e., fictitious unlearning, continual unlearning, and real-world unlearning, demonstrate the effectiveness of our approaches. The code is available at https://github.com/sail-sg/closer-look-LLM-unlearning.</p></details> |  |

Recent techniques have sought to structure LLM outputs using control flow and other code-adjacent techniques to improve planning performance. These techniques include using variables (to track important information) and functions (to divide complex tasks into smaller re-usable sub-tasks). However, purely code-based approaches can be error-prone and insufficient for handling ambiguous or unstructured data. To address these challenges, we propose REPL-Plan, an LLM planning approach that is fully code-expressive (it can utilize all the benefits of code) while also being dynamic (it can flexibly adapt from errors and use the LLM for fuzzy situations). In REPL-Plan, an LLM solves tasks by interacting with a Read-Eval-Print Loop (REPL), which iteratively executes and evaluates code, similar to language shells or interactive code notebooks, allowing the model to flexibly correct errors and handle tasks dynamically. We demonstrate that REPL-Plan achieves strong results across various planning domains compared to previous methods.</p></details> |  |

While text-to-image datasets are abundant, data available for instruction-based image-to-image tasks like object addition and removal is limited. This is because of the several challenges associated with the data generation process, such as, significant human effort, limited automation, suboptimal end-to-end models, data diversity constraints and high expenses. We propose an automated data generation pipeline aimed at alleviating such limitations, and introduce GalaxyEdit - a large-scale image editing dataset for add and remove operations. We fine-tune the SD v1.5 model on our dataset and find that our model can successfully handle a broader range of objects and complex editing instructions, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in FID scores by 11.2\% and 26.1\% for add and remove tasks respectively. Furthermore, in light of on-device usage scenarios, we expand our research to include task-specific lightweight adapters leveraging the ControlNet-xs architecture. While ControlNet-xs excels in canny and depth guided generation, we propose to improve the communication between the control network and U-Net for more intricate add and remove tasks. We achieve this by enhancing ControlNet-xs with non-linear interaction layers based on Volterra filters. Our approach outperforms ControlNet-xs in both add/remove and canny-guided image generation tasks, highlighting the effectiveness of the proposed enhancement.</p></details> | 10 pages, 6 figures |

This study investigates how nine widely used LLMs allocate knowledge between local context and global parameters when answering open-ended questions in knowledge-consistent scenarios. We introduce a novel dataset, WikiAtomic, and systematically vary context sizes to analyze how LLMs prioritize and utilize the provided information and their parametric knowledge in knowledge-consistent scenarios. Additionally, we also study their tendency to hallucinate under varying context sizes. Our findings reveal consistent patterns across models, including a consistent reliance on both contextual (around 70%) and parametric (around 30%) knowledge, and a decrease in hallucinations with increasing context. These insights highlight the importance of more effective context organization and developing models that use input more deterministically for robust performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by EMNLP 2024 Main Conference</p></details> |
| **[Tiny-Align: Bridging Automatic Speech Recognition and Large Language Model on the Edge](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13766v1)** | 2024-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The combination of Large Language Models (LLM) and Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), when deployed on edge devices (called edge ASR-LLM), can serve as a powerful personalized assistant to enable audio-based interaction for users. Compared to text-based interaction, edge ASR-LLM allows accessible and natural audio interactions. Unfortunately, existing ASR-LLM models are mainly trained in high-performance computing environments and produce substantial model weights, making them difficult to deploy on edge devices. More importantly, to better serve users' personalized needs, the ASR-LLM must be able to learn from each distinct user, given that audio input often contains highly personalized characteristics that necessitate personalized on-device training. Since individually fine-tuning the ASR or LLM often leads to suboptimal results due to modality-specific limitations, end-to-end training ensures seamless integration of audio features and language understanding (cross-modal alignment), ultimately enabling a more personalized and efficient adaptation on edge devices. However, due to the complex training requirements and substantial computational demands of existing approaches, cross-modal alignment between ASR audio and LLM can be challenging on edge devices. In this work, we propose a resource-efficient cross-modal alignment framework that bridges ASR and LLMs on edge devices to handle personalized audio input. Our framework enables efficient ASR-LLM alignment on resource-constrained devices like NVIDIA Jetson Orin (8GB RAM), achieving 50x training time speedup while improving the alignment quality by more than 50\%. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to study efficient ASR-LLM alignment on resource-constrained edge devices.</p></details> | 7 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Exploring Large Language Models for Climate Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13724v1)** | 2024-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the increasing impacts of climate change, there is a growing demand for accessible tools that can provide reliable future climate information to support planning, finance, and other decision-making applications. Large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-4, present a promising approach to bridging the gap between complex climate data and the general public, offering a way for non-specialist users to obtain essential climate insights through natural language interaction. However, an essential challenge remains under-explored: evaluating the ability of LLMs to provide accurate and reliable future climate predictions, which is crucial for applications that rely on anticipating climate trends. In this study, we investigate the capability of GPT-4 in predicting rainfall at short-term (15-day) and long-term (12-month) scales. We designed a series of experiments to assess GPT's performance under different conditions, including scenarios with and without expert data inputs. Our results indicate that GPT, when operating independently, tends to generate conservative forecasts, often reverting to historical averages in the absence of clear trend signals. This study highlights both the potential and challenges of applying LLMs for future climate predictions, providing insights into their integration with climate-related applications and suggesting directions for enhancing their predictive capabilities in the field.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large Language Models on Graphs: A Comprehensive Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02783v4)** | 2024-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs), such as GPT4 and LLaMA, are creating significant advancements in natural language processing, due to their strong text encoding/decoding ability and newly found emergent capability (e.g., reasoning). While LLMs are mainly designed to process pure texts, there are many real-world scenarios where text data is associated with rich structure information in the form of graphs (e.g., academic networks, and e-commerce networks) or scenarios where graph data is paired with rich textual information (e.g., molecules with descriptions). Besides, although LLMs have shown their pure text-based reasoning ability, it is underexplored whether such ability can be generalized to graphs (i.e., graph-based reasoning). In this paper, we provide a systematic review of scenarios and techniques related to large language models on graphs. We first summarize potential scenarios of adopting LLMs on graphs into three categories, namely pure graphs, text-attributed graphs, and text-paired graphs. We then discuss detailed techniques for utilizing LLMs on graphs, including LLM as Predictor, LLM as Encoder, and LLM as Aligner, and compare the advantages and disadvantages of different schools of models. Furthermore, we discuss the real-world applications of such methods and summarize open-source codes and benchmark datasets. Finally, we conclude with potential future research directions in this fast-growing field.

| **[Large Scale Transfer Learning for Tabular Data via Language Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12031v2)** | 2024-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tabular data -- structured, heterogeneous, spreadsheet-style data with rows and columns -- is widely used in practice across many domains. However, while recent foundation models have reduced the need for developing task-specific datasets and predictors in domains such as language modeling and computer vision, this transfer learning paradigm has not had similar impact in the tabular domain. In this work, we seek to narrow this gap and present TabuLa-8B, a language model for tabular prediction. We define a process for extracting a large, high-quality training dataset from the TabLib corpus, proposing methods for tabular data filtering and quality control. Using the resulting dataset, which comprises over 2.1B rows from over 4M unique tables, we fine-tune a Llama 3-8B large language model (LLM) for tabular data prediction (classification and binned regression) using a novel packing and attention scheme for tabular prediction. Through evaluation across a test suite of 329 datasets, we find that TabuLa-8B has zero-shot accuracy on unseen tables that is over 15 percentage points (pp) higher than random guessing, a feat that is not possible with existing state-of-the-art tabular prediction models (e.g. XGBoost, TabPFN). In the few-shot setting (1-32 shots), without any fine-tuning on the target datasets, TabuLa-8B is 5-15 pp more accurate than XGBoost and TabPFN models that are explicitly trained on equal, or even up to 16x more data. We release our model, code, and data along with the publication of this paper.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2024 camera-ready updates</p></details> |
| **[From Decoding to Meta-Generation: Inference-time Algorithms for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16838v2)** | 2024-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One of the most striking findings in modern research on large language models (LLMs) is that scaling up compute during training leads to better results. However, less attention has been given to the benefits of scaling compute during inference. This survey focuses on these inference-time approaches. We explore three areas under a unified mathematical formalism: token-level generation algorithms, meta-generation algorithms, and efficient generation. Token-level generation algorithms, often called decoding algorithms, operate by sampling a single token at a time or constructing a token-level search space and then selecting an output. These methods typically assume access to a language model's logits, next-token distributions, or probability scores. Meta-generation algorithms work on partial or full sequences, incorporating domain knowledge, enabling backtracking, and integrating external information. Efficient generation methods aim to reduce token costs and improve the speed of generation. Our survey unifies perspectives from three research communities: traditional natural language processing, modern LLMs, and machine learning systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unleashing the Power of Large Language Models for Group POI Recommendations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13415v1)** | 2024-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Group Point-of-Interest (POI) recommendations aim to predict the next POI that satisfies the diverse preferences of a group of users. This task is more challenging than traditional individual POI recommendations due to complex group decision-making and extremely sparse group-level check-in data. Existing methods for group POI recommendations primarily rely on single ID-based features from check-in data, capturing only statistical correlations and failing to fully utilize the rich semantic information contained in the check-ins, resulting in suboptimal performance. To this end, we propose a framework that unleashes the power of the Large Language Model (LLM) for context-aware group POI recommendations (LLMGPR). Our approach first introduces POI tokens alongside the original word tokens of the LLM, which are initialized by applying the LLM to the rich information of each POI. We then propose a novel sequencing adapter guided by Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation (QLORA) to modify the LLM. The enhanced LLM can learn sequence representations by combining semantic-enhanced POI tokens and rich contextual information including positional encodings and spatio-temporal differences. This approach can be adapted for learning either group or user representations depending on the sequence type. Furthermore, we enhance group representations by aggregating individual member representations with another QLORA-based aggregation adapter and introducing a self-supervised learning task that predicts the purpose of check-in sequences, alleviating the data sparsity issue. Our experimental results demonstrate that LLMGPR outperforms existing methods, effectively addressing group-level data sparsity and providing superior recommendations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Are Large Language Models Memorizing Bug Benchmarks?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13323v1)** | 2024-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have become integral to various software engineering tasks, including code generation, bug detection, and repair. To evaluate model performance in these domains, numerous bug benchmarks containing real-world bugs from software projects have been developed. However, a growing concern within the software engineering community is that these benchmarks may not reliably reflect true LLM performance due to the risk of data leakage. Despite this concern, limited research has been conducted to quantify the impact of potential leakage. In this paper, we systematically evaluate popular LLMs to assess their susceptibility to data leakage from widely used bug benchmarks. To identify potential leakage, we use multiple metrics, including a study of benchmark membership within commonly used training datasets, as well as analyses of negative log-likelihood and n-gram accuracy. Our findings show that certain models, in particular codegen-multi, exhibit significant evidence of memorization in widely used benchmarks like Defects4J, while newer models trained on larger datasets like LLaMa 3.1 exhibit limited signs of leakage. These results highlight the need for careful benchmark selection and the adoption of robust metrics to adequately assess models capabilities.</p></details> | pre-print |

However, most evaluations rely on traditional methods like multiple-choice questions in benchmarks such as VideoMME and LongVideoBench, which are prone to lack the depth needed to capture the complex demands of real-world users. To address this limitation-and due to the prohibitive cost and slow pace of human annotation for video tasks-we introduce VideoAutoArena, an arena-style benchmark inspired by LMSYS Chatbot Arena's framework, designed to automatically assess LMMs' video analysis abilities. VideoAutoArena utilizes user simulation to generate open-ended, adaptive questions that rigorously assess model performance in video understanding. The benchmark features an automated, scalable evaluation framework, incorporating a modified ELO Rating System for fair and continuous comparisons across multiple LMMs. To validate our automated judging system, we construct a 'gold standard' using a carefully curated subset of human annotations, demonstrating that our arena strongly aligns with human judgment while maintaining scalability. Additionally, we introduce a fault-driven evolution strategy, progressively increasing question complexity to push models toward handling more challenging video analysis scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that VideoAutoArena effectively differentiates among state-of-the-art LMMs, providing insights into model strengths and areas for improvement. To further streamline our evaluation, we introduce VideoAutoBench as an auxiliary benchmark, where human annotators label winners in a subset of VideoAutoArena battles. We use GPT-4o as a judge to compare responses against these human-validated answers. Together, VideoAutoArena and VideoAutoBench offer a cost-effective, and scalable framework for evaluating LMMs in user-centric video analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://videoautoarena.github.io/</p></details> |

In particular, we identify that existing pre-training strategies for monolithic MLLMs often suffer from unstable optimization or catastrophic forgetting. To address this issue, our core idea is to embed a new visual parameter space into a pre-trained LLM, thereby stably learning visual knowledge from noisy data while freezing the LLM. Based on this principle, we present Mono-InternVL, a novel monolithic MLLM that seamlessly integrates a set of visual experts via a multimodal mixture-of-experts structure. Moreover, we propose an innovative pre-training strategy to maximize the visual capability of Mono-InternVL, namely Endogenous Visual Pre-training (EViP). In particular, EViP is designed as a progressive learning process for visual experts, which aims to fully exploit the visual knowledge from noisy data to high-quality data. To validate our approach, we conduct extensive experiments on 16 benchmarks. Experimental results confirm the superior performance of Mono-InternVL than existing monolithic MLLMs on 13 of 16 multimodal benchmarks, e.g., +80 points over Emu3 on OCRBench. Compared to the modular baseline, i.e., InternVL-1.5, Mono-InternVL still retains comparable multimodal performance while reducing up to 67% first token latency. Code and model are released at https://huggingface.co/OpenGVLab/Mono-InternVL-2B.</p></details> |  |

We focus on a specific privacy risk where LLMs may help identify the authorship of anonymous texts, which challenges the effectiveness of anonymity in real-world systems such as anonymous peer review systems. To investigate these risks, we present AIDBench, a new benchmark that incorporates several author identification datasets, including emails, blogs, reviews, articles, and research papers. AIDBench utilizes two evaluation methods: one-to-one authorship identification, which determines whether two texts are from the same author; and one-to-many authorship identification, which, given a query text and a list of candidate texts, identifies the candidate most likely written by the same author as the query text. We also introduce a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-based method to enhance the large-scale authorship identification capabilities of LLMs, particularly when input lengths exceed the models' context windows, thereby establishing a new baseline for authorship identification using LLMs. Our experiments with AIDBench demonstrate that LLMs can correctly guess authorship at rates well above random chance, revealing new privacy risks posed by these powerful models. The source code and data will be made publicly available after acceptance.</p></details> | 21 pages, 7 figures |

Suitably prompted, LLMs can be coaxed into discussing such existentially significant matters as their own putative consciousness and the role of artificial intelligence in the fate of the Cosmos. Here we examine two lengthy conversations of this type. We trace likely sources, both ancient and modern, for the extensive repertoire of images, myths, metaphors, and conceptual esoterica that the language model draws on during these conversations, and foreground the contemporary communities and cultural movements that deploy related motifs, especially in their online activity. Finally, we consider the larger societal impacts of such engagements with LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Statistical Significance with Relevance Assessments of Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13212v1)** | 2024-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Test collections are an integral part of Information Retrieval (IR) research. They allow researchers to evaluate and compare ranking algorithms in a quick, easy and reproducible way. However, constructing these datasets requires great efforts in manual labelling and logistics, and having only few human relevance judgements can introduce biases in the comparison. Recent research has explored the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for labelling the relevance of documents for building new retrieval test collections. Their strong text-understanding capabilities and low cost compared to human-made judgements makes them an appealing tool for gathering relevance judgements. Results suggest that LLM-generated labels are promising for IR evaluation in terms of ranking correlation, but nothing is said about the implications in terms of statistical significance. In this work, we look at how LLM-generated judgements preserve the same pairwise significance evaluation as human judgements. Our results show that LLM judgements detect most of the significant differences while maintaining acceptable numbers of false positives. However, we also show that some systems are treated differently under LLM-generated labels, suggesting that evaluation with LLM judgements might not be entirely fair. Our work represents a step forward in the evaluation of statistical testing results provided by LLM judgements. We hope that this will serve as a basis for other researchers to develop reliable models for automatic relevance assessments.</p></details> |  |

Significant resources have been invested in the safety of LLMs and their alignment with social norms. However, research examining their behavior from the information security awareness (ISA) perspective is lacking. Chatbots and LLM-based assistants may put unwitting users in harm's way by facilitating unsafe behavior. We observe that the ISA inherent in some of today's most popular LLMs varies significantly, with most models requiring user prompts with a clear security context to utilize their security knowledge and provide safe responses to users. Based on this observation, we created a comprehensive set of 30 scenarios to assess the ISA of LLMs. These scenarios benchmark the evaluated models with respect to all focus areas defined in a mobile ISA taxonomy. Among our findings is that ISA is mildly affected by changing the model's temperature, whereas adjusting the system prompt can substantially impact it. This underscores the necessity of setting the right system prompt to mitigate ISA weaknesses. Our findings also highlight the importance of ISA assessment for the development of future LLM-based assistants.</p></details> |  |

However, interoperability challenges, particularly with missing medical codes, hinders effective data integration across studies. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising solution for automated coding without labeled data, current approaches face challenges on complex coding tasks. We introduce ALIGN, a novel compositional LLM-based system for automated, zero-shot medical coding. ALIGN follows a three-step process: (1) diverse candidate code generation; (2) self-evaluation of codes and (3) confidence scoring and uncertainty estimation enabling human deferral to ensure reliability. We evaluate ALIGN on harmonizing medication terms into Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) and medical history terms into Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) codes extracted from 22 immunology trials. ALIGN outperformed the LLM baselines, while also providing capabilities for trustworthy deployment. For MedDRA coding, ALIGN achieved high accuracy across all levels, matching RAG and excelling at the most specific levels (87-90% for HLGT). For ATC coding, ALIGN demonstrated superior performance, particularly at lower hierarchy levels (ATC Level 4), with 72-73% overall accuracy and 86-89% accuracy for common medications, outperforming baselines by 7-22%. ALIGN's uncertainty-based deferral improved accuracy by 17% to 90% accuracy with 30% deferral, notably enhancing performance on uncommon medications. ALIGN achieves this cost-efficiently at \$0.0007 and \$0.02 per code for GPT-4o-mini and GPT-4o, reducing barriers to clinical adoption. ALIGN advances automated medical coding for clinical trial data, contributing to enhanced data interoperability and reusability, positioning it as a promising tool to improve clinical research and accelerate drug development.</p></details> |  |

In certain scenarios, such as multi-tenant serving, deploying multiple LLMs becomes necessary to meet complex demands. Recent studies suggest decomposing a fine-tuned LLM into a base model and corresponding delta weights, which are then compressed using low-rank or low-bit approaches to reduce costs. In this work, we observe that existing low-rank and low-bit compression methods can significantly harm the model performance for task-specific fine-tuned LLMs (e.g., WizardMath for math problems). Motivated by the long-tail distribution of singular values in the delta weights, we propose a delta quantization approach using mixed-precision. This method employs higher-bit representation for singular vectors corresponding to larger singular values. We evaluate our approach on various fine-tuned LLMs, including math LLMs, code LLMs, chat LLMs, and even VLMs. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach performs comparably to full fine-tuned LLMs, surpassing both low-rank and low-bit baselines by a considerable margin. Additionally, we show that our method is compatible with various backbone LLMs, such as Llama-2, Llama-3, and Mistral, highlighting its generalizability.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2024 |

To bridge this gap, following the concept of scaling test-time, we propose a simple method by encouraging models to adopt a more patient reasoning style without the need of introducing new knowledge or skills. To employ a preference optimization approach, we generate detailed reasoning processes as positive examples and simple answers as negative examples, thereby training the model to favor thoroughness in its responses.

However, the risks associated with using LLMs in medical applications have not been systematically characterized. We propose using five key principles for safe and trustworthy medical AI: Truthfulness, Resilience, Fairness, Robustness, and Privacy, along with ten specific aspects. Under this comprehensive framework, we introduce a novel MedGuard benchmark with 1,000 expert-verified questions. Our evaluation of 11 commonly used LLMs shows that the current language models, regardless of their safety alignment mechanisms, generally perform poorly on most of our benchmarks, particularly when compared to the high performance of human physicians. Despite recent reports indicate that advanced LLMs like ChatGPT can match or even exceed human performance in various medical tasks, this study underscores a significant safety gap, highlighting the crucial need for human oversight and the implementation of AI safety guardrails.</p></details> |  |

Multi-Branch Cooperation Network for Large-Scale Click-Through Rate Prediction at Taobao](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13057v1)** | 2024-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing click-through rate (CTR) prediction works have studied the role of feature interaction through a variety of techniques. Each interaction technique exhibits its own strength, and solely using one type could constrain the model's capability to capture the complex feature relationships, especially for industrial large-scale data with enormous users and items. Recent research shows that effective CTR models often combine an MLP network with a dedicated feature interaction network in a two-parallel structure. However, the interplay and cooperative dynamics between different streams or branches remain under-researched. In this work, we introduce a novel Multi-Branch Cooperation Network (MBCnet) which enables multiple branch networks to collaborate with each other for better complex feature interaction modeling. Specifically, MBCnet consists of three branches: the Expert-based Feature Grouping and Crossing (EFGC) branch that promotes the model's memorization ability of specific feature fields, the low rank Cross Net branch and Deep branch to enhance both explicit and implicit feature crossing for improved generalization. Among branches, a novel cooperation scheme is proposed based on two principles: branch co-teaching and moderate differentiation. Branch co-teaching encourages well-learned branches to support poorly-learned ones on specific training samples. Moderate differentiation advocates branches to maintain a reasonable level of difference in their feature representations. The cooperation strategy improves learning through mutual knowledge sharing via co-teaching and boosts the discovery of diverse feature interactions across branches. Extensive experiments on large-scale industrial datasets and online A/B test demonstrate MBCnet's superior performance, delivering a 0.09 point increase in CTR, 1.49% growth in deals, and 1.62% rise in GMV. Core codes will be released soon.</p></details> | 10 pages |
| **[Efficient Masked AutoEncoder for Video Object Counting and A Large-Scale Benchmark](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13056v1)** | 2024-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The dynamic imbalance of the fore-background is a major challenge in video object counting, which is usually caused by the sparsity of foreground objects. This often leads to severe under- and over-prediction problems and has been less studied in existing works. To tackle this issue in video object counting, we propose a density-embedded Efficient Masked Autoencoder Counting (E-MAC) framework in this paper. To effectively capture the dynamic variations across frames, we utilize an optical flow-based temporal collaborative fusion that aligns features to derive multi-frame density residuals. The counting accuracy of the current frame is boosted by harnessing the information from adjacent frames. More importantly, to empower the representation ability of dynamic foreground objects for intra-frame, we first take the density map as an auxiliary modality to perform $\mathtt{D}$ensity-$\mathtt{E}$mbedded $\mathtt{M}$asked m$\mathtt{O}$deling ($\mathtt{DEMO}$) for multimodal self-representation learning to regress density map. However, as $\mathtt{DEMO}$ contributes effective cross-modal regression guidance, it also brings in redundant background information and hard to focus on foreground regions. To handle this dilemma, we further propose an efficient spatial adaptive masking derived from density maps to boost efficiency. In addition, considering most existing datasets are limited to human-centric scenarios, we first propose a large video bird counting dataset $\textit{DroneBird}$, in natural scenarios for migratory bird protection. Extensive experiments on three crowd datasets and our $\textit{DroneBird}$ validate our superiority against the counterparts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hardware Scaling Trends and Diminishing Returns in Large-Scale Distributed Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13055v1)** | 2024-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dramatic increases in the capabilities of neural network models in recent years are driven by scaling model size, training data, and corresponding computational resources. To develop the exceedingly large networks required in modern applications, such as large language models (LLMs), model training is distributed across tens of thousands of hardware accelerators (e.g. GPUs), requiring orchestration of computation and communication across large computing clusters. In this work, we demonstrate that careful consideration of hardware configuration and parallelization strategy is critical for effective (i.e. compute- and cost-efficient) scaling of model size, training data, and total computation. We conduct an extensive empirical study of the performance of large-scale LLM training workloads across model size, hardware configurations, and distributed parallelization strategies. We demonstrate that: (1) beyond certain scales, overhead incurred from certain distributed communication strategies leads parallelization strategies previously thought to be sub-optimal in fact become preferable; and (2) scaling the total number of accelerators for large model training quickly yields diminishing returns even when hardware and parallelization strategies are properly optimized, implying poor marginal performance per additional unit of power or GPU-hour.</p></details> |  |
| **["It was 80% me, 20% AI": Seeking Authenticity in Co-Writing with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13032v1)** | 2024-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Given the rising proliferation and diversity of AI writing assistance tools, especially those powered by large language models (LLMs), both writers and readers may have concerns about the impact of these tools on the authenticity of writing work. We examine whether and how writers want to preserve their authentic voice when co-writing with AI tools and whether personalization of AI writing support could help achieve this goal. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 19 professional writers, during which they co-wrote with both personalized and non-personalized AI writing-support tools. We supplemented writers' perspectives with opinions from 30 avid readers about the written work co-produced with AI collected through an online survey. Our findings illuminate conceptions of authenticity in human-AI co-creation, which focus more on the process and experience of constructing creators' authentic selves. While writers reacted positively to personalized AI writing tools, they believed the form of personalization needs to target writers' growth and go beyond the phase of text production. Overall, readers' responses showed less concern about human-AI co-writing. Readers could not distinguish AI-assisted work, personalized or not, from writers' solo-written work and showed positive attitudes toward writers experimenting with new technology for creative writing.</p></details> |  |

Most of the existing CSC approaches relying on BERT architecture achieve excellent performance. However, limited by the scale of the foundation model, BERT-based method does not work well in few-shot scenarios, showing certain limitations in practical applications. In this paper, we explore using an in-context learning method named RS-LLM (Rich Semantic based LLMs) to introduce large language models (LLMs) as the foundation model. Besides, we study the impact of introducing various Chinese rich semantic information in our framework. We found that by introducing a small number of specific Chinese rich semantic structures, LLMs achieve better performance than the BERT-based model on few-shot CSC task. Furthermore, we conduct experiments on multiple datasets, and the experimental results verified the superiority of our proposed framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted by Findings of the Association for Computational Linguistics: ACL 2024</p></details> |

In-Context Learning (ICL) and Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) are currently two mainstream methods for augmenting LLMs to downstream tasks. ICL typically constructs a few-shot learning scenario, either manually or by setting up a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system, helping models quickly grasp domain knowledge or question-answering patterns without changing model parameters. However, this approach involves trade-offs, such as slower inference speed and increased space occupancy. PEFT assists the model in adapting to tasks through minimal parameter modifications, but the training process still demands high hardware requirements, even with a small number of parameters involved. To address these challenges, we propose Reference Trustable Decoding (RTD), a paradigm that allows models to quickly adapt to new tasks without fine-tuning, maintaining low inference costs. RTD constructs a reference datastore from the provided training examples and optimizes the LLM's final vocabulary distribution by flexibly selecting suitable references based on the input, resulting in more trustable responses and enabling the model to adapt to downstream tasks at a low cost. Experimental evaluations on various LLMs using different benchmarks demonstrate that RTD establishes a new paradigm for augmenting models to downstream tasks. Furthermore, our method exhibits strong orthogonality with traditional methods, allowing for concurrent usage.

Their potential application spans a broad range of medical tasks, such as clinical documentation, matching patients to clinical trials, and answering medical questions. In this primer paper, we propose an actionable guideline to help healthcare professionals more efficiently utilize LLMs in their work, along with a set of best practices. This approach consists of several main phases, including formulating the task, choosing LLMs, prompt engineering, fine-tuning, and deployment. We start with the discussion of critical considerations in identifying healthcare tasks that align with the core capabilities of LLMs and selecting models based on the selected task and data, performance requirements, and model interface. We then review the strategies, such as prompt engineering and fine-tuning, to adapt standard LLMs to specialized medical tasks. Deployment considerations, including regulatory compliance, ethical guidelines, and continuous monitoring for fairness and bias, are also discussed. By providing a structured step-by-step methodology, this tutorial aims to equip healthcare professionals with the tools necessary to effectively integrate LLMs into clinical practice, ensuring that these powerful technologies are applied in a safe, reliable, and impactful manner.</p></details> | Under review |

Developing such ML models from scratch is cost prohibitive and requires substantial compute, data, and time (e.g., expert labeling). To address these challenges, we introduce Health AI Developer Foundations (HAI-DEF), a suite of pre-trained, domain-specific foundation models, tools, and recipes to accelerate building ML for health applications. The models cover various modalities and domains, including radiology (X-rays and computed tomography), histopathology, dermatological imaging, and audio. These models provide domain specific embeddings that facilitate AI development with less labeled data, shorter training times, and reduced computational costs compared to traditional approaches. In addition, we utilize a common interface and style across these models, and prioritize usability to enable developers to integrate HAI-DEF efficiently. We present model evaluations across various tasks and conclude with a discussion of their application and evaluation, covering the importance of ensuring efficacy, fairness, and equity. Finally, while HAI-DEF and specifically the foundation models lower the barrier to entry for ML in healthcare, we emphasize the importance of validation with problem- and population-specific data for each desired usage setting. This technical report will be updated over time as more modalities and features are added.</p></details> | 16 pages, 8 figures |

Foundation models have shown great potential to assist in these tasks. In this paper, we explore how existing foundation models can be applied to cytological classification. More particularly, we focus on low-rank adaptation, a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method suited to few-shot learning. We evaluated five foundation models across four cytological classification datasets. Our results demonstrate that fine-tuning the pre-trained backbones with LoRA significantly improves model performance compared to fine-tuning only the classifier head, achieving state-of-the-art results on both simple and complex classification tasks while requiring fewer data samples.</p></details> | 5 pages, 2 figures |

Here, we develop a foundation model for prostate cancer digital pathology called HistoEncoder by pre-training on 48 million prostate tissue tile images. We demonstrate that HistoEncoder features extracted from tile images with similar histological patterns map closely together in the feature space. HistoEncoder outperforms models pre-trained with natural images, even without fine-tuning or with 1000 times less training data. We describe two use cases that leverage the capabilities of HistoEncoder by fine-tuning the model with a limited amount of data and computational resources. First, we show how HistoEncoder can be used to automatically annotate large-scale datasets with high accuracy. Second, we combine histomics with commonly used clinical nomograms, significantly improving prostate cancer-specific death survival models. Foundation models such as HistoEncoder can allow organizations with limited resources to build effective clinical software tools without needing extensive datasets or significant amounts of computing.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving EO Foundation Models with Confidence Assessment for enhanced Semantic segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18279v2)** | 2024-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Confidence assessments of semantic segmentation algorithms are important. Ideally, deep learning models should have the ability to predict in advance whether their output is likely to be incorrect. Assessing the confidence levels of model predictions in Earth Observation (EO) classification is essential, as it can enhance semantic segmentation performance and help prevent further exploitation of the results in case of erroneous prediction. The model we developed, Confidence Assessment for enhanced Semantic segmentation (CAS), evaluates confidence at both the segment and pixel levels, providing both labels and confidence scores as output. Our model, CAS, identifies segments with incorrect predicted labels using the proposed combined confidence metric, refines the model, and enhances its performance. This work has significant applications, particularly in evaluating EO Foundation Models on semantic segmentation downstream tasks, such as land cover classification using Sentinel-2 satellite data. The evaluation results show that this strategy is effective and that the proposed model CAS outperforms other baseline models.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 7 figures, 4 tables, Accepted</p></details> |

Artificial intelligence offers substantial potential to improve prediction accuracy and computational efficiency in this field, however this remains underexplored in many domains. Here we introduce Aurora, a large-scale foundation model for the Earth system trained on over a million hours of diverse data. Aurora outperforms operational forecasts for air quality, ocean waves, tropical cyclone tracks, and high-resolution weather forecasting at orders of magnitude smaller computational expense than dedicated existing systems. With the ability to fine-tune Aurora to diverse application domains at only modest computational cost, Aurora represents significant progress in making actionable Earth system predictions accessible to anyone.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods are constrained to basic material types with limited predictable parameters, making them insufficient to represent the complexity of real-world materials. We introduce a novel approach that leverages multi-modal foundation models and video diffusion to achieve enhanced 4D dynamic scene simulation. Our method utilizes multi-modal models to identify material types and initialize material parameters through image queries, while simultaneously inferring 3D Gaussian splats for detailed scene representation. We further refine these material parameters using video diffusion with a differentiable Material Point Method (MPM) and optical flow guidance rather than render loss or Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) loss. This integrated framework enables accurate prediction and realistic simulation of dynamic interactions in real-world scenarios, advancing both accuracy and flexibility in physics-based simulations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Homep...</summary><p>Homepage: https://zhuomanliu.github.io/PhysFlow/</p></details> |

While smart meters and deep learning models enable forecasting using past data from multiple buildings, data heterogeneity from diverse buildings can reduce model performance. The impact of increasing dataset heterogeneity in time series forecasting, while keeping size and model constant, is understudied. We tackle this issue using the ComStock dataset, which provides synthetic energy consumption data for U.S. commercial buildings. Two curated subsets, identical in size and region but differing in building type diversity, are used to assess the performance of various time series forecasting models, including fine-tuned open-source foundation models (FMs). The results show that dataset heterogeneity and model architecture have a greater impact on post-training forecasting performance than the parameter count. Moreover, despite the higher computational cost, fine-tuned FMs demonstrate competitive performance compared to base models trained from scratch.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2024 Workshop on Time Series in the Age of Large Models</p></details> |

However, creating such datasets remains challenging due to the complexity and heterogeneity of medical data. To address this challenge, we introduce HoneyBee, a scalable modular framework for building multimodal oncology datasets that leverages foundation models to generate representative embeddings. HoneyBee integrates various data modalities, including clinical diagnostic and pathology imaging data, medical notes, reports, records, and molecular data. It employs data preprocessing techniques and foundation models to generate embeddings that capture the essential features and relationships within the raw medical data. The generated embeddings are stored in a structured format using Hugging Face datasets and PyTorch dataloaders for accessibility. Vector databases enable efficient querying and retrieval for machine learning applications. We demonstrate the effectiveness of HoneyBee through experiments assessing the quality and representativeness of these embeddings. The framework is designed to be extensible to other medical domains and aims to accelerate oncology research by providing high-quality, machine learning-ready datasets. HoneyBee is an ongoing open-source effort, and the code, datasets, and models are available at the project repository.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unsupervised Foundation Model-Agnostic Slide-Level Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13623v1)** | 2024-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Representation learning of pathology whole-slide images (WSIs) has primarily relied on weak supervision with Multiple Instance Learning (MIL). This approach leads to slide representations highly tailored to a specific clinical task. Self-supervised learning (SSL) has been successfully applied to train histopathology foundation models (FMs) for patch embedding generation. However, generating patient or slide level embeddings remains challenging. Existing approaches for slide representation learning extend the principles of SSL from patch level learning to entire slides by aligning different augmentations of the slide or by utilizing multimodal data. By integrating tile embeddings from multiple FMs, we propose a new single modality SSL method in feature space that generates useful slide representations. Our contrastive pretraining strategy, called COBRA, employs multiple FMs and an architecture based on Mamba-2. COBRA exceeds performance of state-of-the-art slide encoders on four different public CPTAC cohorts on average by at least +3.8% AUC, despite only being pretrained on 3048 WSIs from TCGA. Additionally, COBRA is readily compatible at inference time with previously unseen feature extractors.</p></details> |  |
| **[Long Term Memory: The Foundation of AI Self-Evolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15665v3)** | 2024-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) like GPTs, trained on vast datasets, have demonstrated impressive capabilities in language understanding, reasoning, and planning, achieving human-level performance in various tasks. Most studies focus on enhancing these models by training on ever-larger datasets to build more powerful foundation models. While training stronger models is important, enabling models to evolve during inference is equally crucial, a process we refer to as AI self-evolution. Unlike large-scale training, self-evolution may rely on limited data or interactions. Inspired by the columnar organization of the human cerebral cortex, we hypothesize that AI models could develop cognitive abilities and build internal representations through iterative interactions with their environment. To achieve this, models need long-term memory (LTM) to store and manage processed interaction data. LTM supports self-evolution by representing diverse experiences across environments and agents. In this report, we explore AI self-evolution and its potential to enhance models during inference. We examine LTM's role in lifelong learning, allowing models to evolve based on accumulated interactions. We outline the structure of LTM and the systems needed for effective data retention and representation. We also classify approaches for building personalized models with LTM data and show how these models achieve self-evolution through interaction. Using LTM, our multi-agent framework OMNE achieved first place on the GAIA benchmark, demonstrating LTM's potential for AI self-evolution. Finally, we present a roadmap for future research, emphasizing the importance of LTM for advancing AI technology and its practical applications.</p></details> | 56 pages, 13 figures |

Recently, vision foundation models (VFM) have demonstrated powerful generalization capabilities across various visual tasks. In this paper, we present a parameter-efficient adaptive approach, termed Cloud-Adapter, designed to enhance the accuracy and robustness of cloud segmentation. Our method leverages a VFM pretrained on general domain data, which remains frozen, eliminating the need for additional training. Cloud-Adapter incorporates a lightweight spatial perception module that initially utilizes a convolutional neural network (ConvNet) to extract dense spatial representations. These multi-scale features are then aggregated and serve as contextual inputs to an adapting module, which modulates the frozen transformer layers within the VFM. Experimental results demonstrate that the Cloud-Adapter approach, utilizing only 0.6% of the trainable parameters of the frozen backbone, achieves substantial performance gains. Cloud-Adapter consistently attains state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across a wide variety of cloud segmentation datasets from multiple satellite sources, sensor series, data processing levels, land cover scenarios, and annotation granularities. We have released the source code and pretrained models at https://github.com/XavierJiezou/Cloud-Adapter to support further research.</p></details> | 13 pages, 9 figures |

Traditional approaches have relied on separate models tailored to either grid-based data, representing cities as uniform cells, or graph-based data, modeling cities as networks of nodes and edges. In this paper, we build UniFlow, a foundational model for general urban flow prediction that unifies both grid-based and graphbased data. We first design a multi-view spatio-temporal patching mechanism to standardize different data into a consistent sequential format and then introduce a spatio-temporal transformer architecture to capture complex correlations and dynamics. To leverage shared spatio-temporal patterns across different data types and facilitate effective cross-learning, we propose SpatioTemporal Memory Retrieval Augmentation (ST-MRA). By creating structured memory modules to store shared spatio-temporal patterns, ST-MRA enhances predictions through adaptive memory retrieval. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniFlow outperforms existing models in both grid-based and graph-based flow prediction, excelling particularly in scenarios with limited data availability, showcasing its superior performance and broad applicability.

However, to date, there has been limited work demonstrating how well these models perform in medical applications, where labeled data can be scarce. Further, we observe that currently, the majority of time series foundation models either are univariate in nature, or assume channel independence, meaning that they handle multivariate time series but do not model how the different variables relate. In this paper, we propose a prompt-tuning-inspired fine-tuning technique, Generalized Prompt Tuning (Gen-P-Tuning), that enables us to adapt an existing univariate time series foundation model (treated as frozen) to handle multivariate time series prediction. Our approach provides a way to combine information across channels (variables) of multivariate time series. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our fine-tuning approach against various baselines on two MIMIC classification tasks, and on influenza-like illness forecasting.</p></details> | <details><summary>Machi...</summary><p>Machine Learning for Health (ML4H 2024)</p></details> |

At the crucial intersection of research and clinical practice, it demands precise and flexible assessment. However, current biomarkers, such as RECIST 1.1's long and short axis measurements, fall short of capturing this complexity, offering an approximate estimate of tumor burden and a simplistic representation of a more intricate process. Additionally, existing supervised AI models face challenges in addressing the variability in tumor presentations, limiting their clinical utility. These limitations arise from the scarcity of annotations and the models' focus on narrowly defined tasks. To address these challenges, we developed ONCOPILOT, an interactive radiological foundation model trained on approximately 7,500 CT scans covering the whole body, from both normal anatomy and a wide range of oncological cases. ONCOPILOT performs 3D tumor segmentation using visual prompts like point-click and bounding boxes, outperforming state-of-the-art models (e.g., nnUnet) and achieving radiologist-level accuracy in RECIST 1.1 measurements. The key advantage of this foundation model is its ability to surpass state-of-the-art performance while keeping the radiologist in the loop, a capability that previous models could not achieve. When radiologists interactively refine the segmentations, accuracy improves further. ONCOPILOT also accelerates measurement processes and reduces inter-reader variability, facilitating volumetric analysis and unlocking new biomarkers for deeper insights. This AI assistant is expected to enhance the precision of RECIST 1.1 measurements, unlock the potential of volumetric biomarkers, and improve patient stratification and clinical care, while seamlessly integrating into the radiological workflow.</p></details> |  |

However, this integration also brings unique safety and security challenges. In this paper, we conceptualize cybersafety and cybersecurity in the context of multimodal learning and present a comprehensive Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) to unify these concepts in MFMs, identifying key threats to these models. We propose a taxonomy framework grounded in information theory, evaluating and categorizing threats through the concepts of channel capacity, signal, noise, and bandwidth. This approach provides a novel framework that unifies model safety and system security in MFMs, offering a more comprehensive and actionable understanding of the risks involved. We used this to explore existing defense mechanisms, and identified gaps in current research - particularly, a lack of protection for alignment between modalities and a need for more systematic defense methods. Our work contributes to a deeper understanding of the security and safety landscape in MFMs, providing researchers and practitioners with valuable insights for improving the robustness and reliability of these models.</p></details> |  |

Effectively modeling these dynamics is essential for understanding and optimizing urban systems In this work, we introduce UrbanDiT, a foundation model for open-world urban spatio-temporal learning that successfully scale up diffusion transformers in this field. UrbanDiT pioneers a unified model that integrates diverse spatio-temporal data sources and types while learning universal spatio-temporal patterns across different cities and scenarios. This allows the model to unify both multi-data and multi-task learning, and effectively support a wide range of spatio-temporal applications. Its key innovation lies in the elaborated prompt learning framework, which adaptively generates both data-driven and task-specific prompts, guiding the model to deliver superior performance across various urban applications. UrbanDiT offers three primary advantages: 1) It unifies diverse data types, such as grid-based and graph-based data, into a sequential format, allowing to capture spatio-temporal dynamics across diverse scenarios of different cities; 2) With masking strategies and task-specific prompts, it supports a wide range of tasks, including bi-directional spatio-temporal prediction, temporal interpolation, spatial extrapolation, and spatio-temporal imputation; and 3) It generalizes effectively to open-world scenarios, with its powerful zero-shot capabilities outperforming nearly all baselines with training data. These features allow UrbanDiT to achieves state-of-the-art performance in different domains such as transportation traffic, crowd flows, taxi demand, bike usage, and cellular traffic, across multiple cities and tasks. UrbanDiT sets up a new benchmark for foundation models in the urban spatio-temporal domain.</p></details> |  |

However, their rapidly growing capabilities and autonomy have raised significant concerns about AI safety. Researchers are exploring better ways to design guardrails to ensure that the runtime behavior of FM-based agents remains within specific boundaries. Nevertheless, designing effective runtime guardrails is challenging due to the agents' autonomous and non-deterministic behavior. The involvement of multiple pipeline stages and agent artifacts, such as goals, plans, tools, at runtime further complicates these issues. Addressing these challenges at runtime requires multi-layered guardrails that operate effectively at various levels of the agent architecture. Thus, in this paper, we present a comprehensive taxonomy of runtime guardrails for FM-based agents to identify the key quality attributes for guardrails and design dimensions based on the results of a systematic literature review. Inspired by the Swiss Cheese Model, we also propose a reference architecture for designing multi-layered runtime guardrails for FM-based agents, which includes three dimensions: quality attributes, pipelines, and artifacts. The proposed taxonomy and reference architecture provide concrete and robust guidance for researchers and practitioners to build AI-safety-by-design from a software architecture perspective.</p></details> | 17 Pages |

One approach involves training LLM architectures on tokenized time series data using cross-entropy loss. Although this method has demonstrated promising results, cross-entropy loss is primarily designed for classification tasks and does not account for the distance between classes. To address this limitation, we propose using the Wasserstein loss for such architectures. To validate our approach, we fine-tuned a foundational time series model on $22$ zero-shot datasets, comparing the performance of cross-entropy loss with that of Wasserstein loss. Our results demonstrate that replacing cross-entropy loss with Wasserstein loss significantly improves point estimation.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 mai...</summary><p>4 main pages; 2 figures</p></details> |

However, the emergence of foundation models presents significant challenges in providing effective supervision signals necessary for further enhancing their capabilities. Consequently, there is an urgent need to explore novel supervision signals and technical approaches. In this paper, we propose verifier engineering, a novel post-training paradigm specifically designed for the era of foundation models. The core of verifier engineering involves leveraging a suite of automated verifiers to perform verification tasks and deliver meaningful feedback to foundation models. We systematically categorize the verifier engineering process into three essential stages: search, verify, and feedback, and provide a comprehensive review of state-of-the-art research developments within each stage. We believe that verifier engineering constitutes a fundamental pathway toward achieving Artificial General Intelligence.</p></details> |  |
| **[TL-CLIP: A Power-specific Multimodal Pre-trained Visual Foundation Model for Transmission Line Defect Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11370v1)** | 2024-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transmission line defect recognition models have traditionally used general pre-trained weights as the initial basis for their training. These models often suffer weak generalization capability due to the lack of domain knowledge in the pre-training dataset. To address this issue, we propose a two-stage transmission-line-oriented contrastive language-image pre-training (TL-CLIP) framework, which lays a more effective foundation for transmission line defect recognition. The pre-training process employs a novel power-specific multimodal algorithm assisted with two power-specific pre-training tasks for better modeling the power-related semantic knowledge contained in the inspection data. To fine-tune the pre-trained model, we develop a transfer learning strategy, namely fine-tuning with pre-training objective (FTP), to alleviate the overfitting problem caused by limited inspection data. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves the performance of transmission line defect recognition in both classification and detection tasks, indicating clear advantages over traditional pre-trained models in the scene of transmission line inspection.</p></details> |  |
| **[CCExpert: Advancing MLLM Capability in Remote Sensing Change Captioning with Difference-Aware Integration and a Foundational Dataset](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11360v1)** | 2024-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Remote Sensing Image Change Captioning (RSICC) aims to generate natural language descriptions of surface changes between multi-temporal remote sensing images, detailing the categories, locations, and dynamics of changed objects (e.g., additions or disappearances). Many current methods attempt to leverage the long-sequence understanding and reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for this task. However, without comprehensive data support, these approaches often alter the essential feature transmission pathways of MLLMs, disrupting the intrinsic knowledge within the models and limiting their potential in RSICC. In this paper, we propose a novel model, CCExpert, based on a new, advanced multimodal large model framework. Firstly, we design a difference-aware integration module to capture multi-scale differences between bi-temporal images and incorporate them into the original image context, thereby enhancing the signal-to-noise ratio of differential features. Secondly, we constructed a high-quality, diversified dataset called CC-Foundation, containing 200,000 image pairs and 1.2 million captions, to provide substantial data support for continue pretraining in this domain. Lastly, we employed a three-stage progressive training process to ensure the deep integration of the difference-aware integration module with the pretrained MLLM. CCExpert achieved a notable performance of $S^*_m=81.80$ on the LEVIR-CC benchmark, significantly surpassing previous state-of-the-art methods. The code and part of the dataset will soon be open-sourced at https://github.com/Meize0729/CCExpert.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Transfer Learning for Video-language Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11223v1)** | 2024-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pre-trained vision-language models provide a robust foundation for efficient transfer learning across various downstream tasks. In the field of video action recognition, mainstream approaches often introduce additional parameter modules to capture temporal information. While the increased model capacity brought by these additional parameters helps better fit the video-specific inductive biases, existing methods require learning a large number of parameters and are prone to catastrophic forgetting of the original generalizable knowledge. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective Multi-modal Spatio-Temporal Adapter (MSTA) to improve the alignment between representations in the text and vision branches, achieving a balance between general knowledge and task-specific knowledge. Furthermore, to mitigate over-fitting and enhance generalizability, we introduce a spatio-temporal description-guided consistency constraint. This constraint involves feeding template inputs (i.e., ``a video of $\{\textbf{cls}\}$'') into the trainable language branch, while LLM-generated spatio-temporal descriptions are input into the pre-trained language branch, enforcing consistency between the outputs of the two branches. This mechanism prevents over-fitting to downstream tasks and improves the distinguishability of the trainable branch within the spatio-temporal semantic space. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach across four tasks: zero-shot transfer, few-shot learning, base-to-novel generalization, and fully-supervised learning. Compared to many state-of-the-art methods, our MSTA achieves outstanding performance across all evaluations, while using only 2-7\% of the trainable parameters in the original model. Code will be avaliable at https://github.com/chenhaoxing/ETL4Video.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adverse Weather-Immune Semantic Segmentation with Unfolded Regularization and Foundation Model Knowledge Distillation for Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14737v2)** | 2024-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Various adverse weather conditions pose a significant challenge to autonomous driving (AD) street scene semantic understanding (segmentation). A common strategy is to minimize the disparity between images captured in clear and adverse weather conditions. However, this technique typically relies on utilizing clear image as a reference, which is challenging to obtain in practice. Furthermore, this method typically targets a single adverse condition, and thus perform poorly when confronting a mixture of multiple adverse weather conditions. To address these issues, we introduce a reference-free and Adverse weather-Immune scheme (called AdvImmu) that leverages the invariance of weather conditions over short periods (seconds). Specifically, AdvImmu includes three components: Locally Sequential Mechanism (LSM), Globally Shuffled Mechanism (GSM), and Unfolded Regularizers (URs). LSM leverages temporal correlations between adjacent frames to enhance model performance. GSM is proposed to shuffle LSM segments to prevent overfitting of temporal patterns. URs are the deep unfolding implementation of two proposed regularizers to penalize the model complexity to enhance across-weather generalization. In addition, to overcome the over-reliance on consecutive frame-wise annotations in the training of AdvImmu (typically unavailable in AD scenarios), we incorporate a foundation model named Segment Anything Model (SAM) to assist to annotate frames, and additionally propose a cluster algorithm (denoted as SBICAC) to surmount SAM's category-agnostic issue to generate pseudo-labels. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed AdvImmu outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods by 88.56% in mean Intersection over Union (mIoU).</p></details> | 16 Pages |

However, existing methods are often tailored to specific tasks and regions, resulting in limitations related to task specificity, regional dependency, and data quality sensitivity. Addressing these challenges requires a universal human trajectory foundation model capable of generalizing and scaling across diverse tasks and geographic contexts. To this end, we propose UniTraj, a Universal human Trajectory foundation model that is task-adaptive, region-independent, and highly generalizable. To further enhance performance, we construct WorldTrace, the first large-scale, high-quality, globally distributed dataset sourced from open web platforms, encompassing 2.45 million trajectories with billions of points across 70 countries. Through multiple resampling and masking strategies designed for pre-training, UniTraj effectively overcomes geographic and task constraints, adapting to heterogeneous data quality. Extensive experiments across multiple trajectory analysis tasks and real-world datasets demonstrate that UniTraj consistently outperforms existing approaches in terms of scalability and adaptability. These results underscore the potential of UniTraj as a versatile, robust solution for a wide range of trajectory analysis applications, with WorldTrace serving as an ideal but non-exclusive foundation for training.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Foundation Model for Cardiac MRI Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10403v1)** | 2024-11-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, machine learning (ML) based reconstruction has been widely investigated and employed in cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging. ML-based reconstructions can deliver clinically acceptable image quality under substantially accelerated scans. ML-based reconstruction, however, also requires substantial data and computational time to train the neural network, which is often optimized for a fixed acceleration rate or image contrast. In practice, imaging parameters are often tuned to best suit the diagnosis, which may differ from the training data. This can result in degraded image quality, and multiple trained networks are needed to fulfill the clinical demands. In this study, we propose a foundation model that uses adaptive unrolling, channel-shifting, and Pattern and Contrast-Prompt-UNet (PCP-UNet) to tackle the problem. In particular, the undersampled data goes through a different number of unrolled iterations according to its acceleration rate. Channel-shifting improves reconstructed data quality. The PCP-UNet is equipped with an image contrast and sampling pattern prompt. In vivo CMR experiments were performed using mixed combinations of image contrasts, acceleration rates, and (under)sampling patterns. The proposed foundation model has significantly improved image quality for a wide range of CMR protocols and outperforms the conventional ML-based method.</p></details> | <details><summary>For M...</summary><p>For MICCAI CMRxRecon Challenge 2024 team CardiAxs</p></details> |
| **[CorrCLIP: Reconstructing Correlations in CLIP with Off-the-Shelf Foundation Models for Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10086v1)** | 2024-11-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation aims to assign semantic labels to each pixel without relying on a predefined set of categories. Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) demonstrates outstanding zero-shot classification capabilities but struggles with the pixel-wise segmentation task as the captured inter-patch correlations correspond to no specific visual concepts. Despite previous CLIP-based works improving inter-patch correlations by self-self attention, they still face the inherent limitation that image patches tend to have high similarity to outlier ones. In this work, we introduce CorrCLIP, a training-free approach for open-vocabulary semantic segmentation, which reconstructs significantly coherent inter-patch correlations utilizing foundation models. Specifically, it employs the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to define the scope of patch interactions, ensuring that patches interact only with semantically similar ones. Furthermore, CorrCLIP obtains an understanding of an image's semantic layout via self-supervised models to determine concrete similarity values between image patches, which addresses the similarity irregularity problem caused by the aforementioned restricted patch interaction regime. Finally, CorrCLIP reuses the region masks produced by SAM to update the segmentation map. As a training-free method, CorrCLIP achieves a notable improvement across eight challenging benchmarks regarding the averaged mean Intersection over Union, boosting it from 44.4% to 51.0%.</p></details> |  |
| **[Tissue Concepts: supervised foundation models in computational pathology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03519v2)** | 2024-11-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to the increasing workload of pathologists, the need for automation to support diagnostic tasks and quantitative biomarker evaluation is becoming more and more apparent. Foundation models have the potential to improve generalizability within and across centers and serve as starting points for data efficient development of specialized yet robust AI models. However, the training foundation models themselves is usually very expensive in terms of data, computation, and time. This paper proposes a supervised training method that drastically reduces these expenses. The proposed method is based on multi-task learning to train a joint encoder, by combining 16 different classification, segmentation, and detection tasks on a total of 912,000 patches. Since the encoder is capable of capturing the properties of the samples, we term it the Tissue Concepts encoder. To evaluate the performance and generalizability of the Tissue Concepts encoder across centers, classification of whole slide images from four of the most prevalent solid cancers - breast, colon, lung, and prostate - was used. The experiments show that the Tissue Concepts model achieve comparable performance to models trained with self-supervision, while requiring only 6% of the amount of training patches. Furthermore, the Tissue Concepts encoder outperforms an ImageNet pre-trained encoder on both in-domain and out-of-domain data.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 Pa...</summary><p>22 Pages, 3 Figures, submitted to and under revision at Computers in Biology and Medicine</p></details> |

Video Foundation Models to Enhance Intermittent Supervision](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10016v1)** | 2024-11-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper investigates the application of Video Foundation Models (ViFMs) for generating robot data summaries to enhance intermittent human supervision of robot teams. We propose a novel framework that produces both generic and query-driven summaries of long-duration robot vision data in three modalities: storyboards, short videos, and text. Through a user study involving 30 participants, we evaluate the efficacy of these summary methods in allowing operators to accurately retrieve the observations and actions that occurred while the robot was operating without supervision over an extended duration (40 min). Our findings reveal that query-driven summaries significantly improve retrieval accuracy compared to generic summaries or raw data, albeit with increased task duration. Storyboards are found to be the most effective presentation modality, especially for object-related queries. This work represents, to our knowledge, the first zero-shot application of ViFMs for generating multi-modal robot-to-human communication in intermittent supervision contexts, demonstrating both the promise and limitations of these models in human-robot interaction (HRI) scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE RAL for possible publication</p></details> |
| **[Building 6G Radio Foundation Models with Transformer Architectures](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09996v1)** | 2024-11-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation deep learning (DL) models are general models, designed to learn general, robust and adaptable representations of their target modality, enabling finetuning across a range of downstream tasks. These models are pretrained on large, unlabeled datasets using self-supervised learning (SSL). Foundation models have demonstrated better generalization than traditional supervised approaches, a critical requirement for wireless communications where the dynamic environment demands model adaptability. In this work, we propose and demonstrate the effectiveness of a Vision Transformer (ViT) as a radio foundation model for spectrogram learning. We introduce a Masked Spectrogram Modeling (MSM) approach to pretrain the ViT in a self-supervised fashion. We evaluate the ViT-based foundation model on two downstream tasks: Channel State Information (CSI)-based Human Activity sensing and Spectrogram Segmentation. Experimental results demonstrate competitive performance to supervised training while generalizing across diverse domains. Notably, the pretrained ViT model outperforms a four-times larger model that is trained from scratch on the spectrogram segmentation task, while requiring significantly less training time, and achieves competitive performance on the CSI-based human activity sensing task. This work demonstrates the effectiveness of ViT with MSM for pretraining as a promising technique for scalable foundation model development in future 6G networks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Free Lunch in Pathology Foundation Model: Task-specific Model Adaptation with Concept-Guided Feature Enhancement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09894v1)** | 2024-11-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Whole slide image (WSI) analysis is gaining prominence within the medical imaging field. Recent advances in pathology foundation models have shown the potential to extract powerful feature representations from WSIs for downstream tasks. However, these foundation models are usually designed for general-purpose pathology image analysis and may not be optimal for specific downstream tasks or cancer types. In this work, we present Concept Anchor-guided Task-specific Feature Enhancement (CATE), an adaptable paradigm that can boost the expressivity and discriminativeness of pathology foundation models for specific downstream tasks. Based on a set of task-specific concepts derived from the pathology vision-language model with expert-designed prompts, we introduce two interconnected modules to dynamically calibrate the generic image features extracted by foundation models for certain tasks or cancer types. Specifically, we design a Concept-guided Information Bottleneck module to enhance task-relevant characteristics by maximizing the mutual information between image features and concept anchors while suppressing superfluous information. Moreover, a Concept-Feature Interference module is proposed to utilize the similarity between calibrated features and concept anchors to further generate discriminative task-specific features. The extensive experiments on public WSI datasets demonstrate that CATE significantly enhances the performance and generalizability of MIL models. Additionally, heatmap and umap visualization results also reveal the effectiveness and interpretability of CATE. The source code is available at https://github.com/HKU-MedAI/CATE.</p></details> |  |
| **[EHRMamba: Towards Generalizable and Scalable Foundation Models for Electronic Health Records](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14567v3)** | 2024-11-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformers have significantly advanced the modeling of Electronic Health Records (EHR), yet their deployment in real-world healthcare is limited by several key challenges. Firstly, the quadratic computational cost and insufficient context length of these models hinder hospitals' ability in processing the extensive medical histories typical in EHR data. Additionally, existing models employ separate finetuning for each clinical task, complicating maintenance in healthcare environments. Moreover, these models focus exclusively on either clinical prediction or EHR forecasting, lacking proficiency in both tasks. To overcome these limitations, we introduce EHRMamba, a robust foundation model built on the Mamba architecture. EHRMamba can process sequences up to 300% longer than previous models due to its linear computational cost. We also introduce a novel approach to Multitask Prompted Finetuning (MPF) for EHR data, which enables EHRMamba to simultaneously learn multiple clinical tasks in a single finetuning phase, significantly enhancing deployment and cross-task generalization. Furthermore, our model leverages the HL7 FHIR data standard to simplify integration into existing hospital systems. Alongside EHRMamba, we open-source Odyssey, a toolkit designed to support the development and deployment of EHR foundation models, with an emphasis on data standardization and interpretability. Our evaluations on the MIMIC-IV dataset demonstrate that EHRMamba advances state-of-the-art performance across 6 major clinical tasks and excels in EHR forecasting, marking a significant leap forward in the field.</p></details> | 17 Pages, 4 Figures |

These pretrained models can be fine-tuned for related downstream tasks, offering faster development and reduced training costs, while often achieving improved performance. In this work, we introduce Masked Spectrogram Modeling, a novel self-supervised learning approach for pretraining foundational DL models on radio signals. Adopting a Convolutional LSTM architecture for efficient spatio-temporal processing, we pretrain the model with an unlabelled radio dataset collected from over-the-air measurements. Subsequently, the pretrained model is fine-tuned for two downstream tasks: spectrum forecasting and segmentation. Experimental results demonstrate that our methodology achieves competitive performance in both forecasting accuracy and segmentation, validating its effectiveness for developing foundational radio models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Real-time Adapting Routing (RAR): Improving Efficiency Through Continuous Learning in Software Powered by Layered Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09837v1)** | 2024-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To balance the quality and inference cost of a Foundation Model (FM, such as large language models (LLMs)) powered software, people often opt to train a routing model that routes requests to FMs with different sizes and capabilities. Existing routing models rely on learning the optimal routing decision from carefully curated data, require complex computations to be updated, and do not consider the potential evolution of weaker FMs. In this paper, we propose Real-time Adaptive Routing (RAR), an approach to continuously adapt FM routing decisions while using guided in-context learning to enhance the capabilities of weaker FM. The goal is to reduce reliance on stronger, more expensive FMs. We evaluate our approach on different subsets of the popular MMLU benchmark. Over time, our approach routes 50.2% fewer requests to computationally expensive models while maintaining around 90.5% of the general response quality. In addition, the guides generated from stronger models have shown intra-domain generalization and led to a better quality of responses compared to an equivalent approach with a standalone weaker FM.</p></details> |  |

To effectively measure moral sentiments in natural language processing texts, it is crucial to utilize large, annotated datasets that provide nuanced understanding for accurate analysis and modeltraining. However, existing corpora, while valuable, often face linguistic limitations. To address this gap in the Chinese language domain,we introduce the Moral Foundation Weibo Corpus. This corpus consists of 25,671 Chinese comments on Weibo, encompassing six diverse topic areas. Each comment is manually annotated by at least three systematically trained annotators based on ten moral categories derived from a grounded theory of morality. To assess annotator reliability, we present the kappa testresults, a gold standard for measuring consistency. Additionally, we apply several the latest large language models to supplement the manual annotations, conducting analytical experiments to compare their performance and report baseline results for moral sentiment classification.</p></details> |  |

Despite its rapid progress, it heavily depends on sophisticatedly designed models given specific paralinguistic tasks. Thus, the heterogeneity and diversity of ComParal models largely prevent the realistic implementation of ComParal models. Recently, with the advent of acoustic foundation models because of self-supervised learning, developing more generic models that can efficiently perceive a plethora of paralinguistic information has become an active topic in speech processing. However, it lacks a unified evaluation framework for a fair and consistent performance comparison. To bridge this gap, we conduct a large-scale benchmark, namely ParaLBench, which concentrates on standardizing the evaluation process of diverse paralinguistic tasks, including critical aspects of affective computing such as emotion recognition and emotion dimensions prediction, over different acoustic foundation models. This benchmark contains ten datasets with thirteen distinct paralinguistic tasks, covering short-, medium- and long-term characteristics. Each task is carried out on 14 acoustic foundation models under a unified evaluation framework, which allows for an unbiased methodological comparison and offers a grounded reference for the ComParal community. Based on the insights gained from ParaLBench, we also point out potential research directions, i.e., the cross-corpus generalizability, to propel ComParal research in the future. The code associated with this study will be available to foster the transparency and replicability of this work for succeeding researchers.</p></details> |  |

Unlike traditional methods that rely on bulky data formats like voxel grids or point clouds, EPG is lightweight and scalable. It facilitates a range of robotic tasks, including open-vocabulary querying, disambiguation, image-based querying, language-directed navigation, and re-localization in 3D environments. We showcase the effectiveness of EPG in handling these tasks, demonstrating its capacity to improve how robots interact with and navigate through complex spaces. Through both qualitative and quantitative assessments, we illustrate EPG's strong performance and its ability to outperform existing methods in re-localization. Our work introduces a crucial step forward in enabling robots to efficiently understand and operate within large-scale 3D spaces.</p></details> |  |

However, as grids expand and operate closer to their limits, iterative power flow solvers, central to QSTS simulations, become computationally prohibitive and face increasing convergence issues. Neural power flow solvers provide a promising alternative, speeding up power flow computations by 3 to 4 orders of magnitude, though they are costly to train. In this paper, we envision how recently introduced grid foundation models could improve the economic viability of neural power flow solvers. Conceptually, these models amortize training costs by serving as a foundation for a range of grid operation and planning tasks beyond power flow solving, with only minimal fine-tuning required. We call for collaboration between the AI and power grid communities to develop and open-source these models, enabling all operators, even those with limited resources, to benefit from AI without building solutions from scratch.</p></details> | <details><summary>Equal...</summary><p>Equal contributors: A.P. and F.M.; Lead contact: A.P</p></details> |
| **[General Geospatial Inference with a Population Dynamics Foundation Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07207v2)** | 2024-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Supporting the health and well-being of dynamic populations around the world requires governmental agencies, organizations and researchers to understand and reason over complex relationships between human behavior and local contexts in order to identify high-risk groups and strategically allocate limited resources. Traditional approaches to these classes of problems often entail developing manually curated, task-specific features and models to represent human behavior and the natural and built environment, which can be challenging to adapt to new, or even, related tasks. To address this, we introduce a Population Dynamics Foundation Model (PDFM) that aims to capture the relationships between diverse data modalities and is applicable to a broad range of geospatial tasks. We first construct a geo-indexed dataset for postal codes and counties across the United States, capturing rich aggregated information on human behavior from maps, busyness, and aggregated search trends, and environmental factors such as weather and air quality. We then model this data and the complex relationships between locations using a graph neural network, producing embeddings that can be adapted to a wide range of downstream tasks using relatively simple models. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach by benchmarking it on 27 downstream tasks spanning three distinct domains: health indicators, socioeconomic factors, and environmental measurements. The approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on all 27 geospatial interpolation tasks, and on 25 out of the 27 extrapolation and super-resolution tasks. We combined the PDFM with a state-of-the-art forecasting foundation model, TimesFM, to predict unemployment and poverty, achieving performance that surpasses fully supervised forecasting.

They employ advanced deep learning architectures to extract structural information autonomously from vast datasets through self-supervision. The resulting rich representations of complex systems and dynamics can be applied to many downstream applications. Therefore, FMs can find uses in electric power grids, challenged by the energy transition and climate change. In this paper, we call for the development of, and state why we believe in, the potential of FMs for electric grids. We highlight their strengths and weaknesses amidst the challenges of a changing grid. We argue that an FM learning from diverse grid data and topologies could unlock transformative capabilities, pioneering a new approach in leveraging AI to redefine how we manage complexity and uncertainty in the electric grid. Finally, we discuss a power grid FM concept, namely GridFM, based on graph neural networks and show how different downstream tasks benefit.</p></details> | <details><summary>Major...</summary><p>Major equal contributors: H.F.H., T.B., B.G., L.S.A.M., A.P., A.V., J.W.; Significant equal contributors: J.B., A.B.M., S.C., I.F., B.H., R.J., K.K., V.M., F.M., M.D.M., O.R., H.S., L.X., E.S.Y., A.Z.; Other equal contributors: A.J.B., R.J.B., B.P.B., J.S., S.S; Lead contact: H.F.H</p></details> |

Geoscience foundation models (GFMs) emerge as a paradigm-shifting solution, integrating extensive cross-disciplinary data to enhance the simulation and understanding of Earth system dynamics. These data-centric AI models extract insights from petabytes of structured and unstructured data, effectively addressing the complexities of Earth systems that traditional models struggle to capture. The unique strengths of GFMs include flexible task specification, diverse input-output capabilities, and multi-modal knowledge representation, enabling analyses that surpass those of individual data sources or traditional AI methods. This review not only highlights the key advantages of GFMs, but also presents essential techniques for their construction, with a focus on transformers, pre-training, and adaptation strategies. Subsequently, we examine recent advancements in GFMs, including large language models, vision models, and vision-language models, particularly emphasizing the potential applications in remote sensing. Additionally, the review concludes with a comprehensive analysis of the challenges and future trends in GFMs, addressing five critical aspects: data integration, model complexity, uncertainty quantification, interdisciplinary collaboration, and concerns related to privacy, trust, and security. This review offers a comprehensive overview of emerging geoscientific research paradigms, emphasizing the untapped opportunities at the intersection of advanced AI techniques and geoscience. It examines major methodologies, showcases advances in large-scale models, and discusses the challenges and prospects that will shape the future landscape of GFMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>accpe...</summary><p>accpeted by IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Magazine</p></details> |
| **[TransAgent: Transfer Vision-Language Foundation Models with Heterogeneous Agent Collaboration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12183v2)** | 2024-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language foundation models (such as CLIP) have recently shown their power in transfer learning, owing to large-scale image-text pre-training. However, target domain data in the downstream tasks can be highly different from the pre-training phase, which makes it hard for such a single model to generalize well. Alternatively, there exists a wide range of expert models that contain diversified vision and/or language knowledge pre-trained on different modalities, tasks, networks, and datasets. Unfortunately, these models are "isolated agents" with heterogeneous structures, and how to integrate their knowledge for generalizing CLIP-like models has not been fully explored. To bridge this gap, we propose a general and concise TransAgent framework, which transports the knowledge of the isolated agents in a unified manner, and effectively guides CLIP to generalize with multi-source knowledge distillation. With such a distinct framework, we flexibly collaborate with 11 heterogeneous agents to empower vision-language foundation models, without further cost in the inference phase. Finally, our TransAgent achieves state-of-the-art performance on 11 visual recognition datasets. Under the same low-shot setting, it outperforms the popular CoOp with around 10% on average, and 20% on EuroSAT which contains large domain shifts.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2024 |
| **[City Foundation Models for Learning General Purpose Representations from OpenStreetMap](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00583v3)** | 2024-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pre-trained Foundation Models (PFMs) have ushered in a paradigm-shift in Artificial Intelligence, due to their ability to learn general-purpose representations that can be readily employed in a wide range of downstream tasks. While PFMs have been successfully adopted in various fields such as Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision, their capacity in handling geospatial data and answering urban questions remains limited. This can be attributed to the intrinsic heterogeneity of geospatial data, which encompasses different data types, including points, segments and regions, as well as multiple information modalities, such as a spatial position, visual characteristics and textual annotations. The proliferation of Volunteered Geographic Information initiatives, and the ever-increasing availability of open geospatial data sources, like OpenStreetMap, which is freely accessible globally, unveil a promising opportunity to bridge this gap. In this paper, we present CityFM, a self-supervised framework to train a foundation model within a selected geographical area of interest, such as a city. CityFM relies solely on open data from OSM, and produces multimodal representations of entities of different types, incorporating spatial, visual, and textual information. We analyse the entity representations generated using our foundation models from a qualitative perspective, and conduct quantitative experiments on road, building, and region-level downstream tasks. We compare its results to algorithms tailored specifically for the respective applications. In all the experiments, CityFM achieves performance superior to, or on par with, the baselines.</p></details> | CIKM 2024 |
| **[MicroScopiQ: Accelerating Foundational Models through Outlier-Aware Microscaling Quantization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05282v2)** | 2024-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantization of foundational models (FMs) is significantly more challenging than traditional DNNs due to the emergence of large magnitude features called outliers. Existing outlier-aware algorithm/architecture co-design techniques either use mixed-precision, retaining outliers at high precision but compromise hardware efficiency, or quantize inliers and outliers at the same precision, improving hardware efficiency at the cost of accuracy. To address this mutual exclusivity, in this paper, we propose MicroScopiQ, a novel co-design technique that leverages pruning to complement outlier-aware quantization. MicroScopiQ retains outliers at higher precision while pruning a certain fraction of least important weights to distribute the additional outlier bits; ensuring high accuracy, aligned memory and hardware efficiency. We design a high-throughput, low overhead accelerator architecture composed of simple multi-precision INT processing elements and a novel network-on-chip called ReCoN that efficiently abstracts the complexity of supporting high-precision outliers. Additionally, unlike existing alternatives, MicroScopiQ does not assume any locality of outlier weights, enabling applicability to a broad range of FMs. Extensive experiments across various quantization settings show that MicroScopiQ achieves SoTA quantization performance while simultaneously improving inference performance by 3x and reducing energy by 2x over existing alternatives.</p></details> | Under review |

To address these challenges, we introduce AuscultaBase, a foundational framework aimed at advancing body sound diagnostics through innovative data integration and contrastive learning techniques. Our contributions include the following: First, we compile AuscultaBase-Corpus, a large-scale, multi-source body sound database encompassing 11 datasets with 40,317 audio recordings and totaling 322.4 hours of heart, lung, and bowel sounds. Second, we develop AuscultaBase-Model, a foundational diagnostic model for body sounds, utilizing contrastive learning on the compiled corpus. Third, we establish AuscultaBase-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark containing 16 sub-tasks, assessing the performance of various open-source acoustic pre-trained models. Evaluation results indicate that our model outperforms all other open-source models in 12 out of 16 tasks, demonstrating the efficacy of our approach in advancing diagnostic capabilities for body sound analysis.</p></details> | 26 pages |

However, these capabilities have yet to be fully demonstrated in bioacoustics tasks, such as detecting animal vocalizations in large recordings, classifying rare and endangered species, and labeling context and behavior - tasks that are crucial for conservation, biodiversity monitoring, and the study of animal behavior. In this work, we present NatureLM-audio, the first audio-language foundation model specifically designed for bioacoustics. Our carefully curated training dataset comprises text-audio pairs spanning a diverse range of bioacoustics, speech, and music data, designed to address the challenges posed by limited annotated datasets in the field. We demonstrate successful transfer of learned representations from music and speech to bioacoustics, and our model shows promising generalization to unseen taxa and tasks. Importantly, we test NatureLM-audio on a novel benchmark (BEANS-Zero) and it sets the new state of the art (SotA) on several bioacoustics tasks, including zero-shot classification of unseen species. To advance bioacoustics research, we also open-source the code for generating training and benchmark data, as well as for training the model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Demo ...</summary><p>Demo page: https://earthspecies.github.io/naturelm-audio-demo/ The code will be open-sourced and available shortly</p></details> |

However, generating multiple high-quality and diverse responses without sacrificing accuracy remains a challenge, especially when using greedy sampling. In this work, we propose a novel framework, Synthesize-Partition-Adapt (SPA), that leverages the abundant synthetic data available in many domains to elicit diverse responses from foundation models. By leveraging signal provided by data attribution methods such as influence functions, SPA partitions data into subsets, each targeting unique aspects of the data, and trains multiple model adaptations optimized for these subsets. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in diversifying foundation model responses while maintaining high quality, showcased through the HumanEval and MBPP tasks in the code generation domain and several tasks in the natural language understanding domain, highlighting its potential to enrich user experience across various applications.</p></details> |  |

Several Multiple Instance Learning frameworks proposed for this task utilize a ResNet50 backbone pre-trained on natural images. By leveraging recenetly released histopathological foundation models such as UNI and Hibou, the predictive prowess of existing MIL networks can be enhanced. Furthermore, deploying an ensemble of digital pathology foundation models yields higher baseline accuracy, although the benefits appear to diminish with more complex MIL architectures. Our code will be made publicly available upon acceptance.</p></details> |  |

However, a significant challenge lies in the scarcity and high cost of obtaining high-quality materials datasets. In other fields, such as natural language processing, foundation models pre-trained on large datasets have achieved exceptional success in transfer learning, effectively leveraging latent features to achieve high performance on tasks with limited data. Despite this progress, the concept of foundation models remains underexplored in materials science. Here, we present a foundation model specifically designed for composite materials. Our model is pre-trained on a dataset of short-fiber composites to learn robust latent features. During transfer learning, the MMAE accurately predicts homogenized stiffness, with an R2 score reaching as high as 0.959 and consistently exceeding 0.91, even when trained on limited data. These findings validate the feasibility and effectiveness of foundation models in composite materials. We anticipate extending this approach to more complex three-dimensional composite materials, polycrystalline materials, and beyond. Moreover, this framework enables high-accuracy predictions even when experimental data are scarce, paving the way for more efficient and cost-effective materials design and analysis.</p></details> |  |

Despite the significant progress of pre-trained graph neural networks, there haven't been GFMs that can achieve desired performance on various graph-learning-related tasks. Building GFMs may rely on a vocabulary that encodes transferable patterns shared among different tasks and domains. Unlike image and text, defining such transferable patterns for graphs remains an open question. In this paper, we aim to bridge this gap by rethinking the transferable patterns on graphs as computation trees -- i.e., tree structures derived from the message-passing process. Based on this insight, we propose a cross-task, cross-domain graph foundation model named GFT, short for Graph Foundation model with transferable Tree vocabulary. By treating computation trees as tokens within the transferable vocabulary, GFT improves model generalization and reduces the risk of negative transfer. The theoretical analyses and extensive experimental studies have demonstrated the transferability of computation trees and shown the effectiveness of GFT across diverse tasks and domains in graph learning.

Accurate segmentation of the left atrium (LA) in 3D late gadolinium-enhanced (LGE) MRI is helpful for evaluating AF, as fibrotic remodeling in the LA myocardium contributes to arrhythmia and serves as a key determinant of therapeutic strategies. However, manual LA segmentation is labor-intensive and challenging. Recent foundational deep learning models, such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM), pre-trained on diverse datasets, have demonstrated promise in generic segmentation tasks. MedSAM, a fine-tuned version of SAM for medical applications, enables efficient, zero-shot segmentation without domain-specific training. Despite the potential of MedSAM model, it has not yet been evaluated for the complex task of LA segmentation in 3D LGE-MRI. This study aims to (1) evaluate the performance of MedSAM in automating LA segmentation, (2) compare the performance of the MedSAM2 model, which uses a single prompt with automated tracking, with the MedSAM1 model, which requires separate prompt for each slice, and (3) analyze the performance of MedSAM1 in terms of Dice score(i.e., segmentation accuracy) by varying the size and location of the box prompt.</p></details> |  |

What Matters and What Does Not](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17044v2)** | 2024-11-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The remarkable performance achieved by Large Language Models (LLM) has driven research efforts to leverage them for a wide range of tasks and input modalities. In speech-to-text (S2T) tasks, the emerging solution consists of projecting the output of the encoder of a Speech Foundational Model (SFM) into the LLM embedding space through an adapter module. However, no work has yet investigated how much the downstream-task performance depends on each component (SFM, adapter, LLM) nor whether the best design of the adapter depends on the chosen SFM and LLM. To fill this gap, we evaluate the combination of 5 adapter modules, 2 LLMs (Mistral and Llama), and 2 SFMs (Whisper and SeamlessM4T) on two widespread S2T tasks, namely Automatic Speech Recognition and Speech Translation. Our results demonstrate that the SFM plays a pivotal role in downstream performance, while the adapter choice has moderate impact and depends on the SFM and LLM.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we investigate the potential of domain-specific foundation models for dermatology in addressing this challenge. We utilize self-supervised learning (SSL) techniques to pre-train models on a dataset of over 240,000 dermatological images from public and private collections. Our study considers several SSL methods and compares the resulting foundation models against domain-agnostic models like those pre-trained on ImageNet and state-of-the-art models such as MONET across 12 downstream tasks. Unlike previous research, we emphasize the development of smaller models that are more suitable for resource-limited clinical settings, facilitating easier adaptation to a broad range of use cases. Results show that models pre-trained in this work not only outperform general-purpose models but also approach the performance of models 50 times larger on clinically relevant diagnostic tasks. To promote further research in this direction, we publicly release both the training code and the foundation models, which can benefit clinicians in dermatological applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Findi...</summary><p>Findings paper presented at Machine Learning for Health (ML4H) symposium 2024, December 15-16, 2024, Vancouver, Canada, 11 pages</p></details> |

A Comparative Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05489v1)** | 2024-11-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning has led to remarkable advancements in computational histopathology, e.g., in diagnostics, biomarker prediction, and outcome prognosis. Yet, the lack of annotated data and the impact of batch effects, e.g., systematic technical data differences across hospitals, hamper model robustness and generalization. Recent histopathological foundation models -- pretrained on millions to billions of images -- have been reported to improve generalization performances on various downstream tasks. However, it has not been systematically assessed whether they fully eliminate batch effects. In this study, we empirically show that the feature embeddings of the foundation models still contain distinct hospital signatures that can lead to biased predictions and misclassifications. We further find that the signatures are not removed by stain normalization methods, dominate distances in feature space, and are evident across various principal components. Our work provides a novel perspective on the evaluation of medical foundation models, paving the way for more robust pretraining strategies and downstream predictors.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AIM-FM Workshop @ NeurIPS'24</p></details> |

Existing data-driven models focus on single weather understanding tasks (e.g., weather forecasting). Although these models have achieved promising results, they fail to tackle various complex tasks within a single and unified model. Moreover, the paradigm that relies on limited real observations for a single scenario hinders the model's performance upper bound. In response to these limitations, we draw inspiration from the in-context learning paradigm employed in state-of-the-art visual foundation models and large language models. In this paper, we introduce the first generalist weather foundation model (WeatherGFM), designed to address a wide spectrum of weather understanding tasks in a unified manner. More specifically, we initially unify the representation and definition of the diverse weather understanding tasks. Subsequently, we devised weather prompt formats to manage different weather data modalities, namely single, multiple, and temporal modalities. Finally, we adopt a visual prompting question-answering paradigm for the training of unified weather understanding tasks. Extensive experiments indicate that our WeatherGFM can effectively handle up to ten weather understanding tasks, including weather forecasting, super-resolution, weather image translation, and post-processing. Our method also showcases generalization ability on unseen tasks.</p></details> |  |

As AI agent systems tackle more complex tasks and evolve, they involve a wider range of stakeholders, including agent users, agentic system developers and deployers, and AI model developers. These systems also integrate multiple components such as AI agent workflows, RAG pipelines, prompt management, agent capabilities, and observability features. In this case, obtaining reliable outputs and answers from these agents remains challenging, necessitating a dependable execution process and end-to-end observability solutions. To build reliable AI agents and LLM applications, it is essential to shift towards designing AgentOps platforms that ensure observability and traceability across the entire development-to-production life-cycle. To this end, we conducted a rapid review and identified relevant AgentOps tools from the agentic ecosystem. Based on this review, we provide an overview of the essential features of AgentOps and propose a comprehensive overview of observability data/traceable artifacts across the agent production life-cycle. Our findings provide a systematic overview of the current AgentOps landscape, emphasizing the critical role of observability/traceability in enhancing the reliability of autonomous agent systems.</p></details> | 19 pages, 9 figures |

However, it remains unclear why this model -- originally developed for multi-player stochastic game matching -- can be adopted to convert pairwise response comparisons to reward values and make predictions. Especially given the fact that only a limited number of prompt-response pairs are sparsely compared with others. In this paper, we first revisit the foundations of using BT models in reward modeling, and establish the convergence rate of BT reward models based on deep neural networks using embeddings, providing a theoretical foundation for their use. Despite theoretically sound, we argue that the BT model is not a necessary choice from the perspective of downstream optimization. This is because a reward model only needs to preserve the correct ranking predictions through a monotonic transformation of the true reward. We highlight the critical concept of order consistency in reward modeling and demonstrate that the BT model possesses this property. Consequently, we propose a simple and straightforward upper-bound algorithm, compatible with off-the-shelf binary classifiers, as an alternative order-consistent reward modeling objective. To offer practical insights, we empirically evaluate the performance of these different reward modeling approaches across more than 12,000 experimental setups, using $6$ base LLMs, $2$ datasets, and diverse annotation designs that vary in quantity, quality, and pairing choices in preference annotations.</p></details> |  |

Next, we summarize a unified framework that captures the essential components used in prior research, accompanied by a taxonomy. Additionally, we explore commercial applications of (M)LLM-based GUI agents. Drawing from existing work, we identify several key challenges and propose future research directions.

This study introduces a novel approach towards the creation of medical foundation models by integrating a large-scale multi-modal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) dataset derived from 41,400 participants in its own. Our method involves a novel two-stage pretraining approach using vision transformers. The first stage is dedicated to encoding anatomical structures in generally healthy brains, identifying key features such as shapes and sizes of different brain regions. The second stage concentrates on spatial information, encompassing aspects like location and the relative positioning of brain structures. We rigorously evaluate our model, BrainFounder, using the Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS) challenge and Anatomical Tracings of Lesions After Stroke v2.0 (ATLAS v2.0) datasets. BrainFounder demonstrates a significant performance gain, surpassing the achievements of the previous winning solutions using fully supervised learning. Our findings underscore the impact of scaling up both the complexity of the model and the volume of unlabeled training data derived from generally healthy brains, which enhances the accuracy and predictive capabilities of the model in complex neuroimaging tasks with MRI. The implications of this research provide transformative insights and practical applications in healthcare and make substantial steps towards the creation of foundation models for Medical AI.

The main problem for those applications arises from the difficulty in collecting large labeled task-specific data for model development. Generalizable respiratory acoustic foundation models pretrained with unlabeled data would offer appealing advantages and possibly unlock this impasse. However, given the safety-critical nature of healthcare applications, it is pivotal to also ensure openness and replicability for any proposed foundation model solution. To this end, we introduce OPERA, an OPEn Respiratory Acoustic foundation model pretraining and benchmarking system, as the first approach answering this need. We curate large-scale respiratory audio datasets (~136K samples, over 400 hours), pretrain three pioneering foundation models, and build a benchmark consisting of 19 downstream respiratory health tasks for evaluation. Our pretrained models demonstrate superior performance (against existing acoustic models pretrained with general audio on 16 out of 19 tasks) and generalizability (to unseen datasets and new respiratory audio modalities). This highlights the great promise of respiratory acoustic foundation models and encourages more studies using OPERA as an open resource to accelerate research on respiratory audio for health.

However, they often fail to fully capture the complexity of research workflows, which typically involve interpreting non-textual data and gathering information across multiple documents. To address this gap, we introduce M3SciQA, a multi-modal, multi-document scientific question answering benchmark designed for a more comprehensive evaluation of foundation models. M3SciQA consists of 1,452 expert-annotated questions spanning 70 natural language processing paper clusters, where each cluster represents a primary paper along with all its cited documents, mirroring the workflow of comprehending a single paper by requiring multi-modal and multi-document data. With M3SciQA, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 18 foundation models. Our results indicate that current foundation models still significantly underperform compared to human experts in multi-modal information retrieval and in reasoning across multiple scientific documents. Additionally, we explore the implications of these findings for the future advancement of applying foundation models in multi-modal scientific literature analysis.</p></details> |  |

Face reconstruction attack (also known as template inversion) refers to reconstructing face images from face embeddings and using the reconstructed face image to enter a face recognition system. In this paper, we propose to use a face foundation model to reconstruct face images from the embeddings of a blackbox face recognition model. The foundation model is trained with 42M images to generate face images from the facial embeddings of a fixed face recognition model. We propose to use an adapter to translate target embeddings into the embedding space of the foundation model. The generated images are evaluated on different face recognition models and different datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method to translate embeddings of different face recognition models.

Nevertheless, there is a lack of systematic knowledge to guide practitioners in designing the agents considering challenges of goal-seeking (including generating instrumental goals and plans), such as hallucinations inherent in foundation models, explainability of reasoning process, complex accountability, etc. To address this issue, we have performed a systematic literature review to understand the state-of-the-art foundation model-based agents and the broader ecosystem. In this paper, we present a pattern catalogue consisting of 18 architectural patterns with analyses of the context, forces, and trade-offs as the outcomes from the previous literature review. We propose a decision model for selecting the patterns. The proposed catalogue can provide holistic guidance for the effective use of patterns, and support the architecture design of foundation model-based agents by facilitating goal-seeking and plan generation.</p></details> |  |

The Segmentation Anything Model (SAM) serves as a powerful foundation model for visual segmentation and can be adapted for medical image segmentation. However, medical imaging data typically contain privacy-sensitive information, making it challenging to train foundation models with centralized storage and sharing. To date, there are few foundation models tailored for medical image deployment within the federated learning framework, and the segmentation performance, as well as the efficiency of communication and training, remain unexplored. In response to these issues, we developed Federated Foundation models for Medical image Segmentation (FedFMS), which includes the Federated SAM (FedSAM) and a communication and training-efficient Federated SAM with Medical SAM Adapter (FedMSA). Comprehensive experiments on diverse datasets are conducted to investigate the performance disparities between centralized training and federated learning across various configurations of FedFMS. The experiments revealed that FedFMS could achieve performance comparable to models trained via centralized training methods while maintaining privacy. Furthermore, FedMSA demonstrated the potential to enhance communication and training efficiency.

However, these large-scale datasets are often collected without explicit consent, raising ethical and privacy concerns. To address this, there have been proposals to use synthetic datasets for training face recognition models. Yet, such models still rely on real data to train the generative models and generally exhibit inferior performance compared to those trained on real datasets. One of these datasets, DigiFace, uses a graphics pipeline to generate different identities and different intra-class variations without using real data in training the models. However, the performance of this approach is poor on face recognition benchmarks, possibly due to the lack of realism in the images generated from the graphics pipeline. In this work, we introduce a novel framework for realism transfer aimed at enhancing the realism of synthetically generated face images. Our method leverages the large-scale face foundation model, and we adapt the pipeline for realism enhancement. By integrating the controllable aspects of the graphics pipeline with our realism enhancement technique, we generate a large amount of realistic variations-combining the advantages of both approaches. Our empirical evaluations demonstrate that models trained using our enhanced dataset significantly improve the performance of face recognition systems over the baseline.

However, fully understanding and predicting RNA behavior, particularly for applications in drug discovery, remains a challenge due to the complexity of RNA structures and interactions. While foundational models in biology have demonstrated success in modeling several biomolecules, especially proteins, achieving similar breakthroughs for RNA has proven more difficult. Current RNA models have yet to match the performance observed in the protein domain, leaving an important gap in computational biology. In this work, we present ChaRNABERT, a suite of sample and parameter-efficient RNA foundational models, that through a learnable tokenization process, are able to reach state-of-the-art performance on several tasks in established benchmarks. We extend its testing in relevant downstream tasks such as RNA-protein and aptamer-protein interaction prediction.

One of the most predominant biomarkers in neuroimaging is represented by brain age, which has been shown to be a good indicator for different conditions, such as Alzheimer's Disease. Using brain age for pretraining DL models in transfer learning settings has also recently shown promising results, especially when dealing with data scarcity of different conditions. On the other hand, anatomical information of brain MRIs (e.g. cortical thickness) can provide important information for learning good representations that can be transferred to many downstream tasks. In this work, we propose AnatCL, an anatomical foundation model for brain MRIs that i.) leverages anatomical information with a weakly contrastive learning approach and ii.) achieves state-of-the-art performances in many different downstream tasks. To validate our approach we consider 12 different downstream tasks for diagnosis classification, and prediction of 10 different clinical assessment scores.

Unlike traditional software, agents operate autonomously, using extensive data and opaque implicit reasoning, making it difficult to observe and understand their behavior during runtime, especially when they take unexpected actions or encounter errors. In this paper, we highlight the limitations of traditional operational observability in the context of FM-powered software, and introduce cognitive observability as a new type of required observability that has emerged for such innovative systems. We then propose a novel framework that provides cognitive observability into the implicit reasoning processes of agents (a.k.a. reasoning observability), and demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in boosting the debuggability of Agentware and, in turn, the abilities of an Agentware through a case study on AutoCodeRover, a cuttingedge Agentware for autonomous program improvement.</p></details> |  |

It is based on a multiscale operator transformer, with time-conditioned layer norms that enable continuous-in-time evaluations. A novel training strategy leveraging the semi-group property of time-dependent PDEs to allow for significant scaling-up of the training data is also proposed. Poseidon is pretrained on a diverse, large scale dataset for the governing equations of fluid dynamics. It is then evaluated on a suite of 15 challenging downstream tasks that include a wide variety of PDE types and operators. We show that Poseidon exhibits excellent performance across the board by outperforming baselines significantly, both in terms of sample efficiency and accuracy. Poseidon also generalizes very well to new physics that is not seen during pretraining. Moreover, Poseidon scales with respect to model and data size, both for pretraining and for downstream tasks. Taken together, our results showcase the surprising ability of Poseidon to learn effective representations from a very small set of PDEs during pretraining in order to generalize well to unseen and unrelated PDEs downstream, demonstrating its potential as an effective, general purpose PDE foundation model. Finally, the Poseidon model as well as underlying pretraining and downstream datasets are open sourced, with code being available at https://github.com/camlab-ethz/poseidon and pretrained models and datasets at https://huggingface.co/camlab-ethz.</p></details> |  |

Emerging research indicates that large vision-language models (VLMs) can enhance performance across various downstream vision-language understanding tasks. However, general-domain models often underperform in specialized fields. This study introduces a domain-specific Large Vision-Language Model, Human-Scene Vision-Language Model (HumanVLM), designed to provide a foundation for human-scene Vision-Language tasks. Specifically, (1) we create a large-scale human-scene multimodal image-text dataset (HumanCaption-10M) sourced from the Internet to facilitate domain-specific alignment; (2) develop a captioning approach for human-centered images, capturing human faces, bodies, and backgrounds, and construct a high-quality Human-Scene image-text dataset (HumanCaptionHQ, about 311k pairs) that contain as much detailed information as possible about human; (3) Using HumanCaption-10M and HumanCaptionHQ, we train a HumanVLM. In the experiments, we then evaluate our HumanVLM across varous downstream tasks, where it demonstrates superior overall performance among multimodal models of comparable scale, particularly excelling in human-related tasks and significantly outperforming similar models, including Qwen2VL and ChatGPT-4o. HumanVLM, alongside the data introduced, will stimulate the research in human-around fields.</p></details> | 34 pages,11 figures |

While Parameter-efficient Fine-tuning (PEFT) is commonly used to adapt these models, studies often prioritize parameter efficiency, neglecting GPU memory and training speed. To address this, we introduced the IISAN framework, significantly enhancing efficiency. However, IISAN was limited to symmetrical MFMs and identical text and image encoders, preventing the use of state-of-the-art Large Language Models. To overcome this, we developed IISAN-Versa, a versatile plug-and-play architecture compatible with both symmetrical and asymmetrical MFMs. IISAN-Versa employs a Decoupled PEFT structure and utilizes both intra- and inter-modal adaptation. It effectively handles asymmetry through a simple yet effective combination of group layer-dropping and dimension transformation alignment. Our research demonstrates that IISAN-Versa effectively adapts large text encoders, and we further identify a scaling effect where larger encoders generally perform better. IISAN-Versa also demonstrates strong versatility in our defined multimodal scenarios, which include raw titles and captions generated from images and videos. Additionally, IISAN-Versa achieved state-of-the-art performance on the Microlens public benchmark.

However, most of these models rely on the Transformer architecture, which incurs quadratic complexity as input length increases. To address this, we introduce TSMamba, a linear-complexity foundation model for time series forecasting built on the Mamba architecture. The model captures temporal dependencies through both forward and backward Mamba encoders, achieving high prediction accuracy. To reduce reliance on large datasets and lower training costs, TSMamba employs a two-stage transfer learning process that leverages pretrained Mamba LLMs, allowing effective time series modeling with a moderate training set. In the first stage, the forward and backward backbones are optimized via patch-wise autoregressive prediction; in the second stage, the model trains a prediction head and refines other components for long-term forecasting. While the backbone assumes channel independence to manage varying channel numbers across datasets, a channel-wise compressed attention module is introduced to capture cross-channel dependencies during fine-tuning on specific multivariate datasets. Experiments show that TSMamba's zero-shot performance is comparable to state-of-the-art time series foundation models, despite using significantly less training data. It also achieves competitive or superior full-shot performance compared to task-specific prediction models. The code will be made publicly available.</p></details> |  |

We specifically evaluated this approach on representative tasks such as music tagging, music transcription, music source separation, and music mixing. Our results reveal that the features extracted from foundation models provide valuable enhancements in training downstream task models. This highlights the capability of using features extracted from music foundation models as a booster for downstream tasks.

Has this achieved what the original FMs accomplished, i.e. the supplanting of traditional supervised learning in their domains? To answer we look at three modalities -- genomics, satellite imaging, and time series -- with multiple recent FMs and compare them to a standard supervised learning workflow: model development, hyperparameter tuning, and training, all using only data from the target task. Across these three specialized domains, we find that it is consistently possible to train simple supervised models -- no more complicated than a lightly modified wide ResNet or UNet -- that match or even outperform the latest foundation models. Our work demonstrates that the benefits of large-scale pretraining have yet to be realized in many specialized areas, reinforces the need to compare new FMs to strong, well-tuned baselines, and introduces two new, easy-to-use, open-source, and automated workflows for doing so.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The first two authors contributed equally.

| **[Foundation AI Model for Medical Image Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02745v1)** | 2024-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models refer to artificial intelligence (AI) models that are trained on massive amounts of data and demonstrate broad generalizability across various tasks with high accuracy. These models offer versatile, one-for-many or one-for-all solutions, eliminating the need for developing task-specific AI models. Examples of such foundation models include the Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer (ChatGPT) and the Segment Anything Model (SAM). These models have been trained on millions to billions of samples and have shown wide-ranging and accurate applications in numerous tasks such as text processing (using ChatGPT) and natural image segmentation (using SAM). In medical image segmentation - finding target regions in medical images - there is a growing need for these one-for-many or one-for-all foundation models. Such models could obviate the need to develop thousands of task-specific AI models, which is currently standard practice in the field. They can also be adapted to tasks with datasets too small for effective training. We discuss two paths to achieve foundation models for medical image segmentation and comment on progress, challenges, and opportunities. One path is to adapt or fine-tune existing models, originally developed for natural images, for use with medical images. The second path entails building models from scratch, exclusively training on medical images.</p></details> |  |
| **[Conformal Alignment: Knowing When to Trust Foundation Models with Guarantees](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10301v3)** | 2024-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Before deploying outputs from foundation models in high-stakes tasks, it is imperative to ensure that they align with human values. For instance, in radiology report generation, reports generated by a vision-language model must align with human evaluations before their use in medical decision-making. This paper presents Conformal Alignment, a general framework for identifying units whose outputs meet a user-specified alignment criterion. It is guaranteed that on average, a prescribed fraction of selected units indeed meet the alignment criterion, regardless of the foundation model or the data distribution. Given any pre-trained model and new units with model-generated outputs, Conformal Alignment leverages a set of reference data with ground-truth alignment status to train an alignment predictor. It then selects new units whose predicted alignment scores surpass a data-dependent threshold, certifying their corresponding outputs as trustworthy. Through applications to question answering and radiology report generation, we demonstrate that our method is able to accurately identify units with trustworthy outputs via lightweight training over a moderate amount of reference data. En route, we investigate the informativeness of various features in alignment prediction and combine them with standard models to construct the alignment predictor.</p></details> |  |

The use of token representations is widely credited with increased model performance but is also the source of many undesirable behaviors, such as spurious ambiguity or inconsistency. Despite its recognized importance as a standard representation method in NLP, the theoretical underpinnings of tokenization are not yet fully understood. In particular, the impact of tokenization on statistical estimation has been investigated mostly through empirical means. The present paper contributes to addressing this theoretical gap by proposing a unified formal framework for representing and analyzing tokenizer models. Based on the category of stochastic maps, this framework enables us to establish general conditions for a principled use of tokenizers, and most importantly, the necessary and sufficient conditions for a tokenizer model to preserve the consistency of statistical estimators. Additionally, we discuss statistical and computational concerns crucial for designing and implementing tokenizer models, such as inconsistency, ambiguity, tractability, and boundedness. The framework and results advanced in this paper contribute to building robust theoretical foundations for representations in neural language modeling that can inform future empirical research.</p></details> |  |

Deep learning has shown promise in exploring these relationships using various data types. However, transcriptomics, which provides detailed insights into cellular states, is still underused due to its high noise levels and limited data availability. Recent advancements in transcriptomics sequencing provide new opportunities to uncover valuable insights, especially with the rise of many new foundation models for transcriptomics, yet no benchmark has been made to robustly evaluate the effectiveness of these rising models for perturbation analysis. This article presents a novel biologically motivated evaluation framework and a hierarchy of perturbation analysis tasks for comparing the performance of pretrained foundation models to each other and to more classical techniques of learning from transcriptomics data.

This exploration is beneficial for finding good loss basins when training from scratch. It is not necessarily ideal when resuming from a powerful foundation model because it can lead to large deviations from the pre-trained initialization and, consequently, worse robustness and generalization. At the same time, strong regularization on all parameters can lead to under-fitting. We hypothesize that selectively regularizing the parameter space is the key to fitting and retraining the pre-trained knowledge. This paper proposes a new weight decay technique, Selective Projection Decay (SPD), that selectively imposes a strong penalty on certain layers while allowing others to change freely. Intuitively, SPD expands and contracts the parameter search space for layers with consistent and inconsistent loss reduction, respectively. Experimentally, when equipped with SPD, Adam consistently provides better in-distribution generalization and out-of-distribution robustness performance on multiple popular vision and language benchmarks.

However, addressing uncertainty in both perception (sensory interpretation) and decision-making (plan generation) remains a critical challenge for ensuring task reliability. We present a comprehensive framework to disentangle, quantify, and mitigate these two forms of uncertainty. We first introduce a framework for uncertainty disentanglement, isolating perception uncertainty arising from limitations in visual understanding and decision uncertainty relating to the robustness of generated plans. To quantify each type of uncertainty, we propose methods tailored to the unique properties of perception and decision-making: we use conformal prediction to calibrate perception uncertainty and introduce Formal-Methods-Driven Prediction (FMDP) to quantify decision uncertainty, leveraging formal verification techniques for theoretical guarantees. Building on this quantification, we implement two targeted intervention mechanisms: an active sensing process that dynamically re-observes high-uncertainty scenes to enhance visual input quality and an automated refinement procedure that fine-tunes the model on high-certainty data, improving its capability to meet task specifications. Empirical validation in real-world and simulated robotic tasks demonstrates that our uncertainty disentanglement framework reduces variability by up to 40% and enhances task success rates by 5% compared to baselines. These improvements are attributed to the combined effect of both interventions and highlight the importance of uncertainty disentanglement which facilitates targeted interventions that enhance the robustness and reliability of autonomous systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Fine-...</summary><p>Fine-tuned models, code, and datasets are available at https://tinyurl.com/uncertainty-disentanglement</p></details> |

Investigating molecular data through multi-omics approaches is crucial for unraveling the complex biological mechanisms underlying cancer, thereby enabling more effective diagnosis, treatment, and prevention strategies. However, predicting patient outcomes through the integration of all available multi-omics data is still an under-study research direction. Here, we present SeNMo, a foundation model that has been trained on multi-omics data across 33 cancer types. SeNMo is particularly efficient in handling multi-omics data characterized by high-width and low-length attributes. We trained SeNMo for the task of overall survival of patients using pan-cancer multi-omics data involving 33 cancer sites from the GDC. The training multi-omics data includes gene expression, DNA methylation, miRNA expression, DNA mutations, protein expression modalities, and clinical data. SeNMo was validated on two independent cohorts: Moffitt Cancer Center and CPTAC lung squamous cell carcinoma. We evaluated the model's performance in predicting patient's overall survival using the C-Index. SeNMo performed consistently well in the training regime, reflected by the validation C-Index of 0.76 on GDC's public data. In the testing regime, SeNMo performed with a C-Index of 0.758 on a held-out test set. The model showed an average accuracy of 99.8% on the task of classifying the primary cancer type on the pan-cancer test cohort. SeNMo demonstrated robust performance on the classification task of predicting the primary cancer type of patients. SeNMo further demonstrated significant performance in predicting tertiary lymph structures from multi-omics data, showing generalizability across cancer types, molecular data types, and clinical endpoints.</p></details> |  |

Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a promising tool for disentangling FM representations, but they struggle to capture rare, yet crucial concepts in the data. We introduce Specialized Sparse Autoencoders (SSAEs), designed to illuminate these elusive dark matter features by focusing on specific subdomains. We present a practical recipe for training SSAEs, demonstrating the efficacy of dense retrieval for data selection and the benefits of Tilted Empirical Risk Minimization as a training objective to improve concept recall. Our evaluation of SSAEs on standard metrics, such as downstream perplexity and $L_0$ sparsity, show that they effectively capture subdomain tail concepts, exceeding the capabilities of general-purpose SAEs. We showcase the practical utility of SSAEs in a case study on the Bias in Bios dataset, where SSAEs achieve a 12.5\% increase in worst-group classification accuracy when applied to remove spurious gender information. SSAEs provide a powerful new lens for peering into the inner workings of FMs in subdomains.</p></details> |  |

Recent developments show that if the linear recurrence powering SSMs allows for multiplicative interactions between inputs and hidden states (e.g. GateLoop, Mamba, GLA), then the resulting architecture can surpass in both in accuracy and efficiency attention-powered foundation models trained on text, at scales of billion parameters. In this paper, we give theoretical grounding to this recent finding using tools from Rough Path Theory: we show that when random linear recurrences are equipped with simple input-controlled transitions (selectivity mechanism), then the hidden state is provably a low-dimensional projection of a powerful mathematical object called the signature of the input -- capturing non-linear interactions between tokens at distinct timescales. Our theory not only motivates the success of modern selective state-space models such as Mamba but also provides a solid framework to understand the expressive power of future SSM variants.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS Version w/ minor edits</p></details> |
| **[FRoundation: Are Foundation Models Ready for Face Recognition?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23831v2)** | 2024-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models are predominantly trained in an unsupervised or self-supervised manner on highly diverse and large-scale datasets, making them broadly applicable to various downstream tasks. In this work, we investigate for the first time whether such models are suitable for the specific domain of face recognition. We further propose and demonstrate the adaptation of these models for face recognition across different levels of data availability. Extensive experiments are conducted on multiple foundation models and datasets of varying scales for training and fine-tuning, with evaluation on a wide range of benchmarks. Our results indicate that, despite their versatility, pre-trained foundation models underperform in face recognition compared to similar architectures trained specifically for this task. However, fine-tuning foundation models yields promising results, often surpassing models trained from scratch when training data is limited. Even with access to large-scale face recognition training datasets, fine-tuned foundation models perform comparably to models trained from scratch, but with lower training computational costs and without relying on the assumption of extensive data availability. Our analysis also explores bias in face recognition, with slightly higher bias observed in some settings when using foundation models.</p></details> |  |
