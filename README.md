| **[Powerful Spatial Multiple Testing via Borrowing Neighboring Information](http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.17121v2)** | 2024-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Clustered effects are often encountered in multiple hypothesis testing of spatial signals. In this paper, we propose a new method, termed \textit{two-dimensional spatial multiple testing} (2d-SMT) procedure, to control the false discovery rate (FDR) and improve the detection power by exploiting the spatial information encoded in neighboring observations. The proposed method provides a novel perspective of utilizing spatial information by gathering signal patterns and spatial dependence into an auxiliary statistic. 2d-SMT rejects the null when a primary statistic at the location of interest and the auxiliary statistic constructed based on nearby observations are greater than their corresponding cutoffs. 2d-SMT can also be combined with different variants of the weighted BH procedures to improve the detection power further. A fast algorithm is developed to accelerate the search for optimal cutoffs in 2d-SMT. In theory, we establish the asymptotic FDR control of 2d-SMT under weak spatial dependence. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate that the 2d-SMT method combined with various weighted BH procedures achieves the most competitive performance in FDR and power trade-off.</p></details> | 35 pages |

Despite the improvement brought by the strong visual backbone in extracting spatial features, CLIP still falls short in capturing and integrating spatial-temporal features which is essential for video recognition. In this paper, we propose OmniCLIP, a framework that adapts CLIP for video recognition by focusing on learning comprehensive features encompassing spatial, temporal, and dynamic spatial-temporal scales, which we refer to as omni-scale features. This is achieved through the design of spatial-temporal blocks that include parallel temporal adapters (PTA), enabling efficient temporal modeling. Additionally, we introduce a self-prompt generator (SPG) module to capture dynamic object spatial features. The synergy between PTA and SPG allows OmniCLIP to discern varying spatial information across frames and assess object scales over time. We have conducted extensive experiments in supervised video recognition, few-shot video recognition, and zero-shot recognition tasks. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, especially with OmniCLIP achieving a top-1 accuracy of 74.30\% on HMDB51 in a 16-shot setting, surpassing the recent MotionPrompt approach even with full training data. The code is available at \url{https://github.com/XiaoBuL/OmniCLIP}.</p></details> | ECAI-2024 |
| **[Camera Perspective Transformation to Bird's Eye View via Spatial Transformer Model for Road Intersection Monitoring](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05577v1)** | 2024-08-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Road intersection monitoring and control research often utilize bird's eye view (BEV) simulators. In real traffic settings, achieving a BEV akin to that in a simulator necessitates the deployment of drones or specific sensor mounting, which is neither feasible nor practical. Consequently, traffic intersection management remains confined to simulation environments given these constraints. In this paper, we address the gap between simulated environments and real-world implementation by introducing a novel deep-learning model that converts a single camera's perspective of a road intersection into a BEV. We created a simulation environment that closely resembles a real-world traffic junction. The proposed model transforms the vehicles into BEV images, facilitating road intersection monitoring and control model processing. Inspired by image transformation techniques, we propose a Spatial-Transformer Double Decoder-UNet (SDD-UNet) model that aims to eliminate the transformed image distortions. In addition, the model accurately estimates the vehicle's positions and enables the direct application of simulation-trained models in real-world contexts. SDD-UNet model achieves an average dice similarity coefficient (DSC) above 95% which is 40% better than the original UNet model. The mean absolute error (MAE) is 0.102 and the centroid of the predicted mask is 0.14 meters displaced, on average, indicating high accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Object Re-identification via Spatial-temporal Fusion Networks and Causal Identity Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05558v1)** | 2024-08-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Object re-identification (ReID) in large camera networks has many challenges. First, the similar appearances of objects degrade ReID performances. This challenge cannot be addressed by existing appearance-based ReID methods. Second, most ReID studies are performed in laboratory settings and do not consider ReID problems in real-world scenarios. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a novel ReID framework that leverages a spatial-temporal fusion network and causal identity matching (CIM). The framework estimates camera network topology using the proposed adaptive Parzen window and combines appearance features with spatial-temporal cue within the Fusion Network. It achieved outstanding performance across several datasets, including VeRi776, Vehicle-3I, and Market-1501, achieving up to 99.70% rank-1 accuracy and 95.5% mAP. Furthermore, the proposed CIM approach, which dynamically assigns gallery sets based on the camera network topology, further improved ReID accuracy and robustness in real-world settings, evidenced by a 94.95% mAP and 95.19% F1 score on the Vehicle-3I dataset. The experimental results support the effectiveness of incorporating spatial-temporal information and CIM for real-world ReID scenarios regardless of the data domain (e.g., vehicle, person).</p></details> |  |
| **[S-SIRUS: an explainability algorithm for spatial regression Random Forest](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05537v1)** | 2024-08-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Random Forest (RF) is a widely used machine learning algorithm known for its flexibility, user-friendliness, and high predictive performance across various domains. However, it is non-interpretable. This can limit its usefulness in applied sciences, where understanding the relationships between predictors and response variable is crucial from a decision-making perspective. In the literature, several methods have been proposed to explain RF, but none of them addresses the challenge of explaining RF in the context of spatially dependent data. Therefore, this work aims to explain regression RF in the case of spatially dependent data by extracting a compact and simple list of rules. In this respect, we propose S-SIRUS, a spatial extension of SIRUS, the latter being a well-established regression rule algorithm able to extract a stable and short list of rules from the classical regression RF algorithm. A simulation study was conducted to evaluate the explainability capability of the proposed S-SIRUS, in comparison to SIRUS, by considering different levels of spatial dependence among the data. The results suggest that S-SIRUS exhibits a higher test predictive accuracy than SIRUS when spatial correlation is present. Moreover, for higher levels of spatial correlation, S-SIRUS produces a shorter list of rules, easing the explanation of the mechanism behind the predictions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Design and Fabrication of Soft Locomotion Robots based on Spatial Compliant Mechanisms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05207v1)** | 2024-08-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Soft robotics has emerged as a promising technology that holds great potential for various application areas. This is due to soft materials unique properties, including flexibility, safety, and shock absorption, among others. Despite many advancement in the field, the development of effective design methodologies and production techniques for soft robots remains a challenge. Although numerous robot prototypes have been proposed in recent years, their designs are often complex and difficult to produce. As such, there is a need for more efficient and unified design approaches that can facilitate the production of soft robots with desirable properties. In this paper, we propose a method for designing soft robots using elastic beams and spatial compliant mechanisms. The method is based on an evolutionary approach that enables the creation of designs with both high motion and force transmission ratios. Specifically, we focus on the development of locomotion mechanisms using a central linear actuator. Our approach involves the use of commonly available plastic materials and a 3D printer to manufacture the designs. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach by presenting experimental results that show successful production and real world operation. Overall, our findings suggest that the use of elastic beams and an evolutionary approach can facilitate the creation of soft robots with desirable locomotion properties, including fast locomotion up to 3.7 body lengths per second, locomotion with a payload, and underwater locomotion. This method has the potential to enable the development of more efficient and practical soft robots for various applications.</p></details> | 20 pages, 11 figures |
| **[Spatial Deconfounding is Reasonable Statistical Practice: Interpretations, Clarifications, and New Benefits](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05106v1)** | 2024-08-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The spatial linear mixed model (SLMM) consists of fixed and spatial random effects that can be confounded. Restricted spatial regression (RSR) models restrict the spatial random effects to be in the orthogonal column space of the covariates, which "deconfounds" the SLMM. Recent articles have shown that the RSR generally performs worse than the SLMM under a certain interpretation of the RSR. We show that every additive model can be reparameterized as a deconfounded model leading to what we call the linear reparameterization of additive models (LRAM). Under this reparameterization the coefficients of the covariates (referred to as deconfounded regression effects) are different from the (confounded) regression effects in the SLMM. It is shown that under the LRAM interpretation, existing deconfounded spatial models produce estimated deconfounded regression effects, spatial prediction, and spatial prediction variances equivalent to that of SLMM in Bayesian contexts. Furthermore, a general RSR (GRSR) and the SLMM produce identical inferences on confounded regression effects. While our results are in complete agreement with recent criticisms, our new results under the LRAM interpretation provide clarifications that lead to different and sometimes contrary conclusions. Additionally, we discuss the inferential and computational benefits to deconfounding, which we illustrate via a simulation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Masked adversarial neural network for cell type deconvolution in spatial transcriptomics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05065v1)** | 2024-08-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurately determining cell type composition in disease-relevant tissues is crucial for identifying disease targets. Most existing spatial transcriptomics (ST) technologies cannot achieve single-cell resolution, making it challenging to accurately determine cell types. To address this issue, various deconvolution methods have been developed. Most of these methods use single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data from the same tissue as a reference to infer cell types in ST data spots. However, they often overlook the differences between scRNA-seq and ST data. To overcome this limitation, we propose a Masked Adversarial Neural Network (MACD). MACD employs adversarial learning to align real ST data with simulated ST data generated from scRNA-seq data. By mapping them into a unified latent space, it can minimize the differences between the two types of data. Additionally, MACD uses masking techniques to effectively learn the features of real ST data and mitigate noise. We evaluated MACD on 32 simulated datasets and 2 real datasets, demonstrating its accuracy in performing cell type deconvolution. All code and public datasets used in this paper are available at https://github.com/wenwenmin/MACD and https://zenodo.org/records/12804822.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLaVA-VSD: Large Language-and-Vision Assistant for Visual Spatial Description](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04957v1)** | 2024-08-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual Spatial Description (VSD) aims to generate texts that describe the spatial relationships between objects within images. Traditional visual spatial relationship classification (VSRC) methods typically output the spatial relationship between two objects in an image, often neglecting world knowledge and lacking general language capabilities. In this paper, we propose a Large Language-and-Vision Assistant for Visual Spatial Description, named LLaVA-VSD, which is designed for the classification, description, and open-ended description of visual spatial relationships. Specifically, the model first constructs a VSD instruction-following dataset using given figure-caption pairs for the three tasks. It then employs LoRA to fine-tune a Large Language and Vision Assistant for VSD, which has 13 billion parameters and supports high-resolution images. Finally, a large language model (Qwen-2) is used to refine the generated sentences, enhancing their diversity and accuracy. LLaVA-VSD demonstrates excellent multimodal conversational capabilities and can follow open-ended instructions to assist with inquiries about object relationships in images.</p></details> |  |
| **[3DSS-Mamba: 3D-Spectral-Spatial Mamba for Hyperspectral Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12487v2)** | 2024-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hyperspectral image (HSI) classification constitutes the fundamental research in remote sensing fields. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformers have demonstrated impressive capability in capturing spectral-spatial contextual dependencies. However, these architectures suffer from limited receptive fields and quadratic computational complexity, respectively. Fortunately, recent Mamba architectures built upon the State Space Model integrate the advantages of long-range sequence modeling and linear computational efficiency, exhibiting substantial potential in low-dimensional scenarios. Motivated by this, we propose a novel 3D-Spectral-Spatial Mamba (3DSS-Mamba) framework for HSI classification, allowing for global spectral-spatial relationship modeling with greater computational efficiency. Technically, a spectral-spatial token generation (SSTG) module is designed to convert the HSI cube into a set of 3D spectral-spatial tokens. To overcome the limitations of traditional Mamba, which is confined to modeling causal sequences and inadaptable to high-dimensional scenarios, a 3D-Spectral-Spatial Selective Scanning (3DSS) mechanism is introduced, which performs pixel-wise selective scanning on 3D hyperspectral tokens along the spectral and spatial dimensions. Five scanning routes are constructed to investigate the impact of dimension prioritization. The 3DSS scanning mechanism combined with conventional mapping operations forms the 3D-spectral-spatial mamba block (3DMB), enabling the extraction of global spectral-spatial semantic representations. Experimental results and analysis demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on HSI classification benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Low-Depth Spatial Tree Algorithms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12953v3)** | 2024-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contemporary accelerator designs exhibit a high degree of spatial localization, wherein two-dimensional physical distance determines communication costs between processing elements. This situation presents considerable algorithmic challenges, particularly when managing sparse data, a pivotal component in progressing data science. The spatial computer model quantifies communication locality by weighting processor communication costs by distance, introducing a term named energy. Moreover, it integrates depth, a widely-utilized metric, to promote high parallelism. We propose and analyze a framework for efficient spatial tree algorithms within the spatial computer model. Our primary method constructs a spatial tree layout that optimizes the locality of the neighbors in the compute grid. This approach thereby enables locality-optimized messaging within the tree. Our layout achieves a polynomial factor improvement in energy compared to utilizing a PRAM approach. Using this layout, we develop energy-efficient treefix sum and lowest common ancestor algorithms, which are both fundamental building blocks for other graph algorithms. With high probability, our algorithms exhibit near-linear energy and poly-logarithmic depth. Our contributions augment a growing body of work demonstrating that computations can have both high spatial locality and low depth. Moreover, our work constitutes an advancement in the spatial layout of irregular and sparse computations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatial Affordance-aware Interactable Subspace Allocation for Mixed Reality Telepresence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04297v1)** | 2024-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To enable remote Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) clients to collaborate as if they were in the same space during Mixed Reality (MR) telepresence, it is essential to overcome spatial heterogeneity and generate a unified shared collaborative environment by integrating remote spaces into a target host space. Especially when multiple remote users connect, a large shared space is necessary for people to maintain their personal space while collaborating, but the existing simple intersection method leads to the creation of narrow shared spaces as the number of remote spaces increases. To robustly align to the host space even as the number of remote spaces increases, we propose a spatial affordance-aware interactable subspace allocation algorithm. The key concept of our approach is to consider the perceivable and interactable areas separately, where every user views the same mutual space, but each remote user has a different interactable subspace, considering their location and spatial affordance. We conducted an evaluation with 900 space combinations, varying the number of remote spaces as two, four, and six, and results show our method outperformed in securing wide interactable mutual space and instantiating users compared to the other spatial matching methods. Our work enables multiple clients from diverse remote locations to access the AR host's space, allowing them to interact directly with the table, wall, or floor by aligning their physical subspaces within a connected mutual space.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 2024 IEEE ISMAR Conference. 10 pages, 6 figures</p></details> |
| **[Harmonized Spatial and Spectral Learning for Robust and Generalized Medical Image Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10373v2)** | 2024-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning has demonstrated remarkable achievements in medical image segmentation. However, prevailing deep learning models struggle with poor generalization due to (i) intra-class variations, where the same class appears differently in different samples, and (ii) inter-class independence, resulting in difficulties capturing intricate relationships between distinct objects, leading to higher false negative cases. This paper presents a novel approach that synergies spatial and spectral representations to enhance domain-generalized medical image segmentation. We introduce the innovative Spectral Correlation Coefficient objective to improve the model's capacity to capture middle-order features and contextual long-range dependencies. This objective complements traditional spatial objectives by incorporating valuable spectral information. Extensive experiments reveal that optimizing this objective with existing architectures like UNet and TransUNet significantly enhances generalization, interpretability, and noise robustness, producing more confident predictions. For instance, in cardiac segmentation, we observe a 0.81 pp and 1.63 pp (pp = percentage point) improvement in DSC over UNet and TransUNet, respectively. Our interpretability study demonstrates that, in most tasks, objectives optimized with UNet outperform even TransUNet by introducing global contextual information alongside local details. These findings underscore the versatility and effectiveness of our proposed method across diverse imaging modalities and medical domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>Early...</summary><p>Early Accepted at ICPR-2024 for Oral Presentation</p></details> |
| **[Uncertainty-Aware Crime Prediction With Spatial Temporal Multivariate Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04193v1)** | 2024-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Crime forecasting is a critical component of urban analysis and essential for stabilizing society today. Unlike other time series forecasting problems, crime incidents are sparse, particularly in small regions and within specific time periods. Traditional spatial-temporal deep learning models often struggle with this sparsity, as they typically cannot effectively handle the non-Gaussian nature of crime data, which is characterized by numerous zeros and over-dispersed patterns. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel approach termed Spatial Temporal Multivariate Zero-Inflated Negative Binomial Graph Neural Networks (STMGNN-ZINB). This framework leverages diffusion and convolution networks to analyze spatial, temporal, and multivariate correlations, enabling the parameterization of probabilistic distributions of crime incidents. By incorporating a Zero-Inflated Negative Binomial model, STMGNN-ZINB effectively manages the sparse nature of crime data, enhancing prediction accuracy and the precision of confidence intervals. Our evaluation on real-world datasets confirms that STMGNN-ZINB outperforms existing models, providing a more reliable tool for predicting and understanding crime dynamics.</p></details> |  |

Recent advances in co-speech gesture generation have primarily utilized data-driven methods, which create natural motion but limit the scope of gestures to those performed in a void. Our work aims to extend these methods by enabling generative models to incorporate scene information into speech-driven gesture synthesis. We introduce a novel synthetic gesture dataset tailored for this purpose. This development represents a critical step toward creating embodied conversational agents that interact more naturally with their environment and users.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bi-Level Spatial and Channel-aware Transformer for Learned Image Compression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03842v1)** | 2024-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in learned image compression (LIC) methods have demonstrated superior performance over traditional hand-crafted codecs. These learning-based methods often employ convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or Transformer-based architectures. However, these nonlinear approaches frequently overlook the frequency characteristics of images, which limits their compression efficiency. To address this issue, we propose a novel Transformer-based image compression method that enhances the transformation stage by considering frequency components within the feature map. Our method integrates a novel Hybrid Spatial-Channel Attention Transformer Block (HSCATB), where a spatial-based branch independently handles high and low frequencies at the attention layer, and a Channel-aware Self-Attention (CaSA) module captures information across channels, significantly improving compression performance. Additionally, we introduce a Mixed Local-Global Feed Forward Network (MLGFFN) within the Transformer block to enhance the extraction of diverse and rich information, which is crucial for effective compression. These innovations collectively improve the transformation's ability to project data into a more decorrelated latent space, thereby boosting overall compression efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework surpasses state-of-the-art LIC methods in rate-distortion performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Interactive Visual Analysis of Spatial Sensitivities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03817v1)** | 2024-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sensitivity analyses of simulation ensembles determine how simulation parameters influence the simulation's outcome. Commonly, one global numerical sensitivity value is computed per simulation parameter. However, when considering 3D spatial simulations, the analysis of localized sensitivities in different spatial regions is of importance in many applications. For analyzing the spatial variation of parameter sensitivity, one needs to compute a spatial sensitivity scalar field per simulation parameter. Given $n$ simulation parameters, we obtain multi-field data consisting of $n$ scalar fields when considering all simulation parameters. We propose an interactive visual analytics solution to analyze the multi-field sensitivity data. It supports the investigation of how strongly and in what way individual parameters influence the simulation outcome, in which spatial regions this is happening, and what the interplay of the simulation parameters is. Its central component is an overview visualization of all sensitivity fields that avoids 3D occlusions by linearizing the data using an adapted scheme of data-driven space-filling curves. The spatial sensitivity values are visualized in a combination of a Horizon Graph and a line chart. We validate our approach by applying it to synthetic and real-world ensemble data.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages paper, 2 pages appendix, 14 figures paper, 1 figure appendix, accepted at IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics (TVCG)</p></details> |
| **[Semantic-guided modeling of spatial relation and object co-occurrence for indoor scene recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.12661v4)** | 2024-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Exploring the semantic context in scene images is essential for indoor scene recognition. However, due to the diverse intra-class spatial layouts and the coexisting inter-class objects, modeling contextual relationships to adapt various image characteristics is a great challenge. Existing contextual modeling methods for scene recognition exhibit two limitations: 1) They typically model only one type of spatial relationship (order or metric) among objects within scenes, with limited exploration of diverse spatial layouts. 2) They often overlook the differences in coexisting objects across different scenes, suppressing scene recognition performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose SpaCoNet, which simultaneously models Spatial relation and Co-occurrence of objects guided by semantic segmentation. Firstly, the Semantic Spatial Relation Module (SSRM) is constructed to model scene spatial features. With the help of semantic segmentation, this module decouples spatial information from the scene image and thoroughly explores all spatial relationships among objects in an end-to-end manner, thereby obtaining semantic-based spatial features. Secondly, both spatial features from the SSRM and deep features from the Image Feature Extraction Module are allocated to each object, so as to distinguish the coexisting object across different scenes. Finally, utilizing the discriminative features above, we design a Global-Local Dependency Module to explore the long-range co-occurrence among objects, and further generate a semantic-guided feature representation for indoor scene recognition. Experimental results on three widely used scene datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of the proposed method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under second review at Expert Systems with Applications</p></details> |
| **[HistoSPACE: Histology-Inspired Spatial Transcriptome Prediction And Characterization Engine](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03592v1)** | 2024-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial transcriptomics (ST) enables the visualization of gene expression within the context of tissue morphology. This emerging discipline has the potential to serve as a foundation for developing tools to design precision medicines. However, due to the higher costs and expertise required for such experiments, its translation into a regular clinical practice might be challenging. Despite the implementation of modern deep learning to enhance information obtained from histological images using AI, efforts have been constrained by limitations in the diversity of information. In this paper, we developed a model, HistoSPACE that explore the diversity of histological images available with ST data to extract molecular insights from tissue image. Our proposed study built an image encoder derived from universal image autoencoder. This image encoder was connected to convolution blocks to built the final model. It was further fine tuned with the help of ST-Data. This model is notably lightweight in compared to traditional histological models. Our developed model demonstrates significant efficiency compared to contemporary algorithms, revealing a correlation of 0.56 in leave-one-out cross-validation. Finally, its robustness was validated through an independent dataset, showing a well matched preditction with predefined disease pathology.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatial-Frequency Discriminability for Revealing Adversarial Perturbations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10856v3)** | 2024-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The vulnerability of deep neural networks to adversarial perturbations has been widely perceived in the computer vision community. From a security perspective, it poses a critical risk for modern vision systems, e.g., the popular Deep Learning as a Service (DLaaS) frameworks. For protecting deep models while not modifying them, current algorithms typically detect adversarial patterns through discriminative decomposition for natural and adversarial data. However, these decompositions are either biased towards frequency resolution or spatial resolution, thus failing to capture adversarial patterns comprehensively. Also, when the detector relies on few fixed features, it is practical for an adversary to fool the model while evading the detector (i.e., defense-aware attack). Motivated by such facts, we propose a discriminative detector relying on a spatial-frequency Krawtchouk decomposition. It expands the above works from two aspects: 1) the introduced Krawtchouk basis provides better spatial-frequency discriminability, capturing the differences between natural and adversarial data comprehensively in both spatial and frequency distributions, w.r.t. the common trigonometric or wavelet basis; 2) the extensive features formed by the Krawtchouk decomposition allows for adaptive feature selection and secrecy mechanism, significantly increasing the difficulty of the defense-aware attack, w.r.t. the detector with few fixed features. Theoretical and numerical analyses demonstrate the uniqueness and usefulness of our detector, exhibiting competitive scores on several deep models and image sets against a variety of adversarial attacks.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we offer a comprehensive investigation of this limitation, while also developing datasets and methods that support algorithmic solutions to improve spatial reasoning in T2I models. We find that spatial relationships are under-represented in the image descriptions found in current vision-language datasets. To alleviate this data bottleneck, we create SPRIGHT, the first spatially focused, large-scale dataset, by re-captioning 6 million images from 4 widely used vision datasets and through a 3-fold evaluation and analysis pipeline, show that SPRIGHT improves the proportion of spatial relationships in existing datasets. We show the efficacy of SPRIGHT data by showing that using only $\sim$0.25% of SPRIGHT results in a 22% improvement in generating spatially accurate images while also improving FID and CMMD scores. We also find that training on images containing a larger number of objects leads to substantial improvements in spatial consistency, including state-of-the-art results on T2I-CompBench with a spatial score of 0.2133, by fine-tuning on <500 images. Through a set of controlled experiments and ablations, we document additional findings that could support future work that seeks to understand factors that affect spatial consistency in text-to-image models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ECCV 2024.

| **[Spatial autoregressive model with measurement error in covariates](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04593v3)** | 2024-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Spatial AutoRegressive model (SAR) is commonly used in studies involving spatial and network data to estimate the spatial or network peer influence and the effects of covariates on the response, taking into account the dependence among units. While the model can be efficiently estimated with a Quasi maximum likelihood approach (QMLE), the detrimental effect of covariate measurement error on the QMLE and how to remedy it is currently unknown. If covariates are measured with error, then the QMLE may not have the $\sqrt{n}$ convergence and may even be inconsistent even when a node is influenced by only a limited number of other nodes or spatial units. We develop a measurement error-corrected ML estimator (ME-QMLE) for the parameters of the SAR model when covariates are measured with error. The ME-QMLE possesses statistical consistency and asymptotic normality properties and we derive its limiting covariance. We consider two types of applications. The first is when the true covariate is imprecisely measured with replicated measurements or cannot be measured directly, and a proxy is observed instead. The second one involves including latent homophily factors estimated with error from the network for estimating peer influence. Our numerical results verify the bias correction property of the estimator and the accuracy of the standard error estimates in finite samples. We illustrate the method on two real datasets; i) peer influence in GPA for middle school students in New Jersey and ii) county-level death rates from the COVID-19 pandemic.</p></details> |  |
| **[MVGT: A Multi-view Graph Transformer Based on Spatial Relations for EEG Emotion Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03131v3)** | 2024-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Electroencephalography (EEG), a medical imaging technique that captures scalp electrical activity of brain structures via electrodes, has been widely used in affective computing. The spatial domain of EEG is rich in affective information. However, few of the existing studies have simultaneously analyzed EEG signals from multiple perspectives of geometric and anatomical structures in spatial domain. In this paper, we propose a multi-view Graph Transformer (MVGT) based on spatial relations, which integrates information from the temporal, frequency and spatial domains, including geometric and anatomical structures, so as to enhance the expressive power of the model comprehensively. We incorporate the spatial information of EEG channels into the model as encoding, thereby improving its ability to perceive the spatial structure of the channels. Meanwhile, experimental results based on publicly available datasets demonstrate that our proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art methods in recent years. In addition, the results also show that the MVGT could extract information from multiple domains and capture inter-channel relationships in EEG emotion recognition tasks effectively.</p></details> |  |

However, current CDMs require a paired segmentation map and echocardiogram dataset. We present a new method called Free-Echo for generating realistic echocardiograms from a single end-diastolic segmentation map without additional training data. Our method is based on the 3D-Unet with Temporal Attention Layers model and is conditioned on the segmentation map using a training-free conditioning method based on SDEdit. We evaluate our model on two public echocardiogram datasets, CAMUS and EchoNet-Dynamic. We show that our model can generate plausible echocardiograms that are spatially aligned with the input segmentation map, achieving performance comparable to training-based CDMs. Our work opens up new possibilities for generating echocardiograms from a single segmentation map, which can be used for data augmentation, domain adaptation, and other applications in medical imaging.

One way to understand the behavior of the swarm is through collective behavior reconstruction using prior demonstrations. Existing approaches often require access to the swarm controller which may not be available. We reconstruct collective behaviors in distinct swarm scenarios involving shared environments without using swarm controller information. We achieve this by transforming prior demonstrations into features that describe multi-agent interactions before behavior reconstruction with multi-agent generative adversarial imitation learning (MA-GAIL). We show that our approach outperforms existing algorithms in spatial organization, and can be used to observe and reconstruct a swarm's behavior for further analysis and testing, which might be impractical or undesirable on the original robot swarm.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 4 figures.

| **[Spatial-temporal Graph Convolutional Networks with Diversified Transformation for Dynamic Graph Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02704v1)** | 2024-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dynamic graphs (DG) are often used to describe evolving interactions between nodes in real-world applications. Temporal patterns are a natural feature of DGs and are also key to representation learning. However, existing dynamic GCN models are mostly composed of static GCNs and sequence modules, which results in the separation of spatiotemporal information and cannot effectively capture complex temporal patterns in DGs. To address this problem, this study proposes a spatial-temporal graph convolutional networks with diversified transformation (STGCNDT), which includes three aspects: a) constructing a unified graph tensor convolutional network (GTCN) using tensor M-products without the need to represent spatiotemporal information separately; b) introducing three transformation schemes in GTCN to model complex temporal patterns to aggregate temporal information; and c) constructing an ensemble of diversified transformation schemes to obtain higher representation capabilities. Empirical studies on four DGs that appear in communication networks show that the proposed STGCNDT significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models in solving link weight estimation tasks due to the diversified transformations.</p></details> | 8 papges, 1 figure |
| **[Group Multi-View Transformer for 3D Shape Analysis with Spatial Encoding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16477v3)** | 2024-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, the results of view-based 3D shape recognition methods have saturated, and models with excellent performance cannot be deployed on memory-limited devices due to their huge size of parameters. To address this problem, we introduce a compression method based on knowledge distillation for this field, which largely reduces the number of parameters while preserving model performance as much as possible. Specifically, to enhance the capabilities of smaller models, we design a high-performing large model called Group Multi-view Vision Transformer (GMViT). In GMViT, the view-level ViT first establishes relationships between view-level features. Additionally, to capture deeper features, we employ the grouping module to enhance view-level features into group-level features. Finally, the group-level ViT aggregates group-level features into complete, well-formed 3D shape descriptors. Notably, in both ViTs, we introduce spatial encoding of camera coordinates as innovative position embeddings. Furthermore, we propose two compressed versions based on GMViT, namely GMViT-simple and GMViT-mini. To enhance the training effectiveness of the small models, we introduce a knowledge distillation method throughout the GMViT process, where the key outputs of each GMViT component serve as distillation targets. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method. The large model GMViT achieves excellent 3D classification and retrieval results on the benchmark datasets ModelNet, ShapeNetCore55, and MCB. The smaller models, GMViT-simple and GMViT-mini, reduce the parameter size by 8 and 17.6 times, respectively, and improve shape recognition speed by 1.5 times on average, while preserving at least 90% of the classification and retrieval performance. The code is available at https://github.com/bigdata-graph/GMViT.</p></details> | 13pages, 8 figuers |

However, it has been found that such vision-language models lack the ability to correctly reason over spatial relationships. To tackle this shortcoming, we develop the REVISION framework which improves spatial fidelity in vision-language models. REVISION is a 3D rendering based pipeline that generates spatially accurate synthetic images, given a textual prompt. REVISION is an extendable framework, which currently supports 100+ 3D assets, 11 spatial relationships, all with diverse camera perspectives and backgrounds. Leveraging images from REVISION as additional guidance in a training-free manner consistently improves the spatial consistency of T2I models across all spatial relationships, achieving competitive performance on the VISOR and T2I-CompBench benchmarks. We also design RevQA, a question-answering benchmark to evaluate the spatial reasoning abilities of MLLMs, and find that state-of-the-art models are not robust to complex spatial reasoning under adversarial settings. Our results and findings indicate that utilizing rendering-based frameworks is an effective approach for developing spatially-aware generative models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ECCV 2024.

| **[Probabilistic Design of Multi-Dimensional Spatially-Coupled Codes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15166v4)** | 2024-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Because of their excellent asymptotic and finite-length performance, spatially-coupled (SC) codes are a class of low-density parity-check codes that is gaining increasing attention. Multi-dimensional (MD) SC codes are constructed by connecting copies of an SC code via relocations in order to mitigate various sources of non-uniformity and improve performance in many data storage and data transmission systems. As the number of degrees of freedom in the MD-SC code design increases, appropriately exploiting them becomes more difficult because of the complexity growth of the design process. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic framework for the MD-SC code design, which is based on the gradient-descent (GD) algorithm, to design better MD codes and address this challenge. In particular, we express the expected number of short cycles, which we seek to minimize, in the graph representation of the code in terms of entries of a probability-distribution matrix that characterizes the MD-SC code design. We then find a locally-optimal probability distribution, which serves as the starting point of a finite-length algorithmic optimizer that produces the final MD-SC code. We offer the theoretical analysis as well as the algorithms, and we present experimental results demonstrating that our MD codes, conveniently called GD-MD codes, have notably lower short cycle numbers compared with the available state-of-the-art. Moreover, our algorithms converge on solutions in few iterations, which confirms the complexity reduction as a result of limiting the search space via the locally-optimal GD-MD distributions.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages (double column), 5 figures, the short version has been accepted at the IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory (ISIT)</p></details> |

Multi-scale Allocentric Relational Inference from Natural Spatial Descriptions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16364v2)** | 2024-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When communicating routes in natural language, the concept of acquired spatial knowledge is crucial for geographic information retrieval (GIR) and in spatial cognitive research. However, NLP navigation studies often overlook the impact of such acquired knowledge on textual descriptions. Current navigation studies concentrate on egocentric local descriptions (e.g., `it will be on your right') that require reasoning over the agent's local perception. These instructions are typically given as a sequence of steps, with each action-step explicitly mentioning and being followed by a landmark that the agent can use to verify they are on the right path (e.g., `turn right and then you will see...'). In contrast, descriptions based on knowledge acquired through a map provide a complete view of the environment and capture its overall structure. These instructions (e.g., `it is south of Central Park and a block north of a police station') are typically non-sequential, contain allocentric relations, with multiple spatial relations and implicit actions, without any explicit verification. This paper introduces the Rendezvous (RVS) task and dataset, which includes 10,404 examples of English geospatial instructions for reaching a target location using map-knowledge. Our analysis reveals that RVS exhibits a richer use of spatial allocentric relations, and requires resolving more spatial relations simultaneously compared to previous text-based navigation benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

Long-range spatial-spectral correlation modeling is beneficial for HSI denoising but often comes with high computational complexity. Based on the state space model (SSM), Mamba is known for its remarkable long-range dependency modeling capabilities and computational efficiency. Building on this, we introduce a memory-efficient spatial-spectral UMamba (SSUMamba) for HSI denoising, with the spatial-spectral continuous scan (SSCS) Mamba being the core component. SSCS Mamba alternates the row, column, and band in six different orders to generate the sequence and uses the bidirectional SSM to exploit long-range spatial-spectral dependencies. In each order, the images are rearranged between adjacent scans to ensure spatial-spectral continuity. Additionally, 3D convolutions are embedded into the SSCS Mamba to enhance local spatial-spectral modeling. Experiments demonstrate that SSUMamba achieves superior denoising results with lower memory consumption per batch compared to transformer-based methods. The source code is available at https://github.com/lronkitty/SSUMamba.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing dimension reduction techniques do not account for the spatial correlation between observations and do not take the downstream modeling task into consideration when finding the lower-dimensional representation. We formalize the closeness of approximation to the original data and the utility of lower-dimensional scores for downstream modeling as two complementary, sometimes conflicting, metrics for dimension reduction. We illustrate how existing methodologies fall into this framework and propose a flexible dimension reduction algorithm that achieves the optimal trade-off. We derive a computationally simple form for our algorithm and illustrate its performance through simulation studies, as well as two applications in air pollution modeling and spatial transcriptomics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Design-Based Inference for Spatial Experiments under Unknown Interference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.13599v5)** | 2024-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider design-based causal inference for spatial experiments in which treatments may have effects that bleed out and feed back in complex ways. Such spatial spillover effects violate the standard ``no interference'' assumption for standard causal inference methods. The complexity of spatial spillover effects also raises the risk of misspecification and bias in model-based analyses. We offer an approach for robust inference in such settings without having to specify a parametric outcome model. We define a spatial ``average marginalized effect'' (AME) that characterizes how, in expectation, units of observation that are a specified distance from an intervention location are affected by treatment at that location, averaging over effects emanating from other intervention nodes. We show that randomization is sufficient for non-parametric identification of the AME even if the nature of interference is unknown. Under mild restrictions on the extent of interference, we establish asymptotic distributions of estimators and provide methods for both sample-theoretic and randomization-based inference. We show conditions under which the AME recovers a structural effect. We illustrate our approach with a simulation study. Then we re-analyze a randomized field experiment and a quasi-experiment on forest conservation, showing how our approach offers robust inference on policy-relevant spillover effects.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatial-Spectral Morphological Mamba for Hyperspectral Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01372v1)** | 2024-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, Transformers have garnered significant attention for Hyperspectral Image Classification (HSIC) due to their self-attention mechanism, which provides strong classification performance. However, these models face major challenges in computational efficiency, as their complexity increases quadratically with the sequence length. The Mamba architecture, leveraging a State Space Model, offers a more efficient alternative to Transformers. This paper introduces the Spatial-Spectral Morphological Mamba (MorpMamba) model. In the MorpMamba model, a token generation module first converts the Hyperspectral Image (HSI) patch into spatial-spectral tokens. These tokens are then processed by a morphology block, which computes structural and shape information using depthwise separable convolutional operations. The extracted information is enhanced in a feature enhancement module that adjusts the spatial and spectral tokens based on the center region of the HSI sample, allowing for effective information fusion within each block. Subsequently, the tokens are refined in a multi-head self-attention block to further improve the feature space. Finally, the combined information is fed into the state space block for classification and the creation of the ground truth map. Experiments on widely used Hyperspectral (HS) datasets demonstrate that the MorpMamba model outperforms (parametric efficiency) both CNN and Transformer models.</p></details> |  |

Despite the advancements in Deep Learning (DL) and Transformer architectures for HSI Classification (HSIC), challenges such as computational efficiency and the need for extensive labeled data persist. This paper introduces WaveMamba, a novel approach that integrates wavelet transformation with the Spatial-Spectral Mamba architecture to enhance HSIC. WaveMamba captures both local texture patterns and global contextual relationships in an end-to-end trainable model. The Wavelet-based enhanced features are then processed through the state-space architecture to model spatial-spectral relationships and temporal dependencies. The experimental results indicate that WaveMamba surpasses existing models, achieving an accuracy improvement of 4.5\% on the University of Houston dataset and a 2.0\% increase on the Pavia University dataset. These findings validate its effectiveness in addressing the complex data interactions inherent in HSIs.</p></details> |  |

However, traditional Mamba models overlook rich spectral information in HSIs and struggle with high dimensionality and sequential data. To address these issues, we propose the SSM with multi-head self-attention and token enhancement (MHSSMamba). This model integrates spectral and spatial information by enhancing spectral tokens and using multi-head attention to capture complex relationships between spectral bands and spatial locations. It also manages long-range dependencies and the sequential nature of HSI data, preserving contextual information across spectral bands. MHSSMamba achieved remarkable classification accuracies of 97.62\% on Pavia University, 96.92\% on the University of Houston, 96.85\% on Salinas, and 99.49\% on Wuhan-longKou datasets.</p></details> |  |

Several challenges exist for pedestrian detection in autonomous driving applications. First, it is difficult to perform accurate detection using RGB cameras under dark or low-light conditions. Cross-spectral systems must be developed to integrate complementary information from multiple sensor modalities, such as thermal and visible cameras, to improve the robustness of the detections. Second, pedestrian detection models are latency-sensitive. Efficient and easy-to-scale detection models with fewer parameters are highly desirable for real-time applications such as autonomous driving. Third, pedestrian video data provides spatial-temporal correlations of pedestrian movement. It is beneficial to incorporate temporal as well as spatial information to enhance pedestrian detection. This work leverages recent advances in the state space model (Mamba) and proposes a novel Multi-head Hierarchical Patching and Aggregation (MHHPA) structure to extract both fine-grained and coarse-grained information from both RGB and thermal imagery. Experimental results show that the proposed MHHPA is an effective and efficient alternative to a Transformer model for cross-spectral pedestrian detection. Our proposed model also achieves superior performance on small-scale pedestrian detection.

Unfortunately, the existing Transformer-based methods mainly focus on non-local modeling, neglecting the importance of locality in image denoising. Moreover, deep learning methods employ complex spectral learning mechanisms, thus introducing large computation costs. To address these problems, we propose a hybrid spatial-spectral denoising network (HSSD), in which we design a novel hybrid dual-path network inspired by CNN and Transformer characteristics, leading to capturing both local and non-local spatial details while suppressing noise efficiently. Furthermore, to reduce computational complexity, we adopt a simple but effective decoupling strategy that disentangles the learning of space and spectral channels, where multilayer perception with few parameters is utilized to learn the global correlations among spectra. The synthetic and real experiments demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods on spatial and spectral reconstruction.

There have been consistent efforts in studying how to effectively utilize the associated spatial information for refining gene expression modeling. We introduce a class of distance-preserving generative models for spatial transcriptomics, which utilizes the provided spatial information to regularize the learned representation space of gene expressions to have a similar pair-wise distance structure. This helps the latent space to capture meaningful encodings of genes in spatial proximity. We carry out theoretical analysis over a tractable loss function for this purpose and formalize the overall learning objective as a regularized evidence lower bound. Our framework grants compatibility with any variational-inference-based generative models for gene expression modeling. Empirically, we validate our proposed method on the mouse brain tissues Visium dataset and observe improved performance with variational autoencoders and scVI used as backbone models.</p></details> |  |

Although existing CNN and Transformer-based methods have proven effective, CNNs are limited by their inadequate modeling of long-range dependencies, while Transformer ones face high computational costs due to quadratic complexity. Recent Mamba models have demonstrated superior performance over CNN and Transformer-based architectures in some visual tasks, but these models have not fully utilized the local similarities in both spatial and spectral dimensions. Moreover, the long-sequence modeling capability of SSM may offer an advantage in processing the numerous spectral bands for HSI reconstruction, which has not yet been explored. In this paper, we introduce a State Space Model with Across-Scanning and Local Enhancement, named ASLE-SSM, that employs a Spatial-Spectral SSM for global-local balanced context encoding and cross-channel interaction promoting. Specifically, we introduce local scanning in the spatial dimension to balance the global and local receptive fields, and then propose our across-scanning method based on spatial-spectral local cubes to leverage local similarities between adjacent spectral bands and pixels to guide the reconstruction process. These two scanning mechanisms extract the HSI's local features while balancing the global perspective without any additional costs. Experimental results illustrate ASLE-SSM's superiority over existing state-of-the-art methods, with an inference speed 2.4 times faster than Transformer-based MST and saving 0.12 (M) of parameters, achieving the lowest computational cost and parameter count.</p></details> | 12 pages,6 figures |

Most importantly, these forecasts are essential for the operational management of power plants, ensuring supply security and grid stability, and in guiding energy trading and investment decisions. The primary challenge for this forecasting task lies in disentangling the multifaceted drivers of load, which include national deterministic (daily, weekly, annual, and holiday patterns) and national stochastic weather and autoregressive effects. Additionally, transnational stochastic socio-economic and political effects add further complexity, in particular, due to their non-stationarity. To address this challenge, we present an interpretable probabilistic mid-term forecasting model for the hourly load that captures, besides all deterministic effects, the various uncertainties in load. This model recognizes transnational dependencies across 24 European countries, with multivariate modeled socio-economic and political states and cross-country dependent forecasting. Built from interpretable Generalized Additive Models (GAMs), the model enables an analysis of the transmission of each incorporated effect to the hour-specific load. Our findings highlight the vulnerability of countries reliant on electric heating under extreme weather scenarios. This emphasizes the need for high-resolution forecasting of weather effects on pan-European electricity consumption especially in anticipation of widespread electric heating adoption.</p></details> |  |

Simultaneously, advances in imaging AI have enabled extraction of morphological features describing the tissue. The intersection of spatial omics and imaging AI presents opportunities for a more holistic understanding. In this review we introduce a framework for categorizing spatial omics-morphology combination methods, focusing on how morphological features can be translated or integrated into spatial omics analyses. By translation we mean finding morphological features that spatially correlate with gene expression patterns with the purpose of predicting gene expression. Such features can be used to generate super-resolution gene expression maps or infer genetic information from clinical H&E-stained samples. By integration we mean finding morphological features that spatially complement gene expression patterns with the purpose of enriching information. Such features can be used to define spatial domains, especially where gene expression has preceded morphological changes and where morphology remains after gene expression. We discuss learning strategies and directions for further development of the field.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spectral-Spatial Mamba for Hyperspectral Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18401v3)** | 2024-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, deep learning models have achieved excellent performance in hyperspectral image (HSI) classification. Among the many deep models, Transformer has gradually attracted interest for its excellence in modeling the long-range dependencies of spatial-spectral features in HSI. However, Transformer has the problem of quadratic computational complexity due to the self-attention mechanism, which is heavier than other models and thus has limited adoption in HSI processing. Fortunately, the recently emerging state space model-based Mamba shows great computational efficiency while achieving the modeling power of Transformers. Therefore, in this paper, we make a preliminary attempt to apply the Mamba to HSI classification, leading to the proposed spectral-spatial Mamba (SS-Mamba). Specifically, the proposed SS-Mamba mainly consists of spectral-spatial token generation module and several stacked spectral-spatial Mamba blocks. Firstly, the token generation module converts any given HSI cube to spatial and spectral tokens as sequences. And then these tokens are sent to stacked spectral-spatial mamba blocks (SS-MB). Each SS-MB block consists of two basic mamba blocks and a spectral-spatial feature enhancement module. The spatial and spectral tokens are processed separately by the two basic mamba blocks, respectively. Besides, the feature enhancement module modulates spatial and spectral tokens using HSI sample's center region information. In this way, the spectral and spatial tokens cooperate with each other and achieve information fusion within each block. The experimental results conducted on widely used HSI datasets reveal that the proposed model achieves competitive results compared with the state-of-the-art methods. The Mamba-based method opens a new window for HSI classification.</p></details> | 23 pages |

The spatial structure and geometry of the data significantly impact valid statistical inference. Existing models for areal data often rely on adjacency matrices, struggling to differentiate between polygons of varying sizes and shapes. Conversely, data fusion models, while effective, rely on computationally intensive numerical integrals, presenting challenges for moderately large datasets. In response to these issues, we propose the Hausdorff-Gaussian process (HGP), a versatile model class utilizing the Hausdorff distance to capture spatial dependence in both point and areal data. We introduce a valid correlation function within the HGP framework, accommodating diverse modeling techniques, including geostatistical and areal models. Integration into generalized linear mixed-effects models enhances its applicability, particularly in addressing change of support and data fusion challenges. We validate our approach through a comprehensive simulation study and application to two real-world scenarios: one involving areal data and another demonstrating its effectiveness in data fusion. The results suggest that the HGP is competitive with specialized models regarding goodness-of-fit and prediction performances.

We propose a novel machine learning (ML) framework that integrates spatial extreme-value theory to model weather extremes and to quantify probabilities associated with the occurrence, intensity, and spatial extent of these events. Our approach employs new loss functions adapted to extreme values, enabling our model to prioritize the tail rather than the bulk of the data distribution. Applied to a case study of Western European summertime heat extremes, we use daily 500-hPa geopotential height fields and local soil moisture as predictors to capture the complex interplay between local and remote physical processes. Our generative model reveals the importance of individual circulation features in determining different facets of heat extremes, thereby enriching our process understanding from a data-driven perspective. The occurrence, intensity, and spatial extent of heat extremes are sensitive to the relative position of upper-level ridges and troughs that are part of a large-scale wave pattern. Our approach is able to extrapolate beyond the range of the data to make risk-related probabilistic statements. It applies more generally to other weather extremes and offers an attractive alternative to traditional physical and ML-based techniques that focus less on the extremal aspects of weather data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatial Transformer Network YOLO Model for Agricultural Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21652v1)** | 2024-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Object detection plays a crucial role in the field of computer vision by autonomously identifying and locating objects of interest. The You Only Look Once (YOLO) model is an effective single-shot detector. However, YOLO faces challenges in cluttered or partially occluded scenes and can struggle with small, low-contrast objects. We propose a new method that integrates spatial transformer networks (STNs) into YOLO to improve performance. The proposed STN-YOLO aims to enhance the model's effectiveness by focusing on important areas of the image and improving the spatial invariance of the model before the detection process. Our proposed method improved object detection performance both qualitatively and quantitatively. We explore the impact of different localization networks within the STN module as well as the robustness of the model across different spatial transformations. We apply the STN-YOLO on benchmark datasets for Agricultural object detection as well as a new dataset from a state-of-the-art plant phenotyping greenhouse facility. Our code and dataset are publicly available.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 5 figures, submitted for review</p></details> |
| **[Grid-Based Decompositions for Spatial Data under Local Differential Privacy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21624v1)** | 2024-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Local differential privacy (LDP) has recently emerged as a popular privacy standard. With the growing popularity of LDP, several recent works have applied LDP to spatial data, and grid-based decompositions have been a common building block in the collection and analysis of spatial data under DP and LDP. In this paper, we study three grid-based decomposition methods for spatial data under LDP: Uniform Grid (UG), PrivAG, and AAG. UG is a static approach that consists of equal-sized cells. To enable data-dependent decomposition, PrivAG was proposed by Yang et al. as the most recent adaptive grid method. To advance the state-of-the-art in adaptive grids, in this paper we propose the Advanced Adaptive Grid (AAG) method. For each grid cell, following the intuition that the cell's intra-cell density distribution will be affected by its neighbors, AAG performs uneven cell divisions depending on the neighboring cells' densities. We experimentally compare UG, PrivAG, and AAG using three real-world location datasets, varying privacy budgets, and query sizes. Results show that AAG provides higher utility than PrivAG, demonstrating the superiority of our proposed approach. Furthermore, UG's performance is heavily dependent on the choice of grid size. When the grid size is chosen optimally in UG, AAG still beats UG for small queries, but UG beats AAG for large (coarse-grained) queries.</p></details> |  |
| **[Skeleton-Based Action Recognition with Spatial-Structural Graph Convolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21525v1)** | 2024-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human Activity Recognition (HAR) is a field of study that focuses on identifying and classifying human activities. Skeleton-based Human Activity Recognition has received much attention in recent years, where Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) based method is widely used and has achieved remarkable results. However, the representation of skeleton data and the issue of over-smoothing in GCN still need to be studied. 1). Compared to central nodes, edge nodes can only aggregate limited neighbor information, and different edge nodes of the human body are always structurally related. However, the information from edge nodes is crucial for fine-grained activity recognition. 2). The Graph Convolutional Network suffers from a significant over-smoothing issue, causing nodes to become increasingly similar as the number of network layers increases. Based on these two ideas, we propose a two-stream graph convolution method called Spatial-Structural GCN (SpSt-GCN). Spatial GCN performs information aggregation based on the topological structure of the human body, and structural GCN performs differentiation based on the similarity of edge node sequences. The spatial connection is fixed, and the human skeleton naturally maintains this topology regardless of the actions performed by humans. However, the structural connection is dynamic and depends on the type of movement the human body is performing. Based on this idea, we also propose an entirely data-driven structural connection, which greatly increases flexibility. We evaluate our method on two large-scale datasets, i.e., NTU RGB+D and NTU RGB+D 120. The proposed method achieves good results while being efficient.</p></details> |  |

To address this pressing need, we introduce GeoText-1652, a new natural language-guided geo-localization benchmark. This dataset is systematically constructed through an interactive human-computer process leveraging Large Language Model (LLM) driven annotation techniques in conjunction with pre-trained vision models. GeoText-1652 extends the established University-1652 image dataset with spatial-aware text annotations, thereby establishing one-to-one correspondences between image, text, and bounding box elements. We further introduce a new optimization objective to leverage fine-grained spatial associations, called blending spatial matching, for region-level spatial relation matching. Extensive experiments reveal that our approach maintains a competitive recall rate comparing other prevailing cross-modality methods. This underscores the promising potential of our approach in elevating drone control and navigation through the seamless integration of natural language commands in real-world scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ECCV 2024</p></details> |

Egocentric spatial images and videos are emerging as a compelling form of stereoscopic XR content. Different from traditional 2D images, egocentric spatial images present challenges for perceptual quality assessment due to their special shooting, processing methods, and stereoscopic characteristics. However, the corresponding image quality assessment (IQA) research for egocentric spatial images is still lacking. In this paper, we establish the Egocentric Spatial Images Quality Assessment Database (ESIQAD), the first IQA database dedicated for egocentric spatial images as far as we know. Our ESIQAD includes 500 egocentric spatial images, containing 400 images captured with the Apple Vision Pro and 100 images generated via an iPhone's "Spatial Camera" app. The corresponding mean opinion scores (MOSs) are collected under three viewing modes, including 2D display, 3D-window display, and 3D-immersive display. Furthermore, based on our database, we conduct a benchmark experiment and evaluate the performance of 22 state-of-the-art IQA models under three different viewing modes. We hope this research can facilitate future IQA research on egocentric spatial images. The database is available at https://github.com/IntMeGroup/ESIQA.</p></details> | 8 pages, 8 figures |
| **[STUPD: A Synthetic Dataset for Spatial and Temporal Relation Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06680v2)** | 2024-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding relations between objects is crucial for understanding the semantics of a visual scene. It is also an essential step in order to bridge visual and language models. However, current state-of-the-art computer vision models still lack the ability to perform spatial reasoning well. Existing datasets mostly cover a relatively small number of spatial relations, all of which are static relations that do not intrinsically involve motion. In this paper, we propose the Spatial and Temporal Understanding of Prepositions Dataset (STUPD) -- a large-scale video dataset for understanding static and dynamic spatial relationships derived from prepositions of the English language. The dataset contains 150K visual depictions (videos and images), consisting of 30 distinct spatial prepositional senses, in the form of object interaction simulations generated synthetically using Unity3D. In addition to spatial relations, we also propose 50K visual depictions across 10 temporal relations, consisting of videos depicting event/time-point interactions. To our knowledge, no dataset exists that represents temporal relations through visual settings. In this dataset, we also provide 3D information about object interactions such as frame-wise coordinates, and descriptions of the objects used. The goal of this synthetic dataset is to help models perform better in visual relationship detection in real-world settings. We demonstrate an increase in the performance of various models over 2 real-world datasets (ImageNet-VidVRD and Spatial Senses) when pretrained on the STUPD dataset, in comparison to other pretraining datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[High-Resolution Spatial Transcriptomics from Histology Images using HisToSGE](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20518v1)** | 2024-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial transcriptomics (ST) is a groundbreaking genomic technology that enables spatial localization analysis of gene expression within tissue sections. However, it is significantly limited by high costs and sparse spatial resolution. An alternative, more cost-effective strategy is to use deep learning methods to predict high-density gene expression profiles from histological images. However, existing methods struggle to capture rich image features effectively or rely on low-dimensional positional coordinates, making it difficult to accurately predict high-resolution gene expression profiles. To address these limitations, we developed HisToSGE, a method that employs a Pathology Image Large Model (PILM) to extract rich image features from histological images and utilizes a feature learning module to robustly generate high-resolution gene expression profiles. We evaluated HisToSGE on four ST datasets, comparing its performance with five state-of-the-art baseline methods. The results demonstrate that HisToSGE excels in generating high-resolution gene expression profiles and performing downstream tasks such as spatial domain identification. All code and public datasets used in this paper are available at https://github.com/wenwenmin/HisToSGE and https://zenodo.org/records/12792163.</p></details> |  |

Despite this, the application of SNNs in graph representation learning, particularly for non-Euclidean data, remains underexplored, and the influence of spiking dynamics on graph learning is not yet fully understood. This work seeks to address these gaps by examining the unique properties and benefits of spiking dynamics in enhancing graph representation learning. We propose a spike-based graph neural network model that incorporates spiking dynamics, enhanced by a novel spatial-temporal feature normalization (STFN) technique, to improve training efficiency and model stability. Our detailed analysis explores the impact of rate coding and temporal coding on SNN performance, offering new insights into their advantages for deep graph networks and addressing challenges such as the oversmoothing problem. Experimental results demonstrate that our SNN models can achieve competitive performance with state-of-the-art graph neural networks (GNNs) while considerably reducing computational costs, highlighting the potential of SNNs for efficient neuromorphic computing applications in complex graph-based scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Two-stage Estimators for Spatial Confounding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09358v2)** | 2024-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Public health data are often spatially dependent, but standard spatial regression methods can suffer from bias and invalid inference when the independent variable is associated with spatially-correlated residuals. This could occur if, for example, there is an unmeasured environmental contaminant associated with the independent and outcome variables in a spatial regression analysis. Geoadditive structural equation modeling (gSEM), in which an estimated spatial trend is removed from both the explanatory and response variables before estimating the parameters of interest, has previously been proposed as a solution, but there has been little investigation of gSEM's properties with point-referenced data. We link gSEM to results on double machine learning and semiparametric regression based on two-stage procedures. We propose using these semiparametric estimators for spatial regression using Gaussian processes with Mat\`ern covariance to estimate the spatial trends, and term this class of estimators Double Spatial Regression (DSR). We derive regularity conditions for root-$n$ asymptotic normality and consistency and closed-form variance estimation, and show that in simulations where standard spatial regression estimators are highly biased and have poor coverage, DSR can mitigate bias more effectively than competitors and obtain nominal coverage.</p></details> |  |

This capability is crucial for mobile robots to have reliable navigation, build accurate maps, and have precise behaviors around human collaborators. This paper focuses on the development of robust short-term relocalization capabilities for mobile robots using a monocular camera system. A novel multimodal keyframe descriptor is introduced, that contains semantic information of objects detected in the environment and the spatial information of the camera. Using this descriptor, a new Keyframe-based Place Recognition (KPR) method is proposed that is formulated as a multi-stage keyframe filtering algorithm, leading to a new relocalization pipeline for MKVSLAM systems. The proposed approach is evaluated over several indoor GPS denied datasets and demonstrates accurate pose recovery, in comparison to a bag-of-words approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, Keywords: VSLAM, Localization, Semantics.

Existing solutions primarily rely on the RGB modality, which encounters challenges such as background variations, occlusions, motion blurs, and significant computational overhead. Meanwhile, current keypoint-based methods offer a lightweight and informative representation of human motions but necessitate accurate individual annotations and specialized interaction reasoning modules. To address these limitations, we design a panoramic graph that incorporates multi-person skeletons and objects to encapsulate group activity, offering an effective alternative to RGB video. This panoramic graph enables Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) to unify intra-person, inter-person, and person-object interactive modeling through spatial-temporal graph convolutions. In practice, we develop a novel pipeline that extracts skeleton coordinates using pose estimation and tracking algorithms and employ Multi-person Panoramic GCN (MP-GCN) to predict group activities. Extensive experiments on Volleyball and NBA datasets demonstrate that the MP-GCN achieves state-of-the-art performance in both accuracy and efficiency. Notably, our method outperforms RGB-based approaches by using only estimated 2D keypoints as input. Code is available at https://github.com/mgiant/MP-GCN</p></details> |  |
| **[Privacy-Protected Spatial Autoregressive Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16773v2)** | 2024-07-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial autoregressive (SAR) models are important tools for studying network effects. However, with an increasing emphasis on data privacy, data providers often implement privacy protection measures that make classical SAR models inapplicable. In this study, we introduce a privacy-protected SAR model with noise-added response and covariates to meet privacy-protection requirements. However, in this scenario, the traditional quasi-maximum likelihood estimator becomes infeasible because the likelihood function cannot be directly formulated. To address this issue, we first consider an explicit expression for the likelihood function with only noise-added responses. Then, we develop techniques to correct the biases for derivatives introduced by noise. Correspondingly, a Newton-Raphson-type algorithm is proposed to obtain the estimator, leading to a corrected likelihood estimator. To further enhance computational efficiency, we introduce a corrected least squares estimator based on the idea of bias correction. These two estimation methods ensure both data security and the attainment of statistically valid estimators. Theoretical analysis of both estimators is carefully conducted, statistical inference methods and model extensions are discussed. The finite sample performances of different methods are demonstrated through extensive simulations and the analysis of a real dataset.</p></details> |  |
| **[Assessing Spatial Disparities: A Bayesian Linear Regression Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19171v1)** | 2024-07-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Epidemiological investigations of regionally aggregated spatial data often involve detecting spatial health disparities between neighboring regions on a map of disease mortality or incidence rates. Analyzing such data introduces spatial dependence among the health outcomes and seeks to report statistically significant spatial disparities by delineating boundaries that separate neighboring regions with widely disparate health outcomes. However, current statistical methods are often inadequate for appropriately defining what constitutes a spatial disparity and for constructing rankings of posterior probabilities that are robust under changes to such a definition. More specifically, non-parametric Bayesian approaches endow spatial effects with discrete probability distributions using Dirichlet processes, or generalizations thereof, and rely upon computationally intensive methods for inferring on weakly identified parameters. In this manuscript, we introduce a Bayesian linear regression framework to detect spatial health disparities. This enables us to exploit Bayesian conjugate posterior distributions in a more accessible manner and accelerate computation significantly over existing Bayesian non-parametric approaches. Simulation experiments conducted over a county map of the entire United States demonstrate the effectiveness of our method and we apply our method to a data set from the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) on age-standardized US county-level estimates of mortality rates across tracheal, bronchus, and lung cancer.</p></details> | 54 pages, 8 figures |

Unlike existing techniques that take multiple manual steps to derive standardized skeleton representations as model input, we propose a novel Spatial-Temporal Mesh Transformer (STMT) to directly model the mesh sequences. The model uses a hierarchical transformer with intra-frame off-set attention and inter-frame self-attention. The attention mechanism allows the model to freely attend between any two vertex patches to learn non-local relationships in the spatial-temporal domain. Masked vertex modeling and future frame prediction are used as two self-supervised tasks to fully activate the bi-directional and auto-regressive attention in our hierarchical transformer. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to skeleton-based and point-cloud-based models on common MoCap benchmarks.

However, conventional forecasting models encounter significant challenges in precisely predicting wind conditions at high spatial resolutions for individual locations or small geographical areas (< 20 km2) and capturing medium to long-range temporal trends and comprehensive spatio-temporal patterns. This study focuses on a spatial temporal approach for high-resolution gridded wind forecasting at the height of 3 and 10 metres across large areas of the Southwest of Western Australia to overcome these challenges. The model utilises the data that covers a broad geographic area and harnesses a diverse array of meteorological factors, including terrain characteristics, air pressure, 10-metre wind forecasts from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, and limited observation data from sparsely distributed weather stations (such as 3-metre wind profiles, humidity, and temperature), the model demonstrates promising advancements in wind forecasting accuracy and reliability across the entire region of interest. This paper shows the potential of our machine learning model for wind forecasts across various prediction horizons and spatial coverage. It can help facilitate more informed decision-making and enhance resilience across critical sectors.</p></details> |  |

| **[Weakly Supervised Video Anomaly Detection and Localization with Spatio-Temporal Prompts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05905v1)** | 2024-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current weakly supervised video anomaly detection (WSVAD) task aims to achieve frame-level anomalous event detection with only coarse video-level annotations available. Existing works typically involve extracting global features from full-resolution video frames and training frame-level classifiers to detect anomalies in the temporal dimension. However, most anomalous events tend to occur in localized spatial regions rather than the entire video frames, which implies existing frame-level feature based works may be misled by the dominant background information and lack the interpretation of the detected anomalies. To address this dilemma, this paper introduces a novel method called STPrompt that learns spatio-temporal prompt embeddings for weakly supervised video anomaly detection and localization (WSVADL) based on pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs). Our proposed method employs a two-stream network structure, with one stream focusing on the temporal dimension and the other primarily on the spatial dimension. By leveraging the learned knowledge from pre-trained VLMs and incorporating natural motion priors from raw videos, our model learns prompt embeddings that are aligned with spatio-temporal regions of videos (e.g., patches of individual frames) for identify specific local regions of anomalies, enabling accurate video anomaly detection while mitigating the influence of background information. Without relying on detailed spatio-temporal annotations or auxiliary object detection/tracking, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on three public benchmarks for the WSVADL task.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACMMM2024</p></details> |

Considering the spatio-temporal nature of EEG data, one of our frameworks is based on a CNN-BiLSTM model. The other involves a CNN-Transformer architecture which inherently involves the more versatile attention based learning paradigm. In both cases, a special 1D-CNN feature extraction module is used to generate the initial embeddings with 1D convolutions in the time and the EEG channel domains. Considering the EEG signals are noisy, non stationary and the discriminative features are even less clear (than in semantically structured data such as text or image), we also follow a window-based classification followed by majority voting during inference, to yield labels at a signal level. To illustrate how brain patterns correlate with different image classes, we visualize t-SNE plots of the BiLSTM embeddings alongside brain activation maps for the top 10 classes. These visualizations provide insightful revelations into the distinct neural signatures associated with each visual category, showcasing the BiLSTM's capability to capture and represent the discriminative brain activity linked to visual stimuli. We demonstrate the performance of our approach on the updated EEG-Imagenet dataset with positive comparisons with state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper has been submitted at ICPR 2024.

However, existing transformer-based methods primarily use self-attention mechanisms for spatio-temporal modeling, leading to a quadratic complexity, unidirectional modeling of spatio-temporal relationships, and insufficient learning of spatial-temporal correlations. Recently, the Mamba architecture, utilizing the state space model (SSM), has exhibited superior long-range modeling capabilities in a variety of vision tasks with linear complexity. In this paper, we propose PoseMamba, a novel purely SSM-based approach with linear complexity for 3D human pose estimation in monocular video. Specifically, we propose a bidirectional global-local spatio-temporal SSM block that comprehensively models human joint relations within individual frames as well as temporal correlations across frames. Within this bidirectional global-local spatio-temporal SSM block, we introduce a reordering strategy to enhance the local modeling capability of the SSM. This strategy provides a more logical geometric scanning order and integrates it with the global SSM, resulting in a combined global-local spatial scan. We have quantitatively and qualitatively evaluated our approach using two benchmark datasets: Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PoseMamba achieves state-of-the-art performance on both datasets while maintaining a smaller model size and reducing computational costs. The code and models will be released.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatio-Temporal Adaptive Diffusion Models for EEG Super-Resolution in Epilepsy Diagnosis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03089v3)** | 2024-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Electroencephalogram (EEG) technology, particularly high-density EEG (HD EEG) devices, is widely used in fields such as neuroscience. HD EEG devices improve the spatial resolution of EEG by placing more electrodes on the scalp, meeting the requirements of clinical diagnostic applications such as epilepsy focus localization. However, this technique faces challenges such as high acquisition costs and limited usage scenarios. In this paper, spatio-temporal adaptive diffusion models (STADMs) are proposed to pioneer the use of diffusion models for achieving spatial SR reconstruction from low-resolution (LR, 64 channels or fewer) EEG to high-resolution (HR, 256 channels) EEG. Specifically, a spatio-temporal condition module is designed to extract the spatio-temporal features of LR EEG, which then serve as conditional inputs to guide the reverse denoising process of diffusion models. Additionally, a multi-scale Transformer denoising module is constructed to leverage multi-scale convolution blocks and cross-attention-based diffusion Transformer blocks for conditional guidance to generate subject-adaptive SR EEG. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively enhances the spatial resolution of LR EEG and quantitatively outperforms existing methods. Furthermore, STADMs demonstrate their value by applying synthetic SR EEG to classification and source localization tasks of epilepsy patients, indicating their potential to significantly improve the spatial resolution of LR EEG.</p></details> |  |
| **[SpecSTG: A Fast Spectral Diffusion Framework for Probabilistic Spatio-Temporal Traffic Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08119v3)** | 2024-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic forecasting, a crucial application of spatio-temporal graph (STG) learning, has traditionally relied on deterministic models for accurate point estimations. Yet, these models fall short of quantifying future uncertainties. Recently, many probabilistic methods, especially variants of diffusion models, have been proposed to fill this gap. However, existing diffusion methods typically deal with individual sensors separately when generating future time series, resulting in limited usage of spatial information in the probabilistic learning process. In this work, we propose SpecSTG, a novel spectral diffusion framework, to better leverage spatial dependencies and systematic patterns inherent in traffic data. More specifically, our method generates the Fourier representation of future time series, transforming the learning process into the spectral domain enriched with spatial information. Additionally, our approach incorporates a fast spectral graph convolution designed for Fourier input, alleviating the computational burden associated with existing models. Compared with state-of-the-arts, SpecSTG achieves up to 8% improvements on point estimations and up to 0.78% improvements on quantifying future uncertainties. Furthermore, SpecSTG's training and validation speed is 3.33X of the most efficient existing diffusion method for STG forecasting. The source code for SpecSTG is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/SpecSTG.</p></details> |  |

However, acquiring high-resolution MRI typically extends scan time, which can introduce motion artifacts. Super-resolution of MRI therefore emerges as a promising approach to mitigate these challenges. Earlier studies have investigated the use of multiple contrasts for MRI super-resolution (MCSR), whereas majority of them did not fully exploit the rich contrast-invariant structural information. To fully utilize such crucial prior knowledge of multi-contrast MRI, in this work, we propose a novel structure-guided MCSR (SGSR) framework based on a new spatio-frequency co-query attention (CQA) mechanism. Specifically, CQA performs attention on features of multiple contrasts with a shared structural query, which is particularly designed to extract, fuse, and refine the common structures from different contrasts. We further propose a novel frequency-domain CQA module in addition to the spatial domain, to enable more fine-grained structural refinement. Extensive experiments on fastMRI knee data and low-field brain MRI show that SGSR outperforms state-of-the-art MCSR methods with statistical significance.</p></details> | <details><summary>The 1...</summary><p>The 15th International Workshop on Machine Learning in Medical Imaging (MLMI 2024)</p></details> |
| **[Spatio-Temporal Communication Compression in Distributed Prime-Dual Flows](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02332v1)** | 2024-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we study distributed prime-dual flows for multi-agent optimization with spatio-temporal compressions. The central aim of multi-agent optimization is for a network of agents to collaboratively solve a system-level optimization problem with local objective functions and node-to-node communication by distributed algorithms. The scalability of such algorithms crucially depends on the complexity of the communication messages, and a number of communication compressors for distributed optimization have recently been proposed in the literature. First of all, we introduce a general spatio-temporal compressor characterized by the stability of the resulting dynamical system along the vector field of the compressor. We show that several important distributed optimization compressors such as the greedy sparsifier, the uniform quantizer, and the scalarizer all fall into the category of this spatio-temporal compressor. Next, we propose two distributed prime-dual flows with the spatio-temporal compressors being applied to local node states and local error states, respectively, and prove (exponential) convergence of the node trajectories to the global optimizer for (strongly) convex cost functions. Finally, a few numerical examples are present to illustrate our theoretical results.</p></details> |  |

Most existing studies show satisfying performance under regular scenarios, but most neglected safety-critical scenarios. In this study, a spatio-temporal dual-encoder network named STDA for safety-critical scenarios was developed. Considering the exceptional capabilities of human drivers in terms of situational awareness and comprehending risks, driver attention was incorporated into STDA to facilitate swift identification of the critical regions, which is expected to improve both performance and interpretability. STDA contains four parts: the driver attention prediction module, which predicts driver attention; the fusion module designed to fuse the features between driver attention and raw images; the temporary encoder module used to enhance the capability to interpret dynamic scenes; and the behavior prediction module to predict the behavior. The experiment data are used to train and validate the model. The results show that STDA improves the G-mean from 0.659 to 0.719 when incorporating driver attention and adopting a temporal encoder module. In addition, extensive experimentation has been conducted to validate that the proposed module exhibits robust generalization capabilities and can be seamlessly integrated into other mainstream models.</p></details> |  |

This study, part of the European LAMASUS (Land Management for Sustainability) project, aims to support the EU's climate neutrality target by developing a governance model through collaboration between policymakers, land users, and researchers. We present a methodological synthesis for treating land use data using a Bayesian approach within spatial and spatio-temporal modeling frameworks. The study tackles the challenges of analyzing land use changes, particularly the presence of zero values and computational issues with large datasets. It introduces joint model structures to address zeros and employs sequential inference and consensus methods for Big Data problems. Spatial downscaling models approximate smaller scales from aggregated data, circumventing high-resolution data complications. We explore Beta regression and Compositional Data Analysis (CoDa) for land use data, review relevant spatial and spatio-temporal models, and present strategies for handling zeros. The paper demonstrates the implementation of key models, downscaling techniques, and solutions to Big Data challenges with examples from simulated data and the LAMASUS project, providing a comprehensive framework for understanding and managing land use changes.</p></details> | 29 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Spatio-Temporal Partial Sensing Forecast for Long-term Traffic](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02689v1)** | 2024-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic forecasting uses recent measurements by sensors installed at chosen locations to forecast the future road traffic. Existing work either assumes all locations are equipped with sensors or focuses on short-term forecast. This paper studies partial sensing traffic forecast of long-term traffic, assuming sensors only at some locations. The study is important in lowering the infrastructure investment cost in traffic management since deploying sensors at all locations could incur prohibitively high cost. However, the problem is challenging due to the unknown distribution at unsensed locations, the intricate spatio-temporal correlation in long-term forecasting, as well as noise in data and irregularities in traffic patterns (e.g., road closure). We propose a Spatio-Temporal Partial Sensing (STPS) forecast model for long-term traffic prediction, with several novel contributions, including a rank-based embedding technique to capture irregularities and overcome noise, a spatial transfer matrix to overcome the spatial distribution shift from permanently sensed locations to unsensed locations, and a multi-step training process that utilizes all available data to successively refine the model parameters for better accuracy. Extensive experiments on several real-world traffic datasets demonstrate that STPS outperforms the state-of-the-art and achieves superior accuracy in partial sensing long-term forecasting.</p></details> |  |

However, their predictive distribution is not generally known. Under this modeling assumption, we define a novel spatio-temporal embedding and a theory-guided machine learning approach that employs a generalized Bayesian algorithm to make ensemble forecasts. We use Lipschitz predictors and determine fixed-time and any-time PAC Bayesian bounds in the batch learning setting. Performing causal forecast is a highlight of our methodology as its potential application to data with spatial and temporal short and long-range dependence. We then test the performance of our learning methodology by using linear predictors and data sets simulated from a spatio-temporal Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process.</p></details> |  |
| **[SARN: Structurally-Aware Recurrent Network for Spatio-Temporal Disaggregation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07292v4)** | 2024-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open data is frequently released spatially aggregated, usually to comply with privacy policies. But coarse, heterogeneous aggregations complicate learning and integration for downstream AI/ML systems. In this work, we consider models to disaggregate spatio-temporal data from a low-resolution, irregular partition (e.g., census tract) to a high-resolution, irregular partition (e.g., city block). We propose an overarching model named the Structurally-Aware Recurrent Network (SARN), which integrates structurally-aware spatial attention (SASA) layers into the Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) model. The spatial attention layers capture spatial interactions among regions, while the gated recurrent module captures the temporal dependencies. Each SASA layer calculates both global and structural attention -- global attention facilitates comprehensive interactions between different geographic levels, while structural attention leverages the containment relationship between different geographic levels (e.g., a city block being wholly contained within a census tract) to ensure coherent and consistent results. For scenarios with limited historical training data, we explore transfer learning and show that a model pre-trained on one city variable can be fine-tuned for another city variable using only a few hundred samples. Evaluating these techniques on two mobility datasets, we find that on both datasets, SARN significantly outperforms other neural models (5% and 1%) and typical heuristic methods (40% and 14%), enabling us to generate realistic, high-quality fine-grained data for downstream applications.</p></details> |  |

Different from conventional approaches that statically estimate fetal brain motions from pairs of images, our method dynamically tracks the rigid movement patterns of the fetal head across temporal and spatial dimensions. Specifically, we first develop an equivariant neural network that efficiently learns rigid motion sequences through low-dimensional spatial representations of images. Subsequently, we learn spatio-temporal representations by incorporating time encoding and self-attention neural network layers. This approach allows for the capture of long-term dependencies of fetal brain motion and addresses alignment errors due to contrast changes and severe motion artifacts. Our model also provides a geometric deformation estimation that properly addresses image distortions among all time frames. To the best of our knowledge, our approach is the first to learn spatial-temporal representations via deep neural networks for fetal motion tracking without data augmentation. We validated our model using real fetal echo-planar images with simulated and real motions. Our method carries significant potential value in accurately measuring, tracking, and correcting fetal motion in fetal MRI sequences.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 3 figures, Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Interventions (MICCAI) Workshop on Perinatal Imaging, Placental and Preterm Image analysis (PIPPI) 2024</p></details> |
| **[STANet: A Novel Spatio-Temporal Aggregation Network for Depression Classification with Small and Unbalanced FMRI Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21323v1)** | 2024-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate diagnosis of depression is crucial for timely implementation of optimal treatments, preventing complications and reducing the risk of suicide. Traditional methods rely on self-report questionnaires and clinical assessment, lacking objective biomarkers. Combining fMRI with artificial intelligence can enhance depression diagnosis by integrating neuroimaging indicators. However, the specificity of fMRI acquisition for depression often results in unbalanced and small datasets, challenging the sensitivity and accuracy of classification models. In this study, we propose the Spatio-Temporal Aggregation Network (STANet) for diagnosing depression by integrating CNN and RNN to capture both temporal and spatial features of brain activity. STANet comprises the following steps:(1) Aggregate spatio-temporal information via ICA. (2) Utilize multi-scale deep convolution to capture detailed features. (3) Balance data using the SMOTE to generate new samples for minority classes. (4) Employ the AFGRU classifier, which combines Fourier transformation with GRU, to capture long-term dependencies, with an adaptive weight assignment mechanism to enhance model generalization. The experimental results demonstrate that STANet achieves superior depression diagnostic performance with 82.38% accuracy and a 90.72% AUC. The STFA module enhances classification by capturing deeper features at multiple scales. The AFGRU classifier, with adaptive weights and stacked GRU, attains higher accuracy and AUC. SMOTE outperforms other oversampling methods. Additionally, spatio-temporal aggregated features achieve better performance compared to using only temporal or spatial features. STANet outperforms traditional or deep learning classifiers, and functional connectivity-based classifiers, as demonstrated by ten-fold cross-validation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatio-temporal areal models to support small area estimation: An application to national-scale forest carbon monitoring](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09909v2)** | 2024-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>National Forest Inventory (NFI) programs can provide vital information on the status, trend, and change in forest parameters. These programs are being increasingly asked to provide forest parameter estimates for spatial and temporal extents smaller than their current design and accompanying design-based methods can deliver with desired levels of uncertainty. Many NFI designs and estimation methods focus on status and are not well equipped to provide acceptable estimates for trend and change parameters, especially over small spatial domains and/or short time periods. Fine-scale space-time indexed estimates are critical to a variety of environmental, ecological, and economic monitoring efforts. Estimates for forest carbon status, trend, and change are of particular importance to international initiatives to track carbon dynamics. Model-based small area estimation (SAE) methods for NFI and similar ecological monitoring data typically pursue inference on status within small spatial domains, with few demonstrated methods that account for spatio-temporal dependence needed for trend and change estimation. We propose a spatio-temporal Bayesian model framework that delivers statistically valid estimates with full uncertainty quantification for status, trend, and change. The framework accommodates a variety of space and time dependency structures, and we detail model configurations for different settings. Through analysis of simulated datasets, we compare the relative performance of candidate models and a traditional direct estimator. We then apply candidate models to a large-scale NFI dataset to demonstrate the utility of the proposed framework for providing unique quantification of forest carbon dynamics in the contiguous United States. We also provide computationally efficient algorithms, software, and data to reproduce our results and for benchmarking.</p></details> |  |
| **[SpotFormer: Multi-Scale Spatio-Temporal Transformer for Facial Expression Spotting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20799v1)** | 2024-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Facial expression spotting, identifying periods where facial expressions occur in a video, is a significant yet challenging task in facial expression analysis. The issues of irrelevant facial movements and the challenge of detecting subtle motions in micro-expressions remain unresolved, hindering accurate expression spotting. In this paper, we propose an efficient framework for facial expression spotting. First, we propose a Sliding Window-based Multi-Resolution Optical flow (SW-MRO) feature, which calculates multi-resolution optical flow of the input image sequence within compact sliding windows. The window length is tailored to perceive complete micro-expressions and distinguish between general macro- and micro-expressions. SW-MRO can effectively reveal subtle motions while avoiding severe head movement problems. Second, we propose SpotFormer, a multi-scale spatio-temporal Transformer that simultaneously encodes spatio-temporal relationships of the SW-MRO features for accurate frame-level probability estimation. In SpotFormer, our proposed Facial Local Graph Pooling (FLGP) and convolutional layers are applied for multi-scale spatio-temporal feature extraction. We show the validity of the architecture of SpotFormer by comparing it with several model variants. Third, we introduce supervised contrastive learning into SpotFormer to enhance the discriminability between different types of expressions. Extensive experiments on SAMM-LV and CAS(ME)^2 show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art models, particularly in micro-expression spotting.</p></details> |  |
| **[Orca: Ocean Significant Wave Height Estimation with Spatio-temporally Aware Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20053v1)** | 2024-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Significant wave height (SWH) is a vital metric in marine science, and accurate SWH estimation is crucial for various applications, e.g., marine energy development, fishery, early warning systems for potential risks, etc. Traditional SWH estimation methods that are based on numerical models and physical theories are hindered by computational inefficiencies. Recently, machine learning has emerged as an appealing alternative to improve accuracy and reduce computational time. However, due to limited observational technology and high costs, the scarcity of real-world data restricts the potential of machine learning models. To overcome these limitations, we propose an ocean SWH estimation framework, namely Orca. Specifically, Orca enhances the limited spatio-temporal reasoning abilities of classic LLMs with a novel spatiotemporal aware encoding module. By segmenting the limited buoy observational data temporally, encoding the buoys' locations spatially, and designing prompt templates, Orca capitalizes on the robust generalization ability of LLMs to estimate significant wave height effectively with limited data. Experimental results on the Gulf of Mexico demonstrate that Orca achieves state-of-the-art performance in SWH estimation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Causal Deepsets for Off-policy Evaluation under Spatial or Spatio-temporal Interferences](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17910v1)** | 2024-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Off-policy evaluation (OPE) is widely applied in sectors such as pharmaceuticals and e-commerce to evaluate the efficacy of novel products or policies from offline datasets. This paper introduces a causal deepset framework that relaxes several key structural assumptions, primarily the mean-field assumption, prevalent in existing OPE methodologies that handle spatio-temporal interference. These traditional assumptions frequently prove inadequate in real-world settings, thereby restricting the capability of current OPE methods to effectively address complex interference effects. In response, we advocate for the implementation of the permutation invariance (PI) assumption. This innovative approach enables the data-driven, adaptive learning of the mean-field function, offering a more flexible estimation method beyond conventional averaging. Furthermore, we present novel algorithms that incorporate the PI assumption into OPE and thoroughly examine their theoretical foundations. Our numerical analyses demonstrate that this novel approach yields significantly more precise estimations than existing baseline algorithms, thereby substantially improving the practical applicability and effectiveness of OPE methodologies. A Python implementation of our proposed method is available at https://github.com/BIG-S2/Causal-Deepsets.</p></details> |  |
| **[SOAP: Enhancing Spatio-Temporal Relation and Motion Information Capturing for Few-Shot Action Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16344v2)** | 2024-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High frame-rate (HFR) videos of action recognition improve fine-grained expression while reducing the spatio-temporal relation and motion information density. Thus, large amounts of video samples are continuously required for traditional data-driven training. However, samples are not always sufficient in real-world scenarios, promoting few-shot action recognition (FSAR) research. We observe that most recent FSAR works build spatio-temporal relation of video samples via temporal alignment after spatial feature extraction, cutting apart spatial and temporal features within samples. They also capture motion information via narrow perspectives between adjacent frames without considering density, leading to insufficient motion information capturing. Therefore, we propose a novel plug-and-play architecture for FSAR called Spatio-tempOral frAme tuPle enhancer (SOAP) in this paper. The model we designed with such architecture refers to SOAP-Net. Temporal connections between different feature channels and spatio-temporal relation of features are considered instead of simple feature extraction. Comprehensive motion information is also captured, using frame tuples with multiple frames containing more motion information than adjacent frames. Combining frame tuples of diverse frame counts further provides a broader perspective. SOAP-Net achieves new state-of-the-art performance across well-known benchmarks such as SthSthV2, Kinetics, UCF101, and HMDB51. Extensive empirical evaluations underscore the competitiveness, pluggability, generalization, and robustness of SOAP.

Existing methods either utilize multi-modal information in video-text pairs or apply global and local alignment techniques to promote alignment precision. However, these methods often fail to fully explore the spatio-temporal relationships among vision tokens within video and across different video-text pairs. In this paper, we propose a novel Spatio-Temporal Graph Transformer module to uniformly learn spatial and temporal contexts for video-language alignment pre-training (dubbed STGT). Specifically, our STGT combines spatio-temporal graph structure information with attention in transformer block, effectively utilizing the spatio-temporal contexts. In this way, we can model the relationships between vision tokens, promoting video-text alignment precision for benefiting downstream tasks. In addition, we propose a self-similarity alignment loss to explore the inherent self-similarity in the video and text. With the initial optimization achieved by contrastive learning, it can further promote the alignment accuracy between video and text. Experimental results on challenging downstream tasks, including video-text retrieval and video question answering, verify the superior performance of our method.</p></details> | under review |

Current state-of-the-art methods either require multiple independent stages of processing that employ motion cues or, in the case of end-to-end trainable networks, lack in segmentation accuracy, in part due to the difficulty of learning segmentation maps from videos with transient object presence. This limits the application of WSVOS for semantic annotation of surgical videos where multiple surgical tools frequently move in and out of the field of view, a problem that is more difficult than typically encountered in WSVOS. This paper introduces Video Spatio-Temporal Disentanglement Networks (VDST-Net), a framework to disentangle spatiotemporal information using semi-decoupled knowledge distillation to predict high-quality class activation maps (CAMs). A teacher network designed to resolve temporal conflicts when specifics about object location and timing in the video are not provided works with a student network that integrates information over time by leveraging temporal dependencies. We demonstrate the efficacy of our framework on a public reference dataset and on a more challenging surgical video dataset where objects are, on average, present in less than 60\% of annotated frames. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques and generates superior segmentation masks under video-level weak supervision.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 6 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |

Additionally, the knowledge map displays spatial and temporal distributions via spatial maps and time axes, respectively. Our visualization technology addresses the limitations inherent in single-view approaches and the deficiency of interaction in spatio-temporal perspectives evident in existing visualization methods. Moreover, we have encapsulated this technology within an integrated, open-source platform named GeoViz.

These deep learning based methods learn ST correlations to support the downstream tasks in the fields such as smart mobility, smart city and other intelligent transportation systems. Despite their effectiveness, ST data fusion and forecasting methods face practical challenges in real-world scenarios. First, forecasting performance for ST data-insufficient area is inferior, making it necessary to transfer meta knowledge from heterogeneous area to enhance the sparse representations. Second, it is nontrivial to accurately forecast in multi-transportation-mode scenarios due to the fine-grained ST features of similar transportation modes, making it necessary to distinguish and measure the ST correlations to alleviate the influence caused by entangled ST features. At last, partial data modalities (e.g., transportation mode) are lost due to privacy or technical issues in certain scenarios, making it necessary to effectively fuse the multimodal sparse ST features and enrich the ST representations. To tackle these challenges, our research work aim to develop effective fusion and forecasting methods for multimodal ST data in smart mobility scenario. In this paper, we will introduce our recent works that investigates the challenges in terms of various real-world applications and establish the open challenges in this field for future work.</p></details> | 4 pages |

Although Bayesian methods are common in spatio-temporal modeling, standard Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques are usually slow for large datasets such as house price data. To tackle this problem, we propose a divide-and-conquer spatio-temporal modeling approach. This method involves partitioning the data into multiple subsets and applying an appropriate Gaussian process model to each subset in parallel. The results from each subset are then combined using the Wasserstein barycenter technique to obtain the global parameters for the original problem. The proposed methodology allows for multiple observations per spatial and time unit, thereby offering added benefits for practitioners. As a real-life application, we analyze house price data of more than 0.6 million transactions from 983 middle layer super output areas in London over a period of eight years. The methodology provides insightful findings about the effects of various amenities, trend patterns, and the relationship between prices and carbon emissions. Furthermore, as demonstrated through a cross-validation study, it shows good predictive accuracy while balancing computational efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Suppl...</summary><p>Supplementary material is available from the authors upon request</p></details> |
| **[The SPDE approach for spatio-temporal datasets with advection and diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.14015v4)** | 2024-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the task of predicting spatio-temporal fields in environmental science using statistical methods, introducing statistical models inspired by the physics of the underlying phenomena that are numerically efficient is of growing interest. Large space-time datasets call for new numerical methods to efficiently process them. The Stochastic Partial Differential Equation (SPDE) approach has proven to be effective for the estimation and the prediction in a spatial context. We present here the advection-diffusion SPDE with first order derivative in time which defines a large class of nonseparable spatio-temporal models. A Gaussian Markov random field approximation of the solution to the SPDE is built by discretizing the temporal derivative with a finite difference method (implicit Euler) and by solving the spatial SPDE with a finite element method (continuous Galerkin) at each time step. The ''Streamline Diffusion'' stabilization technique is introduced when the advection term dominates the diffusion. Computationally efficient methods are proposed to estimate the parameters of the SPDE and to predict the spatio-temporal field by kriging, as well as to perform conditional simulations. The approach is applied to a solar radiation dataset. Its advantages and limitations are discussed.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Spatio-Temporal Approach with Self-Corrective Causal Inference for Flight Delay Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15185v1)** | 2024-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate flight delay prediction is crucial for the secure and effective operation of the air traffic system. Recent advances in modeling inter-airport relationships present a promising approach for investigating flight delay prediction from the multi-airport scenario. However, the previous prediction works only accounted for the simplistic relationships such as traffic flow or geographical distance, overlooking the intricate interactions among airports and thus proving inadequate. In this paper, we leverage causal inference to precisely model inter-airport relationships and propose a self-corrective spatio-temporal graph neural network (named CausalNet) for flight delay prediction. Specifically, Granger causality inference coupled with a self-correction module is designed to construct causality graphs among airports and dynamically modify them based on the current airport's delays. Additionally, the features of the causality graphs are adaptively extracted and utilized to address the heterogeneity of airports. Extensive experiments are conducted on the real data of top-74 busiest airports in China. The results show that CausalNet is superior to baselines. Ablation studies emphasize the power of the proposed self-correction causality graph and the graph feature extraction module. All of these prove the effectiveness of the proposed methodology.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Source and Test-Time Domain Adaptation on Multivariate Signals using Spatio-Temporal Monge Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14303v1)** | 2024-07-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine learning applications on signals such as computer vision or biomedical data often face significant challenges due to the variability that exists across hardware devices or session recordings. This variability poses a Domain Adaptation (DA) problem, as training and testing data distributions often differ. In this work, we propose Spatio-Temporal Monge Alignment (STMA) to mitigate these variabilities. This Optimal Transport (OT) based method adapts the cross-power spectrum density (cross-PSD) of multivariate signals by mapping them to the Wasserstein barycenter of source domains (multi-source DA). Predictions for new domains can be done with a filtering without the need for retraining a model with source data (test-time DA). We also study and discuss two special cases of the method, Temporal Monge Alignment (TMA) and Spatial Monge Alignment (SMA). Non-asymptotic concentration bounds are derived for the mappings estimation, which reveals a bias-plus-variance error structure with a variance decay rate of $\mathcal{O}(n_\ell^{-1/2})$ with $n_\ell$ the signal length. This theoretical guarantee demonstrates the efficiency of the proposed computational schema. Numerical experiments on multivariate biosignals and image data show that STMA leads to significant and consistent performance gains between datasets acquired with very different settings. Notably, STMA is a pre-processing step complementary to state-of-the-art deep learning methods.</p></details> |  |

Owing to the outstanding performance in dealing with structure learning potentials, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are often used to capture such complex spatio-temporal features in multivariate time series. However, these data-driven models often fail to capture the essential spatio-temporal relationships when significant signal corruption occurs. Additionally, calculating the high-order neighbor nodes in these models is of high computational complexity. To address these problems, we propose a novel higher-order spatio-temporal physics-incorporated GNN (HSPGNN). Firstly, the dynamic Laplacian matrix can be obtained by the spatial attention mechanism. Then, the generic inhomogeneous partial differential equation (PDE) of physical dynamic systems is used to construct the dynamic higher-order spatio-temporal GNN to obtain the missing time series values. Moreover, we estimate the missing impact by Normalizing Flows (NF) to evaluate the importance of each node in the graph for better explainability. Experimental results on four benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HSPGNN and the superior performance when combining various order neighbor nodes.

| **[Spatio-Temporal Branching for Motion Prediction using Motion Increments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01097v4)** | 2024-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human motion prediction (HMP) has emerged as a popular research topic due to its diverse applications, but it remains a challenging task due to the stochastic and aperiodic nature of future poses. Traditional methods rely on hand-crafted features and machine learning techniques, which often struggle to model the complex dynamics of human motion. Recent deep learning-based methods have achieved success by learning spatio-temporal representations of motion, but these models often overlook the reliability of motion data. Additionally, the temporal and spatial dependencies of skeleton nodes are distinct. The temporal relationship captures motion information over time, while the spatial relationship describes body structure and the relationships between different nodes. In this paper, we propose a novel spatio-temporal branching network using incremental information for HMP, which decouples the learning of temporal-domain and spatial-domain features, extracts more motion information, and achieves complementary cross-domain knowledge learning through knowledge distillation. Our approach effectively reduces noise interference and provides more expressive information for characterizing motion by separately extracting temporal and spatial features. We evaluate our approach on standard HMP benchmarks and outperform state-of-the-art methods in terms of prediction accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>The i...</summary><p>The incremental information of our paper includes the displacement information from the last frame of the historical sequence, derived from the motion information of the first frame in the future sequence and the motion information of the last frame of the historical sequence.

Changes in the size, shape and movement of the chambers can be important markers for cardiac disease and modeling this in relation to clinical demography or disease is therefore of interest. Existing methods for spatio-temporal modeling of the human heart require shape correspondence over time or suffer from large memory requirements, making it difficult to use for complex anatomies. We introduce a novel conditional generative model, where the shape and movement is modeled implicitly in the form of a spatio-temporal neural distance field and conditioned on clinical demography. The model is based on an auto-decoder architecture and aims to disentangle the individual variations from that related to the clinical demography. It is tested on the left atrium (including the left atrial appendage), where it outperforms current state-of-the-art methods for anatomical sequence completion and generates synthetic sequences that realistically mimics the shape and motion of the real left atrium. In practice, this means we can infer functional measurements from a static image, generate synthetic populations with specified demography or disease and investigate how non-imaging clinical data effect the shape and motion of cardiac anatomies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for MICCAI2024</p></details> |

However, estimating incidence or mortality rates associated with rare cancers presents important difficulties and poses new statistical methodological challenges. In this paper, we expand the collection of multivariate spatio-temporal models by introducing adaptable shared spatio-temporal components to enable a comprehensive analysis of both incidence and cancer mortality in rare cancer cases. These models allow the modulation of spatio-temporal effects between incidence and mortality, allowing for changes in their relationship over time. The new models have been implemented in INLA using r-generic constructions. We conduct a simulation study to evaluate the performance of the new spatio-temporal models. Our results show that multivariate spatio-temporal models incorporating a flexible shared spatio-temporal term outperform conventional multivariate spatio-temporal models that include specific spatio-temporal effects for each health outcome. We use these models to analyze incidence and mortality data for pancreatic cancer and leukaemia among males across 142 administrative health care districts of Great Britain over a span of nine biennial periods (2002-2019).</p></details> | 40 pages, 12 figures |

To address this limitation, this paper presents the spatio-temporal GraphFormer framework for 3D human pose estimation in video, which integrates body structure graph-based representations with spatio-temporal information. Specifically, we develop a spatio-temporal criss-cross graph (STG) attention mechanism. This approach is designed to learn the long-range dependencies in data across both time and space, integrating graph information directly into the respective attention layers. Furthermore, we introduce the dual-path modulated hop-wise regular GCN (MHR-GCN) module, which utilizes modulation to optimize parameter usage and employs spatio-temporal hop-wise skip connections to acquire higher-order information. Additionally, this module processes temporal and spatial dimensions independently to learn their respective features while avoiding mutual influence. Finally, we demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in 3D human pose estimation on the Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP datasets.</p></details> |  |

The restoration and enhancement have proven to be highly beneficial. However, there are only a limited number of enhancement methods explicitly designed for videos acquired in low-light conditions. We propose a Spatio-Temporal Aligned SUNet (STA-SUNet) model using a Swin Transformer as a backbone to capture low light video features and exploit their spatio-temporal correlations. The STA-SUNet model is trained on a novel, fully registered dataset (BVI), which comprises dynamic scenes captured under varying light conditions. It is further analysed comparatively against various other models over three test datasets. The model demonstrates superior adaptivity across all datasets, obtaining the highest PSNR and SSIM values. It is particularly effective in extreme low-light conditions, yielding fairly good visualisation results.</p></details> |  |

In this regard, covariance properties with respect to geometric image transformations in the earliest layers of the visual hierarchy are essential for expressing robust image operations, and for formulating invariant visual operations at higher levels. This paper defines and proves a set of joint covariance properties for spatio-temporal receptive fields in terms of spatio-temporal derivative operators applied to spatio-temporally smoothed image data under compositions of spatial scaling transformations, spatial affine transformations, Galilean transformations and temporal scaling transformations. Specifically, the derived relations show how the parameters of the receptive fields need to be transformed, in order to match the output from spatio-temporal receptive fields under composed spatio-temporal image transformations. For this purpose, we also fundamentally extend the notion of scale-normalized derivatives to affine-normalized derivatives, that are computed based on spatial smoothing with affine Gaussian kernels, and analyze the covariance properties of the resulting affine-normalized derivatives for the affine group as well as for important subgroups thereof. We conclude with a geometric analysis, showing how the derived joint covariance properties make it possible to relate or match spatio-temporal receptive field responses, when observing, possibly moving, local surface patches from different views, under locally linearized perspective or projective transformations, as well as when observing different instances of spatio-temporal events, that may occur either faster or slower between different views of similar spatio-temporal events.</p></details> | <details><summary>41 pa...</summary><p>41 pages, 13 figures.

Designing spatio-temporal forecasting models separately in a task-wise and city-wise manner to forecast demand and supply-demand gap in a ride-hailing system poses a burden for the expanding transportation network companies. Therefore, a multi-task learning architecture is proposed in this study by developing gated ensemble of spatio-temporal mixture of experts network (GESME-Net) with convolutional recurrent neural network (CRNN), convolutional neural network (CNN), and recurrent neural network (RNN) for simultaneously forecasting these spatio-temporal tasks in a city as well as across different cities. Furthermore, a task adaptation layer is integrated with the architecture for learning joint representation in multi-task learning and revealing the contribution of the input features utilized in prediction. The proposed architecture is tested with data from Didi Chuxing for: (i) simultaneously forecasting demand and supply-demand gap in Beijing, and (ii) simultaneously forecasting demand across Chengdu and Xian. In both scenarios, models from our proposed architecture outperformed the single-task and multi-task deep learning benchmarks and ensemble-based machine learning algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2012.08868</p></details> |

If an AV can predict its surrounding vehicles' future trajectories, it can make safe and efficient manoeuvre decisions. In this paper, we present such a Deep Spatio-Temporal Context-Aware decision Network (DST-CAN) model for predictive manoeuvre planning of AVs. A memory neuron network is used to predict future trajectories of its surrounding vehicles. The driving environment's spatio-temporal information (past, present, and predicted future trajectories) are embedded into a context-aware grid. The proposed DST-CAN model employs these context-aware grids as inputs to a convolutional neural network to understand the spatial relationships between the vehicles and determine a safe and efficient manoeuvre decision. The DST-CAN model also uses information of human driving behavior on a highway. Performance evaluation of DST-CAN has been carried out using two publicly available NGSIM US-101 and I-80 datasets. Also, rule-based ground truth decisions have been compared with those generated by DST-CAN. The results clearly show that DST-CAN can make much better decisions with 3-sec of predicted trajectories of neighboring vehicles compared to currently existing methods that do not use this prediction.</p></details> | 12 pages, 8 figures |

Traditional methods based on generative adversarial networks(GAN) or joint learning frameworks can achieve good prediction accuracy under low observation ratios, but they usually have high computational costs. In view of this, this paper proposes a spatio-temporal encoding and decoding-based method for future human activity skeleton synthesis. Firstly, algorithms such as time control, discrete cosine transform, and low-pass filtering are used to cut or pad the skeleton sequences. Secondly, the encoder and decoder are responsible for extracting intermediate semantic encoding from observed skeleton sequences and inferring future sequences from the intermediate semantic encoding, respectively. Finally, joint displacement error, velocity error, and acceleration error, three higher-order kinematic features, are used as key components of the loss function to optimize model parameters. Experimental results show that the proposed future skeleton synthesis algorithm performs better than some existing algorithms. It generates skeleton sequences with smaller errors and fewer model parameters, effectively providing future information for early activity prediction.</p></details> |  |

We train this model on the Raw Heidelberg Digits keyword spotting benchmark using Backpropagation Through Time with surrogate gradients. Analysing the spatio-temporal structure of synaptic interactions in the network we observe that after training excitation and inhibition are grouped together both in space and time. To further enhance the efficiency and biological realism of our model, we implemented a dynamic pruning strategy that combines DEEP R for connection removal and RigL for connection reintroduction, ensuring that the network maintains optimal connectivity throughout training. Additionally, we incorporated Dale's Principle, enforcing each neuron to be exclusively excitatory or inhibitory -- aligning our model closer to biological neural networks. We observed that, after training, the spatio-temporal patterns of excitation and inhibition appeared in the more biologically plausible model as well. Our research demonstrates the potential of integrating learnable delays, dynamic pruning, and biological constraints to develop efficient SNN models for temporal data processing. Furthermore, our results enhance the understanding of spatio-temporal dynamics in SNNs -- suggesting that the spatio-temporal features which emerge from training are robust to both pruning and rewiring processes -- providing a solid foundation for future work in neuromorphic computing applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 4 figures, submitted to Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience</p></details> |

To address these problems, this study proposes a spatio-temporal model that incorporates skewness while maintaining mean and variance, by applying the flexible subclass of the closed skew-normal distribution. An efficient sampling method is introduced, leveraging the autoregressive representation of the model. Additionally, the model's symmetry concerning spatial order is demonstrated, and Mardia's skewness and kurtosis are derived, showing independence from the mean and variance. Simulation studies compare the estimation performance of the proposed model with that of the Gaussian model. The result confirms its superiority in high skewness and low observation noise scenarios. The identification of Cobb-Douglas production functions across US states is examined as an application to real data, revealing that the proposed model excels in both goodness-of-fit and predictive performance.</p></details> |  |

Most of the existing models achieve either spectral or spatial compression, and do not jointly consider the spatio-spectral redundancies present in HSIs. To address this problem, in this paper we focus our attention on the High Fidelity Compression (HiFiC) model (which is proven to be highly effective for spatial compression problems) and adapt it to perform spatio-spectral compression of HSIs. In detail, we introduce two new models: i) HiFiC using Squeeze and Excitation (SE) blocks (denoted as HiFiC$_{SE}$); and ii) HiFiC with 3D convolutions (denoted as HiFiC$_{3D}$) in the framework of compression of HSIs. We analyze the effectiveness of HiFiC$_{SE}$ and HiFiC$_{3D}$ in compressing the spatio-spectral redundancies with channel attention and inter-dependency analysis. Experimental results show the efficacy of the proposed models in performing spatio-spectral compression, while reconstructing images at reduced bitrates with higher reconstruction quality. The code of the proposed models is publicly available at https://git.tu-berlin.de/rsim/HSI-SSC .</p></details> |  |

We train these networks to predict the dynamics of delay-dynamical and spatio-temporal systems for a single size. Then, we drive the networks by their own predictions. We demonstrate that by scaling the size of the trained network, we can predict the complex dynamics for larger or smaller system sizes. Thus, the network learns from a single example and, by exploiting symmetry properties, infers entire bifurcation diagrams.</p></details> |  |

Multicasting has garnered consistent attention as a means to fulfill the increasing demand for more efficient data transmission methods. Nevertheless, leveraging multicast wireless networks for spatio-temporally asynchronous data requests poses challenges. In this context, this paper introduces a new multicast mechanism called \emph{set-up based merged multicast (SMMC)} to minimize the delivery time of the requested file in wireless networks by considering the uncertainties inherent in wireless channels. The proposed mechanism comprises two phases. The first phase involves gathering asynchronous requests for a file from users experiencing diverse channel conditions. During this phase, packets of the requested file are transmitted individually in unicast mode within a specified set-up time. Following this, the second phase initiates multicast transmission, which sequentially handles the remaining packets of the file in multicast mode. In the proposed mechanism, we optimize the set-up time and transmission rates of both unicast and multicast modes to minimize the expected file delivery time by jointly taking into account the statistical characteristics of wireless channels, users' locations, and file popularity. Additionally, we also delve into a \emph{fine-tuned SMMC} by utilizing posterior information on the multicast group size and further improve the performance. Our performance evaluations reveal that the proposed SMMC outperforms conventional unicast methods, especially with high-demand data.</p></details> |  |

In a graphon particle system, the interactions among particles are characterized by the coupled mean field terms through an underlying graphon and the randomness of the coefficients comes from the stochastic processes associated with the particle labels. By constructing two-level approximated sequences converging in 2-Wasserstein distance, we prove the existence and uniqueness of the solution to the system. Besides, by constructing two-level approximated functions converging to the graphon mean field terms, we establish the law of large numbers, which reveals that if the number of particles tends to infinity and the discretization step tends to zero, then the discrete-time interacting particle system over a large-scale network converges to the graphon particle system. As a byproduct, we discover that the graphon particle system can describe the limiting dynamics of the distributed stochastic gradient descent algorithm over the large-scale network and prove that if the gradients of the local cost functions are Lipschitz continuous, then the graphon particle system can be regarded as the spatio-temporal approximation of the discrete-time distributed stochastic gradient descent algorithm as the number of network nodes tends to infinity and the algorithm step size tends to zero.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we target enhancing VLMs with a fine-grained structural spatio-temporal alignment learning method (namely Finsta). First of all, we represent the input texts and videos with fine-grained scene graph (SG) structures, both of which are further unified into a holistic SG (HSG) for bridging two modalities. Then, an SG-based framework is built, where the textual SG (TSG) is encoded with a graph Transformer, while the video dynamic SG (DSG) and the HSG are modeled with a novel recurrent graph Transformer for spatial and temporal feature propagation. A spatial-temporal Gaussian differential graph Transformer is further devised to strengthen the sense of the changes in objects across spatial and temporal dimensions. Next, based on the fine-grained structural features of TSG and DSG, we perform object-centered spatial alignment and predicate-centered temporal alignment respectively, enhancing the video-language grounding in both the spatiality and temporality. We design our method as a plug&play system, which can be integrated into existing well-trained VLMs for further representation augmentation, without training from scratch or relying on SG annotations in downstream applications. On 6 representative VL modeling tasks over 12 datasets in both standard and long-form video scenarios, Finsta consistently improves the existing 13 strong-performing VLMs persistently, and refreshes the current state-of-the-art end task performance significantly in both the fine-tuning and zero-shot settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE TPAMI 2024</p></details> |

However, current works for evaluating the spatio-temporal understanding capability of LLMs are somewhat limited and biased. These works either fail to incorporate the latest language models or only focus on assessing the memorized spatio-temporal knowledge. To address this gap, this paper dissects LLMs' capability of spatio-temporal data into four distinct dimensions: knowledge comprehension, spatio-temporal reasoning, accurate computation, and downstream applications. We curate several natural language question-answer tasks for each category and build the benchmark dataset, namely STBench, containing 13 distinct tasks and over 60,000 QA pairs. Moreover, we have assessed the capabilities of 13 LLMs, such as GPT-4o, Gemma and Mistral. Experimental results reveal that existing LLMs show remarkable performance on knowledge comprehension and spatio-temporal reasoning tasks, with potential for further enhancement on other tasks through in-context learning, chain-of-though prompting, and fine-tuning.

Recent advancements in foundational models, particularly those employing self-attention mechanisms, have significantly enhanced our ability to comprehend the semantics of diverse data types. One such area that could highly benefit from multi-modality is in understanding geospatial data, which inherently has multiple modalities. However, current Natural Language Processing (NLP) mechanisms struggle to effectively address geospatial queries. Existing pre-trained LLMs are inadequately equipped to meet the unique demands of geospatial data, lacking the ability to retrieve precise spatio-temporal data in real-time, thus leading to significantly reduced accuracy in answering complex geospatial queries. To address these limitations, we introduce Geode--a pioneering system designed to tackle zero-shot geospatial question-answering tasks with high precision using spatio-temporal data retrieval.

While a few researchers focus on learning ice layer patterns from echogram images captured by airborne snow radar sensors via different convolutional neural networks, the noise in the echogram images proves to be a major obstacle. Instead, we focus on geometric deep learning based on graph neural networks to learn the spatio-temporal patterns from thickness information of shallow ice layers and make predictions for deep layers. In this paper, we propose a physics-informed hybrid graph neural network that combines the GraphSAGE framework for graph feature learning with the long short-term memory (LSTM) structure for learning temporal changes, and introduce measurements of physical ice properties from Model Atmospheric Regional (MAR) weather model as physical node features.

OFOS platforms offer dynamic allocation incentives to users and merchants through diverse marketing campaigns to encourage payments while maintaining the platforms' budget efficiency. Despite significant progress, the marketing domain continues to face two primary challenges: (i) how to allocate a limited budget with greater efficiency, demanding precision in predicting users' monotonic response (i.e. sensitivity) to incentives, and (ii) ensuring spatio-temporal adaptability and robustness in diverse marketing campaigns across different times and locations. To address these issues, we propose a Constrained Monotonic Adaptive Network (CoMAN) method for spatio-temporal perception within marketing pricing. Specifically, we capture spatio-temporal preferences within attribute features through two foundational spatio-temporal perception modules. To further enhance catching the user sensitivity differentials to incentives across varied times and locations, we design modules for learning spatio-temporal convexity and concavity as well as for expressing sensitivity functions. CoMAN can achieve a more efficient allocation of incentive investments during pricing, thus increasing the conversion rate and orders while maintaining budget efficiency. Extensive offline and online experimental results within our diverse marketing campaigns demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach while outperforming the monotonic state-of-the-art method.</p></details> | 7 pages |

Matrix factorization is employed to decompose spatio-temporal data into spatial and temporal components. To improve clarity in the temporal patterns, we introduce a nonnegativity constraint on the time domain along with regularization in the frequency domain. Specifically, regularization in the frequency domain involves selecting features in the frequency space, making an interpretation in the frequency domain more convenient. We propose two methods in the frequency domain: soft and hard regularizations, and provide convergence guarantees to first-order stationary points of the corresponding constrained optimization problem. While our primary motivation stems from geophysical data analysis based on GRACE (Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment) data, our methodology has the potential for wider application. Consequently, when applying our methodology to GRACE data, we find that the results with the proposed methodology are comparable to previous research in the field of geophysical sciences but offer clearer interpretability.</p></details> | <details><summary>35 pa...</summary><p>35 pages, Final version</p></details> |

Despite their advantages, a significant gap persists between real-world scenarios, where detection speed is critical, and existing proposals, which operate on large graphs representing several hours of traffic. This gap results in unrealistic operational conditions and impractical detection delays. Moreover, existing models do not generalize well across different networks, hampering their deployment in production environments. To address these issues, we introduce PPTGNN, a practical spatio-temporal GNN for intrusion detection. PPTGNN enables near real-time predictions, while better capturing the spatio-temporal dynamics of network attacks. PPTGNN employs self-supervised pre-training for improved performance and reduced dependency on labeled data. We evaluate PPTGNN on three public datasets and show that it significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models, such as E-ResGAT and E-GraphSAGE, with an average accuracy improvement of 10.38%. Finally, we show that a pre-trained PPTGNN can easily be fine-tuned to unseen networks with minimal labeled examples. This highlights the potential of PPTGNN as a general, large-scale pre-trained model that can effectively operate in diverse network environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper currently under review.

While limiting the variety of training data can make training easier, it can also lead to a lack of knowledge and information for the model, resulting in a decrease in performance. To address this challenge, we presented an innovative paradigm that incorporates three separate forms of curriculum learning specifically targeting from spatial, temporal, and quantile perspectives. Furthermore, our framework incorporates a stacking fusion module to combine diverse information from three types of curriculum learning, resulting in a strong and thorough learning process. We demonstrated the effectiveness of this framework with extensive empirical evaluations, highlighting its better performance in addressing complex ST challenges. We provided thorough ablation studies to investigate the effectiveness of our curriculum and to explain how it contributes to the improvement of learning efficiency on ST data.</p></details> |  |

Premature predictions may yield a higher rate of false alarms, whereas delaying predictions to gather more information can render them too late to be useful. In applications such as wildfires, crimes, and traffic jams, timely forecasting are vital for safeguarding human life and property. Consequently, finding a balance between accuracy and timeliness is crucial. In this paper, we propose an early spatio-temporal forecasting model based on Multi-Objective reinforcement learning that can either implement an optimal policy given a preference or infer the preference based on a small number of samples. The model addresses two primary challenges: 1) enhancing the accuracy of early forecasting and 2) providing the optimal policy for determining the most suitable prediction time for each area. Our method demonstrates superior performance on three large-scale real-world datasets, surpassing existing methods in early spatio-temporal forecasting tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted paper in KDD 2024</p></details> |

This paper proposes a Multi-level Multi-view Augmented Spatio-temporal Transformer (LVSTformer) for traffic prediction. The model aims to capture spatial dependencies from three different levels: local geographic, global semantic, and pivotal nodes, along with long- and short-term temporal dependencies. Specifically, we design three spatial augmented views to delve into the spatial information from the perspectives of local, global, and pivotal nodes. By combining three spatial augmented views with three parallel spatial self-attention mechanisms, the model can comprehensively captures spatial dependencies at different levels. We design a gated temporal self-attention mechanism to effectively capture long- and short-term temporal dependencies. Furthermore, a spatio-temporal context broadcasting module is introduced between two spatio-temporal layers to ensure a well-distributed allocation of attention scores, alleviating overfitting and information loss, and enhancing the generalization ability and robustness of the model. A comprehensive set of experiments is conducted on six well-known traffic benchmarks, the experimental results demonstrate that LVSTformer achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to competing baselines, with the maximum improvement reaching up to 4.32%.</p></details> |  |

Although several recent methods have been proposed to model complex dynamics in STGs, addressing long-range spatio-temporal dependencies remains a significant challenge, leading to limited performance gains. Inspired by a recently proposed state space model named Mamba, which has shown remarkable capability of capturing long-range dependency, we propose a new STG forecasting framework named SpoT-Mamba. SpoT-Mamba generates node embeddings by scanning various node-specific walk sequences. Based on the node embeddings, it conducts temporal scans to capture long-range spatio-temporal dependencies. Experimental results on the real-world traffic forecasting dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of SpoT-Mamba.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 2 figures, 3 tables.

In this paper, we focus on NCA models used for texture synthesis, where the update rule is inspired by partial differential equations (PDEs) describing reaction-diffusion systems. To train the NCA model, the spatio-temporal domain is discretized, and Euler integration is used to numerically simulate the PDE. However, whether a trained NCA truly learns the continuous dynamic described by the corresponding PDE or merely overfits the discretization used in training remains an open question. We study NCA models at the limit where space-time discretization approaches continuity. We find that existing NCA models tend to overfit the training discretization, especially in the proximity of the initial condition, also called "seed". To address this, we propose a solution that utilizes uniform noise as the initial condition. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in preserving the consistency of NCA dynamics across a wide range of spatio-temporal granularities. Our improved NCA model enables two new test-time interactions by allowing continuous control over the speed of pattern formation and the scale of the synthesized patterns. We demonstrate this new NCA feature in our interactive online demo. Our work reveals that NCA models can learn continuous dynamics and opens new venues for NCA research from a dynamical system's perspective.</p></details> | 9 pages, 12 figures |

Specifically, in the context of estimation, we seek the most likely evolution realizing measured spatio-temporal marginals of killed particles. In the context of control, we seek a suitable control action directing the killed process toward spatio-temporal probabilistic constraints. To this end, we derive a new Schr\"odinger system of coupled, in space and time, partial differential equations to construct the solution of the proposed problem. Further, we show that a Fortet-Sinkhorn type of algorithm is available to attain the associated bridge. A key feature of our framework is that the obtained bridge retains the Markovian structure in the prior process, and thereby, the corresponding controller takes the form of state feedback.</p></details> | 6 pages, 2 figures |

Mainstream approaches employ bidirectional feature propagation, spatio-temporal transformers, or a combination of both to extract information from the video sequence. However, limitations in memory and computational resources constraints the temporal window length of the spatio-temporal transformer, preventing the extraction of longer temporal contextual information from the video sequence. Additionally, bidirectional feature propagation is highly sensitive to inaccurate optical flow in blurry frames, leading to error accumulation during the propagation process. To address these issues, we propose \textbf{BSSTNet}, \textbf{B}lur-aware \textbf{S}patio-temporal \textbf{S}parse \textbf{T}ransformer Network. It introduces the blur map, which converts the originally dense attention into a sparse form, enabling a more extensive utilization of information throughout the entire video sequence. Specifically, BSSTNet (1) uses a longer temporal window in the transformer, leveraging information from more distant frames to restore the blurry pixels in the current frame. (2) introduces bidirectional feature propagation guided by blur maps, which reduces error accumulation caused by the blur frame. The experimental results demonstrate the proposed BSSTNet outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on the GoPro and DVD datasets.</p></details> | CVPR 2024 |

Spatio-temporal data, on the other hand, is vital for analyzing phenomena in both space and time, providing a dynamic perspective on complex system interactions. Recently, diffusion models have seen widespread application in time series and spatio-temporal data mining. Not only do they enhance the generative and inferential capabilities for sequential and temporal data, but they also extend to other downstream tasks. In this survey, we comprehensively and thoroughly review the use of diffusion models in time series and spatio-temporal data, categorizing them by model category, task type, data modality, and practical application domain. In detail, we categorize diffusion models into unconditioned and conditioned types and discuss time series and spatio-temporal data separately. Unconditioned models, which operate unsupervised, are subdivided into probability-based and score-based models, serving predictive and generative tasks such as forecasting, anomaly detection, classification, and imputation. Conditioned models, on the other hand, utilize extra information to enhance performance and are similarly divided for both predictive and generative tasks. Our survey extensively covers their application in various fields, including healthcare, recommendation, climate, energy, audio, and transportation, providing a foundational understanding of how these models analyze and generate data. Through this structured overview, we aim to provide researchers and practitioners with a comprehensive understanding of diffusion models for time series and spatio-temporal data analysis, aiming to direct future innovations and applications by addressing traditional challenges and exploring innovative solutions within the diffusion model framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>Ongoi...</summary><p>Ongoing work & Under review; 27 pages, 8 figures, 2 tables; Github Repo: https://github.com/yyysjz1997/Awesome-TimeSeries-SpatioTemporal-Diffusion-Model</p></details> |

However, significant individual variation in the organisation of the human cerebral cortex makes it difficult to identify population-level trends in these signals. Recently, Surface Vision Transformers (SiTs) have emerged as a promising approach for modelling cortical signals, yet they face some limitations in low-data scenarios due to the lack of inductive biases in their architecture. To address these challenges, this paper proposes the surface Masked AutoEncoder (sMAE) and video surface Masked AutoEncoder (vsMAE) - for multivariate and spatio-temporal pre-training of cortical signals over regular icosahedral grids. These models are trained to reconstruct cortical feature maps from masked versions of the input by learning strong latent representations of cortical structure and function. Such representations translate into better modelling of individual phenotypes and enhanced performance in downstream tasks. The proposed approach was evaluated on cortical phenotype regression using data from the young adult Human Connectome Project (HCP) and developing HCP (dHCP). Results show that (v)sMAE pre-trained models improve phenotyping prediction performance on multiple tasks by $\ge 26\%$, and offer faster convergence relative to models trained from scratch. Finally, we show that pre-training vision transformers on large datasets, such as the UK Biobank (UKB), supports transfer learning to low-data regimes. Our code and pre-trained models are publicly available at https://github.com/metrics-lab/surface-masked-autoencoders .</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publications for MIDL 2024; 20 figures; 7 figures</p></details> |

However, tackling the video camouflage object detection (VCOD) task presents a unique challenge. Camouflaged objects typically blend into the background, making them difficult to distinguish in still images. Additionally, ensuring temporal consistency in this context is a challenging problem. As a result, SAM encounters limitations and falls short when applied to the VCOD task. To overcome these challenges, we propose a new method called the SAM Propagation Module (SAM-PM). Our propagation module enforces temporal consistency within SAM by employing spatio-temporal cross-attention mechanisms. Moreover, we exclusively train the propagation module while keeping the SAM network weights frozen, allowing us to integrate task-specific insights with the vast knowledge accumulated by the large model. Our method effectively incorporates temporal consistency and domain-specific expertise into the segmentation network with an addition of less than 1% of SAM's parameters. Extensive experimentation reveals a substantial performance improvement in the VCOD benchmark when compared to the most recent state-of-the-art techniques. Code and pre-trained weights are open-sourced at https://github.com/SpiderNitt/SAM-PM</p></details> |  |

The prediction of the remaining useful life (RUL) of batteries is crucial for ensuring reliable and efficient operation, as well as reducing maintenance costs. However, determining the life cycle of batteries in real-world scenarios is challenging, and existing methods have limitations in predicting the number of cycles iteratively. In addition, existing works often oversimplify the datasets, neglecting important features of the batteries such as temperature, internal resistance, and material type. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a two-stage RUL prediction scheme for Lithium-ion batteries using a spatio-temporal multimodal attention network (ST-MAN). The proposed ST-MAN is to capture the complex spatio-temporal dependencies in the battery data, including the features that are often neglected in existing works. Despite operating without prior knowledge of end-of-life (EOL) events, our method consistently achieves lower error rates, boasting mean absolute error (MAE) and mean square error (MSE) of 0.0275 and 0.0014, respectively, compared to existing convolutional neural networks (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM)-based methods. The proposed method has the potential to improve the reliability and efficiency of battery operations and is applicable in various industries.</p></details> |  |

We propose novel approaches to improve mesh-agnostic spatio-temporal prediction of transient flow fields using graph U-Nets, enabling accurate prediction on diverse mesh configurations. Key enhancements to the graph U-Net architecture, including the Gaussian mixture model convolutional operator and noise injection approaches, provide increased flexibility in modeling node dynamics: the former reduces prediction error by 95\% compared to conventional convolutional operators, while the latter improves long-term prediction robustness, resulting in an error reduction of 86\%. We also investigate transductive and inductive-learning perspectives of graph U-Nets with proposed improvements. In the transductive setting, they effectively predict quantities for unseen nodes within the trained graph. In the inductive setting, they successfully perform in mesh scenarios with different vortex-shedding periods, showing 98\% improvement in predicting the future flow fields compared to a model trained without the inductive settings. It is found that graph U-Nets without pooling operations, i.e. without reducing and restoring the node dimensionality of the graph data, perform better in inductive settings due to their ability to learn from the detailed structure of each graph. Meanwhile, we also discover that the choice of normalization technique significantly impacts graph U-Net performance.</p></details> |  |

Although these methods have shown some potential in creating immersive experiences, two drawbacks limit their ubiquity: (i) a significant reduction in reconstruction quality when the computing budget is limited, and (ii) a lack of semantic understanding of the underlying scenes. To address these issues, we introduce Gear-NeRF, which leverages semantic information from powerful image segmentation models. Our approach presents a principled way for learning a spatio-temporal (4D) semantic embedding, based on which we introduce the concept of gears to allow for stratified modeling of dynamic regions of the scene based on the extent of their motion. Such differentiation allows us to adjust the spatio-temporal sampling resolution for each region in proportion to its motion scale, achieving more photo-realistic dynamic novel view synthesis. At the same time, almost for free, our approach enables free-viewpoint tracking of objects of interest - a functionality not yet achieved by existing NeRF-based methods. Empirical studies validate the effectiveness of our method, where we achieve state-of-the-art rendering and tracking performance on multiple challenging datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper accepted to IEEE/CVF CVPR 2024 (Spotlight).

Computations are done through a Gaussian Markov random field approximation of the solution of the SPDE, which is constructed through a finite volume method. The new flexible non-separable model is compared to a flexible separable model both for reconstruction and forecasting and evaluated in terms of root mean square errors and continuous rank probability scores. A simulation study demonstrates that the non-separable model performs better when the data is simulated with non-separable effects such as diffusion and advection. Further, we estimate surrogate models for emulating the output of a ocean model in Trondheimsfjorden, Norway, and simulate observations of autonoumous underwater vehicles. The results show that the flexible non-separable model outperforms the flexible separable model for real-time prediction of unobserved locations.</p></details> |  |

In recent years, they have gained considerable research interest. However, existing SNNs predominantly rely on the Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) model and are primarily suited for simple, static tasks. They lack the ability to effectively model long-term temporal dependencies and facilitate spatial information interaction, which is crucial for tackling complex, dynamic spatio-temporal prediction tasks. To tackle these challenges, this paper draws inspiration from the concept of autaptic synapses in biology and proposes a novel Spatio-Temporal Circuit (STC) model. The STC model integrates two learnable adaptive pathways, enhancing the spiking neurons' temporal memory and spatial coordination. We conduct a theoretical analysis of the dynamic parameters in the STC model, highlighting their contribution in establishing long-term memory and mitigating the issue of gradient vanishing. Through extensive experiments on multiple spatio-temporal prediction datasets, we demonstrate that our model outperforms other adaptive models. Furthermore, our model is compatible with existing spiking neuron models, thereby augmenting their dynamic representations. In essence, our work enriches the specificity and topological complexity of SNNs.</p></details> | Accepted by ICML2024 |

The existing video adversarial attack methods mainly take a gradient-based approach and generate adversarial videos with noticeable perturbations. In this paper, we propose a novel Sparse Adversarial Video Attack via Spatio-Temporal Invertible Neural Networks (SVASTIN) to generate adversarial videos through spatio-temporal feature space information exchanging. It consists of a Guided Target Video Learning (GTVL) module to balance the perturbation budget and optimization speed and a Spatio-Temporal Invertible Neural Network (STIN) module to perform spatio-temporal feature space information exchanging between a source video and the target feature tensor learned by GTVL module.

Many recent studies have concentrated on meticulously reconciling various advantages, leading to designed models that are neither simple nor practical. To address this issue, this paper presents a systematic study on existing shortcomings faced by off-the-shelf models, including lack of local fidelity, poor prediction performance over long time-steps,low scalability, and inefficiency. To systematically address the aforementioned problems, we propose an EarthFarseer, a concise framework that combines parallel local convolutions and global Fourier-based transformer architectures, enabling dynamically capture the local-global spatial interactions and dependencies. EarthFarseer also incorporates a multi-scale fully convolutional and Fourier architectures to efficiently and effectively capture the temporal evolution.

Consequently, methods for predicting and preventing traffic accidents have been researched for many years. With advancements in the field of artificial intelligence, various studies have applied Machine Learning and Deep Learning techniques to traffic accident prediction. Modern traffic conditions change rapidly by the minute, and these changes vary significantly across different roads. In other words, the risk of traffic accidents changes minute by minute in various patterns for each road. Therefore, it is desirable to predict traffic accident risk at the Minute-Level and Road-Level. However, because roads have close and complex relationships with adjacent roads, research on predicting traffic accidents at the Minute-Level and Road-Level is challenging. Thus, it is essential to build a model that can reflect the spatial and temporal characteristics of roads for traffic accident prediction. Consequently, recent attempts have been made to use Graph Convolutional Networks to capture the spatial characteristics of roads and Recurrent Neural Networks to capture their temporal characteristics for predicting traffic accident risk. This paper proposes the Sequential based Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Networks (SST-GCN), which combines GCN and LSTM, to predict traffic accidents at the Minute-Level and Road-Level using a road dataset constructed in Seoul, the capital of South Korea. Experiments have demonstrated that SST-GCN outperforms other state-of-the-art models in Minute-Level predictions.</p></details> |  |

However, key limitations of l-step MPGNNs are that their "receptive field" is typically limited to the l-hop neighborhood of a node and that information exchange between distant nodes is limited by over-squashing. Motivated by these limitations, we propose Spatio-Spectral Graph Neural Networks (S$^2$GNNs) -- a new modeling paradigm for Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) that synergistically combines spatially and spectrally parametrized graph filters. Parameterizing filters partially in the frequency domain enables global yet efficient information propagation. We show that S$^2$GNNs vanquish over-squashing and yield strictly tighter approximation-theoretic error bounds than MPGNNs. Further, rethinking graph convolutions at a fundamental level unlocks new design spaces. For example, S$^2$GNNs allow for free positional encodings that make them strictly more expressive than the 1-Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) test. Moreover, to obtain general-purpose S$^2$GNNs, we propose spectrally parametrized filters for directed graphs. S$^2$GNNs outperform spatial MPGNNs, graph transformers, and graph rewirings, e.g., on the peptide long-range benchmark tasks, and are competitive with state-of-the-art sequence modeling. On a 40 GB GPU, S$^2$GNNs scale to millions of nodes.</p></details> | <details><summary>46 pa...</summary><p>46 pages, 27 figures, 12 tables</p></details> |

Digital Subtraction Angiography (DSA) sequences, recognized as the golden standard for diagnosing CVDs, can clearly visualize the dynamic flow and reveal pathological conditions within the cerebrovasculature. Therefore, precise segmentation of cerebral arteries (CAs) and classification between their main trunks and branches are crucial for physicians to accurately quantify diseases. However, achieving accurate CA segmentation in DSA sequences remains a challenging task due to small vessels with low contrast, and ambiguity between vessels and residual skull structures. Moreover, the lack of publicly available datasets limits exploration in the field. In this paper, we introduce a DSA Sequence-based Cerebral Artery segmentation dataset (DSCA), the first publicly accessible dataset designed specifically for pixel-level semantic segmentation of CAs. Additionally, we propose DSANet, a spatio-temporal network for CA segmentation in DSA sequences. Unlike existing DSA segmentation methods that focus only on a single frame, the proposed DSANet introduces a separate temporal encoding branch to capture dynamic vessel details across multiple frames. To enhance small vessel segmentation and improve vessel connectivity, we design a novel TemporalFormer module to capture global context and correlations among sequential frames. Furthermore, we develop a Spatio-Temporal Fusion (STF) module to effectively integrate spatial and temporal features from the encoder. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DSANet outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in CA segmentation, achieving a Dice of 0.9033.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Framework for Spatio-Temporal Graph Analytics In Field Sports](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13109v1)** | 2024-05-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The global sports analytics industry has a market value of USD 3.78 billion in 2023. The increase of wearables such as GPS sensors has provided analysts with large fine-grained datasets detailing player performance. Traditional analysis of this data focuses on individual athletes with measures of internal and external loading such as distance covered in speed zones or rate of perceived exertion. However these metrics do not provide enough information to understand team dynamics within field sports. The spatio-temporal nature of match play necessitates an investment in date-engineering to adequately transform the data into a suitable format to extract features such as areas of activity. In this paper we present an approach to construct Time-Window Spatial Activity Graphs (TWGs) for field sports. Using GPS data obtained from Gaelic Football matches we demonstrate how our approach can be utilised to extract spatio-temporal features from GPS sensor data</p></details> |  |

The primary challenge in achieving precise load forecasting for EVCS lies in accounting for the nonlinear of charging behaviors, the spatial interactions among different stations, and the intricate temporal variations in usage patterns. To address these challenges, we propose a Multiscale Spatio-Temporal Enhanced Model (MSTEM) for effective load forecasting at EVCS. MSTEM incorporates a multiscale graph neural network to discern hierarchical nonlinear temporal dependencies across various time scales. Besides, it also integrates a recurrent learning component and a residual fusion mechanism, enhancing its capability to accurately capture spatial and temporal variations in charging patterns. The effectiveness of the proposed MSTEM has been validated through comparative analysis with six baseline models using three evaluation metrics. The case studies utilize real-world datasets for both fast and slow charging loads at EVCS in Perth, UK. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of MSTEM in short-term continuous load forecasting for EVCS.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 1 figure, AEEES 2024</p></details> |

Models for this task are usually trained with human-annotated sentences and bounding box supervision. This work addresses this task from a multimodal supervision perspective, proposing a framework for spatio-temporal action grounding trained on loose video and subtitle supervision only, without human annotation. To this end, we combine local representation learning, which focuses on leveraging fine-grained spatial information, with a global representation encoding that captures higher-level representations and incorporates both in a joint approach. To evaluate this challenging task in a real-life setting, a new benchmark dataset is proposed providing dense spatio-temporal grounding annotations in long, untrimmed, multi-action instructional videos for over 5K events. We evaluate the proposed approach and other methods on the proposed and standard downstream tasks showing that our method improves over current baselines in various settings, including spatial, temporal, and untrimmed multi-action spatio-temporal grounding.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be presented at CVPR 2024.

However, this is a nontrivial problem and poses two critical challenges: sparse spatio-temporal correlation between audio-video pairs and multimodal correlation overwriting that forgets audio-video relations. To tackle this problem, we propose a new continual audio-video pre-training method with two novel ideas: (1) Localized Patch Importance Scoring: we introduce a multimodal encoder to determine the importance score for each patch, emphasizing semantically intertwined audio-video patches. (2) Replay-guided Correlation Assessment: to reduce the corruption of previously learned audiovisual knowledge due to drift, we propose to assess the correlation of the current patches on the past steps to identify the patches exhibiting high correlations with the past steps. Based on the results from the two ideas, we perform probabilistic patch selection for effective continual audio-video pre-training. Experimental validation on multiple benchmarks shows that our method achieves a 3.69%p of relative performance gain in zero-shot retrieval tasks compared to strong continual learning baselines, while reducing memory consumption by ~45%.</p></details> | ICML 2024 |

Despite the significant strides made by graph-based networks in spatio-temporal forecasting, there remain two pivotal factors closely related to forecasting performance that need further consideration: time delays in propagation dynamics and multi-scale high-dimensional interactions. In this work, we present a Series-Aligned Multi-Scale Graph Learning (SAMSGL) framework, aiming to enhance forecasting performance. In order to handle time delays in spatial interactions, we propose a series-aligned graph convolution layer to facilitate the aggregation of non-delayed graph signals, thereby mitigating the influence of time delays for the improvement in accuracy. To understand global and local spatio-temporal interactions, we develop a spatio-temporal architecture via multi-scale graph learning, which encompasses two essential components: multi-scale graph structure learning and graph-fully connected (Graph-FC) blocks. The multi-scale graph structure learning includes a global graph structure to learn both delayed and non-delayed node embeddings, as well as a local one to learn node variations influenced by neighboring factors. The Graph-FC blocks synergistically fuse spatial and temporal information to boost prediction accuracy. To evaluate the performance of SAMSGL, we conduct experiments on meteorological and traffic forecasting datasets, which demonstrate its effectiveness and superiority.</p></details> | Accepted by Chaos |

In order to summarise information encompassed in such data, we combine two well known statistical modelling methods. To account for the spatial dimension, we use the intrinsic modification of the conditional autoregression, and incorporate it with the hidden Markov model, allowing the spatial patterns to vary over time. We apply our method into parish register data considering deaths caused by measles in Finland in 1750-1850, and gain novel insight of previously undiscovered infection dynamics. Five distinctive, reoccurring states describing spatially and temporally differing infection burden and potential routes of spread are identified. We also find that there is a change in the occurrences of the most typical spatial patterns circa 1812, possibly due to changes in communication routes after major administrative transformations in Finland.</p></details> |  |

Mobile networks offer a promising alternative using network activity counts, but these lack crucial directionality. Thus, we present the TeltoMob dataset, featuring undirected telecom counts and corresponding directional flows, to predict directional mobility flows on roadways. To address this, we propose a two-stage spatio-temporal graph neural network (STGNN) framework. The first stage uses a pre-trained STGNN to process telecom data, while the second stage integrates directional and geographic insights for accurate prediction. Our experiments demonstrate the framework's compatibility with various STGNN models and confirm its effectiveness. We also show how to incorporate the framework into real-world transportation systems, enhancing sustainable urban mobility.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 Fig...</summary><p>8 Figures, 5 Tables.

This issue is particularly challenging in spatio-temporal analyses, where it has been less explored so far. To study the effects of air pollution on mortality in Italy, we argue that a model that simultaneously accounts for spatio-temporal confounding and for the non-linear form of the effect of interest is needed. To this end, we propose a Bayesian dynamic generalized linear model, which allows for a non-linear association and for a decomposition of the exposure effect into two components. This decomposition accommodates associations with the outcome at fine and coarse temporal and spatial scales of variation. These features, when combined, allow reducing the spatio-temporal confounding bias and recovering the true shape of the association, as demonstrated through simulation studies. The results from the real-data application indicate that the exposure effect seems to have different magnitudes in different seasons, with peaks in the summer. We hypothesize that this could be due to possible interactions between the exposure variable with air temperature and unmeasured confounders.</p></details> | 40 pages, 11 figures |

This approach proves advantageous in staving off computational challenges that constitute known hindrances to existing nonparametric quantile regression methods when the number of predictors is much larger than the available sample size. We investigate conditions under which estimation is feasible and of good overall quality and obtain sharp approximations that we employ to devising statistical inference methodology. These include simultaneous confidence intervals and tests of hypotheses, whose asymptotics is borne by a non-trivial functional central limit theorem tailored to martingale differences. Additionally, we provide finite-sample results through various simulations which, accompanied by an illustrative application to real-worldesque data (on electricity demand), offer guarantees on the performance of the proposed methodology.</p></details> | <details><summary>33 pa...</summary><p>33 pages, 2 figures and accompanying supplementary documentation</p></details> |

With its inherent decentralization and immutability, blockchain offers itself as a potential solution for these requirements. However, the practicality of incorporating blockchain into real-time sensor data storage systems is a topic that demands in-depth examination. While blockchain promises unmatched data security and auditability, some intrinsic qualities, namely scalability restrictions, transactional delays, and escalating storage demands, impede its seamless deployment in high-frequency, voluminous data contexts typical of real-time sensors. This essay launches a methodical investigation into these difficulties, illuminating their underlying causes, potential effects, and potential countermeasures. In addition, we present a novel pragmatic experimental setup and analysis of blockchain for smart system applications, with an extended discussion of the benefits and disadvantages of deploying blockchain based solutions for smart system ecosystems.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we focus on a generalization, called $VRPPDSTCtd$, in which the travel-time metric is \emph{time-dependent}: the traversal-time per road segment (represented as a directed arc) is determined by some function of the departure-time from its tail towards its head. Time-dependence makes things much more complicated, even for the simpler problem of computing earliest-arrival-time paths which is a crucial subroutine to be solved (numerous times) by $VRPPDSTCtd$ schedulers. We propose two \emph{online} schedulers of requests to workers, one which is a time-dependent variant of the classical Plain-Insertion heuristic, and an extension of it trying to digest some sort of forecasts for future demands for service. We enrich these two online schedulers with two additional heuristics, one targeting for distance-balanced assignments of work loads to the workers and another that makes local-search-improvements to the produced solutions. We conduct a careful experimental evaluation of the proposed algorithms on a real-world instance, with or without these heuristics, and compare their quality with human-curated assignments provided by professional experts (human operators at actual pickup-and-delivery control centers), and also with feasible solutions constructed from a relaxed MILP formulation of $VRPPDSTCtd$, which is also introduced in this paper. Our findings are quite encouraging, demonstrating that the proposed algorithms produce solutions which (i) are significant improvements over the human-curated assignments, and (ii) have overall quality pretty close to that of the (extremely time-consuming) solutions provided by an exact solver for the MILP formulation.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, extended version of the ATMOS 2024 accepted paper</p></details> |

More specifically, we examine projected gradient play in smooth monotone repeated network games in which the agents' participation and connectivity vary over time. We model this changing system with a stochastic network which takes a new independent realization at each repetition. We show that the strategy profile learned by the agents through projected gradient dynamics over the sequence of network realizations converges to a Nash equilibrium of the game in which players minimize their expected cost, almost surely and in the mean-square sense. We then show that the learned strategy profile is an almost Nash equilibrium of the game played by the agents at each stage of the repeated game with high probability. Using these two results, we derive non-asymptotic bounds on the regret incurred by the agents.</p></details> | 10 pages |

This overlooks the inherent characteristic of time-series data containing both time and frequency features. In this work, we present Spectral eXplanation (SpectralX), an XAI framework that provides time-frequency explanations for time-series black-box classifiers. This easily adaptable framework enables users to "plug-in" various perturbation-based XAI methods for any pre-trained time-series classification models to assess their impact on the explanation quality without having to modify the framework architecture. Additionally, we introduce Feature Importance Approximations (FIA), a new perturbation-based XAI method. These methods consist of feature insertion, deletion, and combination techniques to enhance computational efficiency and class-specific explanations in time-series classification tasks. We conduct extensive experiments in the generated synthetic dataset and various UCR Time-Series datasets to first compare the explanation performance of FIA and other existing perturbation-based XAI methods in both time-domain and time-frequency domain, and then show the superiority of our FIA in the time-frequency domain with the SpectralX framework. Finally, we conduct a user study to confirm the practicality of our FIA in SpectralX framework for class-specific time-frequency based time-series explanations.

There are very few quantitative evaluation methodologies and even fewer examples of actionable explanation, where the explanation methods are shown to objectively improve specific computational tasks on time series data. In this paper we focus on analyzing InterpretTime, a recent evaluation methodology for attribution methods applied to MTSC. We showcase some significant weaknesses of the original methodology and propose ideas to improve both its accuracy and efficiency. Unlike related work, we go beyond evaluation and also showcase the actionability of the produced explainer ranking, by using the best attribution methods for the task of channel selection in MTSC. We find that perturbation-based methods such as SHAP and Feature Ablation work well across a set of datasets, classifiers and tasks and outperform gradient-based methods. We apply the best ranked explainers to channel selection for MTSC and show significant data size reduction and improved classifier accuracy.</p></details> |  |

Several equivalent characterisations are given for the different definitions, in particular by orthogonal projections. We then define two mixed graphs based on different definitions of Granger causality and contemporaneous correlation, the (mixed) orthogonality graph and the local (mixed) orthogonality graph. In these graphs, the components of the process are represented by vertices, directed edges between the vertices visualise Granger causal influences and undirected edges visualise contemporaneous correlation between the component processes. Further, we introduce various notions of Markov properties in analogy to Eichler (2012), which relate paths in the graphs to different dependence structures of subprocesses, and we derive sufficient criteria for the (local) orthogonality graph to satisfy them. Finally, as an example, for the popular multivariate continuous-time AR (MCAR) processes, we explicitly characterise the edges in the (local) orthogonality graph by the model parameters.</p></details> |  |

Two of the prevalent ways to do this are through decision-time and background planning methods. In this study, we are interested in understanding how the value-based versions of these two planning methods will compare against each other across different settings. Towards this goal, we first consider the simplest instantiations of value-based decision-time and background planning methods and provide theoretical results on which one will perform better in the regular RL and transfer learning settings. Then, we consider the modern instantiations of them and provide hypotheses on which one will perform better in the same settings. Finally, we perform illustrative experiments to validate these theoretical results and hypotheses. Overall, our findings suggest that even though value-based versions of the two planning methods perform on par in their simplest instantiations, the modern instantiations of value-based decision-time planning methods can perform on par or better than the modern instantiations of value-based background planning methods in both the regular RL and transfer learning settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EWRL 2024</p></details> |
| **[Time-limited H2-optimal Model Order Reduction of Linear Systems with Quadratic Outputs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05965v1)** | 2024-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>An important class of dynamical systems with several practical applications is linear systems with quadratic outputs. These models have the same state equation as standard linear time-invariant systems but differ in their output equations, which are nonlinear quadratic functions of the system states. When dealing with models of exceptionally high order, the computational demands for simulation and analysis can become overwhelming. In such cases, model order reduction proves to be a useful technique, as it allows for constructing a reduced-order model that accurately represents the essential characteristics of the original high-order system while significantly simplifying its complexity. In time-limited model order reduction, the main goal is to maintain the output response of the original system within a specific time range in the reduced-order model. To assess the error within this time interval, a mathematical expression for the time-limited $\mathcal{H}_2$-norm is derived in this paper. This norm acts as a measure of the accuracy of the reduced-order model within the specified time range. Subsequently, the necessary conditions for achieving a local optimum of the time-limited $\mathcal{H}_2$ norm error are derived. The inherent inability to satisfy these optimality conditions within the Petrov-Galerkin projection framework is also discussed. After that, a stationary point iteration algorithm based on the optimality conditions and Petrov-Galerkin projection is proposed. Upon convergence, this algorithm fulfills three of the four optimality conditions. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, a numerical example is provided that showcases its ability to effectively approximate the original high-order model within the desired time interval.</p></details> |  |

This paper presents a signal processing framework that deterministically encodes continuous-time signals into biologically feasible spike trains, and addresses the questions about representable signal classes and reconstruction bounds. The framework considers encoding of a signal through spike trains generated by an ensemble of neurons using a convolve-then-threshold mechanism with various convolution kernels. A closed-form solution to the inverse problem, from spike trains to signal reconstruction, is derived in the Hilbert space of shifted kernel functions, ensuring sparse representation of a generalized Finite Rate of Innovation (FRI) class of signals. Additionally, inspired by real-time processing in biological systems, an efficient iterative version of the optimal reconstruction is formulated that considers only a finite window of past spikes, ensuring robustness of the technique to ill-conditioned encoding; convergence guarantees of the windowed reconstruction to the optimal solution are then provided. Experiments on a large audio dataset demonstrate excellent reconstruction accuracy at spike rates as low as one-fifth of the Nyquist rate, while showing clear competitive advantage in comparison to state-of-the-art sparse coding techniques in the low spike rate regime.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, including a 9-page appendix, 8 figures.

The emergence of LTSF-Linear, with its straightforward linear architecture, has notably outperformed transformer-based counterparts, prompting a reevaluation of the transformer's utility in time series forecasting. In response, this paper presents an adaptation of a recent architecture termed extended LSTM (xLSTM) for LTSF. xLSTM incorporates exponential gating and a revised memory structure with higher capacity that has good potential for LTSF. Our adopted architecture for LTSF termed as xLSTMTime surpasses current approaches. We compare xLSTMTime's performance against various state-of-the-art models across multiple real-world da-tasets, demonstrating superior forecasting capabilities. Our findings suggest that refined recurrent architectures can offer competitive alternatives to transformer-based models in LTSF tasks, po-tentially redefining the landscape of time series forecasting.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large language models can be zero-shot anomaly detectors for time series?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14755v2)** | 2024-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies have shown the ability of large language models to perform a variety of tasks, including time series forecasting. The flexible nature of these models allows them to be used for many applications. In this paper, we present a novel study of large language models used for the challenging task of time series anomaly detection. This problem entails two aspects novel for LLMs: the need for the model to identify part of the input sequence (or multiple parts) as anomalous; and the need for it to work with time series data rather than the traditional text input. We introduce sigllm, a framework for time series anomaly detection using large language models. Our framework includes a time-series-to-text conversion module, as well as end-to-end pipelines that prompt language models to perform time series anomaly detection. We investigate two paradigms for testing the abilities of large language models to perform the detection task. First, we present a prompt-based detection method that directly asks a language model to indicate which elements of the input are anomalies. Second, we leverage the forecasting capability of a large language model to guide the anomaly detection process. We evaluated our framework on 11 datasets spanning various sources and 10 pipelines. We show that the forecasting method significantly outperformed the prompting method in all 11 datasets with respect to the F1 score. Moreover, while large language models are capable of finding anomalies, state-of-the-art deep learning models are still superior in performance, achieving results 30% better than large language models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large Language Models Are Zero-Shot Time Series Forecasters](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07820v3)** | 2024-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>By encoding time series as a string of numerical digits, we can frame time series forecasting as next-token prediction in text. Developing this approach, we find that large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-3 and LLaMA-2 can surprisingly zero-shot extrapolate time series at a level comparable to or exceeding the performance of purpose-built time series models trained on the downstream tasks. To facilitate this performance, we propose procedures for effectively tokenizing time series data and converting discrete distributions over tokens into highly flexible densities over continuous values. We argue the success of LLMs for time series stems from their ability to naturally represent multimodal distributions, in conjunction with biases for simplicity, and repetition, which align with the salient features in many time series, such as repeated seasonal trends. We also show how LLMs can naturally handle missing data without imputation through non-numerical text, accommodate textual side information, and answer questions to help explain predictions. While we find that increasing model size generally improves performance on time series, we show GPT-4 can perform worse than GPT-3 because of how it tokenizes numbers, and poor uncertainty calibration, which is likely the result of alignment interventions such as RLHF.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2023.

Current pre-training methods are limited in either unidirectional next-token prediction or randomly masked token prediction. We propose a novel architecture called Bidirectional Timely Generative Pre-trained Transformer (BiTimelyGPT), which pre-trains on biosignals and longitudinal clinical records by both next-token and previous-token prediction in alternating transformer layers. This pre-training task preserves original distribution and data shapes of the time-series. Additionally, the full-rank forward and backward attention matrices exhibit more expressive representation capabilities. Using biosignals and longitudinal clinical records, BiTimelyGPT demonstrates superior performance in predicting neurological functionality, disease diagnosis, and physiological signs. By visualizing the attention heatmap, we observe that the pre-trained BiTimelyGPT can identify discriminative segments from biosignal time-series sequences, even more so after fine-tuning on the task.</p></details> |  |
| **[An End-to-End Model for Time Series Classification In the Presence of Missing Values](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05849v1)** | 2024-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series classification with missing data is a prevalent issue in time series analysis, as temporal data often contain missing values in practical applications. The traditional two-stage approach, which handles imputation and classification separately, can result in sub-optimal performance as label information is not utilized in the imputation process. On the other hand, a one-stage approach can learn features under missing information, but feature representation is limited as imputed errors are propagated in the classification process. To overcome these challenges, this study proposes an end-to-end neural network that unifies data imputation and representation learning within a single framework, allowing the imputation process to take advantage of label information. Differing from previous methods, our approach places less emphasis on the accuracy of imputation data and instead prioritizes classification performance. A specifically designed multi-scale feature learning module is implemented to extract useful information from the noise-imputation data. The proposed model is evaluated on 68 univariate time series datasets from the UCR archive, as well as a multivariate time series dataset with various missing data ratios and 4 real-world datasets with missing information. The results indicate that the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art approaches for incomplete time series classification, particularly in scenarios with high levels of missing data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Real-Time Drowsiness Detection Using Eye Aspect Ratio and Facial Landmark Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05836v1)** | 2024-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Drowsiness detection is essential for improving safety in areas such as transportation and workplace health. This study presents a real-time system designed to detect drowsiness using the Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR) and facial landmark detection techniques. The system leverages Dlibs pre-trained shape predictor model to accurately detect and monitor 68 facial landmarks, which are used to compute the EAR. By establishing a threshold for the EAR, the system identifies when eyes are closed, indicating potential drowsiness. The process involves capturing a live video stream, detecting faces in each frame, extracting eye landmarks, and calculating the EAR to assess alertness. Our experiments show that the system reliably detects drowsiness with high accuracy while maintaining low computational demands. This study offers a strong solution for real-time drowsiness detection, with promising applications in driver monitoring and workplace safety. Future research will investigate incorporating additional physiological and contextual data to further enhance detection accuracy and reliability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Test-Time Prompt Tuning for Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05775v1)** | 2024-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models have showcased impressive zero-shot classification capabilities when equipped with suitable text prompts. Previous studies have shown the effectiveness of test-time prompt tuning; however, these methods typically require per-image prompt adaptation during inference, which incurs high computational budgets and limits scalability and practical deployment. To overcome this issue, we introduce Self-TPT, a novel framework leveraging Self-supervised learning for efficient Test-time Prompt Tuning. The key aspect of Self-TPT is that it turns to efficient predefined class adaptation via self-supervised learning, thus avoiding computation-heavy per-image adaptation at inference. Self-TPT begins by co-training the self-supervised and the classification task using source data, then applies the self-supervised task exclusively for test-time new class adaptation. Specifically, we propose Contrastive Prompt Learning (CPT) as the key task for self-supervision. CPT is designed to minimize the intra-class distances while enhancing inter-class distinguishability via contrastive learning. Furthermore, empirical evidence suggests that CPT could closely mimic back-propagated gradients of the classification task, offering a plausible explanation for its effectiveness. Motivated by this finding, we further introduce a gradient matching loss to explicitly enhance the gradient similarity. We evaluated Self-TPT across three challenging zero-shot benchmarks. The results consistently demonstrate that Self-TPT not only significantly reduces inference costs but also achieves state-of-the-art performance, effectively balancing the efficiency-efficacy trade-off.</p></details> |  |
| **[LI-TTA: Language Informed Test-Time Adaptation for Automatic Speech Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05769v1)** | 2024-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) has emerged as a crucial solution to the domain shift challenge, wherein the target environment diverges from the original training environment. A prime exemplification is TTA for Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), which enhances model performance by leveraging output prediction entropy minimization as a self-supervision signal. However, a key limitation of this self-supervision lies in its primary focus on acoustic features, with minimal attention to the linguistic properties of the input. To address this gap, we propose Language Informed Test-Time Adaptation (LI-TTA), which incorporates linguistic insights during TTA for ASR. LI-TTA integrates corrections from an external language model to merge linguistic with acoustic information by minimizing the CTC loss from the correction alongside the standard TTA loss. With extensive experiments, we show that LI-TTA effectively improves the performance of TTA for ASR in various distribution shift situations.</p></details> | INTERSPEECH 2024 |
| **[MTSCI: A Conditional Diffusion Model for Multivariate Time Series Consistent Imputation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05740v1)** | 2024-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Missing values are prevalent in multivariate time series, compromising the integrity of analyses and degrading the performance of downstream tasks. Consequently, research has focused on multivariate time series imputation, aiming to accurately impute the missing values based on available observations. A key research question is how to ensure imputation consistency, i.e., intra-consistency between observed and imputed values, and inter-consistency between adjacent windows after imputation. However, previous methods rely solely on the inductive bias of the imputation targets to guide the learning process, ignoring imputation consistency and ultimately resulting in poor performance. Diffusion models, known for their powerful generative abilities, prefer to generate consistent results based on available observations. Therefore, we propose a conditional diffusion model for Multivariate Time Series Consistent Imputation (MTSCI). Specifically, MTSCI employs a contrastive complementary mask to generate dual views during the forward noising process. Then, the intra contrastive loss is calculated to ensure intra-consistency between the imputed and observed values. Meanwhile, MTSCI utilizes a mixup mechanism to incorporate conditional information from adjacent windows during the denoising process, facilitating the inter-consistency between imputed samples. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance on multivariate time series imputation task under different missing scenarios.

Actually, even if a user is interested in the live-streaming author, it still may be an negative watching (e.g., short-view < 3s) since the real-time content is not attractive enough. Therefore, for live-streaming recommendation, there exists a challenging task: how do we recommend the live-streaming at right moment for users? Additionally, our platform's major exposure content is short short-video, and the amount of exposed short-video is 9x more than exposed live-streaming. Thus users will leave more behaviors on short-videos, which leads to a serious data imbalance problem making the live-streaming data could not fully reflect user interests. In such case, there raises another challenging task: how do we utilize users' short-video behaviors to make live-streaming recommendation better?</p></details> | Work in progress |

This can lead to inefficiencies as the optimal control rate varies with task requirements. We propose the Multi-Objective Soft Elastic Actor-Critic (MOSEAC), an off-policy actor-critic algorithm that uses elastic time steps to dynamically adjust the control frequency. This approach minimizes computational resources by selecting the lowest viable frequency. We show that MOSEAC converges and produces stable policies at the theoretical level, and validate our findings in a real-time 3D racing game. MOSEAC significantly outperformed other variable time step approaches in terms of energy efficiency and task effectiveness. Additionally, MOSEAC demonstrated faster and more stable training, showcasing its potential for real-world RL applications in robotics.</p></details> |  |

While increasing biomedical tasks have employed state-of-the-art language models, there are very few studies have examined temporal effects on biomedical models when data usually shifts across development and deployment. This study fills the gap by statistically probing relations between language model performance and data shifts across three biomedical tasks. We deploy diverse metrics to evaluate model performance, distance methods to measure data drifts, and statistical methods to quantify temporal effects on biomedical language models. Our study shows that time matters for deploying biomedical language models, while the degree of performance degradation varies by biomedical tasks and statistical quantification approaches. We believe this study can establish a solid benchmark to evaluate and assess temporal effects on deploying biomedical language models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AMIA 2024 Annual Symposium</p></details> |
| **[Scoring Time Intervals using Non-Hierarchical Transformer For Automatic Piano Transcription](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09466v5)** | 2024-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The neural semi-Markov Conditional Random Field (semi-CRF) framework has demonstrated promise for event-based piano transcription. In this framework, all events (notes or pedals) are represented as closed time intervals tied to specific event types. The neural semi-CRF approach requires an interval scoring matrix that assigns a score for every candidate interval. However, designing an efficient and expressive architecture for scoring intervals is not trivial. This paper introduces a simple method for scoring intervals using scaled inner product operations that resemble how attention scoring is done in transformers. We show theoretically that, due to the special structure from encoding the non-overlapping intervals, under a mild condition, the inner product operations are expressive enough to represent an ideal scoring matrix that can yield the correct transcription result. We then demonstrate that an encoder-only structured non-hierarchical transformer backbone, operating only on a low-time-resolution feature map, is capable of transcribing piano notes and pedals with high accuracy and time precision. The experiment shows that our approach achieves the new state-of-the-art performance across all subtasks in terms of the F1 measure on the Maestro dataset.</p></details> | Camera-ready version |
| **[Strong denoising of financial time-series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05690v1)** | 2024-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper we introduce a method for significantly improving the signal to noise ratio in financial data. The approach relies on combining a target variable with different context variables and use auto-encoders (AEs) to learn reconstructions of the combined inputs. The objective is to obtain agreement among pairs of AEs which are trained on related but different inputs and for which they are forced to find common ground. The training process is set up as a "conversation" where the models take turns at producing a prediction (speaking) and reconciling own predictions with the output of the other AE (listening), until an agreement is reached. This leads to a new way of constraining the complexity of the data representation generated by the AE. Unlike standard regularization whose strength needs to be decided by the designer, the proposed mutual regularization uses the partner network to detect and amend the lack of generality of the learned representation of the data. The integration of alternative perspectives enhances the de-noising capacity of a single AE and allows us to discover new regularities in financial time-series which can be converted into profitable trading strategies.</p></details> |  |
| **[SRTFD: Scalable Real-Time Fault Diagnosis through Online Continual Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05681v1)** | 2024-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fault diagnosis (FD) is essential for maintaining operational safety and minimizing economic losses by detecting system abnormalities. Recently, deep learning (DL)-driven FD methods have gained prominence, offering significant improvements in precision and adaptability through the utilization of extensive datasets and advanced DL models. Modern industrial environments, however, demand FD methods that can handle new fault types, dynamic conditions, large-scale data, and provide real-time responses with minimal prior information. Although online continual learning (OCL) demonstrates potential in addressing these requirements by enabling DL models to continuously learn from streaming data, it faces challenges such as data redundancy, imbalance, and limited labeled data. To overcome these limitations, we propose SRTFD, a scalable real-time fault diagnosis framework that enhances OCL with three critical methods: Retrospect Coreset Selection (RCS), which selects the most relevant data to reduce redundant training and improve efficiency; Global Balance Technique (GBT), which ensures balanced coreset selection and robust model performance; and Confidence and Uncertainty-driven Pseudo-label Learning (CUPL), which updates the model using unlabeled data for continuous adaptation. Extensive experiments on a real-world dataset and two public simulated datasets demonstrate SRTFD's effectiveness and potential for providing advanced, scalable, and precise fault diagnosis in modern industrial systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[PS-TTL: Prototype-based Soft-labels and Test-Time Learning for Few-shot Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05674v1)** | 2024-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, Few-Shot Object Detection (FSOD) has gained widespread attention and made significant progress due to its ability to build models with a good generalization power using extremely limited annotated data. The fine-tuning based paradigm is currently dominating this field, where detectors are initially pre-trained on base classes with sufficient samples and then fine-tuned on novel ones with few samples, but the scarcity of labeled samples of novel classes greatly interferes precisely fitting their data distribution, thus hampering the performance. To address this issue, we propose a new framework for FSOD, namely Prototype-based Soft-labels and Test-Time Learning (PS-TTL). Specifically, we design a Test-Time Learning (TTL) module that employs a mean-teacher network for self-training to discover novel instances from test data, allowing detectors to learn better representations and classifiers for novel classes. Furthermore, we notice that even though relatively low-confidence pseudo-labels exhibit classification confusion, they still tend to recall foreground. We thus develop a Prototype-based Soft-labels (PS) strategy through assessing similarities between low-confidence pseudo-labels and category prototypes as soft-labels to unleash their potential, which substantially mitigates the constraints posed by few-shot samples. Extensive experiments on both the VOC and COCO benchmarks show that PS-TTL achieves the state-of-the-art, highlighting its effectiveness. The code and model are available at https://github.com/gaoyingjay/PS-TTL.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACM MM 2024</p></details> |

Existing RNN layers have linear complexity, but their performance in long context is limited by the expressive power of their hidden state. We propose a new class of sequence modeling layers with linear complexity and an expressive hidden state. The key idea is to make the hidden state a machine learning model itself, and the update rule a step of self-supervised learning. Since the hidden state is updated by training even on test sequences, our layers are called Test-Time Training (TTT) layers. We consider two instantiations: TTT-Linear and TTT-MLP, whose hidden state is a linear model and a two-layer MLP respectively. We evaluate our instantiations at the scale of 125M to 1.3B parameters, comparing with a strong Transformer and Mamba, a modern RNN. Both TTT-Linear and TTT-MLP match or exceed the baselines. Similar to Transformer, they can keep reducing perplexity by conditioning on more tokens, while Mamba cannot after 16k context. With preliminary systems optimization, TTT-Linear is already faster than Transformer at 8k context and matches Mamba in wall-clock time. TTT-MLP still faces challenges in memory I/O, but shows larger potential in long context, pointing to a promising direction for future research.</p></details> |  |

We use a multi-layer 2D grid map representation obtained by summing the intensities of lidar point clouds that lie in multiple non-overlapping height intervals. We isolate a neighborhood of points reflected from transparent obstacles by comparing the intensities in the different 2D grid map layers. Using the neighborhood, we linearly extrapolate the transparent obstacle by computing a tangential line segment and use it to perform safe, real-time collision avoidance. Finally, we also demonstrate our transparent object isolation's applicability to mapping an environment. We demonstrate that our approach detects transparent objects made of various materials (glass, acrylic, PVC), arbitrary shapes, colors, and textures in a variety of real-world indoor and outdoor scenarios with varying lighting conditions. We compare our method with other glass/transparent object detection methods that use RGB images, 2D laser scans, etc. in these benchmark scenarios. We demonstrate superior detection accuracy in terms of F-score improvement at least by 12.74% and 38.46% decrease in mean absolute error (MAE), improved navigation success rates (at least two times better than the second-best), and a real-time inference rate (~50Hz on a mobile CPU). We will release our code and challenging benchmarks for future evaluations upon publication.</p></details> |  |
| **[TOSS: Real-time Tracking and Moving Object Segmentation for Static Scene Mapping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05453v1)** | 2024-08-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Safe navigation with simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) for autonomous robots is crucial in challenging environments. To achieve this goal, detecting moving objects in the surroundings and building a static map are essential. However, existing moving object segmentation methods have been developed separately for each field, making it challenging to perform real-time navigation and precise static map building simultaneously. In this paper, we propose an integrated real-time framework that combines online tracking-based moving object segmentation with static map building. For safe navigation, we introduce a computationally efficient hierarchical association cost matrix to enable real-time moving object segmentation. In the context of precise static mapping, we present a voting-based method, DS-Voting, designed to achieve accurate dynamic object removal and static object recovery by emphasizing their spatio-temporal differences. We evaluate our proposed method quantitatively and qualitatively in the SemanticKITTI dataset and real-world challenging environments. The results demonstrate that dynamic objects can be clearly distinguished and incorporated into static map construction, even in stairs, steep hills, and dense vegetation.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, The 11th International Conference on Robot Intelligence Technology and Applications (RiTA 2023)</p></details> |
| **[FTMixer: Frequency and Time Domain Representations Fusion for Time Series Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15256v2)** | 2024-08-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series data can be represented in both the time and frequency domains, with the time domain emphasizing local dependencies and the frequency domain highlighting global dependencies. To harness the strengths of both domains in capturing local and global dependencies, we propose the Frequency and Time Domain Mixer (FTMixer). To exploit the global characteristics of the frequency domain, we introduce the Frequency Channel Convolution (FCC) module, designed to capture global inter-series dependencies. Inspired by the windowing concept in frequency domain transformations, we present the Windowing Frequency Convolution (WFC) module to capture local dependencies. The WFC module first applies frequency transformation within each window, followed by convolution across windows. Furthermore, to better capture these local dependencies, we employ channel-independent scheme to mix the time domain and frequency domain patches. Notably, FTMixer employs the Discrete Cosine Transformation (DCT) with real numbers instead of the complex-number-based Discrete Fourier Transformation (DFT), enabling direct utilization of modern deep learning operators in the frequency domain. Extensive experimental results across seven real-world long-term time series datasets demonstrate the superiority of FTMixer, in terms of both forecasting performance and computational efficiency.</p></details> |  |

As a classic machine learning task, time series forecasting has recently been boosted by LLMs. Recent works treat large language models as \emph{zero-shot} time series reasoners without further fine-tuning, which achieves remarkable performance. However, there are some unexplored research problems when applying LLMs for time series forecasting under the zero-shot setting. For instance, the LLMs' preferences for the input time series are less understood. In this paper, by comparing LLMs with traditional time series forecasting models, we observe many interesting properties of LLMs in the context of time series forecasting. First, our study shows that LLMs perform well in predicting time series with clear patterns and trends, but face challenges with datasets lacking periodicity. This observation can be explained by the ability of LLMs to recognize the underlying period within datasets, which is supported by our experiments. In addition, the input strategy is investigated, and it is found that incorporating external knowledge and adopting natural language paraphrases substantially improve the predictive performance of LLMs for time series. Overall, our study contributes insight into LLMs' advantages and limitations in time series forecasting under different conditions.</p></details> |  |

| **[A UAV-Enabled Time-Sensitive Data Collection Scheme for Grassland Monitoring Edge Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20585v2)** | 2024-08-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Grassland monitoring is essential for the sustainable development of grassland resources. Traditional Internet of Things (IoT) devices generate critical ecological data, making data loss unacceptable, but the harsh environment complicates data collection. Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) and mobile edge computing (MEC) offer efficient data collection solutions, enhancing performance on resource-limited mobile devices. In this context, this paper is the first to investigate a UAV-enabled time-sensitive data collection problem (TSDCMP) within grassland monitoring edge networks (GMENs). Unlike many existing data collection scenarios, this problem has three key challenges. First, the total amount of data collected depends significantly on the data collection duration and arrival time of UAV at each access point (AP). Second, the volume of data at different APs varies among regions due to differences in monitoring objects and vegetation coverage. Third, the service requests time and locations from APs are often not adjacent topologically. To address these issues, We formulate the TSDCMP for UAV-enabled GMENs as a mixed-integer programming model in a single trip. This model considers constraints such as the limited energy of UAV, the coupled routing and time scheduling, and the state of APs and UAV arrival time. Subsequently, we propose a novel cooperative heuristic algorithm based on temporal-spatial correlations (CHTSC) that integrates a modified dynamic programming (MDP) into an iterated local search to solve the TSDCMP for UAV-enabled GMENs. This approach fully takes into account the temporal and spatial relationships between consecutive service requests from APs. Systematic simulation studies demonstrate that the mixed-integer programming model effectively represents the TSDCMP within UAV-enabled GMENs.</p></details> |  |

This raises a natural question: How optimal can polynomial-time algorithms reach? Whereas algorithms for computing constant-factor optimal solutions have been developed, the constant factor is generally very large, limiting their application potential. In this work, among other breakthroughs, we propose the first low-polynomial-time MAPF algorithms delivering $1$-$1.5$ (resp., $1$-$1.67$) asymptotic makespan optimality guarantees for 2D (resp., 3D) grids for random instances at a very high $1/3$ agent density, with high probability. Moreover, when regularly distributed obstacles are introduced, our methods experience no performance degradation. These methods generalize to support $100\%$ agent density. Regardless of the dimensionality and density, our high-quality methods are enabled by a unique hierarchical integration of two key building blocks. At the higher level, we apply the labeled Grid Rearrangement Algorithm (RTA), capable of performing efficient reconfiguration on grids through row/column shuffles. At the lower level, we devise novel methods that efficiently simulate row/column shuffles returned by RTA. Our implementations of RTA-based algorithms are highly effective in extensive numerical evaluations, demonstrating excellent scalability compared to other SOTA methods. For example, in 3D settings, \rta-based algorithms readily scale to grids with over $370,000$ vertices and over $120,000$ agents and consistently achieve conservative makespan optimality approaching $1.5$, as predicted by our theoretical analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2201.08976</p></details> |
| **[Constant-time Motion Planning with Anytime Refinement for Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00837v2)** | 2024-08-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robotic manipulators are essential for future autonomous systems, yet limited trust in their autonomy has confined them to rigid, task-specific systems. The intricate configuration space of manipulators, coupled with the challenges of obstacle avoidance and constraint satisfaction, often makes motion planning the bottleneck for achieving reliable and adaptable autonomy. Recently, a class of constant-time motion planners (CTMP) was introduced. These planners employ a preprocessing phase to compute data structures that enable online planning provably guarantee the ability to generate motion plans, potentially sub-optimal, within a user defined time bound. This framework has been demonstrated to be effective in a number of time-critical tasks. However, robotic systems often have more time allotted for planning than the online portion of CTMP requires, time that can be used to improve the solution. To this end, we propose an anytime refinement approach that works in combination with CTMP algorithms. Our proposed framework, as it operates as a constant time algorithm, rapidly generates an initial solution within a user-defined time threshold. Furthermore, functioning as an anytime algorithm, it iteratively refines the solution's quality within the allocated time budget. This enables our approach to strike a balance between guaranteed fast plan generation and the pursuit of optimization over time. We support our approach by elucidating its analytical properties, showing the convergence of the anytime component towards optimal solutions. Additionally, we provide empirical validation through simulation and real-world demonstrations on a 6 degree-of-freedom robot manipulator, applied to an assembly domain.</p></details> |  |

In many applications, the data grows dynamically, requiring their filters to expand along with the data. However, existing methods for expanding filters cannot maintain stable performance, memory footprint, and false positive rate (FPR) simultaneously. We address this problem with Aleph Filter, which makes the following contributions. (1) It supports all operations (insertions, queries, deletes, etc.) in constant time, no matter how much the data grows. (2) Given an estimate of how much the data will ultimately grow, Aleph Filter provides a memory vs. FPR trade-offs on par with static filters.</p></details> |  |

| **[AI-driven Java Performance Testing: Balancing Result Quality with Testing Time](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05100v1)** | 2024-08-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Performance testing aims at uncovering efficiency issues of software systems. In order to be both effective and practical, the design of a performance test must achieve a reasonable trade-off between result quality and testing time. This becomes particularly challenging in Java context, where the software undergoes a warm-up phase of execution, due to just-in-time compilation. During this phase, performance measurements are subject to severe fluctuations, which may adversely affect quality of performance test results. However, these approaches often provide suboptimal estimates of the warm-up phase, resulting in either insufficient or excessive warm-up iterations, which may degrade result quality or increase testing time. There is still a lack of consensus on how to properly address this problem. Here, we propose and study an AI-based framework to dynamically halt warm-up iterations at runtime. Specifically, our framework leverages recent advances in AI for Time Series Classification (TSC) to predict the end of the warm-up phase during test execution. We conduct experiments by training three different TSC models on half a million of measurement segments obtained from JMH microbenchmark executions. We find that our framework significantly improves the accuracy of the warm-up estimates provided by state-of-practice and state-of-the-art methods. This higher estimation accuracy results in a net improvement in either result quality or testing time for up to +35.3% of the microbenchmarks. Our study highlights that integrating AI to dynamically estimate the end of the warm-up phase can enhance the cost-effectiveness of Java performance testing.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in The 39th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Automated Software Engineering (ASE '24)</p></details> |
| **[Unlocking Decoding-time Controllability: Gradient-Free Multi-Objective Alignment with Contrastive Prompts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05094v1)** | 2024-08-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The task of multi-objective alignment aims at balancing and controlling the different alignment objectives (e.g., helpfulness, harmlessness and honesty) of large language models to meet the personalized requirements of different users. However, previous methods tend to train multiple models to deal with various user preferences, with the number of trained models growing linearly with the number of alignment objectives and the number of different preferences. Meanwhile, existing methods are generally poor in extensibility and require significant re-training for each new alignment objective considered. Considering the limitation of previous approaches, we propose MCA (Multi-objective Contrastive Alignemnt), which constructs an expert prompt and an adversarial prompt for each objective to contrast at the decoding time and balances the objectives through combining the contrast. Our approach is verified to be superior to previous methods in obtaining a well-distributed Pareto front among different alignment objectives.</p></details> |  |

It aims at optimizing the process of Learning from Demonstration (LfD), applied in the manufacturing sector. As the effectiveness of LfD is challenged by the quality and efficiency of human demonstrations, our approach offers a streamlined method to intuitively capture task requirements from human teachers, by reducing the need for multiple demonstrations. Furthermore, we propose an optimization-based smoothing algorithm that ensures time-optimal and jerk-regulated demonstration trajectories, while also adhering to the robot's kinematic constraints. The result is a significant reduction in noise, thereby boosting the robot's operation efficiency. Evaluations using a Franka Emika Research 3 (FR3) robot for a variety of tasks further substantiate the efficacy of our framework, highlighting its potential to transform kinesthetic demonstrations in contemporary manufacturing environments. Moreover, we take our proposed framework into a real manufacturing setting operated by an ABB YuMi robot and showcase its positive impact on LfD outcomes by performing a case study via Dynamic Movement Primitives (DMPs).</p></details> | 20 pages, 14 figures |

However, the real-time evolution of non-equilibrium quantum electronic systems poses a significant challenge for theoretical and computational approaches. This work introduces a variational approach for fermionic time-dependent wave functions, surpassing mean-field approximations by capturing many-body correlations. Our methodology introduces a parameterization of the time-evolving quantum state, enabling an accurate approximation of its evolution. To account for electron correlations, we employ time-dependent Jastrow factors and backflow transformations, which can be further enhanced by incorporating neural networks for function parameterization. We utilize the time-dependent variational Monte Carlo technique to efficiently compute optimal time-dependent parameters. Additionally, we introduce a new time-evolution method based on Trotter-root expansions of the propagator, enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of our simulations. The approach is demonstrated in three distinct systems: the solvable harmonic interaction model, the dynamics of a diatomic molecule in intense laser fields, and a quenched quantum dot. In all cases, we show clear signatures of many-body correlations in the dynamics that are not captured by mean-field methods. The results showcase the ability of our variational approach to accurately capture the time evolution of quantum states, providing insight into the quantum dynamics of interacting electronic systems, beyond the capabilities of mean-field.</p></details> |  |
| **[Transforming Time-Varying to Static Channels: The Power of Fluid Antenna Mobility](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04320v2)** | 2024-08-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper addresses the mobility problem with the assistance of fluid antenna (FA) on the user equipment (UE) side. We propose a matrix pencil-based moving port (MPMP) prediction method, which may transform the time-varying channel to a static channel by timely sliding the liquid. Different from the existing channel prediction method, we design a moving port selection method, which is the first attempt to transform the channel prediction to the port prediction by exploiting the movability of FA. Theoretical analysis shows that for the line-ofsight (LoS) channel, the prediction error of our proposed MPMP method may converge to zero, as the number of BS antennas and the port density of the FA are large enough. For a multi-path channel, we also derive the upper and lower bounds of the prediction error when the number of paths is large enough. When the UEs move at a speed of 60 or 120 km/h, simulation results show that, with the assistance of FA, our proposed MPMP method performs better than the existing channel prediction method.</p></details> |  |

Inspired by this progress, we explore the potential of foundation models for time-series forecasting in smart agriculture, a field often plagued by limited data availability. Specifically, this work presents a novel application of $\texttt{TimeGPT}$, a state-of-the-art (SOTA) time-series foundation model, to predict soil water potential ($\psi_\mathrm{soil}$), a key indicator of field water status that is typically used for irrigation advice. Traditionally, this task relies on a wide array of input variables. We explore $\psi_\mathrm{soil}$'s ability to forecast $\psi_\mathrm{soil}$ in: ($i$) a zero-shot setting, ($ii$) a fine-tuned setting relying solely on historic $\psi_\mathrm{soil}$ measurements, and ($iii$) a fine-tuned setting where we also add exogenous variables to the model. We compare $\texttt{TimeGPT}$'s performance to established SOTA baseline models for forecasting $\psi_\mathrm{soil}$. Our results demonstrate that $\texttt{TimeGPT}$ achieves competitive forecasting accuracy using only historical $\psi_\mathrm{soil}$ data, highlighting its remarkable potential for agricultural applications. This research paves the way for foundation time-series models for sustainable development in agriculture by enabling forecasting tasks that were traditionally reliant on extensive data collection and domain expertise.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, accepted at KDD '24 - Fragile Earth Workshop https://openreview.net/forum?id=GZBGhi4JfE</p></details> |

These real-world scenarios are formalized by our new universal computation model. Leveraging this model and new proof techniques, we discover tight lower bounds that apply to virtually all synchronous and asynchronous methods, including Minibatch SGD, Asynchronous SGD (Recht et al., 2011), and Picky SGD (Cohen et al., 2021). We show that these lower bounds, up to constant factors, are matched by the optimal Rennala SGD and Malenia SGD methods (Tyurin & Richt\'arik, 2023).</p></details> |  |

These processes can greatly benefit from advances in the field, as state-of-the-art approaches may aid in cases involving, for example, highly dimensional data. To provide the reader with understanding of the terminology, this survey introduces a novel taxonomy where a distinction between online and offline, and training and inference is made. Additionally, it presents the most popular data sets and evaluation metrics used in the literature, as well as a detailed analysis. Furthermore, this survey provides an extensive overview of the state-of-the-art model-based online semi- and unsupervised anomaly detection approaches for multivariate time-series data, categorising them into different model families and other properties. The biggest research challenge revolves around benchmarking, as currently there is no reliable way to compare different approaches against one another. This problem is two-fold: on the one hand, public data sets suffers from at least one fundamental flaw, while on the other hand, there is a lack of intuitive and representative evaluation metrics in the field. Moreover, the way most publications choose a detection threshold disregards real-world conditions, which hinders the application in the real world. To allow for tangible advances in the field, these issues must be addressed in future work.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence journal</p></details> |

Time series analytics is therefore crucial to unlocking the wealth of information implicit in available data. With the recent advancements in graph neural networks (GNNs), there has been a surge in GNN-based approaches for time series analysis. These approaches can explicitly model inter-temporal and inter-variable relationships, which traditional and other deep neural network-based methods struggle to do. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of graph neural networks for time series analysis (GNN4TS), encompassing four fundamental dimensions: forecasting, classification, anomaly detection, and imputation. Our aim is to guide designers and practitioners to understand, build applications, and advance research of GNN4TS. At first, we provide a comprehensive task-oriented taxonomy of GNN4TS. Then, we present and discuss representative research works and introduce mainstream applications of GNN4TS. A comprehensive discussion of potential future research directions completes the survey. This survey, for the first time, brings together a vast array of knowledge on GNN-based time series research, highlighting foundations, practical applications, and opportunities of graph neural networks for time series analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>37 pa...</summary><p>37 pages, 6 figures, 7 tables; Project page: https://github.com/KimMeen/Awesome-GNN4TS</p></details> |

Considering single LiDAR odometry often faces hardware failures and degradation in practical scenarios, Multi-LiDAR Odometry (MLO), as an emerging technology, is studied to enhance the performance of LiDAR-based localization and mapping systems. However, MLO can suffer from high computational complexity introduced by dense point clouds that are fused from multiple LiDARs, and the continuous-time measurement characteristic is constantly neglected by existing LiDAR odometry. This motivates us to develop a Continuous-Time and Efficient MLO, namely CTE-MLO, which can achieve accurate and real-time state estimation using multi-LiDAR measurements through a continuous-time perspective. In this paper, the Gaussian process estimation is naturally combined with the Kalman filter, which enables each LiDAR point in a point stream to query the corresponding continuous-time trajectory within its time instants. A decentralized multi-LiDAR synchronization scheme also be devised to combine points from separate LiDARs into a single point cloud without the requirement for primary LiDAR assignment. Moreover, with the aim of improving the real-time performance of MLO without sacrificing robustness, a point cloud sampling strategy is designed with the consideration of localizability. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through various scenarios, including public datasets and real-world autonomous driving experiments. The results demonstrate that the proposed CTE-MLO can achieve high-accuracy continuous-time state estimations in real-time and is demonstratively competitive compared to other state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Progressive Neural Network for Multi-Horizon Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19322v2)** | 2024-08-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we introduce ProNet, an novel deep learning approach designed for multi-horizon time series forecasting, adaptively blending autoregressive (AR) and non-autoregressive (NAR) strategies. Our method involves dividing the forecasting horizon into segments, predicting the most crucial steps in each segment non-autoregressively, and the remaining steps autoregressively. The segmentation process relies on latent variables, which effectively capture the significance of individual time steps through variational inference. In comparison to AR models, ProNet showcases remarkable advantages, requiring fewer AR iterations, resulting in faster prediction speed, and mitigating error accumulation. On the other hand, when compared to NAR models, ProNet takes into account the interdependency of predictions in the output space, leading to improved forecasting accuracy. Our comprehensive evaluation, encompassing four large datasets, and an ablation study, demonstrate the effectiveness of ProNet, highlighting its superior performance in terms of accuracy and prediction speed, outperforming state-of-the-art AR and NAR forecasting models.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Evaluation of Standard Statistical Models and LLMs on Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04867v1)** | 2024-08-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This research examines the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in predicting time series, with a specific focus on the LLMTIME model. Despite the established effectiveness of LLMs in tasks such as text generation, language translation, and sentiment analysis, this study highlights the key challenges that large language models encounter in the context of time series prediction. We assess the performance of LLMTIME across multiple datasets and introduce classical almost periodic functions as time series to gauge its effectiveness. The empirical results indicate that while large language models can perform well in zero-shot forecasting for certain datasets, their predictive accuracy diminishes notably when confronted with diverse time series data and traditional signals. The primary finding of this study is that the predictive capacity of LLMTIME, similar to other LLMs, significantly deteriorates when dealing with time series data that contain both periodic and trend components, as well as when the signal comprises complex frequency components.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Parallel Vector-form $LDL^\top$ Decomposition for Accelerating Execution-time-certified $\ell_1$-penalty Soft-constrained MPC](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18235v3)** | 2024-08-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Handling possible infeasibility and providing an execution time certificate are two pressing requirements of real-time Model Predictive Control (MPC). To meet these two requirements simultaneously, this paper proposes an $\ell_1$-penalty soft-constrained MPC formulation that is globally feasible and solvable with an execution time certificate using our proposed algorithm. This paper proves for the first time that $\ell_1$-penalty soft-constrained MPC problems can be equivalently transformed into a box-constrained quadratic programming (Box-QP) and then our previous execution-time-certified algorithm \cite{wu2023direct} (only limited to Box-QP) can be applied. However, our previous Box-QP algorithm \cite{wu2023direct}, which provides a theoretical execution-time certificate, is conservative in its iteration analysis, thus sacrificing computation efficiency. To this end, this paper proposes a novel $LDL^\top$ decomposition for the first time, to accelerate the computation of Newton step at each iteration. The speedup of our $LDL^\top$ decomposition comes from two-fold: \textit{i)} exploitation of the fact that the number of inequality constraints is generally larger than the number of variables in condensed MPC formulations, \textit{ii)} vectorized and parallel implementation based on based on its vector-wise operations, instead of element-wise operations of previous decomposition methods. Numerical experiments demonstrate great speedups of the proposed $LDL^\top$ decomposition (even up to 1000-fold, compared to the standard Choleksky method), which thus helps our solver achieve comparable computation performance to the state-of-the-art solvers such as IPOPT and OSQP.

Fully automatic analysis of myocardial perfusion MRI datasets enables rapid and objective reporting of stress/rest studies in patients with suspected ischemic heart disease. Developing deep learning techniques that can analyze multi-center datasets despite limited training data and variations in software and hardware is an ongoing challenge. Methods. Datasets from 3 medical centers acquired at 3T (n = 150 subjects) were included: an internal dataset (inD; n = 95) and two external datasets (exDs; n = 55) used for evaluating the robustness of the trained deep neural network (DNN) models against differences in pulse sequence (exD-1) and scanner vendor (exD-2). A subset of inD (n = 85) was used for training/validation of a pool of DNNs for segmentation, all using the same spatiotemporal U-Net architecture and hyperparameters but with different parameter initializations. We employed a space-time sliding-patch analysis approach that automatically yields a pixel-wise "uncertainty map" as a byproduct of the segmentation process. In our approach, a given test case is segmented by all members of the DNN pool and the resulting uncertainty maps are leveraged to automatically select the "best" one among the pool of solutions. Results. The proposed DAUGS analysis approach performed similarly to the established approach on the internal dataset (p = n.s.) whereas it significantly outperformed on the external datasets (p < 0.005 for exD-1 and exD-2). Moreover, the number of image series with "failed" segmentation was significantly lower for the proposed vs. the established approach (4.3% vs. 17.1%, p < 0.0005). Conclusions. The proposed DAUGS analysis approach has the potential to improve the robustness of deep learning methods for segmentation of multi-center stress perfusion datasets with variations in the choice of pulse sequence, site location or scanner vendor.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in JCMR, 2024</p></details> |

Such dynamic displays put a demand on our visual processing capacities, yet our perception of motion is limited. Several techniques have been shown to improve the processing of dynamic displays. Staging the animation to sequentially show steps in a transition and tracing object movement by displaying trajectory histories can improve processing by reducing the cognitive load. In this paper, We examine the effectiveness of staging and tracing in dynamic displays. We showed participants animated line charts depicting the movements of lines and asked them to identify the line with the highest mean and variance. We manipulated the animation to display the lines with or without staging, tracing and history, and compared the results to a static chart as a control. Results showed that tracing and staging are preferred by participants, and improve their performance in mean and variance tasks respectively. They also preferred display time 3 times shorter when staging is used. Also, encoding animation speed with mean and variance in congruent tasks is associated with higher accuracy. These findings help inform real-world best practices for building dynamic displays.

Though the entire TDHF Hamiltonian, including the inter-electronic potential, can be computed from first principles, we use this problem as a testbed to develop strategies that can be applied to learn \emph{a priori} unknown terms that arise in other methods/approaches to quantum dynamics, e.g., emerging problems such as learning exchange-correlation potentials for time-dependent density functional theory. We develop, train, and test three models of the TDHF inter-electronic potential, each parameterized by a four-index tensor of size up to $60 \times 60 \times 60 \times 60$. Two of the models preserve Hermitian symmetry, while one model preserves an eight-fold permutation symmetry that implies Hermitian symmetry. Across seven different molecular systems, we find that accounting for the deeper eight-fold symmetry leads to the best-performing model across three metrics: training efficiency, test set predictive power, and direct comparison of true and learned inter-electronic potentials. All three models, when trained on ensembles of field-free trajectories, generate accurate electron dynamics predictions even in a field-on regime that lies outside the training set. To enable our models to scale to large molecular systems, we derive expressions for Jacobian-vector products that enable iterative, matrix-free training.</p></details> | 24 pages, 8 figures |

Compared with existing high-end DECT leveraging advanced X-ray source and/or detector technologies, the use of the sequentially-scanning data acquisition scheme to implement DECT may make broader impact on clinical practice because this scheme requires no specialized hardware designs. However, since the concentration of iodinated contrast agent in the imaged subject varies over time, sequentially-scanned data sets acquired at two tube potentials are temporally inconsistent. As existing material decomposition approaches for DECT assume that the data sets acquired at two tube potentials are temporally consistent, the violation of this assumption results in inaccurate quantification accuracy of iodine concentration. In this work, we developed a technique to achieve sequentially-scanning DECT imaging using high temporal resolution image reconstruction and temporal extrapolation, ACCELERATION in short, to address the technical challenge induced by temporal inconsistency of sequentially-scanned data sets and improve iodine quantification accuracy in sequentially-scanning DECT. ACCELERATION has been validated and evaluated using numerical simulation data sets generated from clinical human subject exams. Results demonstrated the improvement of iodine quantification accuracy using ACCELERATION.</p></details> |  |

Despite the improvement brought by the strong visual backbone in extracting spatial features, CLIP still falls short in capturing and integrating spatial-temporal features which is essential for video recognition. In this paper, we propose OmniCLIP, a framework that adapts CLIP for video recognition by focusing on learning comprehensive features encompassing spatial, temporal, and dynamic spatial-temporal scales, which we refer to as omni-scale features. This is achieved through the design of spatial-temporal blocks that include parallel temporal adapters (PTA), enabling efficient temporal modeling. Additionally, we introduce a self-prompt generator (SPG) module to capture dynamic object spatial features. The synergy between PTA and SPG allows OmniCLIP to discern varying spatial information across frames and assess object scales over time. We have conducted extensive experiments in supervised video recognition, few-shot video recognition, and zero-shot recognition tasks. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, especially with OmniCLIP achieving a top-1 accuracy of 74.30\% on HMDB51 in a 16-shot setting, surpassing the recent MotionPrompt approach even with full training data.

We benchmark SET against said models on the charged $N$-body problem, a simple physical system with complex dynamics. While existing spatio-temporal graph neural networks focus on sequential modeling, we empirically demonstrate that leveraging underlying domain symmetries yields considerable improvements for modeling dynamical systems on graphs.</p></details> |  |

Since many existing works optimize WTAL models based on action classification labels, they encounter the task discrepancy problem (i.e., localization-by-classification). To tackle this issue, recent studies have attempted to utilize action category names as auxiliary semantic knowledge through vision-language pre-training (VLP). However, there are still areas where existing research falls short. Previous approaches primarily focused on leveraging textual information from language models but overlooked the alignment of dynamic human action and VLP knowledge in a joint space. Furthermore, the deterministic representation employed in previous studies struggles to capture fine-grained human motions. To address these problems, we propose a novel framework that aligns human action knowledge and VLP knowledge in a probabilistic embedding space. Moreover, we propose intra- and inter-distribution contrastive learning to enhance the probabilistic embedding space based on statistical similarities. Extensive experiments and ablation studies reveal that our method significantly outperforms all previous state-of-the-art methods.

Despite significant strides in time series forecasting, high noise-to-signal ratio, non-normality, non-stationarity, and lack of data continue challenging practitioners. In response, we leverage a simple representation augmentation technique to overcome these challenges. Our augmented representation acts as a statistical-space prior encoded at each time step. In response, we name our method Statistical-space Augmented Representation (SSAR). The underlying high-dimensional data-generating process inspires our representation augmentation. We rigorously examine the empirical generalization performance on two data sets with two downstream temporal learning algorithms. Our approach significantly beats all five up-to-date baselines. Moreover, the highly modular nature of our approach can easily be applied to various settings. Lastly, fully-fledged theoretical perspectives are available throughout the writing for a clear and rigorous understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>IJCAI...</summary><p>IJCAI 2024 STRL Workshop (Oral)</p></details> |
| **[Weakly Supervised Video Anomaly Detection and Localization with Spatio-Temporal Prompts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05905v1)** | 2024-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current weakly supervised video anomaly detection (WSVAD) task aims to achieve frame-level anomalous event detection with only coarse video-level annotations available. Existing works typically involve extracting global features from full-resolution video frames and training frame-level classifiers to detect anomalies in the temporal dimension. However, most anomalous events tend to occur in localized spatial regions rather than the entire video frames, which implies existing frame-level feature based works may be misled by the dominant background information and lack the interpretation of the detected anomalies. To address this dilemma, this paper introduces a novel method called STPrompt that learns spatio-temporal prompt embeddings for weakly supervised video anomaly detection and localization (WSVADL) based on pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs). Our proposed method employs a two-stream network structure, with one stream focusing on the temporal dimension and the other primarily on the spatial dimension. By leveraging the learned knowledge from pre-trained VLMs and incorporating natural motion priors from raw videos, our model learns prompt embeddings that are aligned with spatio-temporal regions of videos (e.g., patches of individual frames) for identify specific local regions of anomalies, enabling accurate video anomaly detection while mitigating the influence of background information. Without relying on detailed spatio-temporal annotations or auxiliary object detection/tracking, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on three public benchmarks for the WSVADL task.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACMMM2024</p></details> |
| **[Time Makes Space: Emergence of Place Fields in Networks Encoding Temporally Continuous Sensory Experiences](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05798v1)** | 2024-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The vertebrate hippocampus is believed to use recurrent connectivity in area CA3 to support episodic memory recall from partial cues. This brain area also contains place cells, whose location-selective firing fields implement maps supporting spatial memory. Here we show that place cells emerge in networks trained to remember temporally continuous sensory episodes. We model CA3 as a recurrent autoencoder that recalls and reconstructs sensory experiences from noisy and partially occluded observations by agents traversing simulated rooms. The agents move in realistic trajectories modeled from rodents and environments are modeled as high-dimensional sensory experience maps. Training our autoencoder to pattern-complete and reconstruct experiences with a constraint on total activity causes spatially localized firing fields, i.e., place cells, to emerge in the encoding layer. The emergent place fields reproduce key aspects of hippocampal phenomenology: a) remapping (maintenance of and reversion to distinct learned maps in different environments), implemented via repositioning of experience manifolds in the network's hidden layer, b) orthogonality of spatial representations in different arenas, c) robust place field emergence in differently shaped rooms, with single units showing multiple place fields in large or complex spaces, and d) slow representational drift of place fields. We argue that these results arise because continuous traversal of space makes sensory experience temporally continuous. We make testable predictions: a) rapidly changing sensory context will disrupt place fields, b) place fields will form even if recurrent connections are blocked, but reversion to previously learned representations upon remapping will be abolished, c) the dimension of temporally smooth experience sets the dimensionality of place fields, including during virtual navigation of abstract spaces.</p></details> |  |
| **[Time Matters: Examine Temporal Effects on Biomedical Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17638v2)** | 2024-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time roots in applying language models for biomedical applications: models are trained on historical data and will be deployed for new or future data, which may vary from training data. While increasing biomedical tasks have employed state-of-the-art language models, there are very few studies have examined temporal effects on biomedical models when data usually shifts across development and deployment. This study fills the gap by statistically probing relations between language model performance and data shifts across three biomedical tasks.

| **[Object Re-identification via Spatial-temporal Fusion Networks and Causal Identity Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05558v1)** | 2024-08-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Object re-identification (ReID) in large camera networks has many challenges. First, the similar appearances of objects degrade ReID performances. This challenge cannot be addressed by existing appearance-based ReID methods. Second, most ReID studies are performed in laboratory settings and do not consider ReID problems in real-world scenarios. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a novel ReID framework that leverages a spatial-temporal fusion network and causal identity matching (CIM). The framework estimates camera network topology using the proposed adaptive Parzen window and combines appearance features with spatial-temporal cue within the Fusion Network. It achieved outstanding performance across several datasets, including VeRi776, Vehicle-3I, and Market-1501, achieving up to 99.70% rank-1 accuracy and 95.5% mAP. Furthermore, the proposed CIM approach, which dynamically assigns gallery sets based on the camera network topology, further improved ReID accuracy and robustness in real-world settings, evidenced by a 94.95% mAP and 95.19% F1 score on the Vehicle-3I dataset. The experimental results support the effectiveness of incorporating spatial-temporal information and CIM for real-world ReID scenarios regardless of the data domain (e.g., vehicle, person).</p></details> |  |
| **[Higher-Order Temporal Network Prediction and Interpretation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05165v1)** | 2024-08-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A social interaction (so-called higher-order event/interaction) can be regarded as the activation of the hyperlink among the corresponding individuals. Social interactions can be, thus, represented as higher-order temporal networks, that record the higher-order events occurring at each time step over time. The prediction of higher-order interactions is usually overlooked in traditional temporal network prediction methods, where a higher-order interaction is regarded as a set of pairwise interactions. The prediction of future higher-order interactions is crucial to forecast and mitigate the spread the information, epidemics and opinion on higher-order social contact networks. In this paper, we propose novel memory-based models for higher-order temporal network prediction. By using these models, we aim to predict the higher-order temporal network one time step ahead, based on the network observed in the past. Importantly, we also intent to understand what network properties and which types of previous interactions enable the prediction. The design and performance analysis of these models are supported by our analysis of the memory property of networks, e.g., similarity of the network and activity of a hyperlink over time respectively. Our models assume that a target hyperlink's future activity (active or not) depends the past activity of the target link and of all or selected types of hyperlinks that overlap with the target. We then compare the performance of both models with a baseline utilizing a pairwise temporal network prediction method. In eight real-world networks, we find that both models consistently outperform the baseline and the refined model tends to perform the best. Our models also reveal how past interactions of the target hyperlink and different types of hyperlinks that overlap with the target contribute to the prediction of the target's future activity.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2309.04376</p></details> |

Considering the spatio-temporal nature of EEG data, one of our frameworks is based on a CNN-BiLSTM model. The other involves a CNN-Transformer architecture which inherently involves the more versatile attention based learning paradigm. In both cases, a special 1D-CNN feature extraction module is used to generate the initial embeddings with 1D convolutions in the time and the EEG channel domains. Considering the EEG signals are noisy, non stationary and the discriminative features are even less clear (than in semantically structured data such as text or image), we also follow a window-based classification followed by majority voting during inference, to yield labels at a signal level. To illustrate how brain patterns correlate with different image classes, we visualize t-SNE plots of the BiLSTM embeddings alongside brain activation maps for the top 10 classes. These visualizations provide insightful revelations into the distinct neural signatures associated with each visual category, showcasing the BiLSTM's capability to capture and represent the discriminative brain activity linked to visual stimuli. We demonstrate the performance of our approach on the updated EEG-Imagenet dataset with positive comparisons with state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper has been submitted at ICPR 2024.

In particular, two problems emerge: (1) Encoding longer histories requires more computational resources, making it crucial for CTDG models to maintain low computational complexity to ensure efficiency; (2) Meanwhile, more powerful models are needed to identify and select the most critical temporal information within the extended context provided by longer histories. To address these problems, we propose a CTDG representation learning model named DyGMamba, originating from the popular Mamba state space model (SSM). DyGMamba first leverages a node-level SSM to encode the sequence of historical node interactions. Another time-level SSM is then employed to exploit the temporal patterns hidden in the historical graph, where its output is used to dynamically select the critical information from the interaction history. We validate DyGMamba experimentally on the dynamic link prediction task. The results show that our model achieves state-of-the-art in most cases. DyGMamba also maintains high efficiency in terms of computational resources, making it possible to capture long temporal dependencies with a limited computation budget.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

| **[Conformal Temporal Logic Planning using Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10092v4)** | 2024-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper addresses planning problems for mobile robots. We consider missions that require accomplishing multiple high-level sub-tasks, expressed in natural language (NL), in a temporal and logical order. To formally define the mission, we treat these sub-tasks as atomic predicates in a Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) formula. We refer to this task specification framework as LTL-NL. Our goal is to design plans, defined as sequences of robot actions, accomplishing LTL-NL tasks. This action planning problem cannot be solved directly by existing LTL planners because of the NL nature of atomic predicates. To address it, we propose HERACLEs, a hierarchical neuro-symbolic planner that relies on a novel integration of (i) existing symbolic planners generating high-level task plans determining the order at which the NL sub-tasks should be accomplished; (ii) pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) to design sequences of robot actions based on these task plans; and (iii) conformal prediction acting as a formal interface between (i) and (ii) and managing uncertainties due to LLM imperfections. We show, both theoretically and empirically, that HERACLEs can achieve user-defined mission success rates. Finally, we provide comparative experiments demonstrating that HERACLEs outperforms LLM-based planners that require the mission to be defined solely using NL. Additionally, we present examples demonstrating that our approach enhances user-friendliness compared to conventional symbolic approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Complexity of Learning Temporal Properties](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04486v1)** | 2024-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the problem of learning temporal logic formulas from examples of system behavior. Learning temporal properties has crystallized as an effective mean to explain complex temporal behaviors. Several efficient algorithms have been designed for learning temporal formulas. However, the theoretical understanding of the complexity of the learning decision problems remains largely unexplored. To address this, we study the complexity of the passive learning problems of three prominent temporal logics, Linear Temporal Logic (LTL), Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and Alternating-time Temporal Logic (ATL) and several of their fragments. We show that learning formulas using an unbounded amount of occurrences of binary operators is NP-complete for all of these logics. On the other hand, when investigating the complexity of learning formulas with bounded amount of occurrences of binary operators, we exhibit discrepancies between the complexity of learning LTL, CTL and ATL formulas (with a varying number of agents).</p></details> |  |
| **[MM-Forecast: A Multimodal Approach to Temporal Event Forecasting with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04388v1)** | 2024-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study an emerging and intriguing problem of multimodal temporal event forecasting with large language models. Compared to using text or graph modalities, the investigation of utilizing images for temporal event forecasting has not been fully explored, especially in the era of large language models (LLMs). To bridge this gap, we are particularly interested in two key questions of: 1) why images will help in temporal event forecasting, and 2) how to integrate images into the LLM-based forecasting framework. To answer these research questions, we propose to identify two essential functions that images play in the scenario of temporal event forecasting, i.e., highlighting and complementary. Then, we develop a novel framework, named MM-Forecast. It employs an Image Function Identification module to recognize these functions as verbal descriptions using multimodal large language models (MLLMs), and subsequently incorporates these function descriptions into LLM-based forecasting models. To evaluate our approach, we construct a new multimodal dataset, MidEast-TE-mm, by extending an existing event dataset MidEast-TE-mini with images. Empirical studies demonstrate that our MM-Forecast can correctly identify the image functions, and further more, incorporating these verbal function descriptions significantly improves the forecasting performance. The dataset, code, and prompts are available at https://github.com/LuminosityX/MM-Forecast.</p></details> |  |
| **[Temporal Logic Planning via Zero-Shot Policy Composition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04215v1)** | 2024-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work develops a zero-shot mechanism for an agent to satisfy a Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) specification given existing task primitives. Oftentimes, autonomous robots need to satisfy spatial and temporal goals that are unknown until run time. Prior research addresses the problem by learning policies that are capable of executing a high-level task specified using LTL, but they incorporate the specification into the learning process; therefore, any change to the specification requires retraining the policy. Other related research addresses the problem by creating skill-machines which, given a specification change, do not require full policy retraining but require fine-tuning on the skill-machine to guarantee satisfaction. We present a more a flexible approach -- to learn a set of minimum-violation (MV) task primitive policies that can be used to satisfy arbitrary LTL specifications without retraining or fine-tuning. Task primitives can be learned offline using reinforcement learning (RL) methods and combined using Boolean composition at deployment. This work focuses on creating and pruning a transition system (TS) representation of the environment in order to solve for deterministic, non-ambiguous, and feasible solutions to LTL specifications given an environment and a set of MV task primitive policies. We show that our pruned TS is deterministic, contains no unrealizable transitions, and is sound. Through simulation, we show that our approach is executable and we verify our MV policies produce the expected symbols.</p></details> | 16 pages, 11 figures |
| **[Uncertainty-Aware Crime Prediction With Spatial Temporal Multivariate Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04193v1)** | 2024-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Crime forecasting is a critical component of urban analysis and essential for stabilizing society today. Unlike other time series forecasting problems, crime incidents are sparse, particularly in small regions and within specific time periods. Traditional spatial-temporal deep learning models often struggle with this sparsity, as they typically cannot effectively handle the non-Gaussian nature of crime data, which is characterized by numerous zeros and over-dispersed patterns. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel approach termed Spatial Temporal Multivariate Zero-Inflated Negative Binomial Graph Neural Networks (STMGNN-ZINB). This framework leverages diffusion and convolution networks to analyze spatial, temporal, and multivariate correlations, enabling the parameterization of probabilistic distributions of crime incidents. By incorporating a Zero-Inflated Negative Binomial model, STMGNN-ZINB effectively manages the sparse nature of crime data, enhancing prediction accuracy and the precision of confidence intervals. Our evaluation on real-world datasets confirms that STMGNN-ZINB outperforms existing models, providing a more reliable tool for predicting and understanding crime dynamics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Temporal Feature Matters: A Framework for Diffusion Model Quantization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19547v2)** | 2024-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Diffusion models, widely used for image generation, face significant challenges related to their broad applicability due to prolonged inference times and high memory demands. Efficient Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) is crucial to address these issues. However, unlike traditional models, diffusion models critically rely on the time-step for the multi-round denoising. Typically, each time-step is encoded into a hypersensitive temporal feature by several modules. Despite this, existing PTQ methods do not optimize these modules individually. Instead, they employ unsuitable reconstruction objectives and complex calibration methods, leading to significant disturbances in the temporal feature and denoising trajectory, as well as reduced compression efficiency. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel quantization framework that includes three strategies: 1) TIB-based Maintenance: Based on our innovative Temporal Information Block (TIB) definition, Temporal Information-aware Reconstruction (TIAR) and Finite Set Calibration (FSC) are developed to efficiently align original temporal features. 2) Cache-based Maintenance: Instead of indirect and complex optimization for the related modules, pre-computing and caching quantized counterparts of temporal features are developed to minimize errors. 3) Disturbance-aware Selection: Employ temporal feature errors to guide a fine-grained selection between the two maintenance strategies for further disturbance reduction. This framework preserves most of the temporal information and ensures high-quality end-to-end generation. Extensive testing on various datasets, diffusion models and hardware confirms our superior performance and acceleration..</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2311.16503</p></details> |
| **[Surgformer: Surgical Transformer with Hierarchical Temporal Attention for Surgical Phase Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03867v1)** | 2024-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing state-of-the-art methods for surgical phase recognition either rely on the extraction of spatial-temporal features at a short-range temporal resolution or adopt the sequential extraction of the spatial and temporal features across the entire temporal resolution. However, these methods have limitations in modeling spatial-temporal dependency and addressing spatial-temporal redundancy: 1) These methods fail to effectively model spatial-temporal dependency, due to the lack of long-range information or joint spatial-temporal modeling. 2) These methods utilize dense spatial features across the entire temporal resolution, resulting in significant spatial-temporal redundancy. In this paper, we propose the Surgical Transformer (Surgformer) to address the issues of spatial-temporal modeling and redundancy in an end-to-end manner, which employs divided spatial-temporal attention and takes a limited set of sparse frames as input. Moreover, we propose a novel Hierarchical Temporal Attention (HTA) to capture both global and local information within varied temporal resolutions from a target frame-centric perspective. Distinct from conventional temporal attention that primarily emphasizes dense long-range similarity, HTA not only captures long-term information but also considers local latent consistency among informative frames. HTA then employs pyramid feature aggregation to effectively utilize temporal information across diverse temporal resolutions, thereby enhancing the overall temporal representation. Extensive experiments on two challenging benchmark datasets verify that our proposed Surgformer performs favorably against the state-of-the-art methods. The code is released at https://github.com/isyangshu/Surgformer.</p></details> |  |
| **[Entropy Rate Maximization of Markov Decision Processes under Linear Temporal Logic Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.12805v2)** | 2024-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate the problem of synthesizing optimal control policies for Markov decision processes (MDPs) with both qualitative and quantitative objectives. Specifically, our goal is to achieve a given linear temporal logic (LTL) task with probability one, while maximizing the \emph{entropy rate} of the system. The notion of entropy rate characterizes the long-run average (un)predictability of a stochastic process. Such an optimal policy is of our interest, in particular, from the security point of view, as it not only ensures the completion of tasks, but also maximizes the unpredictability of the system. However, existing works only focus on maximizing the total entropy which may diverge to infinity for infinite horizon. In this paper, we provide a complete solution to the entropy rate maximization problem under LTL constraints. Specifically, we first present an algorithm for synthesizing entropy rate maximizing policies for communicating MDPs. Then based on a new state classification method, we show the entropy rate maximization problem under LTL task can be effectively solved in polynomial-time. We illustrate the proposed algorithm based on two case studies of robot task planning scenario.</p></details> |  |

However, existing transformer-based methods primarily use self-attention mechanisms for spatio-temporal modeling, leading to a quadratic complexity, unidirectional modeling of spatio-temporal relationships, and insufficient learning of spatial-temporal correlations. Recently, the Mamba architecture, utilizing the state space model (SSM), has exhibited superior long-range modeling capabilities in a variety of vision tasks with linear complexity. In this paper, we propose PoseMamba, a novel purely SSM-based approach with linear complexity for 3D human pose estimation in monocular video. Specifically, we propose a bidirectional global-local spatio-temporal SSM block that comprehensively models human joint relations within individual frames as well as temporal correlations across frames. Within this bidirectional global-local spatio-temporal SSM block, we introduce a reordering strategy to enhance the local modeling capability of the SSM. This strategy provides a more logical geometric scanning order and integrates it with the global SSM, resulting in a combined global-local spatial scan. We have quantitatively and qualitatively evaluated our approach using two benchmark datasets: Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PoseMamba achieves state-of-the-art performance on both datasets while maintaining a smaller model size and reducing computational costs. The code and models will be released.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatio-Temporal Adaptive Diffusion Models for EEG Super-Resolution in Epilepsy Diagnosis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03089v3)** | 2024-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Electroencephalogram (EEG) technology, particularly high-density EEG (HD EEG) devices, is widely used in fields such as neuroscience. HD EEG devices improve the spatial resolution of EEG by placing more electrodes on the scalp, meeting the requirements of clinical diagnostic applications such as epilepsy focus localization. However, this technique faces challenges such as high acquisition costs and limited usage scenarios. In this paper, spatio-temporal adaptive diffusion models (STADMs) are proposed to pioneer the use of diffusion models for achieving spatial SR reconstruction from low-resolution (LR, 64 channels or fewer) EEG to high-resolution (HR, 256 channels) EEG. Specifically, a spatio-temporal condition module is designed to extract the spatio-temporal features of LR EEG, which then serve as conditional inputs to guide the reverse denoising process of diffusion models. Additionally, a multi-scale Transformer denoising module is constructed to leverage multi-scale convolution blocks and cross-attention-based diffusion Transformer blocks for conditional guidance to generate subject-adaptive SR EEG. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively enhances the spatial resolution of LR EEG and quantitatively outperforms existing methods. Furthermore, STADMs demonstrate their value by applying synthetic SR EEG to classification and source localization tasks of epilepsy patients, indicating their potential to significantly improve the spatial resolution of LR EEG.</p></details> |  |
| **[FacialPulse: An Efficient RNN-based Depression Detection via Temporal Facial Landmarks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03499v1)** | 2024-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Depression is a prevalent mental health disorder that significantly impacts individuals' lives and well-being. Early detection and intervention are crucial for effective treatment and management of depression. Recently, there are many end-to-end deep learning methods leveraging the facial expression features for automatic depression detection. However, most current methods overlook the temporal dynamics of facial expressions. Although very recent 3DCNN methods remedy this gap, they introduce more computational cost due to the selection of CNN-based backbones and redundant facial features. To address the above limitations, by considering the timing correlation of facial expressions, we propose a novel framework called FacialPulse, which recognizes depression with high accuracy and speed. By harnessing the bidirectional nature and proficiently addressing long-term dependencies, the Facial Motion Modeling Module (FMMM) is designed in FacialPulse to fully capture temporal features. Since the proposed FMMM has parallel processing capabilities and has the gate mechanism to mitigate gradient vanishing, this module can also significantly boost the training speed. Besides, to effectively use facial landmarks to replace original images to decrease information redundancy, a Facial Landmark Calibration Module (FLCM) is designed to eliminate facial landmark errors to further improve recognition accuracy. Extensive experiments on the AVEC2014 dataset and MMDA dataset (a depression dataset) demonstrate the superiority of FacialPulse on recognition accuracy and speed, with the average MAE (Mean Absolute Error) decreased by 21% compared to baselines, and the recognition speed increased by 100% compared to state-of-the-art methods.

| **[SpecSTG: A Fast Spectral Diffusion Framework for Probabilistic Spatio-Temporal Traffic Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08119v3)** | 2024-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic forecasting, a crucial application of spatio-temporal graph (STG) learning, has traditionally relied on deterministic models for accurate point estimations. Yet, these models fall short of quantifying future uncertainties. Recently, many probabilistic methods, especially variants of diffusion models, have been proposed to fill this gap. However, existing diffusion methods typically deal with individual sensors separately when generating future time series, resulting in limited usage of spatial information in the probabilistic learning process. In this work, we propose SpecSTG, a novel spectral diffusion framework, to better leverage spatial dependencies and systematic patterns inherent in traffic data. More specifically, our method generates the Fourier representation of future time series, transforming the learning process into the spectral domain enriched with spatial information. Additionally, our approach incorporates a fast spectral graph convolution designed for Fourier input, alleviating the computational burden associated with existing models. Compared with state-of-the-arts, SpecSTG achieves up to 8% improvements on point estimations and up to 0.78% improvements on quantifying future uncertainties. Furthermore, SpecSTG's training and validation speed is 3.33X of the most efficient existing diffusion method for STG forecasting.

The emergence of large video foundation models has led RGB-only video backbones to outperform previous methods needing both RGB and optical flow modalities. Leveraging these large models is often limited to training only the TAL head due to the prohibitively large GPU memory required to adapt the video backbone for TAL. To overcome this limitation, we introduce LoSA, the first memory-and-parameter-efficient backbone adapter designed specifically for TAL to handle untrimmed videos. LoSA specializes for TAL by introducing Long-Short-range Adapters that adapt the intermediate layers of the video backbone over different temporal ranges. These adapters run parallel to the video backbone to significantly reduce memory footprint. LoSA also includes Long-Short-range Gated Fusion that strategically combines the output of these adapters from the video backbone layers to enhance the video features provided to the TAL head. Experiments show that LoSA significantly outperforms all existing methods on standard TAL benchmarks, THUMOS-14 and ActivityNet-v1.3, by scaling end-to-end backbone adaptation to billion-parameter-plus models like VideoMAEv2~(ViT-g) and leveraging them beyond head-only transfer learning.</p></details> | Under submission |

Our study presents a novel perspective on the interconnectedness of evolving infectious disease knowledge. Through identifying publications based on funded and unfunded research, the analysis of temporal network of infectious disease associations reveals (i) growing compartmentalisation of funded research, i.e., it focuses on the groups of infectious diseases with readily established connections, and (ii) the growth in global integration in unfunded research, i.e., it tends to be more widely exploratory and links distant diseases. Moreover, we find that in both funded and unfunded research prominent diseases like HIV, malaria and tuberculosis have strong bridging effects facilitating global integration, while diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis are characterised with strong local connectivity between themselves. We also find that although coronavirus has seen a surge in publications since COVID-19, its systemic impact on the interconnectedness of infectious disease knowledge remains relatively low. Our work highlights the importance of considering the interconnectedness of infectious diseases in health policy making and has potential to contribute to more efficient health resource allocation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Scientometrics</p></details> |

However, solving the competition between the detector and the feature extractor has always been a challenge. Meanwhile, the issue of directly embedding the ReID task into MOT has remained unresolved. The lack of high discriminability in appearance features results in their limited utility. In this paper, a new learning approach using cross-correlation to capture temporal information of objects is proposed. The feature extraction network is no longer trained solely on appearance features from each frame but learns richer motion features by utilizing feature heatmaps from consecutive frames, which addresses the challenge of inter-class feature similarity. Furthermore, our learning approach is applied to a more lightweight feature extraction network, and treat the feature matching scores as strong cues rather than auxiliary cues, with an appropriate weight calculation to reflect the compatibility between our obtained features and the MOT task. Our tracker, named TCBTrack, achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple public benchmarks, i.e., MOT17, MOT20, and DanceTrack datasets. Specifically, on the DanceTrack test set, we achieve 56.8 HOTA, 58.1 IDF1 and 92.5 MOTA, making it the best online tracker capable of achieving real-time performance. Comparative evaluations with other trackers prove that our tracker achieves the best balance between speed, robustness and accuracy.

To overcome these limitations, we propose memory-augmented transformer (MATR). MATR utilizes the memory queue that selectively preserves the past segment features, allowing to leverage long-term context for inference. We also propose a novel action localization method that observes the current input segment to predict the end time of the ongoing action and accesses the memory queue to estimate the start time of the action.

Temporal patterns are a natural feature of DGs and are also key to representation learning. However, existing dynamic GCN models are mostly composed of static GCNs and sequence modules, which results in the separation of spatiotemporal information and cannot effectively capture complex temporal patterns in DGs. To address this problem, this study proposes a spatial-temporal graph convolutional networks with diversified transformation (STGCNDT), which includes three aspects: a) constructing a unified graph tensor convolutional network (GTCN) using tensor M-products without the need to represent spatiotemporal information separately; b) introducing three transformation schemes in GTCN to model complex temporal patterns to aggregate temporal information; and c) constructing an ensemble of diversified transformation schemes to obtain higher representation capabilities. Empirical studies on four DGs that appear in communication networks show that the proposed STGCNDT significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models in solving link weight estimation tasks due to the diversified transformations.</p></details> | 8 papges, 1 figure |

The central aim of multi-agent optimization is for a network of agents to collaboratively solve a system-level optimization problem with local objective functions and node-to-node communication by distributed algorithms. The scalability of such algorithms crucially depends on the complexity of the communication messages, and a number of communication compressors for distributed optimization have recently been proposed in the literature. First of all, we introduce a general spatio-temporal compressor characterized by the stability of the resulting dynamical system along the vector field of the compressor. We show that several important distributed optimization compressors such as the greedy sparsifier, the uniform quantizer, and the scalarizer all fall into the category of this spatio-temporal compressor. Next, we propose two distributed prime-dual flows with the spatio-temporal compressors being applied to local node states and local error states, respectively, and prove (exponential) convergence of the node trajectories to the global optimizer for (strongly) convex cost functions. Finally, a few numerical examples are present to illustrate our theoretical results.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generalized Gaussian Temporal Difference Error For Uncertainty-aware Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02295v1)** | 2024-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conventional uncertainty-aware temporal difference (TD) learning methods often rely on simplistic assumptions, typically including a zero-mean Gaussian distribution for TD errors. Such oversimplification can lead to inaccurate error representations and compromised uncertainty estimation. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework for generalized Gaussian error modeling in deep reinforcement learning, applicable to both discrete and continuous control settings. Our framework enhances the flexibility of error distribution modeling by incorporating higher-order moments, particularly kurtosis, thereby improving the estimation and mitigation of data-dependent noise, i.e., aleatoric uncertainty. We examine the influence of the shape parameter of the generalized Gaussian distribution (GGD) on aleatoric uncertainty and provide a closed-form expression that demonstrates an inverse relationship between uncertainty and the shape parameter. Additionally, we propose a theoretically grounded weighting scheme to fully leverage the GGD. To address epistemic uncertainty, we enhance the batch inverse variance weighting by incorporating bias reduction and kurtosis considerations, resulting in improved robustness. Extensive experimental evaluations using policy gradient algorithms demonstrate the consistent efficacy of our method, showcasing significant performance improvements.</p></details> |  |

However, in real world applications, environments constantly change due to a variety of external events. To address this problem, we study Markov Decision Processes (MDP) under the influence of an external temporal process. We formalize this notion and discuss conditions under which the problem becomes tractable with suitable solutions. We propose a policy iteration algorithm to solve this problem and theoretically analyze its performance. We derive results on the sample complexity of the algorithm and study its dependency on the extent of non-stationarity of the environment. We then conduct experiments to illustrate our results in a classic control environment.</p></details> |  |
| **[3D Single-object Tracking in Point Clouds with High Temporal Variation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02049v1)** | 2024-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The high temporal variation of the point clouds is the key challenge of 3D single-object tracking (3D SOT). Existing approaches rely on the assumption that the shape variation of the point clouds and the motion of the objects across neighboring frames are smooth, failing to cope with high temporal variation data. In this paper, we present a novel framework for 3D SOT in point clouds with high temporal variation, called HVTrack. HVTrack proposes three novel components to tackle the challenges in the high temporal variation scenario: 1) A Relative-Pose-Aware Memory module to handle temporal point cloud shape variations; 2) a Base-Expansion Feature Cross-Attention module to deal with similar object distractions in expanded search areas; 3) a Contextual Point Guided Self-Attention module for suppressing heavy background noise. We construct a dataset with high temporal variation (KITTI-HV) by setting different frame intervals for sampling in the KITTI dataset. On the KITTI-HV with 5 frame intervals, our HVTrack surpasses the state-of-the-art tracker CXTracker by 11.3%/15.7% in Success/Precision.</p></details> | Accepted by ECCV24 |

The exposure change and absence make existing methods generate flickering HDR results. In this paper, we propose a novel paradigm to render HDR frames via completing the absent exposure information, hence the exposure information is complete and consistent. Our approach involves interpolating neighbor LDR frames in the time dimension to reconstruct LDR frames for the absent exposures. Combining the interpolated and given LDR frames, the complete set of exposure information is available at each time stamp. This benefits the fusing process for HDR results, reducing noise and ghosting artifacts therefore improving temporal consistency. Extensive experimental evaluations on standard benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, highlighting the importance of absent exposure completing in HDR video rendering.

| **[Scalable Signal Temporal Logic Guided Reinforcement Learning via Value Function Space Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01923v1)** | 2024-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of reinforcement learning (RL) and formal methods has emerged as a promising framework for solving long-horizon planning problems. Conventional approaches typically involve abstraction of the state and action spaces and manually created labeling functions or predicates. However, the efficiency of these approaches deteriorates as the tasks become increasingly complex, which results in exponential growth in the size of labeling functions or predicates. To address these issues, we propose a scalable model-based RL framework, called VFSTL, which schedules pre-trained skills to follow unseen STL specifications without using hand-crafted predicates. Given a set of value functions obtained by goal-conditioned RL, we formulate an optimization problem to maximize the robustness value of Signal Temporal Logic (STL) defined specifications, which is computed using value functions as predicates. To further reduce the computation burden, we abstract the environment state space into the value function space (VFS). Then the optimization problem is solved by Model-Based Reinforcement Learning. Simulation results show that STL with value functions as predicates approximates the ground truth robustness and the planning in VFS directly achieves unseen specifications using data from sensors.</p></details> |  |

Most existing studies show satisfying performance under regular scenarios, but most neglected safety-critical scenarios. In this study, a spatio-temporal dual-encoder network named STDA for safety-critical scenarios was developed. Considering the exceptional capabilities of human drivers in terms of situational awareness and comprehending risks, driver attention was incorporated into STDA to facilitate swift identification of the critical regions, which is expected to improve both performance and interpretability. STDA contains four parts: the driver attention prediction module, which predicts driver attention; the fusion module designed to fuse the features between driver attention and raw images; the temporary encoder module used to enhance the capability to interpret dynamic scenes; and the behavior prediction module to predict the behavior. The experiment data are used to train and validate the model. The results show that STDA improves the G-mean from 0.659 to 0.719 when incorporating driver attention and adopting a temporal encoder module. In addition, extensive experimentation has been conducted to validate that the proposed module exhibits robust generalization capabilities and can be seamlessly integrated into other mainstream models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Landmark-guided Diffusion Model for High-fidelity and Temporally Coherent Talking Head Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01732v1)** | 2024-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Audio-driven talking head generation is a significant and challenging task applicable to various fields such as virtual avatars, film production, and online conferences. However, the existing GAN-based models emphasize generating well-synchronized lip shapes but overlook the visual quality of generated frames, while diffusion-based models prioritize generating high-quality frames but neglect lip shape matching, resulting in jittery mouth movements. To address the aforementioned problems, we introduce a two-stage diffusion-based model. The first stage involves generating synchronized facial landmarks based on the given speech. In the second stage, these generated landmarks serve as a condition in the denoising process, aiming to optimize mouth jitter issues and generate high-fidelity, well-synchronized, and temporally coherent talking head videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model yields the best performance.</p></details> |  |

This study, part of the European LAMASUS (Land Management for Sustainability) project, aims to support the EU's climate neutrality target by developing a governance model through collaboration between policymakers, land users, and researchers. We present a methodological synthesis for treating land use data using a Bayesian approach within spatial and spatio-temporal modeling frameworks. The study tackles the challenges of analyzing land use changes, particularly the presence of zero values and computational issues with large datasets. It introduces joint model structures to address zeros and employs sequential inference and consensus methods for Big Data problems. Spatial downscaling models approximate smaller scales from aggregated data, circumventing high-resolution data complications. We explore Beta regression and Compositional Data Analysis (CoDa) for land use data, review relevant spatial and spatio-temporal models, and present strategies for handling zeros. The paper demonstrates the implementation of key models, downscaling techniques, and solutions to Big Data challenges with examples from simulated data and the LAMASUS project, providing a comprehensive framework for understanding and managing land use changes.</p></details> | 29 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Signal-SGN: A Spiking Graph Convolutional Network for Skeletal Action Recognition via Learning Temporal-Frequency Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01701v1)** | 2024-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In skeletal-based action recognition, Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) based methods face limitations due to their complexity and high energy consumption. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have gained attention in recent years for their low energy consumption, but existing methods combining GCNs and SNNs fail to fully utilize the temporal characteristics of skeletal sequences, leading to increased storage and computational costs. To address this issue, we propose a Signal-SGN(Spiking Graph Convolutional Network), which leverages the temporal dimension of skeletal sequences as the spiking timestep and treats features as discrete stochastic signals. The core of the network consists of a 1D Spiking Graph Convolutional Network (1D-SGN) and a Frequency Spiking Convolutional Network (FSN). The SGN performs graph convolution on single frames and incorporates spiking network characteristics to capture inter-frame temporal relationships, while the FSN uses Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and complex convolution to extract temporal-frequency features. We also introduce a multi-scale wavelet transform feature fusion module(MWTF) to capture spectral features of temporal signals, enhancing the model's classification capability. We propose a pluggable temporal-frequency spatial semantic feature extraction module(TFSM) to enhance the model's ability to distinguish features without increasing inference-phase consumption. Our numerous experiments on the NTU RGB+D, NTU RGB+D 120, and NW-UCLA datasets demonstrate that the proposed models not only surpass existing SNN-based methods in accuracy but also reduce computational and storage costs during training. Furthermore, they achieve competitive accuracy compared to corresponding GCN-based methods, which is quite remarkable.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatio-Temporal Partial Sensing Forecast for Long-term Traffic](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02689v1)** | 2024-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic forecasting uses recent measurements by sensors installed at chosen locations to forecast the future road traffic. Existing work either assumes all locations are equipped with sensors or focuses on short-term forecast. This paper studies partial sensing traffic forecast of long-term traffic, assuming sensors only at some locations. The study is important in lowering the infrastructure investment cost in traffic management since deploying sensors at all locations could incur prohibitively high cost. However, the problem is challenging due to the unknown distribution at unsensed locations, the intricate spatio-temporal correlation in long-term forecasting, as well as noise in data and irregularities in traffic patterns (e.g., road closure). We propose a Spatio-Temporal Partial Sensing (STPS) forecast model for long-term traffic prediction, with several novel contributions, including a rank-based embedding technique to capture irregularities and overcome noise, a spatial transfer matrix to overcome the spatial distribution shift from permanently sensed locations to unsensed locations, and a multi-step training process that utilizes all available data to successively refine the model parameters for better accuracy. Extensive experiments on several real-world traffic datasets demonstrate that STPS outperforms the state-of-the-art and achieves superior accuracy in partial sensing long-term forecasting.</p></details> |  |

However, their predictive distribution is not generally known. Under this modeling assumption, we define a novel spatio-temporal embedding and a theory-guided machine learning approach that employs a generalized Bayesian algorithm to make ensemble forecasts. We use Lipschitz predictors and determine fixed-time and any-time PAC Bayesian bounds in the batch learning setting. Performing causal forecast is a highlight of our methodology as its potential application to data with spatial and temporal short and long-range dependence. We then test the performance of our learning methodology by using linear predictors and data sets simulated from a spatio-temporal Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process.</p></details> |  |
| **[MambaST: A Plug-and-Play Cross-Spectral Spatial-Temporal Fuser for Efficient Pedestrian Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01037v1)** | 2024-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes MambaST, a plug-and-play cross-spectral spatial-temporal fusion pipeline for efficient pedestrian detection. Several challenges exist for pedestrian detection in autonomous driving applications. First, it is difficult to perform accurate detection using RGB cameras under dark or low-light conditions. Cross-spectral systems must be developed to integrate complementary information from multiple sensor modalities, such as thermal and visible cameras, to improve the robustness of the detections. Second, pedestrian detection models are latency-sensitive. Efficient and easy-to-scale detection models with fewer parameters are highly desirable for real-time applications such as autonomous driving. Third, pedestrian video data provides spatial-temporal correlations of pedestrian movement. It is beneficial to incorporate temporal as well as spatial information to enhance pedestrian detection. This work leverages recent advances in the state space model (Mamba) and proposes a novel Multi-head Hierarchical Patching and Aggregation (MHHPA) structure to extract both fine-grained and coarse-grained information from both RGB and thermal imagery. Experimental results show that the proposed MHHPA is an effective and efficient alternative to a Transformer model for cross-spectral pedestrian detection. Our proposed model also achieves superior performance on small-scale pedestrian detection.

| **[SARN: Structurally-Aware Recurrent Network for Spatio-Temporal Disaggregation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07292v4)** | 2024-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open data is frequently released spatially aggregated, usually to comply with privacy policies. But coarse, heterogeneous aggregations complicate learning and integration for downstream AI/ML systems. In this work, we consider models to disaggregate spatio-temporal data from a low-resolution, irregular partition (e.g., census tract) to a high-resolution, irregular partition (e.g., city block). We propose an overarching model named the Structurally-Aware Recurrent Network (SARN), which integrates structurally-aware spatial attention (SASA) layers into the Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) model. The spatial attention layers capture spatial interactions among regions, while the gated recurrent module captures the temporal dependencies. Each SASA layer calculates both global and structural attention -- global attention facilitates comprehensive interactions between different geographic levels, while structural attention leverages the containment relationship between different geographic levels (e.g., a city block being wholly contained within a census tract) to ensure coherent and consistent results. For scenarios with limited historical training data, we explore transfer learning and show that a model pre-trained on one city variable can be fine-tuned for another city variable using only a few hundred samples. Evaluating these techniques on two mobility datasets, we find that on both datasets, SARN significantly outperforms other neural models (5% and 1%) and typical heuristic methods (40% and 14%), enabling us to generate realistic, high-quality fine-grained data for downstream applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Synthesis of Temporal Causality](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10912v2)** | 2024-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present an automata-based algorithm to synthesize omega-regular causes for omega-regular effects on executions of a reactive system, such as counterexamples uncovered by a model checker. Our theory is a generalization of temporal causality, which has recently been proposed as a framework for drawing causal relationships between trace properties on a given trace. So far, algorithms exist only for verifying a single causal relationship and, as an extension, cause synthesis through enumeration, which is complete only for a small fragment of effect properties. This work presents the first complete cause-synthesis algorithm for the class of omega-regular effects. We show that in this case, causes are guaranteed to be omega-regular themselves and can be computed as, e.g., nondeterministic B\"uchi automata. We demonstrate the practical feasibility of this algorithm with a prototype tool and evaluate its performance for cause synthesis and cause checking.</p></details> | <details><summary>Full ...</summary><p>Full version with appendix</p></details> |
| **[Temporal Transfer Learning for Traffic Optimization with Coarse-grained Advisory Autonomy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09436v2)** | 2024-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent development of connected and automated vehicle (CAV) technologies has spurred investigations to optimize dense urban traffic to maximize vehicle speed and throughput. This paper explores advisory autonomy, in which real-time driving advisories are issued to the human drivers, thus achieving near-term performance of automated vehicles. Due to the complexity of traffic systems, recent studies of coordinating CAVs have resorted to leveraging deep reinforcement learning (RL). Coarse-grained advisory is formalized as zero-order holds, and we consider a range of hold duration from 0.1 to 40 seconds. However, despite the similarity of the higher frequency tasks on CAVs, a direct application of deep RL fails to be generalized to advisory autonomy tasks. To overcome this, we utilize zero-shot transfer, training policies on a set of source tasks--specific traffic scenarios with designated hold durations--and then evaluating the efficacy of these policies on different target tasks. We introduce Temporal Transfer Learning (TTL) algorithms to select source tasks for zero-shot transfer, systematically leveraging the temporal structure to solve the full range of tasks. TTL selects the most suitable source tasks to maximize the performance of the range of tasks. We validate our algorithms on diverse mixed-traffic scenarios, demonstrating that TTL more reliably solves the tasks than baselines. This paper underscores the potential of coarse-grained advisory autonomy with TTL in traffic flow optimization.</p></details> | 18 pages, 12 figures |

In the medical domain, images containing temporal data are frequently utilized to study temporal dynamics and statistically monitor disease progression. While deep learning-based generative models for natural images have been widely researched, there are comparatively few methods available for synthesizing temporal knee X-rays. In this work, we introduce a novel deep-learning model designed to synthesize intermediate X-ray images between a specific patient's healthy knee and severe KOA stages. During the testing phase, based on a healthy knee X-ray, the proposed model can produce a continuous and effective sequence of KOA X-ray images with varying degrees of severity. Specifically, we introduce a Diffusion-based Morphing Model by modifying the Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model. Our approach integrates diffusion and morphing modules, enabling the model to capture spatial morphing details between source and target knee X-ray images and synthesize intermediate frames along a geodesic path. A hybrid loss consisting of diffusion loss, morphing loss, and supervision loss was employed. We demonstrate that our proposed approach achieves the highest temporal frame synthesis performance, effectively augmenting data for classification models and simulating the progression of KOA.</p></details> |  |

Existing dynamic graph anomaly detection approaches struggle to capture the rich semantics introduced by node and edge categories within TKGs, while TKG embedding methods lack interpretability, undermining the credibility of anomaly detection. Moreover, these methods falter in adapting to pattern changes and semantic drifts resulting from knowledge updates. To tackle these challenges, we introduce AnoT, an efficient TKG summarization method tailored for interpretable online anomaly detection in TKGs. AnoT begins by summarizing a TKG into a novel rule graph, enabling flexible inference of complex patterns in TKGs. When new knowledge emerges, AnoT maps it onto a node in the rule graph and traverses the rule graph recursively to derive the anomaly score of the knowledge. The traversal yields reachable nodes that furnish interpretable evidence for the validity or the anomalous of the new knowledge. Overall, AnoT embodies a detector-updater-monitor architecture, encompassing a detector for offline TKG summarization and online scoring, an updater for real-time rule graph updates based on emerging knowledge, and a monitor for estimating the approximation error of the rule graph. Experimental results on four real-world datasets demonstrate that AnoT surpasses existing methods significantly in terms of accuracy and interoperability. All of the raw datasets and the implementation of AnoT are provided in https://github.com/zjs123/ANoT.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 8 figures.

However, in nonstationary setting, existing work only partially addressed the problem by either utilizing observed auxiliary variables (e.g., class labels and/or domain indexes) as side information or assuming simplified latent causal dynamics. Both constrain the method to a limited range of scenarios. In this study, we further explored the Markov Assumption under time-delayed causally related process in nonstationary setting and showed that under mild conditions, the independent latent components can be recovered from their nonlinear mixture up to a permutation and a component-wise transformation, without the observation of auxiliary variables. We then introduce NCTRL, a principled estimation framework, to reconstruct time-delayed latent causal variables and identify their relations from measured sequential data only. Empirical evaluations demonstrated the reliable identification of time-delayed latent causal influences, with our methodology substantially outperforming existing baselines that fail to exploit the nonstationarity adequately and then, consequently, cannot distinguish distribution shifts.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2023. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2210.13647</p></details> |

While SNNs show promising efficiency on specialized sparse-computational hardware, their practical training often relies on conventional GPUs. This reliance frequently leads to extended computation times when contrasted with traditional Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), presenting significant hurdles for advancing SNN research. To navigate this challenge, we present a novel temporal fusion method, specifically designed to expedite the propagation dynamics of SNNs on GPU platforms, which serves as an enhancement to the current significant approaches for handling deep learning tasks with SNNs. This method underwent thorough validation through extensive experiments in both authentic training scenarios and idealized conditions, confirming its efficacy and adaptability for single and multi-GPU systems.

Unlike existing work, MOSCITO does not need a two-step procedure with tedious post-processing, but directly models essential properties of the data. Interpreting clusters as Markov states allows us to evaluate the clustering performance based on the resulting Markov state models. In experiments on 60 trajectories and 4 different proteins, we show that the performance of MOSCITO achieves state-of-the-art performance in a novel single-step method.

Different from conventional approaches that statically estimate fetal brain motions from pairs of images, our method dynamically tracks the rigid movement patterns of the fetal head across temporal and spatial dimensions. Specifically, we first develop an equivariant neural network that efficiently learns rigid motion sequences through low-dimensional spatial representations of images. Subsequently, we learn spatio-temporal representations by incorporating time encoding and self-attention neural network layers. This approach allows for the capture of long-term dependencies of fetal brain motion and addresses alignment errors due to contrast changes and severe motion artifacts. Our model also provides a geometric deformation estimation that properly addresses image distortions among all time frames. To the best of our knowledge, our approach is the first to learn spatial-temporal representations via deep neural networks for fetal motion tracking without data augmentation. We validated our model using real fetal echo-planar images with simulated and real motions. Our method carries significant potential value in accurately measuring, tracking, and correcting fetal motion in fetal MRI sequences.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 3 figures, Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Interventions (MICCAI) Workshop on Perinatal Imaging, Placental and Preterm Image analysis (PIPPI) 2024</p></details> |
| **[Transformers Learn Temporal Difference Methods for In-Context Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13861v3)** | 2024-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In-context learning refers to the learning ability of a model during inference time without adapting its parameters. The input (i.e., prompt) to the model (e.g., transformers) consists of both a context (i.e., instance-label pairs) and a query instance. The model is then able to output a label for the query instance according to the context during inference. A possible explanation for in-context learning is that the forward pass of (linear) transformers implements iterations of gradient descent on the instance-label pairs in the context. In this paper, we prove by construction that transformers can also implement temporal difference (TD) learning in the forward pass, a phenomenon we refer to as in-context TD. We demonstrate the emergence of in-context TD after training the transformer with a multi-task TD algorithm, accompanied by theoretical analysis. Furthermore, we prove that transformers are expressive enough to implement many other policy evaluation algorithms in the forward pass, including residual gradient, TD with eligibility trace, and average-reward TD.</p></details> |  |

Traditional methods rely on self-report questionnaires and clinical assessment, lacking objective biomarkers. Combining fMRI with artificial intelligence can enhance depression diagnosis by integrating neuroimaging indicators. However, the specificity of fMRI acquisition for depression often results in unbalanced and small datasets, challenging the sensitivity and accuracy of classification models. In this study, we propose the Spatio-Temporal Aggregation Network (STANet) for diagnosing depression by integrating CNN and RNN to capture both temporal and spatial features of brain activity. STANet comprises the following steps:(1) Aggregate spatio-temporal information via ICA. (2) Utilize multi-scale deep convolution to capture detailed features. (3) Balance data using the SMOTE to generate new samples for minority classes. (4) Employ the AFGRU classifier, which combines Fourier transformation with GRU, to capture long-term dependencies, with an adaptive weight assignment mechanism to enhance model generalization. The experimental results demonstrate that STANet achieves superior depression diagnostic performance with 82.38% accuracy and a 90.72% AUC. The STFA module enhances classification by capturing deeper features at multiple scales. The AFGRU classifier, with adaptive weights and stacked GRU, attains higher accuracy and AUC. SMOTE outperforms other oversampling methods. Additionally, spatio-temporal aggregated features achieve better performance compared to using only temporal or spatial features. STANet outperforms traditional or deep learning classifiers, and functional connectivity-based classifiers, as demonstrated by ten-fold cross-validation.</p></details> |  |

This study presents an unprecedented analysis, in terms of breadth, estimating the SIR transmission parameters from incidence data in all 5,570 municipalities in Brazil over 14 years (2010-2023) for both dengue and chikungunya. We describe the Episcanner computational pipeline, developed to estimate these parameters, producing a reusable dataset describing all dengue and chikungunya epidemics that have taken place in this period, in Brazil. The analysis reveals new insights into the climate-epidemic nexus: We identify distinct geographical and temporal patterns of arbovirus disease incidence across Brazil, highlighting how climatic factors like temperature and precipitation influence the timing and intensity of dengue and chikungunya epidemics. The innovative Episcanner tool empowers researchers and public health officials to explore these patterns in detail, facilitating targeted interventions and risk assessments. This research offers a new perspective on the long-term dynamics of climate-driven mosquito-borne diseases and their geographical specificities linked to the effects of global temperature fluctuations such as those captured by the ENSO index.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted for peer review</p></details> |
| **[Temporally Grounding Instructional Diagrams in Unconstrained Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12066v3)** | 2024-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the challenging problem of simultaneously localizing a sequence of queries in the form of instructional diagrams in a video. This requires understanding not only the individual queries but also their interrelationships. However, most existing methods focus on grounding one query at a time, ignoring the inherent structures among queries such as the general mutual exclusiveness and the temporal order. Consequently, the predicted timespans of different step diagrams may overlap considerably or violate the temporal order, thus harming the accuracy. In this paper, we tackle this issue by simultaneously grounding a sequence of step diagrams. Specifically, we propose composite queries, constructed by exhaustively pairing up the visual content features of the step diagrams and a fixed number of learnable positional embeddings. Our insight is that self-attention among composite queries carrying different content features suppress each other to reduce timespan overlaps in predictions, while the cross-attention corrects the temporal misalignment via content and position joint guidance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on the IAW dataset for grounding step diagrams and the YouCook2 benchmark for grounding natural language queries, significantly outperforming existing methods while simultaneously grounding multiple queries.</p></details> |  |

As a promising area, this paper studies an MTL-based control approach considering Signal Temporal Logic (STL). Task compliance is measured via the Robustness Degree (RD) which is computed by using the STL semantics. A suitable methodology is provided to solve the learning and testing stages, with an appropriate treatment of the non-convex terms in the quadratic objective function and using Sequential Convex Programming based on trust region update. In the learning stage, an ensemble of tasks is generated from deterministic goals to obtain a strong initializer for the testing stage, where related tasks are solved with a larger impact of perturbation. The methodology demonstrates to be robust in two dynamical systems showing results that meet the task specifications in a few shots for the testing stage, even for highly perturbed tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Optimal Signal Temporal Logic Decision Trees for Classification: A Max-Flow MILP Formulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21090v1)** | 2024-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a novel framework for inferring timed temporal logic properties from data. The dataset comprises pairs of finite-time system traces and corresponding labels, denoting whether the traces demonstrate specific desired behaviors, e.g. whether the ship follows a safe route or not. Our proposed approach leverages decision-tree-based methods to infer Signal Temporal Logic classifiers using primitive formulae. We formulate the inference process as a mixed integer linear programming optimization problem, recursively generating constraints to determine both data classification and tree structure. Applying a max-flow algorithm on the resultant tree transforms the problem into a global optimization challenge, leading to improved classification rates compared to prior methodologies. Moreover, we introduce a technique to reduce the number of constraints by exploiting the symmetry inherent in STL primitives, which enhances the algorithm's time performance and interpretability. To assess our algorithm's effectiveness and classification performance, we conduct three case studies involving two-class, multi-class, and complex formula classification scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatio-temporal areal models to support small area estimation: An application to national-scale forest carbon monitoring](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09909v2)** | 2024-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>National Forest Inventory (NFI) programs can provide vital information on the status, trend, and change in forest parameters. These programs are being increasingly asked to provide forest parameter estimates for spatial and temporal extents smaller than their current design and accompanying design-based methods can deliver with desired levels of uncertainty. Many NFI designs and estimation methods focus on status and are not well equipped to provide acceptable estimates for trend and change parameters, especially over small spatial domains and/or short time periods. Fine-scale space-time indexed estimates are critical to a variety of environmental, ecological, and economic monitoring efforts. Estimates for forest carbon status, trend, and change are of particular importance to international initiatives to track carbon dynamics. Model-based small area estimation (SAE) methods for NFI and similar ecological monitoring data typically pursue inference on status within small spatial domains, with few demonstrated methods that account for spatio-temporal dependence needed for trend and change estimation. We propose a spatio-temporal Bayesian model framework that delivers statistically valid estimates with full uncertainty quantification for status, trend, and change. The framework accommodates a variety of space and time dependency structures, and we detail model configurations for different settings. Through analysis of simulated datasets, we compare the relative performance of candidate models and a traditional direct estimator. We then apply candidate models to a large-scale NFI dataset to demonstrate the utility of the proposed framework for providing unique quantification of forest carbon dynamics in the contiguous United States. We also provide computationally efficient algorithms, software, and data to reproduce our results and for benchmarking.</p></details> |  |
| **[SpotFormer: Multi-Scale Spatio-Temporal Transformer for Facial Expression Spotting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20799v1)** | 2024-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Facial expression spotting, identifying periods where facial expressions occur in a video, is a significant yet challenging task in facial expression analysis. The issues of irrelevant facial movements and the challenge of detecting subtle motions in micro-expressions remain unresolved, hindering accurate expression spotting. In this paper, we propose an efficient framework for facial expression spotting. First, we propose a Sliding Window-based Multi-Resolution Optical flow (SW-MRO) feature, which calculates multi-resolution optical flow of the input image sequence within compact sliding windows. The window length is tailored to perceive complete micro-expressions and distinguish between general macro- and micro-expressions. SW-MRO can effectively reveal subtle motions while avoiding severe head movement problems. Second, we propose SpotFormer, a multi-scale spatio-temporal Transformer that simultaneously encodes spatio-temporal relationships of the SW-MRO features for accurate frame-level probability estimation. In SpotFormer, our proposed Facial Local Graph Pooling (FLGP) and convolutional layers are applied for multi-scale spatio-temporal feature extraction. We show the validity of the architecture of SpotFormer by comparing it with several model variants. Third, we introduce supervised contrastive learning into SpotFormer to enhance the discriminability between different types of expressions. Extensive experiments on SAMM-LV and CAS(ME)^2 show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art models, particularly in micro-expression spotting.</p></details> |  |
| **[STUPD: A Synthetic Dataset for Spatial and Temporal Relation Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06680v2)** | 2024-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding relations between objects is crucial for understanding the semantics of a visual scene. It is also an essential step in order to bridge visual and language models. However, current state-of-the-art computer vision models still lack the ability to perform spatial reasoning well. Existing datasets mostly cover a relatively small number of spatial relations, all of which are static relations that do not intrinsically involve motion. In this paper, we propose the Spatial and Temporal Understanding of Prepositions Dataset (STUPD) -- a large-scale video dataset for understanding static and dynamic spatial relationships derived from prepositions of the English language. The dataset contains 150K visual depictions (videos and images), consisting of 30 distinct spatial prepositional senses, in the form of object interaction simulations generated synthetically using Unity3D. In addition to spatial relations, we also propose 50K visual depictions across 10 temporal relations, consisting of videos depicting event/time-point interactions. To our knowledge, no dataset exists that represents temporal relations through visual settings. In this dataset, we also provide 3D information about object interactions such as frame-wise coordinates, and descriptions of the objects used. The goal of this synthetic dataset is to help models perform better in visual relationship detection in real-world settings. We demonstrate an increase in the performance of various models over 2 real-world datasets (ImageNet-VidVRD and Spatial Senses) when pretrained on the STUPD dataset, in comparison to other pretraining datasets.</p></details> |  |

Existing distortion correction solutions often struggle to balance computational complexity and accuracy. In this work, we propose an Adaptive Temporal Interval-based Continuous-Time LiDAR-only Odometry, utilizing straightforward and efficient linear interpolation. Our method flexibly adjusts the temporal intervals between control nodes according to the dynamics of motion and environmental characteristics. This adaptability enhances performance across various motion states and improves robustness in challenging, feature-sparse environments. We validate the effectiveness of our method on multiple datasets across different platforms, achieving accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art LiDAR-only odometry methods. Notably, in scenarios involving aggressive motion and sparse features, our method outperforms existing solutions.</p></details> |  |

Despite this, the application of SNNs in graph representation learning, particularly for non-Euclidean data, remains underexplored, and the influence of spiking dynamics on graph learning is not yet fully understood. This work seeks to address these gaps by examining the unique properties and benefits of spiking dynamics in enhancing graph representation learning. We propose a spike-based graph neural network model that incorporates spiking dynamics, enhanced by a novel spatial-temporal feature normalization (STFN) technique, to improve training efficiency and model stability. Our detailed analysis explores the impact of rate coding and temporal coding on SNN performance, offering new insights into their advantages for deep graph networks and addressing challenges such as the oversmoothing problem. Experimental results demonstrate that our SNN models can achieve competitive performance with state-of-the-art graph neural networks (GNNs) while considerably reducing computational costs, highlighting the potential of SNNs for efficient neuromorphic computing applications in complex graph-based scenarios.</p></details> |  |

To address these limitations, we propose FUTGA, a model equipped with fined-grained music understanding capabilities through learning from generative augmentation with temporal compositions. We leverage existing music caption datasets and large language models (LLMs) to synthesize fine-grained music captions with structural descriptions and time boundaries for full-length songs. Augmented by the proposed synthetic dataset, FUTGA is enabled to identify the music's temporal changes at key transition points and their musical functions, as well as generate detailed descriptions for each music segment. We further introduce a full-length music caption dataset generated by FUTGA, as the augmentation of the MusicCaps and the Song Describer datasets. We evaluate the automatically generated captions on several downstream tasks, including music generation and retrieval. The experiments demonstrate the quality of the generated captions and the better performance in various downstream tasks achieved by the proposed music captioning approach.

Recently, machine learning has emerged as an appealing alternative to improve accuracy and reduce computational time. However, due to limited observational technology and high costs, the scarcity of real-world data restricts the potential of machine learning models. To overcome these limitations, we propose an ocean SWH estimation framework, namely Orca. Specifically, Orca enhances the limited spatio-temporal reasoning abilities of classic LLMs with a novel spatiotemporal aware encoding module. By segmenting the limited buoy observational data temporally, encoding the buoys' locations spatially, and designing prompt templates, Orca capitalizes on the robust generalization ability of LLMs to estimate significant wave height effectively with limited data. Experimental results on the Gulf of Mexico demonstrate that Orca achieves state-of-the-art performance in SWH estimation.</p></details> |  |

This approach addresses the demand for explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) and seeks to overcome limitations imposed by model-based approaches and conservative constraints. We formulate our framework within the context of reinforcement learning to pave the way for safety-aware agents. Nevertheless, we assert that our approach could prove beneficial in various contexts, including a safety alert system or analytical purposes. A comprehensive examination of our framework is conducted using a realistic autonomous driving simulator, illustrating its high sample efficiency and reliable prediction capabilities for previously unseen collision events.

After collecting the public posts of around 5000 profiles from Disqus and Twitter, we analyze their posts to match their profiles across the two platforms. We pursue both temporal and non-temporal methods in our analysis. While neither approach proves definitively superior, the temporal approach generally performs better. We found that the temporal window size influences results more than the shifting amount. On the other hand, our sentiment analysis shows that the inclusion of sentiment makes little difference, probably due to flawed data extraction methods. We also experimented with a distance-based reward-and-punishment-focused scoring model, which achieved an accuracy of 24.198% and an average rank of 158.217 out of 2525 in our collected corpus. Future work includes refining sentiment analysis by evaluating sentiments per topic, extending temporal analysis with additional phases, and improving the scoring model through weight adjustments and modified rewards.</p></details> |  |
| **[FreeLong: Training-Free Long Video Generation with SpectralBlend Temporal Attention](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19918v1)** | 2024-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video diffusion models have made substantial progress in various video generation applications. However, training models for long video generation tasks require significant computational and data resources, posing a challenge to developing long video diffusion models. This paper investigates a straightforward and training-free approach to extend an existing short video diffusion model (e.g. pre-trained on 16-frame videos) for consistent long video generation (e.g. 128 frames). Our preliminary observation has found that directly applying the short video diffusion model to generate long videos can lead to severe video quality degradation. Further investigation reveals that this degradation is primarily due to the distortion of high-frequency components in long videos, characterized by a decrease in spatial high-frequency components and an increase in temporal high-frequency components. Motivated by this, we propose a novel solution named FreeLong to balance the frequency distribution of long video features during the denoising process. FreeLong blends the low-frequency components of global video features, which encapsulate the entire video sequence, with the high-frequency components of local video features that focus on shorter subsequences of frames. This approach maintains global consistency while incorporating diverse and high-quality spatiotemporal details from local videos, enhancing both the consistency and fidelity of long video generation. We evaluated FreeLong on multiple base video diffusion models and observed significant improvements. Additionally, our method supports coherent multi-prompt generation, ensuring both visual coherence and seamless transitions between scenes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://yulu.net.cn/freelong</p></details> |
| **[Three-Stream Temporal-Shift Attention Network Based on Self-Knowledge Distillation for Micro-Expression Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17538v2)** | 2024-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Micro-expressions are subtle facial movements that occur spontaneously when people try to conceal real emotions. Micro-expression recognition is crucial in many fields, including criminal analysis and psychotherapy. However, micro-expression recognition is challenging since micro-expressions have low intensity and public datasets are small in size. To this end, a three-stream temporal-shift attention network based on self-knowledge distillation called SKD-TSTSAN is proposed in this paper. Firstly, to address the low intensity of muscle movements, we utilize learning-based motion magnification modules to enhance the intensity of muscle movements. Secondly, we employ efficient channel attention modules in the local-spatial stream to make the network focus on facial regions that are highly relevant to micro-expressions. In addition, temporal shift modules are used in the dynamic-temporal stream, which enables temporal modeling with no additional parameters by mixing motion information from two different temporal domains. Furthermore, we introduce self-knowledge distillation into the micro-expression recognition task by introducing auxiliary classifiers and using the deepest section of the network for supervision, encouraging all blocks to fully explore the features of the training set. Finally, extensive experiments are conducted on four public datasets: CASME II, SAMM, MMEW, and CAS(ME)3. The experimental results demonstrate that our SKD-TSTSAN outperforms other existing methods and achieves new state-of-the-art performance. Our code will be available at https://github.com/GuanghaoZhu663/SKD-TSTSAN.</p></details> |  |

Despite recent advances with transformer-based forecasting models, challenges remain due to the non-stationary, nonlinear characteristics of workload time series and the long-term dependencies. In particular, inconsistent performance between long-term history and near-term forecasts hinders long-range predictions. This paper proposes a novel framework leveraging self-supervised multiscale representation learning to capture both long-term and near-term workload patterns. The long-term history is encoded through multiscale representations while the near-term observations are modeled via temporal flow fusion. These representations of different scales are fused using an attention mechanism and characterized with normalizing flows to handle non-Gaussian/non-linear distributions of time series. Extensive experiments on 9 benchmarks demonstrate superiority over existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proce...</summary><p>Proceedings of the 33rd ACM International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management (CIKM '24), October 21--25, 2024, Boise, ID, USA</p></details> |

Existing solutions primarily rely on the RGB modality, which encounters challenges such as background variations, occlusions, motion blurs, and significant computational overhead. Meanwhile, current keypoint-based methods offer a lightweight and informative representation of human motions but necessitate accurate individual annotations and specialized interaction reasoning modules. To address these limitations, we design a panoramic graph that incorporates multi-person skeletons and objects to encapsulate group activity, offering an effective alternative to RGB video. This panoramic graph enables Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) to unify intra-person, inter-person, and person-object interactive modeling through spatial-temporal graph convolutions. In practice, we develop a novel pipeline that extracts skeleton coordinates using pose estimation and tracking algorithms and employ Multi-person Panoramic GCN (MP-GCN) to predict group activities. Extensive experiments on Volleyball and NBA datasets demonstrate that the MP-GCN achieves state-of-the-art performance in both accuracy and efficiency. Notably, our method outperforms RGB-based approaches by using only estimated 2D keypoints as input. Code is available at https://github.com/mgiant/MP-GCN</p></details> |  |

However, due to the unpredictability of future events, this task is highly challenging. To address this issue, we propose a multi-scale hybrid architecture model based on ensemble learning, called RLGNet (Repeating-Local-Global History Network). Inspired by the application of multi-scale information in other fields, we introduce the concept of multi-scale information into TKG reasoning. Specifically, RLGNet captures and integrates different levels of historical information by combining modules that process information at various scales. The model comprises three modules: the Repeating History Module focuses on identifying repetitive patterns and trends in historical data, the Local History Module captures short-term changes and details, and the Global History Module provides a macro perspective on long-term changes. Additionally, to address the limitations of previous single-architecture models in generalizing across single-step and multi-step reasoning tasks, we adopted architectures based on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP) for the Local and Global History Modules, respectively. This hybrid architecture design enables the model to complement both multi-step and single-step reasoning capabilities. Finally, to address the issue of noise in TKGs, we adopt an ensemble learning strategy, combining the predictions of the three modules to reduce the impact of noise on the final prediction results. In the evaluation on six benchmark datasets, our approach generally outperforms existing TKG reasoning models in multi-step and single-step reasoning tasks.</p></details> |  |

This leads to the rising necessity for comprehensive studies to fully understand LLMs and reveal their potential opportunities, drawbacks, and overall societal impact. With that in mind, this research conducted an extensive investigation into seven LLM's, aiming to assess the temporal stability and inter-rater agreement on their responses on personality instruments in two time points. In addition, LLMs personality profile was analyzed and compared to human normative data. The findings revealed varying levels of inter-rater agreement in the LLMs responses over a short time, with some LLMs showing higher agreement (e.g., LIama3 and GPT-4o) compared to others (e.g., GPT-4 and Gemini). Furthermore, agreement depended on used instruments as well as on domain or trait. This implies the variable robustness in LLMs' ability to reliably simulate stable personality characteristics. In the case of scales which showed at least fair agreement, LLMs displayed mostly a socially desirable profile in both agentic and communal domains, as well as a prosocial personality profile reflected in higher agreeableness and conscientiousness and lower Machiavellianism. Exhibiting temporal stability and coherent responses on personality traits is crucial for AI systems due to their societal impact and AI safety concerns.</p></details> | 21 pages, 1 table |

Our findings indicate that CLIP embeddings, while crucial for aesthetic quality, do not significantly contribute towards the subject and background consistency of video outputs. Moreover, the computationally expensive cross-attention mechanism can be effectively replaced by a simpler linear layer. This layer is computed only once at the first diffusion inference step, and its output is then cached and reused throughout the inference process, thereby enhancing efficiency while maintaining high-quality outputs. Building on these insights, we introduce the VCUT, a training-free approach optimized for efficiency within the SVD architecture. VCUT eliminates temporal cross-attention and replaces spatial cross-attention with a one-time computed linear layer, significantly reducing computational load. The implementation of VCUT leads to a reduction of up to 322T Multiple-Accumulate Operations (MACs) per video and a decrease in model parameters by up to 50M, achieving a 20% reduction in latency compared to the baseline. Our approach demonstrates that conditioning during the Semantic Binding stage is sufficient, eliminating the need for continuous computation across all inference steps and setting a new standard for efficient video generation.</p></details> |  |

Unlike existing techniques that take multiple manual steps to derive standardized skeleton representations as model input, we propose a novel Spatial-Temporal Mesh Transformer (STMT) to directly model the mesh sequences. The model uses a hierarchical transformer with intra-frame off-set attention and inter-frame self-attention. The attention mechanism allows the model to freely attend between any two vertex patches to learn non-local relationships in the spatial-temporal domain. Masked vertex modeling and future frame prediction are used as two self-supervised tasks to fully activate the bi-directional and auto-regressive attention in our hierarchical transformer. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to skeleton-based and point-cloud-based models on common MoCap benchmarks.

Within a discourse, event pairs are situated at different distances or the so-called proximity bands. The temporal ordering communicated about event pairs where at more remote (i.e., ``long'') or less remote (i.e., ``short'') proximity bands are encoded differently. SOTA models have tended to perform well on events situated at either short or long proximity bands, but not both. Nonetheless, real-world, natural texts contain all types of temporal event-pairs. In this paper, we present MulCo: Distilling Multi-Scale Knowledge via Contrastive Learning, a knowledge co-distillation approach that shares knowledge across multiple event pair proximity bands to improve performance on all types of temporal datasets.

| **[The Role of Temporal Hierarchy in Spiking Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18838v1)** | 2024-07-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have the potential for rich spatio-temporal signal processing thanks to exploiting both spatial and temporal parameters. The temporal dynamics such as time constants of the synapses and neurons and delays have been recently shown to have computational benefits that help reduce the overall number of parameters required in the network and increase the accuracy of the SNNs in solving temporal tasks. Optimizing such temporal parameters, for example, through gradient descent, gives rise to a temporal architecture for different problems. As has been shown in machine learning, to reduce the cost of optimization, architectural biases can be applied, in this case in the temporal domain. Such inductive biases in temporal parameters have been found in neuroscience studies, highlighting a hierarchy of temporal structure and input representation in different layers of the cortex. Motivated by this, we propose to impose a hierarchy of temporal representation in the hidden layers of SNNs, highlighting that such an inductive bias improves their performance. We demonstrate the positive effects of temporal hierarchy in the time constants of feed-forward SNNs applied to temporal tasks (Multi-Time-Scale XOR and Keyword Spotting, with a benefit of up to 4.1% in classification accuracy). Moreover, we show that such architectural biases, i.e. hierarchy of time constants, naturally emerge when optimizing the time constants through gradient descent, initialized as homogeneous values. We further pursue this proposal in temporal convolutional SNNs, by introducing the hierarchical bias in the size and dilation of temporal kernels, giving rise to competitive results in popular temporal spike-based datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 9 figures, pre-print</p></details> |
| **[Graph Neural Networks for Virtual Sensing in Complex Systems: Addressing Heterogeneous Temporal Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18691v1)** | 2024-07-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-time condition monitoring is crucial for the reliable and efficient operation of complex systems. However, relying solely on physical sensors can be limited due to their cost, placement constraints, or inability to directly measure certain critical parameters. Virtual sensing addresses these limitations by leveraging readily available sensor data and system knowledge to estimate inaccessible parameters or infer system states. The increasing complexity of industrial systems necessitates deployments of sensors with diverse modalities to provide a comprehensive understanding of system states. These sensors capture data at varying frequencies to monitor both rapid and slowly varying system dynamics, as well as local and global state evolutions of the systems. This leads to heterogeneous temporal dynamics, which, particularly under varying operational end environmental conditions, pose a significant challenge for accurate virtual sensing. To address this, we propose a Heterogeneous Temporal Graph Neural Network (HTGNN) framework. HTGNN explicitly models signals from diverse sensors and integrates operating conditions into the model architecture. We evaluate HTGNN using two newly released datasets: a bearing dataset with diverse load conditions for bearing load prediction and a year-long simulated dataset for predicting bridge live loads. Our results demonstrate that HTGNN significantly outperforms established baseline methods in both tasks, particularly under highly varying operating conditions. These results highlight HTGNN's potential as a robust and accurate virtual sensing approach for complex systems, paving the way for improved monitoring, predictive maintenance, and enhanced system performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper extends our previous conference paper (Best Paper at European Conference of the PHM Society 2024, https://doi.org/10.36001/phme.2024.v8i1.3998)</p></details> |

However, sampling speed has traditionally not been a priority due to their popularity for image generation, limiting their application to dynamical tasks. While recent work has improved the sampling speed of diffusion-based robotic policies, they are restricted to techniques from the image generation domain. We adapt Temporally Entangled Diffusion (TEDi), a framework specific for trajectory generation, to speed up diffusion-based policies for imitation learning. We introduce TEDi Policy, with novel regimes for training and sampling, and show that it drastically improves the sampling speed while remaining performant when applied to state-of-the-art diffusion-based imitation learning policies.</p></details> |  |

However, conventional forecasting models encounter significant challenges in precisely predicting wind conditions at high spatial resolutions for individual locations or small geographical areas (< 20 km2) and capturing medium to long-range temporal trends and comprehensive spatio-temporal patterns. This study focuses on a spatial temporal approach for high-resolution gridded wind forecasting at the height of 3 and 10 metres across large areas of the Southwest of Western Australia to overcome these challenges. The model utilises the data that covers a broad geographic area and harnesses a diverse array of meteorological factors, including terrain characteristics, air pressure, 10-metre wind forecasts from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, and limited observation data from sparsely distributed weather stations (such as 3-metre wind profiles, humidity, and temperature), the model demonstrates promising advancements in wind forecasting accuracy and reliability across the entire region of interest. This paper shows the potential of our machine learning model for wind forecasts across various prediction horizons and spatial coverage. It can help facilitate more informed decision-making and enhance resilience across critical sectors.</p></details> |  |

Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks (STGNNs) demonstrate good performance on many Temporal-correlation Forecasting Problem. However, when applied to tasks lacking periodicity, such as stock data prediction, the effectiveness and robustness of STGNNs are found to be unsatisfactory. And STGNNs are limited by memory savings so that cannot handle problems with a large number of nodes. In this paper, we propose a novel approach called the Temporal-Correlation Graph Pre-trained Network (TCGPN) to address these limitations. TCGPN utilize Temporal-correlation fusion encoder to get a mixed representation and pre-training method with carefully designed temporal and correlation pre-training tasks. Entire structure is independent of the number and order of nodes, so better results can be obtained through various data enhancements. And memory consumption during training can be significantly reduced through multiple sampling. Experiments are conducted on real stock market data sets CSI300 and CSI500 that exhibit minimal periodicity. We fine-tune a simple MLP in downstream tasks and achieve state-of-the-art results, validating the capability to capture more robust temporal correlation patterns.</p></details> |  |
| **[Harnessing Temporal Causality for Advanced Temporal Action Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17792v2)** | 2024-07-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As a fundamental task in long-form video understanding, temporal action detection (TAD) aims to capture inherent temporal relations in untrimmed videos and identify candidate actions with precise boundaries. Over the years, various networks, including convolutions, graphs, and transformers, have been explored for effective temporal modeling for TAD. However, these modules typically treat past and future information equally, overlooking the crucial fact that changes in action boundaries are essentially causal events. Inspired by this insight, we propose leveraging the temporal causality of actions to enhance TAD representation by restricting the model's access to only past or future context. We introduce CausalTAD, which combines causal attention and causal Mamba to achieve state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks. Notably, with CausalTAD, we ranked 1st in the Action Recognition, Action Detection, and Audio-Based Interaction Detection tracks at the EPIC-Kitchens Challenge 2024, as well as 1st in the Moment Queries track at the Ego4D Challenge 2024.

| **[Causal Deepsets for Off-policy Evaluation under Spatial or Spatio-temporal Interferences](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17910v1)** | 2024-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Off-policy evaluation (OPE) is widely applied in sectors such as pharmaceuticals and e-commerce to evaluate the efficacy of novel products or policies from offline datasets. This paper introduces a causal deepset framework that relaxes several key structural assumptions, primarily the mean-field assumption, prevalent in existing OPE methodologies that handle spatio-temporal interference. These traditional assumptions frequently prove inadequate in real-world settings, thereby restricting the capability of current OPE methods to effectively address complex interference effects. In response, we advocate for the implementation of the permutation invariance (PI) assumption. This innovative approach enables the data-driven, adaptive learning of the mean-field function, offering a more flexible estimation method beyond conventional averaging. Furthermore, we present novel algorithms that incorporate the PI assumption into OPE and thoroughly examine their theoretical foundations. Our numerical analyses demonstrate that this novel approach yields significantly more precise estimations than existing baseline algorithms, thereby substantially improving the practical applicability and effectiveness of OPE methodologies. A Python implementation of our proposed method is available at https://github.com/BIG-S2/Causal-Deepsets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reliable Spatial-Temporal Voxels For Multi-Modal Test-Time Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06461v3)** | 2024-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-modal test-time adaptation (MM-TTA) is proposed to adapt models to an unlabeled target domain by leveraging the complementary multi-modal inputs in an online manner. Previous MM-TTA methods for 3D segmentation rely on predictions of cross-modal information in each input frame, while they ignore the fact that predictions of geometric neighborhoods within consecutive frames are highly correlated, leading to unstable predictions across time. To fulfill this gap, we propose ReLiable Spatial-temporal Voxels (Latte), an MM-TTA method that leverages reliable cross-modal spatial-temporal correspondences for multi-modal 3D segmentation. Motivated by the fact that reliable predictions should be consistent with their spatial-temporal correspondences, Latte aggregates consecutive frames in a slide window manner and constructs Spatial-Temopral (ST) voxels to capture temporally local prediction consistency for each modality. After filtering out ST voxels with high ST entropy, Latte conducts cross-modal learning for each point and pixel by attending to those with reliable and consistent predictions among both spatial and temporal neighborhoods. Experimental results show that Latte achieves state-of-the-art performance on three different MM-TTA benchmarks compared to previous MM-TTA or TTA methods.

Effectively extracting meaningful representations for user-generated check-in sequences is pivotal for facilitating various downstream services. However, the user-generated check-in data are simultaneously influenced by the surrounding objective circumstances and the user's subjective intention. Specifically, the temporal uncertainty and spatial diversity exhibited in check-in data make it difficult to capture the macroscopic spatial-temporal patterns of users and to understand the semantics of user mobility activities. Furthermore, the distinct characteristics of the temporal and spatial information in check-in sequences call for an effective fusion method to incorporate these two types of information. In this paper, we propose a novel Spatial-Temporal Cross-view Contrastive Representation (STCCR) framework for check-in sequence representation learning. Specifically, STCCR addresses the above challenges by employing self-supervision from "spatial topic" and "temporal intention" views, facilitating effective fusion of spatial and temporal information at the semantic level. Besides, STCCR leverages contrastive clustering to uncover users' shared spatial topics from diverse mobility activities, while employing angular momentum contrast to mitigate the impact of temporal uncertainty and noise. We extensively evaluate STCCR on three real-world datasets and demonstrate its superior performance across three downstream tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted as a regular paper at IEEE TKDE</p></details> |
| **[CRASH: Crash Recognition and Anticipation System Harnessing with Context-Aware and Temporal Focus Attentions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17757v1)** | 2024-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurately and promptly predicting accidents among surrounding traffic agents from camera footage is crucial for the safety of autonomous vehicles (AVs). This task presents substantial challenges stemming from the unpredictable nature of traffic accidents, their long-tail distribution, the intricacies of traffic scene dynamics, and the inherently constrained field of vision of onboard cameras. To address these challenges, this study introduces a novel accident anticipation framework for AVs, termed CRASH. It seamlessly integrates five components: object detector, feature extractor, object-aware module, context-aware module, and multi-layer fusion. Specifically, we develop the object-aware module to prioritize high-risk objects in complex and ambiguous environments by calculating the spatial-temporal relationships between traffic agents. In parallel, the context-aware is also devised to extend global visual information from the temporal to the frequency domain using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and capture fine-grained visual features of potential objects and broader context cues within traffic scenes. To capture a wider range of visual cues, we further propose a multi-layer fusion that dynamically computes the temporal dependencies between different scenes and iteratively updates the correlations between different visual features for accurate and timely accident prediction. Evaluated on real-world datasets--Dashcam Accident Dataset (DAD), Car Crash Dataset (CCD), and AnAn Accident Detection (A3D) datasets--our model surpasses existing top baselines in critical evaluation metrics like Average Precision (AP) and mean Time-To-Accident (mTTA). Importantly, its robustness and adaptability are particularly evident in challenging driving scenarios with missing or limited training data, demonstrating significant potential for application in real-world autonomous driving systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Adaptive Pseudo-label Learning for Semi-Supervised Temporal Action Localization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07673v3)** | 2024-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Alleviating noisy pseudo labels remains a key challenge in Semi-Supervised Temporal Action Localization (SS-TAL). Existing methods often filter pseudo labels based on strict conditions, but they typically assess classification and localization quality separately, leading to suboptimal pseudo-label ranking and selection. In particular, there might be inaccurate pseudo labels within selected positives, alongside reliable counterparts erroneously assigned to negatives. To tackle these problems, we propose a novel Adaptive Pseudo-label Learning (APL) framework to facilitate better pseudo-label selection. Specifically, to improve the ranking quality, Adaptive Label Quality Assessment (ALQA) is proposed to jointly learn classification confidence and localization reliability, followed by dynamically selecting pseudo labels based on the joint score. Additionally, we propose an Instance-level Consistency Discriminator (ICD) for eliminating ambiguous positives and mining potential positives simultaneously based on inter-instance intrinsic consistency, thereby leading to a more precise selection. We further introduce a general unsupervised Action-aware Contrastive Pre-training (ACP) to enhance the discrimination both within actions and between actions and backgrounds, which benefits SS-TAL. Extensive experiments on THUMOS14 and ActivityNet v1.3 demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance under various semi-supervised settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ECCV 2024</p></details> |

The proposed method integrates risk awareness and trajectory planning by leveraging probabilistic models to evaluate the likelihood of collisions with dynamic and static obstacles. The RALTPER focuses on collision avoidance constraints for both the ego vehicle region and the Gaussian-obstacle risk region. Additionally, this work enhances the generalization of both vehicle and obstacle models, making the planner adaptable to a wider range of scenarios. Our approach formulates the planning problem as a nonlinear optimization, solved using the IPOPT solver within the CasADi environment. The planner is evaluated through simulations of various challenging scenarios, including complex, static, mixed environment and narrow single-lane avoidance of pedestrians. Results demonstrate that RALTPER achieves safer and more efficient trajectory planning particularly in navigating narrow areas where a more accurate vehicle profile representation is critical for avoiding collisions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory Planning for Teleoperated Space Manipulators Using Deep Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05460v1)** | 2024-08-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory planning for teleoperated space manipulators involves challenges such as accurately modeling system dynamics, particularly in free-floating modes with non-holonomic constraints, and managing time delays that increase model uncertainty and affect control precision. Traditional teleoperation methods rely on precise dynamic models requiring complex parameter identification and calibration, while data-driven methods do not require prior knowledge but struggle with time delays. A novel framework utilizing deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is introduced to address these challenges. The framework incorporates three methods: Mapping, Prediction, and State Augmentation, to handle delays when delayed state information is received at the master end. The Soft Actor Critic (SAC) algorithm processes the state information to compute the next action, which is then sent to the remote manipulator for environmental interaction. Four environments are constructed using the MuJoCo simulation platform to account for variations in base and target fixation: fixed base and target, fixed base with rotated target, free-floating base with fixed target, and free-floating base with rotated target. Extensive experiments with both constant and random delays are conducted to evaluate the proposed methods. Results demonstrate that all three methods effectively address trajectory planning challenges, with State Augmentation showing superior efficiency and robustness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Nonlinear Propagation of Non-Gaussian Uncertainties: Theory and Applications to Spacecraft Trajectory Design](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05384v1)** | 2024-08-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a novel approach for propagating uncertainties in dynamical systems building on high-order Taylor expansions of the flow and moment-generating functions (MGFs). Unlike prior methods that focus on Gaussian distributions, our approach leverages the relationship between MGFs and distribution moments to extend high-order uncertainty propagation techniques to non-Gaussian scenarios. This significantly broadens the applicability of these methods to a wider range of problems and uncertainty types. High-order moment computations are performed one-off and symbolically, reducing the computational burden of the technique to the calculation of Taylor series coefficients around a nominal trajectory, achieved by efficiently integrating the system's variational equations. Furthermore, the use of the proposed approach in combination with event transition tensors, allows for accurate propagation of uncertainties at specific events, such as the landing surface of a celestial body, the crossing of a predefined Poincar\'e section, or the trigger of an arbitrary event during the propagation. Via numerical simulations we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in various astrodynamics applications, including the unperturbed and perturbed two-body problem, and the circular restricted three-body problem, showing that it accurately propagates non-Gaussian uncertainties both at future times and at event manifolds.</p></details> |  |

Building on prior work, it addresses the multi-robot communication-aware trajectory planning problem using a general optimisation framework that imposes linear constraints on changes in robot positions to ensure communication performance and collision avoidance. In this paper, the optimisation problem is solved distributively by separating the communication performance constraint through an economic approach. Here, the current communication budget is distributed equally among the robots, and the robots are allowed to trade parts of their budgets with each other. The separated optimisation problem is then solved using the consensus alternating direction method of multipliers. The method was verified through simulation in an inspection task problem.</p></details> |  |

It is important to develop a versatile trajectory learning method that performs different tasks with high accuracy. This involves effectively extracting two core aspects of information--movement patterns and travel purposes--from trajectories. However, this is challenging due to limitations in model capacity and the quality and scale of trajectory datasets. Meanwhile, large language models (LLMs) have shown great success in versatility by training on large-scale, high-quality datasets. Given the similarities between trajectories and sentences, there's potential to leverage LLMs to develop an effective trajectory learning method. However, standard LLMs are not designed to handle the unique spatio-temporal features of trajectories and cannot extract movement patterns and travel purposes. To address these challenges, we propose a model called TrajCogn that effectively utilizes LLMs to model trajectories. TrajCogn leverages the strengths of LLMs to create a versatile trajectory learning approach while addressing the limitations of standard LLMs. First, TrajCogn incorporates a novel trajectory semantic embedder that enables LLMs to process spatio-temporal features and extract movement patterns and travel purposes. Second, TrajCogn introduces a new trajectory prompt that integrates these patterns and purposes into LLMs, allowing the model to adapt to various tasks. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets and two representative tasks demonstrate that TrajCogn successfully achieves its design goals.

| **[PTrajM: Efficient and Semantic-rich Trajectory Learning with Pretrained Trajectory-Mamba](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04916v1)** | 2024-08-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vehicle trajectories provide crucial movement information for various real-world applications. To better utilize vehicle trajectories, it is essential to develop a trajectory learning approach that can effectively and efficiently extract rich semantic information, including movement behavior and travel purposes, to support accurate downstream applications. However, creating such an approach presents two significant challenges. First, movement behavior are inherently spatio-temporally continuous, making them difficult to extract efficiently from irregular and discrete trajectory points. Second, travel purposes are related to the functionalities of areas and road segments traversed by vehicles. These functionalities are not available from the raw spatio-temporal trajectory features and are hard to extract directly from complex textual features associated with these areas and road segments. To address these challenges, we propose PTrajM, a novel method capable of efficient and semantic-rich vehicle trajectory learning. To support efficient modeling of movement behavior, we introduce Trajectory-Mamba as the learnable model of PTrajM, which effectively extracts continuous movement behavior while being more computationally efficient than existing structures. To facilitate efficient extraction of travel purposes, we propose a travel purpose-aware pre-training procedure, which enables PTrajM to discern the travel purposes of trajectories without additional computational resources during its embedding process. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets and comparisons with several state-of-the-art trajectory learning methods demonstrate the effectiveness of PTrajM.

We report the Pearson correlation between a linear projection of the generated trajectories and articulatory data derived from a multi-speaker dataset of electromagnetic articulography (EMA) recordings. A correlation of 0.67 is obtained with an extended feature set based on generative phonology and a linear interpolation technique.

To enhance the interpretability of these latent temporal processes, we develop a semi-supervised approach for disentangling the latent space using established medical knowledge. By combining the generative approach with medical definitions of different characteristics of SSc, we facilitate the discovery of new aspects of the disease.

In our method, robots are represented by 3D points on their link surfaces. The task space of a robot is represented by a point cloud that can be obtained from depth sensors. Using the point-cloud representation, goal reaching in grasping can be formulated as point matching, while collision avoidance can be efficiently achieved by querying the signed distance values of the robot points in the signed distance field of the scene points. Consequently, a constrained nonlinear optimization problem is formulated to solve the joint motion and grasp planning problem. The advantage of our method is that the point-cloud representation is general to be used with any robot in any environment. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by performing experiments on a tabletop scene and a shelf scene for grasping with a Fetch mobile manipulator and a Franka Panda arm.

To address these challenges, we introduce UniTraj, a comprehensive framework that unifies various datasets, models, and evaluation criteria, presenting new opportunities for the vehicle trajectory prediction field. In particular, using UniTraj, we conduct extensive experiments and find that model performance significantly drops when transferred to other datasets. However, enlarging data size and diversity can substantially improve performance, leading to a new state-of-the-art result for the nuScenes dataset.

Our goal is to compute suitable trajectories that (1) satisfy the environment-specific traversability constraints and (2) generate human-like paths while navigating in crosswalks, sidewalks, etc. Our formulation uses a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) generative model enhanced with traversability constraints to generate multiple candidate trajectories for global navigation. We use VLMs and a visual prompting approach with their zero-shot ability of semantic understanding and logical reasoning to choose the best trajectory given the contextual information about the task. We evaluate our methods in various outdoor scenes with wheeled robots and compare the performance with other global navigation algorithms. In practice, we observe at least 3.35% improvement in traversability and 20.61% improvement in terms of human-like navigation in generated trajectories in challenging outdoor navigation scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Pose-Aware Self-Supervised Learning with Viewpoint Trajectory Regularization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14973v2)** | 2024-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning visual features from unlabeled images has proven successful for semantic categorization, often by mapping different $views$ of the same object to the same feature to achieve recognition invariance. However, visual recognition involves not only identifying $what$ an object is but also understanding $how$ it is presented. For example, seeing a car from the side versus head-on is crucial for deciding whether to stay put or jump out of the way. While unsupervised feature learning for downstream viewpoint reasoning is important, it remains under-explored, partly due to the lack of a standardized evaluation method and benchmarks. We introduce a new dataset of adjacent image triplets obtained from a viewpoint trajectory, without any semantic or pose labels. We benchmark both semantic classification and pose estimation accuracies on the same visual feature. Additionally, we propose a viewpoint trajectory regularization loss for learning features from unlabeled image triplets. Our experiments demonstrate that this approach helps develop a visual representation that encodes object identity and organizes objects by their poses, retaining semantic classification accuracy while achieving emergent global pose awareness and better generalization to novel objects.

Learning-based methods are currently showing impressive results in simulation-based challenges, with transformer-based architectures technologically leading the way. Ultimately, however, predictions are needed in the real world. In addition to the shifts from simulation to the real world, many vehicle- and country-specific shifts, i.e. differences in sensor systems, fusion and perception algorithms as well as traffic rules and laws, are on the agenda. Since models that can cover all system setups and design domains at once are not yet foreseeable, model adaptation plays a central role. Therefore, a simulation-based study on transfer learning techniques is conducted on basis of a transformer-based model.

Such a robot needs to be able to constantly adapt to the surrounding scene based on egocentric vision, and predict the ego motion of the wearer. In this work, we leveraged body-mounted cameras and sensors to anticipate the trajectory of human wearers through complex surroundings. To facilitate research in ego-motion prediction, we have collected a comprehensive walking scene navigation dataset centered on the user's perspective. We then present a method to predict human motion conditioning on the surrounding static scene. Our method leverages a diffusion model to produce a distribution of potential future trajectories, taking into account the user's observation of the environment. To that end, we introduce a compact representation to encode the user's visual memory of the surroundings, as well as an efficient sample-generating technique to speed up real-time inference of a diffusion model. We ablate our model and compare it to baselines, and results show that our model outperforms existing methods on key metrics of collision avoidance and trajectory mode coverage.</p></details> | 13 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Stochastic Trajectory Optimization for Demonstration Imitation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03131v2)** | 2024-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Humans often learn new skills by imitating the experts and gradually developing their proficiency. In this work, we introduce Stochastic Trajectory Optimization for Demonstration Imitation (STODI), a trajectory optimization framework for robots to imitate the shape of demonstration trajectories with improved dynamic performance. Consistent with the human learning process, demonstration imitation serves as an initial step, while trajectory optimization aims to enhance robot motion performance. By generating random noise and constructing proper cost functions, the STODI effectively explores and exploits generated noisy trajectories while preserving the demonstration shape characteristics. We employ three metrics to measure the similarity of trajectories in both the time and frequency domains to help with demonstration imitation. Theoretical analysis reveals relationships among these metrics, emphasizing the benefits of frequency-domain analysis for specific tasks. Experiments on a 7-DOF robotic arm in the PyBullet simulator validate the efficacy of the STODI framework, showcasing the improved optimization performance and stability compared to previous methods.</p></details> |  |

Throughout this work we seek a controller that is, robust to the uncertainty and disturbance, accurate, and implementable. To perform these requirements, we use a nonlinear Lyapunov-based approach for designing the controller and guaranteeing its stability. MATLAB-SIMULINK software is used to validate the approach and demonstrate the performance of the controller. Simulation results show that the derived controller is stable, robust to the disturbance and uncertainties, accurate, and implementable.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Holistic Optimization Framework for Energy Efficient UAV-assisted Fog Computing: Attitude Control, Trajectory Planning and Task Assignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14894v2)** | 2024-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have significantly enhanced fog computing by acting as both flexible computation platforms and communication mobile relays. In this paper, we propose a holistic framework that jointly optimizes the total latency and energy consumption for UAV-assisted fog computing in a three-dimensional spatial domain with varying terrain elevations and dynamic task generations. Our proposed framework considers three important and interdependent modules: attitude control, trajectory planning, and task assignment. We first establish a fuzzy proportional-integral-derivative control model to determine the UAV's attitude. Then, we propose an enhanced Ant Colony System (ACS) based algorithm, that includes a safety value and a decoupling mechanism to overcome the convergence issue in classical ACS, to compute the optimal UAV trajectory. Finally, we design an algorithm based on the Particle Swarm Optimization technique, to determine where each offloaded task should be executed. Under our proposed framework, the outcome of one module would affect the decision-making in one other, providing a holistic perspective of the system and thus leading to improved solutions. We demonstrate by extensive simulation results that our proposed framework can significantly improve the overall performance, measured by latency and energy consumption, compared to existing baseline approaches.</p></details> | 14 pages, 10 figures |

Such manoeuvring flight envelope variations, governed by the aircraft's complex nonlinear dynamics, are unpredictable by pilots and existing flight management systems. To prevent in-flight Loss of Control, post-failure trajectories must be optimal, planned in real-time, avoid terrain, and adhere to the impaired aircraft's reduced manoeuvrability and dynamic constraints. This paper presents a novel real-time trajectory optimization method for impaired aircraft based on a combination of differential flatness theory, the pseudospectral method, nonlinear programming, and inverse dynamics. In the proposed method, which utilizes a high-fidelity nonlinear six degree-of-freedom model, to conform to aircraft's altered dynamics a sequence of trim points is selected from the impaired aircraft's manoeuvring flight envelope based on the chosen optimization criteria, ensuring that the resulting three-dimensional trajectory observes terrain avoidance. Then, the required control inputs are obtained for each manoeuvre in less than a second. The method is applied to the NASA Generic Transport Model with rudder failure near a complex mountainous terrain. Both an optimal one-piece trajectory and a near-optimal piecewise path consisting of several optimal trajectories, are generated in non-real-time and real-time, respectively, and compared. Results show that the near-optimal real-time trajectory retains up to 80% of the optimality.</p></details> | <details><summary>56 pa...</summary><p>56 pages, 21 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[LC-LLM: Explainable Lane-Change Intention and Trajectory Predictions with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18344v2)** | 2024-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To ensure safe driving in dynamic environments, autonomous vehicles should possess the capability to accurately predict lane change intentions of surrounding vehicles in advance and forecast their future trajectories. Existing motion prediction approaches have ample room for improvement, particularly in terms of long-term prediction accuracy and interpretability. In this paper, we address these challenges by proposing LC-LLM, an explainable lane change prediction model that leverages the strong reasoning capabilities and self-explanation abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Essentially, we reformulate the lane change prediction task as a language modeling problem, processing heterogeneous driving scenario information as natural language prompts for LLMs and employing supervised fine-tuning to tailor LLMs specifically for lane change prediction task. Additionally, we finetune the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning to improve prediction transparency and reliability, and include explanatory requirements in the prompts during inference stage. Therefore, our LC-LLM model not only predicts lane change intentions and trajectories but also provides CoT reasoning and explanations for its predictions, enhancing its interpretability. Extensive experiments based on the large-scale highD dataset demonstrate the superior performance and interpretability of our LC-LLM in lane change prediction task. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to utilize LLMs for predicting lane change behavior. Our study shows that LLMs can effectively encode comprehensive interaction information for driving behavior understanding.</p></details> | 12 pages, 9 figures |

Due to a large amount of variability in brain anatomy between different individuals, we hypothesize that leveraging MRI time series can help improve specificity, by treating each patient as their own baseline. Here we turn to conditional variational autoencoders to generate individualized MRI predictions given the subject's age, disease status and one previous scan. Using serial imaging data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, we train a novel architecture to build a latent space distribution which can be sampled from to generate future predictions of changing anatomy. This enables us to extrapolate beyond the dataset and predict MRIs up to 10 years. We evaluated the model on a held-out set from ADNI and an independent dataset (from Open Access Series of Imaging Studies). By comparing to several alternatives, we show that our model produces more individualized images with higher resolution. Further, if an individual already has a follow-up MRI, we demonstrate a usage of our model to compute a likelihood ratio classifier for disease status. In practice, the model may be able to assist in early diagnosis of AD and provide a counterfactual baseline trajectory for treatment effect estimation. Furthermore, it generates a synthetic dataset that can potentially be used for downstream tasks such as anomaly detection and classification.</p></details> | <details><summary>MICCA...</summary><p>MICCAI 2024 LDTM workshop</p></details> |

In particular, the tasks of different types and service requirements in MEC network are offloaded from one UAV to another. To pursue the goal of low-carbon edge computing, we study the problem of minimizing system energy consumption by jointly optimizing computation resource allocation, task scheduling, service placement, and UAV trajectories. Considering the inherent unpredictability associated with task generation and the dynamic nature of wireless fading channels, addressing this problem presents a significant challenge. To overcome this issue, we reformulate the complicated non-convex problem as a Markov decision process and propose a soft actor-critic-based trajectory optimization and resource allocation algorithm to implement a flexible learning strategy. Numerical results illustrate that within a multi-UAV-enabled MEC network, the proposed algorithm effectively reduces the system energy consumption in heterogeneous tasks and services scenarios compared to other baseline solutions.</p></details> | 11 pages, 10 figures |

In the past, relatively simple physics-motivated priors have been considered for such approaches, using assumptions such as constant velocity or acceleration. This paper presents an approach to incorporating exogenous control inputs, such as velocity or acceleration commands, into the continuous Gaussian process state-estimation framework. It is shown that this approach generalizes across different domains in robotics, making it applicable to both the estimation of continuous-time trajectories for mobile robots and continuum-robot shapes. Results show that incorporating control inputs leads to more informed priors, potentially requiring less measurements and estimation nodes to obtain accurate estimates. This makes the approach particularly useful in situations in which limited sensing is available.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures, submitted to IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters</p></details> |

In this study, we focus on a scenario where a connected and autonomous vehicle (CAV) serves as the central agent, utilizing both sensors and communication technologies to perceive its surrounding traffics consisting of autonomous vehicles (AVs), connected vehicles (CVs), and human-driven vehicles (HDVs). Our trajectory prediction task is aimed at all the detected surrounding vehicles. To effectively integrate the multi-source data from both sensor and communication technologies, we propose a deep learning framework called MSMA utilizing a cross-attention module for multi-source data fusion. Vector map data is utilized to provide contextual information. The trajectory dataset is collected in CARLA simulator with synthesized data errors introduced. Numerical experiments demonstrate that in a mixed traffic flow scenario, the integration of data from different sources enhances our understanding of the environment. This notably improves trajectory prediction accuracy, particularly in situations with a high CV market penetration rate. The code is available at: https://github.com/xichennn/MSMA.</p></details> |  |
| **[Conformal Trajectory Prediction with Multi-View Data Integration in Cooperative Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00374v2)** | 2024-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current research on trajectory prediction primarily relies on data collected by onboard sensors of an ego vehicle. With the rapid advancement in connected technologies, such as vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication, valuable information from alternate views becomes accessible via wireless networks. The integration of information from alternative views has the potential to overcome the inherent limitations associated with a single viewpoint, such as occlusions and limited field of view. In this work, we introduce V2INet, a novel trajectory prediction framework designed to model multi-view data by extending existing single-view models. Unlike previous approaches where the multi-view data is manually fused or formulated as a separate training stage, our model supports end-to-end training, enhancing both flexibility and performance. Moreover, the predicted multimodal trajectories are calibrated by a post-hoc conformal prediction module to get valid and efficient confidence regions. We evaluated the entire framework using the real-world V2I dataset V2X-Seq. Our results demonstrate superior performance in terms of Final Displacement Error (FDE) and Miss Rate (MR) using a single GPU.

| **[Rule-Based Error Detection and Correction to Operationalize Movement Trajectory Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14250v3)** | 2024-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Classification of movement trajectories has many applications in transportation and is a key component for large-scale movement trajectory generation and anomaly detection which has key safety applications in the aftermath of a disaster or other external shock. However, the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) are based on supervised deep learning - which leads to challenges when the distribution of trajectories changes due to such a shock. We provide a neuro-symbolic rule-based framework to conduct error correction and detection of these models to integrate into our movement trajectory platform. We provide a suite of experiments on several recent SOTA models where we show highly accurate error detection, the ability to improve accuracy with a changing test distribution, and accuracy improvement for the base use case in addition to a suite of theoretical properties that informed algorithm development. Specifically, we show an F1 scores for predicting errors of up to 0.984, significant performance increase for out-of distribution accuracy (8.51% improvement over SOTA for zero-shot accuracy), and accuracy improvement over the SOTA model.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimizing Diffusion Models for Joint Trajectory Prediction and Controllable Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00766v1)** | 2024-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models are promising for joint trajectory prediction and controllable generation in autonomous driving, but they face challenges of inefficient inference steps and high computational demands. To tackle these challenges, we introduce Optimal Gaussian Diffusion (OGD) and Estimated Clean Manifold (ECM) Guidance. OGD optimizes the prior distribution for a small diffusion time $T$ and starts the reverse diffusion process from it. ECM directly injects guidance gradients to the estimated clean manifold, eliminating extensive gradient backpropagation throughout the network. Our methodology streamlines the generative process, enabling practical applications with reduced computational overhead. Experimental validation on the large-scale Argoverse 2 dataset demonstrates our approach's superior performance, offering a viable solution for computationally efficient, high-quality joint trajectory prediction and controllable generation for autonomous driving.

In this process, the complexity of algorithms used for vehicle control has grown significantly. Model Predictive Control (MPC) is a prominent example, which has gained enormous popularity and is now widely used for vehicle motion planning and control. However, safety concerns constrain its practical application, especially since traditional procedures of functional safety (FS), with its universal standard ISO26262, reach their limits. Concomitantly, the new aspect of safety-of-the-intended-function (SOTIF) has moved into the center of attention, whose standard, ISO21448, has only been released in 2022. Thus, experience with SOTIF is low and few case studies are available in industry and research. Hence this paper aims to make two main contributions: (1) an analysis of the SOTIF for a generic MPC-based trajectory planner and (2) an interpretation and concrete application of the generic procedures described in ISO21448 for determining functional insufficiencies (FIs) and triggering conditions (TCs). Particular novelties of the paper include an approach for the out-of-context development of SOTIF-related elements (SOTIF-EooC), a compilation of important FIs and TCs for a MPC-based trajectory planner, and an optimized safety concept based on the identified FIs and TCs for the MPC-based trajectory planner.</p></details> | Extended Version |

We propose an expression exploration framework based on deep symbolic regression (DSR) integrated with a variable intersection selection (VIS) method to find variable combinations that encourage interpretable and parsimonious mathematical expressions. In the exploration learning process, two penalty terms are added to improve the reward function: (i) a complexity penalty to regulate the complexity of the explored expressions to be parsimonious, and (ii) a variable interaction penalty to encourage the expression exploration to focus on variable combinations that can best describe the data. We show the performance of the proposed method to learn several car-following dynamics models and discuss its limitations and future research directions.</p></details> |  |

Nonetheless, the potential of transformer-based diffusion models for effectively generating videos with controllable motion remains an area of limited exploration. This paper introduces Tora, the first trajectory-oriented DiT framework that integrates textual, visual, and trajectory conditions concurrently for video generation. Specifically, Tora consists of a Trajectory Extractor~(TE), a Spatial-Temporal DiT, and a Motion-guidance Fuser~(MGF). The TE encodes arbitrary trajectories into hierarchical spacetime motion patches with a 3D video compression network. The MGF integrates the motion patches into the DiT blocks to generate consistent videos following trajectories. Our design aligns seamlessly with DiT's scalability, allowing precise control of video content's dynamics with diverse durations, aspect ratios, and resolutions. Extensive experiments demonstrate Tora's excellence in achieving high motion fidelity, while also meticulously simulating the movement of the physical world.

Learning-based approaches for multi-agent trajectory prediction, such as primarily relying on graph neural networks, graph transformers, and hypergraph neural networks, have demonstrated outstanding performance on real-world datasets in recent years. However, the hypergraph transformer-based method for trajectory prediction is yet to be explored. Therefore, we present a MultiscAle Relational Transformer (MART) network for multi-agent trajectory prediction. MART is a hypergraph transformer architecture to consider individual and group behaviors in transformer machinery. The core module of MART is the encoder, which comprises a Pair-wise Relational Transformer (PRT) and a Hyper Relational Transformer (HRT). The encoder extends the capabilities of a relational transformer by introducing HRT, which integrates hyperedge features into the transformer mechanism, promoting attention weights to focus on group-wise relations. In addition, we propose an Adaptive Group Estimator (AGE) designed to infer complex group relations in real-world environments. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets (NBA, SDD, and ETH-UCY) demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, enhancing ADE/FDE by 3.9%/11.8% on the NBA dataset.

Due to the intractable growth of non-convex constraints with the number of agents, exploring various homotopy classes that imply different convex domains, is crucial for finding a feasible solution. However, existing methods struggle to explore various homotopy classes efficiently due to combining it with time-consuming precise trajectory solution finding. CSDO, addresses this limitation by separating them into different levels and integrating an efficient Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) algorithm to search homotopy classes. It first searches for a coarse initial guess using a large search step, identifying a specific homotopy class. Subsequent decentralized Quadratic Programming (QP) refinement processes this guess, resolving minor collisions efficiently. Experimental results demonstrate that CSDO outperforms existing MVTP algorithms in large-scale, high-density scenarios, achieving up to 95% success rate in 50m $\times$ 50m random scenarios around one second.

We introduce the Enhanced Transformer for Health Outcome Simulation (ETHOS), a novel application of the transformer deep-learning architecture for analyzing high-dimensional, heterogeneous, and episodic health data. ETHOS is trained using Patient Health Timelines (PHTs)-detailed, tokenized records of health events-to predict future health trajectories, leveraging a zero-shot learning approach. ETHOS represents a significant advancement in foundation model development for healthcare analytics, eliminating the need for labeled data and model fine-tuning. Its ability to simulate various treatment pathways and consider patient-specific factors positions ETHOS as a tool for care optimization and addressing biases in healthcare delivery. Future developments will expand ETHOS' capabilities to incorporate a wider range of data types and data sources.

Forward application of the model yields so called imagined trajectories (sequences of action, predicted state-reward) used to optimize the set of candidate actions that maximize expected reward. The outcome, an ideal imagined trajectory or plan, is imperfect and typically MBRL relies on model predictive control (MPC) to overcome this by continuously re-planning from scratch, incurring thus major computational cost and increasing complexity in tasks with longer receding horizon. We propose uncertainty estimation methods for online evaluation of imagined trajectories to assess whether further planned actions can be trusted to deliver acceptable reward. These methods include comparing the error after performing the last action with the standard expected error and using model uncertainty to assess the deviation from expected outcomes. Additionally, we introduce methods that exploit the forward propagation of the dynamics model to evaluate if the remainder of the plan aligns with expected results and assess the remainder of the plan in terms of the expected reward. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed uncertainty estimation methods by applying them to avoid unnecessary trajectory replanning in a shooting MBRL setting. Results highlight significant reduction on computational costs without sacrificing performance.</p></details> |  |

Stochastic Model Predictive Control (SMPC)-based planners provide non-conservative planning, but do not rule out a (small) probability of collision. We propose a control scheme that yields an efficient trajectory based on SMPC when the traffic scenario allows, still avoiding that the vehicle causes collisions with traffic participants if the latter move according to the prediction assumptions. If some traffic participant does not behave as anticipated, no safety guarantee can be given. Then, our approach yields a trajectory which minimizes the probability of collision, using Constraint Violation Probability Minimization techniques. Our algorithm can also be adapted to minimize the anticipated harm caused by a collision. We provide a thorough discussion of the benefits of our novel control scheme and compare it to a previous approach through numerical simulations from the CommonRoad database.</p></details> |  |

However, efficiently capturing the true trajectory distribution with a compact set is challenging. In this work, we propose a novel approach for generating scene-specific trajectory sets that better represent the diversity and admissibility of future actor behavior. Our method constructs multiple trajectory sets tailored to different scene contexts, such as intersections and non-intersections, by leveraging map information and actor dynamics. We introduce a deterministic goal sampling algorithm that identifies relevant map regions and generates trajectories conditioned on the scene layout. Furthermore, we empirically investigate various sampling strategies and set sizes to optimize the trade-off between coverage and diversity. Experiments on the Argoverse 2 dataset demonstrate that our scene-specific sets achieve higher plausibility while maintaining diversity compared to traditional single-set approaches. The proposed Recursive In-Distribution Subsampling (RIDS) method effectively condenses the representation space and outperforms metric-driven sampling in terms of trajectory admissibility. Our work highlights the benefits of scene-aware trajectory set generation for capturing the complex and heterogeneous nature of actor behavior in real-world driving scenarios.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces Aircraft Trajectory Segmentation-based Contrastive Coding (ATSCC), a novel self-supervised time series representation learning framework designed to capture semantic information in air traffic trajectory data. The framework leverages the segmentable characteristic of trajectories and ensures consistency within the self-assigned segments. Intensive experiments were conducted on datasets from three different airports, totaling four datasets, comparing the learned representation's performance of downstream classification and clustering with other state-of-the-art representation learning techniques. The results show that ATSCC outperforms these methods by aligning with the labels defined by aeronautical procedures. ATSCC is adaptable to various airport configurations and scalable to incomplete trajectories. This research has expanded upon existing capabilities, achieving these improvements independently without predefined inputs such as airport configurations, maneuvering procedures, or labeled data.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 7 figures.

Typical stochastic mobility models, e.g., random waypoint model and Gauss Markov model, can hardly capture the distribution characteristics of users within real-world areas. State-of-the-art trace-based mobility models and existing learning-based trajectory generation methods, however, are frequently constrained by the inaccessibility of substantial real trajectories due to privacy concerns. In this paper, we harness the intrinsic correlation between street maps and trajectories and develop a novel zero-shot trajectory generation method, named Map2Traj, by exploiting the diffusion model. We incorporate street maps as a condition to consistently pilot the denoising process and train our model on diverse sets of real trajectories from various regions in Xi'an, China, and their corresponding street maps. With solely the street map of an unobserved area, Map2Traj generates synthetic trajectories that not only closely resemble the real-world mobility pattern but also offer comparable efficacy. Extensive experiments validate the efficacy of our proposed method on zero-shot trajectory generation tasks in terms of both trajectory and distribution similarities. In addition, a case study of employing Map2Traj in wireless network optimization is presented to validate its efficacy for downstream applications.</p></details> |  |

SAPI uses an abstract way to represent and encode surrounding environment by utilizing information from real-time map, right-of-way, and surrounding traffic. The proposed model consists of two convolutional network (CNN) and recurrent neural network (RNN)-based encoders and one decoder. A refiner is proposed to conduct a look-back operation inside the model, in order to make full use of raw history trajectory information. We evaluate SAPI on a proprietary dataset collected in real-world intersections through autonomous vehicles. It is demonstrated that SAPI shows promising performance when predicting vehicle trajectories at intersection, and outperforms benchmark methods. The average displacement error(ADE) and final displacement error(FDE) for 6-second prediction are 1.84m and 4.32m respectively. We also show that the proposed model can accurately predict vehicle trajectories in different scenarios.</p></details> |  |

Recent manifold learning-based methods have partially addressed the dimensionality and dataset size issues, but struggle with the complex text-conditional distribution. In this paper we propose a text-based trajectory generation model that attempts to address all three challenges while relying on only a handful of demonstration trajectory data. Our key idea is to leverage recent flow-based models capable of capturing complex conditional distributions, not directly in the high-dimensional trajectory space, but rather in the low-dimensional latent coordinate space of the motion manifold, with deliberately designed regularization terms to ensure smoothness of motions and robustness to text variations. We show that our {\it Motion Manifold Flow Primitive (MMFP)} framework can accurately generate qualitatively distinct motions for a wide range of text inputs, significantly outperforming existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 10 figures, under review</p></details> |
| **[Multi-Agent Trajectory Prediction with Difficulty-Guided Feature Enhancement Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18551v2)** | 2024-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction is crucial for autonomous driving as it aims to forecast the future movements of traffic participants. Traditional methods usually perform holistic inference on the trajectories of agents, neglecting the differences in prediction difficulty among agents. This paper proposes a novel Difficulty-Guided Feature Enhancement Network (DGFNet), which leverages the prediction difficulty differences among agents for multi-agent trajectory prediction. Firstly, we employ spatio-temporal feature encoding and interaction to capture rich spatio-temporal features. Secondly, a difficulty-guided decoder is used to control the flow of future trajectories into subsequent modules, obtaining reliable future trajectories. Then, feature interaction and fusion are performed through the future feature interaction module. Finally, the fused agent features are fed into the final predictor to generate the predicted trajectory distributions for multiple participants. Experimental results demonstrate that our DGFNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Argoverse 1\&2 motion forecasting benchmarks. Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of each module. Moreover, compared with SOTA methods, our method balances trajectory prediction accuracy and real-time inference speed.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reputation-Driven Asynchronous Federated Learning for Enhanced Trajectory Prediction with Blockchain](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19428v1)** | 2024-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated learning combined with blockchain empowers secure data sharing in autonomous driving applications. Nevertheless, with the increasing granularity and complexity of vehicle-generated data, the lack of data quality audits raises concerns about multi-party mistrust in trajectory prediction tasks. In response, this paper proposes an asynchronous federated learning data sharing method based on an interpretable reputation quantization mechanism utilizing graph neural network tools. Data providers share data structures under differential privacy constraints to ensure security while reducing redundant data. We implement deep reinforcement learning to categorize vehicles by reputation level, which optimizes the aggregation efficiency of federated learning. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed data sharing scheme not only reinforces the security of the trajectory prediction task but also enhances prediction accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evaluating Human Trajectory Prediction with Metamorphic Testing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18756v1)** | 2024-07-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The prediction of human trajectories is important for planning in autonomous systems that act in the real world, e.g. automated driving or mobile robots. Human trajectory prediction is a noisy process, and no prediction does precisely match any future trajectory. It is therefore approached as a stochastic problem, where the goal is to minimise the error between the true and the predicted trajectory. In this work, we explore the application of metamorphic testing for human trajectory prediction. Metamorphic testing is designed to handle unclear or missing test oracles. It is well-designed for human trajectory prediction, where there is no clear criterion of correct or incorrect human behaviour. Metamorphic relations rely on transformations over source test cases and exploit invariants. A setting well-designed for human trajectory prediction where there are many symmetries of expected human behaviour under variations of the input, e.g. mirroring and rescaling of the input data. We discuss how metamorphic testing can be applied to stochastic human trajectory prediction and introduce the Wasserstein Violation Criterion to statistically assess whether a follow-up test case violates a label-preserving metamorphic relation.</p></details> | <details><summary>MET'2...</summary><p>MET'24: 9th ACM International Workshop on Metamorphic Testing</p></details> |

By harnessing recent progress in tracking, specifically point trajectories and self-supervised representation learning, we build trajectory-aligned tokens (TATs) that capture motion and appearance information. This approach significantly reduces the data requirements while retaining essential information. To process these representations, we use a Masked Space-time Transformer that effectively learns to aggregate information to facilitate few-shot action recognition.

| **[Trajectory Planning Using Reinforcement Learning for Interactive Overtaking Maneuvers in Autonomous Racing Scenarios](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10658v2)** | 2024-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conventional trajectory planning approaches for autonomous racing are based on the sequential execution of prediction of the opposing vehicles and subsequent trajectory planning for the ego vehicle. If the opposing vehicles do not react to the ego vehicle, they can be predicted accurately. However, if there is interaction between the vehicles, the prediction loses its validity. For high interaction, instead of a planning approach that reacts exclusively to the fixed prediction, a trajectory planning approach is required that incorporates the interaction with the opposing vehicles. This paper demonstrates the limitations of a widely used conventional sampling-based approach within a highly interactive blocking scenario. We show that high success rates are achieved for less aggressive blocking behavior but that the collision rate increases with more significant interaction. We further propose a novel Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based trajectory planning approach for racing that explicitly exploits the interaction with the opposing vehicle without requiring a prediction. In contrast to the conventional approach, the RL-based approach achieves high success rates even for aggressive blocking behavior. Furthermore, we propose a novel safety layer (SL) that intervenes when the trajectory generated by the RL-based approach is infeasible. In that event, the SL generates a sub-optimal but feasible trajectory, avoiding termination of the scenario due to a not found valid solution.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, accepted to be published at the 27th IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems, September 24 - 27, 2024, Edmonton, Canada</p></details> |
| **[Sampling-Based Hierarchical Trajectory Planning for Formation Flight](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17392v1)** | 2024-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Formation flight of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) poses significant challenges in terms of safety and formation keeping, particularly in cluttered environments. However, existing methods often struggle to simultaneously satisfy these two critical requirements. To address this issue, this paper proposes a sampling-based trajectory planning method with a hierarchical structure for formation flight in dense obstacle environments. To ensure reliable local sensing information sharing among UAVs, each UAV generates a safe flight corridor (SFC), which is transmitted to the leader UAV. Subsequently, a sampling-based formation guidance path generation method is designed as the front-end strategy, steering the formation to fly in the desired shape safely with the formation connectivity provided by the SFCs. Furthermore, a model predictive path integral (MPPI) based distributed trajectory optimization method is developed as the back-end part, which ensures the smoothness, safety and dynamics feasibility of the executable trajectory. To validate the efficiency of the developed algorithm, comprehensive simulation comparisons are conducted.

However, measuring real-world detouring behavior is challenging due to the need to track the movement of individual vehicles. Recent developments in high-resolution vehicle trajectory data have enabled transportation professionals to observe real-world detouring behaviors without the need to install and maintain hardware such as license plate reading cameras. This paper investigates the feasibility of vehicle probe trajectory data to capture commercial motor vehicle (CMV) detouring behavior under three unique case studies. Before doing so, a validation analysis was conducted to investigate the ability of CMV probe trajectory data to represent overall CMV volumes at well-calibrated count stations near virtual weigh stations (VWS) in Maryland. The validation analysis showed strong positive correlations (above 0.75) at all VWS stations. Upon validating the data, a methodology was applied to assess CMV detour behaviors associated with CMV enforcement activities, congestion avoidance, and incident induced temporary road closures.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at Transportation Research Board Annual Meeting 2024.

| **[TLControl: Trajectory and Language Control for Human Motion Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17135v4)** | 2024-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Controllable human motion synthesis is essential for applications in AR/VR, gaming and embodied AI. Existing methods often focus solely on either language or full trajectory control, lacking precision in synthesizing motions aligned with user-specified trajectories, especially for multi-joint control. To address these issues, we present TLControl, a novel method for realistic human motion synthesis, incorporating both low-level Trajectory and high-level Language semantics controls, through the integration of neural-based and optimization-based techniques. Specifically, we begin with training a VQ-VAE for a compact and well-structured latent motion space organized by body parts. We then propose a Masked Trajectories Transformer (MTT) for predicting a motion distribution conditioned on language and trajectory. Once trained, we use MTT to sample initial motion predictions given user-specified partial trajectories and text descriptions as conditioning. Finally, we introduce a test-time optimization to refine these coarse predictions for precise trajectory control, which offers flexibility by allowing users to specify various optimization goals and ensures high runtime efficiency. Comprehensive experiments show that TLControl significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art in trajectory accuracy and time efficiency, making it practical for interactive and high-quality animation generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reacting on human stubbornness in human-machine trajectory planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17275v1)** | 2024-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, a method for a cooperative trajectory planning between a human and an automation is extended by a behavioral model of the human. This model can characterize the stubbornness of the human, which measures how strong the human adheres to his preferred trajectory. Accordingly, a static model is introduced indicating a link between the force in haptically coupled human-robot interactions and humans's stubbornness. The introduced stubbornness parameter enables an application-independent reaction of the automation for the cooperative trajectory planning. Simulation results in the context of human-machine cooperation in a care application show that the proposed behavioral model can quantitatively estimate the stubbornness of the interacting human, enabling a more targeted adaptation of the automation to the human behavior.</p></details> |  |
| **[Context-aware Multi-task Learning for Pedestrian Intent and Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17162v1)** | 2024-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The advancement of socially-aware autonomous vehicles hinges on precise modeling of human behavior. Within this broad paradigm, the specific challenge lies in accurately predicting pedestrian's trajectory and intention. Traditional methodologies have leaned heavily on historical trajectory data, frequently overlooking vital contextual cues such as pedestrian-specific traits and environmental factors. Furthermore, there's a notable knowledge gap as trajectory and intention prediction have largely been approached as separate problems, despite their mutual dependence. To bridge this gap, we introduce PTINet (Pedestrian Trajectory and Intention Prediction Network), which jointly learns the trajectory and intention prediction by combining past trajectory observations, local contextual features (individual pedestrian behaviors), and global features (signs, markings etc.). The efficacy of our approach is evaluated on widely used public datasets: JAAD and PIE, where it has demonstrated superior performance over existing state-of-the-art models in trajectory and intention prediction. The results from our experiments and ablation studies robustly validate PTINet's effectiveness in jointly exploring intention and trajectory prediction for pedestrian behaviour modelling. The experimental evaluation indicates the advantage of using global and local contextual features for pedestrian trajectory and intention prediction. The effectiveness of PTINet in predicting pedestrian behavior paves the way for the development of automated systems capable of seamlessly interacting with pedestrians in urban settings.</p></details> |  |

Results indicate the proposed filtering algorithm robustly extracts clean, long, and uninterrupted trajectories for further processing.

| **[Simultaneous Trajectory Optimization and Contact Selection for Contact-rich Manipulation with High-Fidelity Geometry](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16976v1)** | 2024-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contact-implicit trajectory optimization (CITO) is an effective method to plan complex trajectories for various contact-rich systems including manipulation and locomotion. CITO formulates a mathematical program with complementarity constraints (MPCC) that enforces that contact forces must be zero when points are not in contact. However, MPCC solve times increase steeply with the number of allowable points of contact, which limits CITO's applicability to problems in which only a few, simple geometries are allowed to make contact. This paper introduces simultaneous trajectory optimization and contact selection (STOCS), as an extension of CITO that overcomes this limitation. The innovation of STOCS is to identify salient contact points and times inside the iterative trajectory optimization process. This effectively reduces the number of variables and constraints in each MPCC invocation. The STOCS framework, instantiated with key contact identification subroutines, renders the optimization of manipulation trajectories computationally tractable even for high-fidelity geometries consisting of tens of thousands of vertices.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2306.06465</p></details> |
| **[Synthetic Trajectory Generation Through Convolutional Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16938v1)** | 2024-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Location trajectories provide valuable insights for applications from urban planning to pandemic control. However, mobility data can also reveal sensitive information about individuals, such as political opinions, religious beliefs, or sexual orientations. Existing privacy-preserving approaches for publishing this data face a significant utility-privacy trade-off. Releasing synthetic trajectory data generated through deep learning offers a promising solution. Due to the trajectories' sequential nature, most existing models are based on recurrent neural networks (RNNs). However, research in generative adversarial networks (GANs) largely employs convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image generation. This discrepancy raises the question of whether advances in computer vision can be applied to trajectory generation. In this work, we introduce a Reversible Trajectory-to-CNN Transformation (RTCT) that adapts trajectories into a format suitable for CNN-based models. We integrated this transformation with the well-known DCGAN in a proof-of-concept (PoC) and evaluated its performance against an RNN-based trajectory GAN using four metrics across two datasets. The PoC was superior in capturing spatial distributions compared to the RNN model but had difficulty replicating sequential and temporal properties. Although the PoC's utility is not sufficient for practical applications, the results demonstrate the transformation's potential to facilitate the use of CNNs for trajectory generation, opening up avenues for future research.

| **[Guaranteed Trajectory Tracking under Learned Dynamics with Contraction Metrics and Disturbance Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.08222v5)** | 2024-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents an approach to trajectory-centric learning control based on contraction metrics and disturbance estimation for nonlinear systems subject to matched uncertainties. The approach uses deep neural networks to learn uncertain dynamics while still providing guarantees of transient tracking performance throughout the learning phase. Within the proposed approach, a disturbance estimation law is adopted to estimate the pointwise value of the uncertainty, with pre-computable estimation error bounds (EEBs). The learned dynamics, the estimated disturbances, and the EEBs are then incorporated in a robust Riemann energy condition to compute the control law that guarantees exponential convergence of actual trajectories to desired ones throughout the learning phase, even when the learned model is poor. On the other hand, with improved accuracy, the learned model can help improve the robustness of the tracking controller, e.g., against input delays, and can be incorporated to plan better trajectories with improved performance, e.g., lower energy consumption and shorter travel time.The proposed framework is validated on a planar quadrotor example.</p></details> | 18 pages, 8 figures |

This method integrates HD map data to improve the robustness and reliability of trajectory predictions for autonomous vehicles.</p></details> |  |
| **[PateGail: A Privacy-Preserving Mobility Trajectory Generator with Imitation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16729v1)** | 2024-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating human mobility trajectories is of great importance to solve the lack of large-scale trajectory data in numerous applications, which is caused by privacy concerns. However, existing mobility trajectory generation methods still require real-world human trajectories centrally collected as the training data, where there exists an inescapable risk of privacy leakage. To overcome this limitation, in this paper, we propose PateGail, a privacy-preserving imitation learning model to generate mobility trajectories, which utilizes the powerful generative adversary imitation learning model to simulate the decision-making process of humans. Further, in order to protect user privacy, we train this model collectively based on decentralized mobility data stored in user devices, where personal discriminators are trained locally to distinguish and reward the real and generated human trajectories. In the training process, only the generated trajectories and their rewards obtained based on personal discriminators are shared between the server and devices, whose privacy is further preserved by our proposed perturbation mechanisms with theoretical proof to satisfy differential privacy. Further, to better model the human decision-making process, we propose a novel aggregation mechanism of the rewards obtained from personal discriminators. We theoretically prove that under the reward obtained based on the aggregation mechanism, our proposed model maximizes the lower bound of the discounted total rewards of users. Extensive experiments show that the trajectories generated by our model are able to resemble real-world trajectories in terms of five key statistical metrics, outperforming state-of-the-art algorithms by over 48.03%. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the synthetic trajectories are able to efficiently support practical applications, including mobility prediction and location recommendation.</p></details> |  |

We frame constrained trajectory optimization as a novel form of constrained functional minimization over trajectory distributions, which avoids treating the constraints as a penalty in the objective and allows us to generate diverse sets of constraint-satisfying trajectories. Our method uses Stein Variational Gradient Descent (SVGD) to find a set of particles that approximates a distribution over low-cost trajectories while obeying constraints. CSVTO is applicable to problems with differentiable equality and inequality constraints and includes a novel particle re-sampling step to escape local minima. By explicitly generating diverse sets of trajectories, CSVTO is better able to avoid poor local minima and is more robust to initialization. We demonstrate that CSVTO outperforms baselines in challenging highly-constrained tasks, such as a 7DoF wrench manipulation task, where CSVTO outperforms all baselines both in success and constraint satisfaction.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 10 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

Biological knowledge suggests that it may be best to describe complex diseases at the level of underlying pathways, which may interact with one another. We propose a Bayesian approach that allows for characterising such correlation among different pathways through Dependent Gaussian Processes (DGP) and mapping the observed high-dimensional gene expression trajectories into unobserved low-dimensional pathway expression trajectories via Bayesian Sparse Factor Analysis. Our proposal is the first attempt to relax the classical assumption of independent factors for longitudinal data and has demonstrated a superior performance in recovering the shape of pathway expression trajectories, revealing the relationships between genes and pathways, and predicting gene expressions (closer point estimates and narrower predictive intervals), as demonstrated through simulations and real data analysis. To fit the model, we propose a Monte Carlo Expectation Maximization (MCEM) scheme that can be implemented conveniently by combining a standard Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampler and an R package GPFDA (Konzen and others, 2021), which returns the maximum likelihood estimates of DGP hyperparameters. The modular structure of MCEM makes it generalizable to other complex models involving the DGP model component. Our R package DGP4LCF that implements the proposed approach is available on CRAN.</p></details> |  |

However, configuring the skills' parameters for a specific task remains a manual and time-consuming endeavor. Existing approaches for learning or optimizing these parameters often require numerous real-world executions or do not work in dynamic environments. To address these challenges, we propose MuTT, a novel encoder-decoder transformer architecture designed to predict environment-aware executions of robot skills by integrating vision, trajectory, and robot skill parameters. Notably, we pioneer the fusion of vision and trajectory, introducing a novel trajectory projection. Furthermore, we illustrate MuTT's efficacy as a predictor when combined with a model-based robot skill optimizer. This approach facilitates the optimization of robot skill parameters for the current environment, without the need for real-world executions during optimization. Designed for compatibility with any representation of robot skills, MuTT demonstrates its versatility across three comprehensive experiments, showcasing superior performance across two different skill representations.</p></details> |  |

The extracted prognostic pathways of these subgroups provide valuable insights into the dynamic trajectories of sepsis severity over time. Visualizing these pathways sheds light on the likelihood and direction of disease progression across various contexts and reveals patterns and pivotal factors or biomarkers influencing the transition between sepsis stages, whether toward deterioration or improvement.

Some leading methods in this domain prioritize long-range matching, involving the unrolling of training trajectories with a fixed number of steps (NS) on the synthetic dataset to align with various expert training trajectories. However, traditional long-range matching methods possess an overfitting-like problem, the fixed step size NS forces synthetic dataset to distortedly conform seen expert training trajectories, resulting in a loss of generality-especially to those from unencountered architecture. We refer to this as the Accumulated Mismatching Problem (AMP), and propose a new approach, Automatic Training Trajectories (ATT), which dynamically and adaptively adjusts trajectory length NS to address the AMP. Our method outperforms existing methods particularly in tests involving cross-architectures.

The survey progresses to detail the leading algorithms for measuring vessel trajectory similarity and the main clustering techniques used in the field today. Furthermore, the various applications of trajectory clustering within the maritime context are explored. Finally, the paper evaluates the effectiveness of different algorithm combinations and pre-processing methods through experimental analysis, focusing on their impact on the performance of distance-based trajectory clustering algorithms.

| **[Risk-Aware Vehicle Trajectory Prediction Under Safety-Critical Scenarios](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13480v1)** | 2024-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction is significant for intelligent vehicles to achieve high-level autonomous driving, and a lot of relevant research achievements have been made recently. Despite the rapid development, most existing studies solely focused on normal safe scenarios while largely neglecting safety-critical scenarios, particularly those involving imminent collisions. This oversight may result in autonomous vehicles lacking the essential predictive ability in such situations, posing a significant threat to safety. To tackle these, this paper proposes a risk-aware trajectory prediction framework tailored to safety-critical scenarios. Leveraging distinctive hazardous features, we develop three core risk-aware components. First, we introduce a risk-incorporated scene encoder, which augments conventional encoders with quantitative risk information to achieve risk-aware encoding of hazardous scene contexts. Next, we incorporate endpoint-risk-combined intention queries as prediction priors in the decoder to ensure that the predicted multimodal trajectories cover both various spatial intentions and risk levels. Lastly, an auxiliary risk prediction task is implemented for the ultimate risk-aware prediction. Furthermore, to support model training and performance evaluation, we introduce a safety-critical trajectory prediction dataset and tailored evaluation metrics. We conduct comprehensive evaluations and compare our model with several SOTA models. Results demonstrate the superior performance of our model, with a significant improvement in most metrics. This prediction advancement enables autonomous vehicles to execute correct collision avoidance maneuvers under safety-critical scenarios, eventually enhancing road traffic safety.</p></details> |  |

However, the development and ranking of state-of-the-art (SotA) models are driven by their In-Distribution (ID) performance on individual competition datasets. We present an OoD testing protocol that homogenizes datasets and prediction tasks across two large-scale motion datasets. We introduce a novel prediction algorithm based on polynomial representations for agent trajectory and road geometry on both the input and output sides of the model. With a much smaller model size, training effort, and inference time, we reach near SotA performance for ID testing and significantly improve robustness in OoD testing. Within our OoD testing protocol, we further study two augmentation strategies of SotA models and their effects on model generalization. Highlighting the contrast between ID and OoD performance, we suggest adding OoD testing to the evaluation criteria of trajectory prediction models.</p></details> |  |

It's a way of generating a smooth and feasible path for the robot to follow over time. The process primarily takes several factors to generate the path, such as velocity, acceleration and jerk.

| **[Deterministic Trajectory Optimization through Probabilistic Optimal Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13316v1)** | 2024-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This article proposes two new algorithms tailored to discrete-time deterministic finite-horizon nonlinear optimal control problems or so-called trajectory optimization problems. Both algorithms are inspired by a novel theoretical paradigm known as probabilistic optimal control, that reformulates optimal control as an equivalent probabilistic inference problem. This perspective allows to address the problem using the Expectation-Maximization algorithm. We show that the application of this algorithm results in a fixed point iteration of probabilistic policies that converge to the deterministic optimal policy. Two strategies for policy evaluation are discussed, using state-of-the-art uncertainty quantification methods resulting into two distinct algorithms. The algorithms are structurally closest related to the differential dynamic programming algorithm and related methods that use sigma-point methods to avoid direct gradient evaluations. The main advantage of our work is an improved balance between exploration and exploitation over the iterations, leading to improved numerical stability and accelerated convergence. These properties are demonstrated on different nonlinear systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory Planning Using Tire Thermodynamics for Automated Drifting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12989v1)** | 2024-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated vehicles need to estimate tire-road friction information, as it plays a key role in safe trajectory planning and vehicle dynamics control. Notably, friction is not solely dependent on road surface conditions, but also varies significantly depending on the tire temperature. However, tire parameters such as the friction coefficient have been conventionally treated as constant values in automated vehicle motion planning. This paper develops a simple thermodynamic model that captures tire friction temperature variation. To verify the model, it is implemented into trajectory planning for automated drifting - a challenging application that requires leveraging an unstable, drifting equilibrium at the friction limits. The proposed method which captures the hidden tire dynamics provides a dynamically feasible trajectory, leading to more precise tracking during experiments with an LQR (Linear Quadratic Regulator) controller.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This manuscript was accepted from IEEE Intelligent Vehicle Symposium (IV 2024) and will be published late August</p></details> |
| **[Forward Invariance in Trajectory Spaces for Safety-critical Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12624v1)** | 2024-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Useful robot control algorithms should not only achieve performance objectives but also adhere to hard safety constraints. Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) have been developed to provably ensure system safety through forward invariance. However, they often unnecessarily sacrifice performance for safety since they are purely reactive. Receding horizon control (RHC), on the other hand, consider planned trajectories to account for the future evolution of a system. This work provides a new perspective on safety-critical control by introducing Forward Invariance in Trajectory Spaces (FITS). We lift the problem of safe RHC into the trajectory space and describe the evolution of planned trajectories as a controlled dynamical system. Safety constraints defined over states can be converted into sets in the trajectory space which we render forward invariant via a CBF framework. We derive an efficient quadratic program (QP) to synthesize trajectories that provably satisfy safety constraints. Our experiments support that FITS improves the adherence to safety specifications without sacrificing performance over alternative CBF and NMPC methods.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 figures |
| **[UniTE: A Survey and Unified Pipeline for Pre-training ST Trajectory Embeddings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12550v1)** | 2024-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal (ST) trajectories are sequences of timestamped locations, which enable a variety of analyses that in turn enable important real-world applications. It is common to map trajectories to vectors, called embeddings, before subsequent analyses. Thus, the qualities of embeddings are very important. Methods for pre-training embeddings, which leverage unlabeled trajectories for training universal embeddings, have shown promising applicability across different tasks, thus attracting considerable interest. However, research progress on this topic faces two key challenges: a lack of a comprehensive overview of existing methods, resulting in several related methods not being well-recognized, and the absence of a unified pipeline, complicating the development new methods and the analysis of methods. To overcome these obstacles and advance the field of pre-training of trajectory embeddings, we present UniTE, a survey and a unified pipeline for this domain. In doing so, we present a comprehensive list of existing methods for pre-training trajectory embeddings, which includes methods that either explicitly or implicitly employ pre-training techniques. Further, we present a unified and modular pipeline with publicly available underlying code, simplifying the process of constructing and evaluating methods for pre-training trajectory embeddings. Additionally, we contribute a selection of experimental results using the proposed pipeline on real-world datasets.</p></details> |  |

Established trajectory prediction methods primarily use agent tracks generated by a detection and tracking system and HD map as inputs. In this work, we propose a novel method that also incorporates visual input from surround-view cameras, allowing the model to utilize visual cues such as human gazes and gestures, road conditions, vehicle turn signals, etc, which are typically hidden from the model in prior methods. Furthermore, we use textual descriptions generated by a Vision-Language Model (VLM) and refined by a Large Language Model (LLM) as supervision during training to guide the model on what to learn from the input data. Despite using these extra inputs, our method achieves a latency of 53 ms, making it feasible for real-time processing, which is significantly faster than that of previous single-agent prediction methods with similar performance. Our experiments show that both the visual inputs and the textual descriptions contribute to improvements in trajectory prediction performance, and our qualitative analysis highlights how the model is able to exploit these additional inputs. Lastly, in this work we create and release the nuScenes-Text dataset, which augments the established nuScenes dataset with rich textual annotations for every scene, demonstrating the positive impact of utilizing VLM on trajectory prediction.

| **[Multi-Agent Probabilistic Ensembles with Trajectory Sampling for Connected Autonomous Vehicles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13910v3)** | 2024-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) have attracted significant attention in recent years and Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown remarkable performance in improving the autonomy of vehicles. In that regard, the widely adopted Model-Free RL (MFRL) promises to solve decision-making tasks in connected AVs (CAVs), contingent on the readiness of a significant amount of data samples for training. Nevertheless, it might be infeasible in practice and possibly lead to learning instability. In contrast, Model-Based RL (MBRL) manifests itself in sample-efficient learning, but the asymptotic performance of MBRL might lag behind the state-of-the-art MFRL algorithms. Furthermore, most studies for CAVs are limited to the decision-making of a single AV only, thus underscoring the performance due to the absence of communications. In this study, we try to address the decision-making problem of multiple CAVs with limited communications and propose a decentralized Multi-Agent Probabilistic Ensembles with Trajectory Sampling algorithm MA-PETS. In particular, in order to better capture the uncertainty of the unknown environment, MA-PETS leverages Probabilistic Ensemble (PE) neural networks to learn from communicated samples among neighboring CAVs. Afterwards, MA-PETS capably develops Trajectory Sampling (TS)-based model-predictive control for decision-making. On this basis, we derive the multi-agent group regret bound affected by the number of agents within the communication range and mathematically validate that incorporating effective information exchange among agents into the multi-agent learning scheme contributes to reducing the group regret bound in the worst case. Finally, we empirically demonstrate the superiority of MA-PETS in terms of the sample efficiency comparable to MFBL.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory and Power Optimization for Multi-UAV Enabled Emergency Wireless Communications Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11896v1)** | 2024-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) has attracted much attention due to its flexible deployment and controllable mobility. As the general communication network cannot meet the emergency requirements, in this paper we study the multi-UAV enabled wireless emergency communication system. Our goal is to maximize the capacity with jointly optimizing trajectory and allocating power. To tackle this non-convex optimization problem, we first decompose it into two sub-problems to optimize the trajectory and power allocation, respectively. Then, we propose the successive convex approximation technique and the block coordinate update algorithm to solve the two subproblems. The approximate optimal solution can be obtained after continuous iterations. Simulation results show that the capacity can be greatly increased using our proposed joint trajectory optimization and power allocation.</p></details> | 6 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Progressive Pretext Task Learning for Human Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11588v1)** | 2024-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human trajectory prediction is a practical task of predicting the future positions of pedestrians on the road, which typically covers all temporal ranges from short-term to long-term within a trajectory. However, existing works attempt to address the entire trajectory prediction with a singular, uniform training paradigm, neglecting the distinction between short-term and long-term dynamics in human trajectories. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a novel Progressive Pretext Task learning (PPT) framework, which progressively enhances the model's capacity of capturing short-term dynamics and long-term dependencies for the final entire trajectory prediction. Specifically, we elaborately design three stages of training tasks in the PPT framework. In the first stage, the model learns to comprehend the short-term dynamics through a stepwise next-position prediction task. In the second stage, the model is further enhanced to understand long-term dependencies through a destination prediction task. In the final stage, the model aims to address the entire future trajectory task by taking full advantage of the knowledge from previous stages. To alleviate the knowledge forgetting, we further apply a cross-task knowledge distillation. Additionally, we design a Transformer-based trajectory predictor, which is able to achieve highly efficient two-step reasoning by integrating a destination-driven prediction strategy and a group of learnable prompt embeddings. Extensive experiments on popular benchmarks have demonstrated that our proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance with high efficiency.

By leveraging natural language processing techniques, this study introduces the Scientific Concept Navigator (SciConNav), an embedding-based navigation model to infer the "knowledge pathway" from the research trajectories of millions of scholars. We validate that the learned representations effectively delineate disciplinary boundaries and capture the intricate relationships between diverse concepts. The utility of the inferred navigation space is showcased through multiple applications. Firstly, we demonstrated the multi-step analogy inferences within the knowledge space and the interconnectivity between concepts in different disciplines. Secondly, we formulated the attribute dimensions of knowledge across domains, observing the distributional shifts in the arrangement of 19 disciplines along these conceptual dimensions, including "Theoretical" to "Applied", and "Chemical" to "Biomedical', highlighting the evolution of functional attributes within knowledge domains. Lastly, by analyzing the high-dimensional knowledge network structure, we found that knowledge connects with shorter global pathways, and interdisciplinary knowledge plays a critical role in the accessibility of the global knowledge network. Our framework offers a novel approach to mining knowledge inheritance pathways in extensive scientific literature, which is of great significance for understanding scientific progression patterns, tailoring scientific learning trajectories, and accelerating scientific progress.</p></details> | <details><summary>21pag...</summary><p>21pages, 13 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |
| **[PRET: Planning with Directed Fidelity Trajectory for Vision and Language Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11487v1)** | 2024-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision and language navigation is a task that requires an agent to navigate according to a natural language instruction. Recent methods predict sub-goals on constructed topology map at each step to enable long-term action planning. However, they suffer from high computational cost when attempting to support such high-level predictions with GCN-like models. In this work, we propose an alternative method that facilitates navigation planning by considering the alignment between instructions and directed fidelity trajectories, which refers to a path from the initial node to the candidate locations on a directed graph without detours. This planning strategy leads to an efficient model while achieving strong performance. Specifically, we introduce a directed graph to illustrate the explored area of the environment, emphasizing directionality. Then, we firstly define the trajectory representation as a sequence of directed edge features, which are extracted from the panorama based on the corresponding orientation. Ultimately, we assess and compare the alignment between instruction and different trajectories during navigation to determine the next navigation target. Our method outperforms previous SOTA method BEVBert on RxR dataset and is comparable on R2R dataset while largely reducing the computational cost.

The system uses readily accessible information from customer smartphones and retail apps, including motion data, store maps, and purchase records. This eliminates the need for additional hardware installations/maintenance and ensures customers full data control. Specifically, RetailOpt first uses inertial navigation to recover relative trajectories from smartphone motion data. The store map and purchase records are cross-referenced to identify a list of visited shelves, providing anchors to localize the relative trajectories in a store through continuous and discrete optimization. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our system in five diverse environments. The system, if successful, would produce accurate customer movement data, essential for a broad range of retail applications including customer behavior analysis and in-store navigation.</p></details> |  |

As opposed to many existing control strategies, which do not consider spatial constraints, the proposed strategy considers spatial constraints on each degree of freedom movement of the UAV. Such consideration makes the design appealing for many practical applications, such as pipeline inspection, boundary tracking, etc. The proposed design accounts for the limited information about the inertia matrix, thereby affirming its inherent robustness against unmodeled dynamics and other imperfections. We rigorously show that the UAV will converge to its desired path by maintaining bounded position, orientation, and linear and angular speeds. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy through various numerical simulations.</p></details> |  |

Motivated by the pivotal role trajectory length plays in the training process, we introduce Ada-NAV, a novel adaptive trajectory length scheme designed to enhance the training sample efficiency of RL algorithms in robotic navigation tasks. Unlike traditional approaches that treat trajectory length as a fixed hyperparameter, we propose to dynamically adjust it based on the entropy of the underlying navigation policy. Interestingly, Ada-NAV can be applied to both existing on-policy and off-policy RL methods, which we demonstrate by empirically validating its efficacy on three popular RL methods: REINFORCE, Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), and Soft Actor-Critic (SAC). We demonstrate through simulated and real-world robotic experiments that Ada-NAV outperforms conventional methods that employ constant or randomly sampled trajectory lengths. Specifically, for a fixed sample budget, Ada-NAV achieves an 18\% increase in navigation success rate, a 20-38\% reduction in navigation path length, and a 9.32\% decrease in elevation costs. Furthermore, we showcase the versatility of Ada-NAV by integrating it with the Clearpath Husky robot, illustrating its applicability in complex outdoor environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 9 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

Strengthening attacks and uncovering vulnerabilities, especially common issues in VLP models (e.g., high transferable AEs), can advance reliable and practical VLP models. A recent work (i.e., Set-level guidance attack) indicates that augmenting image-text pairs to increase AE diversity along the optimization path enhances the transferability of adversarial examples significantly. However, this approach predominantly emphasizes diversity around the online adversarial examples (i.e., AEs in the optimization period), leading to the risk of overfitting the victim model and affecting the transferability. In this study, we posit that the diversity of adversarial examples towards the clean input and online AEs are both pivotal for enhancing transferability across VLP models. Consequently, we propose using diversification along the intersection region of adversarial trajectory to expand the diversity of AEs. To fully leverage the interaction between modalities, we introduce text-guided adversarial example selection during optimization. Furthermore, to further mitigate the potential overfitting, we direct the adversarial text deviating from the last intersection region along the optimization path, rather than adversarial images as in existing methods. Extensive experiments affirm the effectiveness of our method in improving transferability across various VLP models and downstream vision-and-language tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>ECCV2...</summary><p>ECCV2024.

This work introduces a novel approach that combines RL with trajectory optimization to manage this trade-off effectively. Our approach embeds safety constraints within the action space of a modified Markov Decision Process (MDP). The RL agent produces a sequence of actions that are transformed into safe trajectories by a trajectory optimizer, thereby effectively ensuring safety and increasing training stability. This novel approach excels in its performance on challenging Safety Gym tasks, achieving significantly higher rewards and near-zero safety violations during inference. The method's real-world applicability is demonstrated through a safe and effective deployment in a real robot task of box-pushing around obstacles.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces SMART, a novel multi-agent framework that leverages external knowledge to enhance the interpretability and factual consistency of LLM-generated responses. SMART comprises four specialized agents, each performing a specific sub-trajectory action to navigate complex knowledge-intensive tasks. We propose a multi-agent co-training paradigm, Long- and Short-Trajectory Learning, which ensures synergistic collaboration among agents while maintaining fine-grained execution by each agent. Extensive experiments on 5 tasks demonstrate SMART's superior performance compared to previous widely adopted methods.</p></details> |  |

The proposed method integrates risk awareness and trajectory planning by leveraging probabilistic models to evaluate the likelihood of collisions with dynamic and static obstacles. The RALTPER focuses on collision avoidance constraints for both the ego vehicle region and the Gaussian-obstacle risk region. Additionally, this work enhances the generalization of both vehicle and obstacle models, making the planner adaptable to a wider range of scenarios. Our approach formulates the planning problem as a nonlinear optimization, solved using the IPOPT solver within the CasADi environment. The planner is evaluated through simulations of various challenging scenarios, including complex, static, mixed environment and narrow single-lane avoidance of pedestrians. Results demonstrate that RALTPER achieves safer and more efficient trajectory planning particularly in navigating narrow areas where a more accurate vehicle profile representation is critical for avoiding collisions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory Planning for Teleoperated Space Manipulators Using Deep Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05460v1)** | 2024-08-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory planning for teleoperated space manipulators involves challenges such as accurately modeling system dynamics, particularly in free-floating modes with non-holonomic constraints, and managing time delays that increase model uncertainty and affect control precision. Traditional teleoperation methods rely on precise dynamic models requiring complex parameter identification and calibration, while data-driven methods do not require prior knowledge but struggle with time delays. A novel framework utilizing deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is introduced to address these challenges. The framework incorporates three methods: Mapping, Prediction, and State Augmentation, to handle delays when delayed state information is received at the master end. The Soft Actor Critic (SAC) algorithm processes the state information to compute the next action, which is then sent to the remote manipulator for environmental interaction. Four environments are constructed using the MuJoCo simulation platform to account for variations in base and target fixation: fixed base and target, fixed base with rotated target, free-floating base with fixed target, and free-floating base with rotated target. Extensive experiments with both constant and random delays are conducted to evaluate the proposed methods. Results demonstrate that all three methods effectively address trajectory planning challenges, with State Augmentation showing superior efficiency and robustness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Nonlinear Propagation of Non-Gaussian Uncertainties: Theory and Applications to Spacecraft Trajectory Design](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05384v1)** | 2024-08-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a novel approach for propagating uncertainties in dynamical systems building on high-order Taylor expansions of the flow and moment-generating functions (MGFs). Unlike prior methods that focus on Gaussian distributions, our approach leverages the relationship between MGFs and distribution moments to extend high-order uncertainty propagation techniques to non-Gaussian scenarios. This significantly broadens the applicability of these methods to a wider range of problems and uncertainty types. High-order moment computations are performed one-off and symbolically, reducing the computational burden of the technique to the calculation of Taylor series coefficients around a nominal trajectory, achieved by efficiently integrating the system's variational equations. Furthermore, the use of the proposed approach in combination with event transition tensors, allows for accurate propagation of uncertainties at specific events, such as the landing surface of a celestial body, the crossing of a predefined Poincar\'e section, or the trigger of an arbitrary event during the propagation. Via numerical simulations we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in various astrodynamics applications, including the unperturbed and perturbed two-body problem, and the circular restricted three-body problem, showing that it accurately propagates non-Gaussian uncertainties both at future times and at event manifolds.</p></details> |  |

Building on prior work, it addresses the multi-robot communication-aware trajectory planning problem using a general optimisation framework that imposes linear constraints on changes in robot positions to ensure communication performance and collision avoidance. In this paper, the optimisation problem is solved distributively by separating the communication performance constraint through an economic approach. Here, the current communication budget is distributed equally among the robots, and the robots are allowed to trade parts of their budgets with each other. The separated optimisation problem is then solved using the consensus alternating direction method of multipliers. The method was verified through simulation in an inspection task problem.</p></details> |  |

It is important to develop a versatile trajectory learning method that performs different tasks with high accuracy. This involves effectively extracting two core aspects of information--movement patterns and travel purposes--from trajectories. However, this is challenging due to limitations in model capacity and the quality and scale of trajectory datasets. Meanwhile, large language models (LLMs) have shown great success in versatility by training on large-scale, high-quality datasets. Given the similarities between trajectories and sentences, there's potential to leverage LLMs to develop an effective trajectory learning method. However, standard LLMs are not designed to handle the unique spatio-temporal features of trajectories and cannot extract movement patterns and travel purposes. To address these challenges, we propose a model called TrajCogn that effectively utilizes LLMs to model trajectories. TrajCogn leverages the strengths of LLMs to create a versatile trajectory learning approach while addressing the limitations of standard LLMs. First, TrajCogn incorporates a novel trajectory semantic embedder that enables LLMs to process spatio-temporal features and extract movement patterns and travel purposes. Second, TrajCogn introduces a new trajectory prompt that integrates these patterns and purposes into LLMs, allowing the model to adapt to various tasks. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets and two representative tasks demonstrate that TrajCogn successfully achieves its design goals.

To better utilize vehicle trajectories, it is essential to develop a trajectory learning approach that can effectively and efficiently extract rich semantic information, including movement behavior and travel purposes, to support accurate downstream applications. However, creating such an approach presents two significant challenges. First, movement behavior are inherently spatio-temporally continuous, making them difficult to extract efficiently from irregular and discrete trajectory points. Second, travel purposes are related to the functionalities of areas and road segments traversed by vehicles. These functionalities are not available from the raw spatio-temporal trajectory features and are hard to extract directly from complex textual features associated with these areas and road segments. To address these challenges, we propose PTrajM, a novel method capable of efficient and semantic-rich vehicle trajectory learning. To support efficient modeling of movement behavior, we introduce Trajectory-Mamba as the learnable model of PTrajM, which effectively extracts continuous movement behavior while being more computationally efficient than existing structures. To facilitate efficient extraction of travel purposes, we propose a travel purpose-aware pre-training procedure, which enables PTrajM to discern the travel purposes of trajectories without additional computational resources during its embedding process. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets and comparisons with several state-of-the-art trajectory learning methods demonstrate the effectiveness of PTrajM.

By combining the generative approach with medical definitions of different characteristics of SSc, we facilitate the discovery of new aspects of the disease. We show that the learned temporal latent processes can be utilized for further data analysis and clinical hypothesis testing, including finding similar patients and clustering SSc patient trajectories into novel sub-types.

In our method, robots are represented by 3D points on their link surfaces. The task space of a robot is represented by a point cloud that can be obtained from depth sensors. Using the point-cloud representation, goal reaching in grasping can be formulated as point matching, while collision avoidance can be efficiently achieved by querying the signed distance values of the robot points in the signed distance field of the scene points. Consequently, a constrained nonlinear optimization problem is formulated to solve the joint motion and grasp planning problem. The advantage of our method is that the point-cloud representation is general to be used with any robot in any environment. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by performing experiments on a tabletop scene and a shelf scene for grasping with a Fetch mobile manipulator and a Franka Panda arm.

While these questions can be studied by employing multiple datasets, it is challenging due to several discrepancies, e.g., in data formats, map resolution, and semantic annotation types. To address these challenges, we introduce UniTraj, a comprehensive framework that unifies various datasets, models, and evaluation criteria, presenting new opportunities for the vehicle trajectory prediction field. In particular, using UniTraj, we conduct extensive experiments and find that model performance significantly drops when transferred to other datasets. However, enlarging data size and diversity can substantially improve performance, leading to a new state-of-the-art result for the nuScenes dataset. We provide insights into dataset characteristics to explain these findings.

Model predictive path integral control is a framework that builds upon optimization principles while incorporating stochastic sampling of input trajectories. This paper investigates several sampling approaches for trajectory generation. In this context, normalizing flows originating from the field of variational inference are considered for the generation of sampling distributions, as they model transformations of simple to more complex distributions. Accordingly, learning-based normalizing flow models are trained for a more efficient exploration of the input domain for the task at hand. The developed algorithm and the proposed sampling distributions are evaluated in two simulation scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to be published as part of the 2024 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV), Jeju Shinhwa World, Jeju Island, Korea, June 2-5, 2024</p></details> |

Our goal is to compute suitable trajectories that (1) satisfy the environment-specific traversability constraints and (2) generate human-like paths while navigating in crosswalks, sidewalks, etc. Our formulation uses a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) generative model enhanced with traversability constraints to generate multiple candidate trajectories for global navigation. We use VLMs and a visual prompting approach with their zero-shot ability of semantic understanding and logical reasoning to choose the best trajectory given the contextual information about the task. We evaluate our methods in various outdoor scenes with wheeled robots and compare the performance with other global navigation algorithms. In practice, we observe at least 3.35% improvement in traversability and 20.61% improvement in terms of human-like navigation in generated trajectories in challenging outdoor navigation scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Pose-Aware Self-Supervised Learning with Viewpoint Trajectory Regularization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14973v2)** | 2024-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning visual features from unlabeled images has proven successful for semantic categorization, often by mapping different $views$ of the same object to the same feature to achieve recognition invariance. However, visual recognition involves not only identifying $what$ an object is but also understanding $how$ it is presented. For example, seeing a car from the side versus head-on is crucial for deciding whether to stay put or jump out of the way. While unsupervised feature learning for downstream viewpoint reasoning is important, it remains under-explored, partly due to the lack of a standardized evaluation method and benchmarks. We introduce a new dataset of adjacent image triplets obtained from a viewpoint trajectory, without any semantic or pose labels. We benchmark both semantic classification and pose estimation accuracies on the same visual feature. Additionally, we propose a viewpoint trajectory regularization loss for learning features from unlabeled image triplets. Our experiments demonstrate that this approach helps develop a visual representation that encodes object identity and organizes objects by their poses, retaining semantic classification accuracy while achieving emergent global pose awareness and better generalization to novel objects. Our dataset and code are available at http://pwang.pw/trajSSL/.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ECCV 2024</p></details> |

Learning-based methods are currently showing impressive results in simulation-based challenges, with transformer-based architectures technologically leading the way. Ultimately, however, predictions are needed in the real world. In addition to the shifts from simulation to the real world, many vehicle- and country-specific shifts, i.e. differences in sensor systems, fusion and perception algorithms as well as traffic rules and laws, are on the agenda. Since models that can cover all system setups and design domains at once are not yet foreseeable, model adaptation plays a central role. Therefore, a simulation-based study on transfer learning techniques is conducted on basis of a transformer-based model. Furthermore, the study aims to provide insights into possible trade-offs between computational time and performance to support effective transfers into the real world.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in 2024 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV), Jeju Shinhwa World, Jeju Island, Korea, June 2-5, 2024</p></details> |

Such a robot needs to be able to constantly adapt to the surrounding scene based on egocentric vision, and predict the ego motion of the wearer. In this work, we leveraged body-mounted cameras and sensors to anticipate the trajectory of human wearers through complex surroundings. To facilitate research in ego-motion prediction, we have collected a comprehensive walking scene navigation dataset centered on the user's perspective. We then present a method to predict human motion conditioning on the surrounding static scene. Our method leverages a diffusion model to produce a distribution of potential future trajectories, taking into account the user's observation of the environment. To that end, we introduce a compact representation to encode the user's visual memory of the surroundings, as well as an efficient sample-generating technique to speed up real-time inference of a diffusion model. We ablate our model and compare it to baselines, and results show that our model outperforms existing methods on key metrics of collision avoidance and trajectory mode coverage.</p></details> | 13 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Stochastic Trajectory Optimization for Demonstration Imitation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03131v2)** | 2024-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Humans often learn new skills by imitating the experts and gradually developing their proficiency. In this work, we introduce Stochastic Trajectory Optimization for Demonstration Imitation (STODI), a trajectory optimization framework for robots to imitate the shape of demonstration trajectories with improved dynamic performance. Consistent with the human learning process, demonstration imitation serves as an initial step, while trajectory optimization aims to enhance robot motion performance. By generating random noise and constructing proper cost functions, the STODI effectively explores and exploits generated noisy trajectories while preserving the demonstration shape characteristics. We employ three metrics to measure the similarity of trajectories in both the time and frequency domains to help with demonstration imitation. Theoretical analysis reveals relationships among these metrics, emphasizing the benefits of frequency-domain analysis for specific tasks. Experiments on a 7-DOF robotic arm in the PyBullet simulator validate the efficacy of the STODI framework, showcasing the improved optimization performance and stability compared to previous methods.</p></details> |  |

Throughout this work we seek a controller that is, robust to the uncertainty and disturbance, accurate, and implementable. To perform these requirements, we use a nonlinear Lyapunov-based approach for designing the controller and guaranteeing its stability. MATLAB-SIMULINK software is used to validate the approach and demonstrate the performance of the controller. Simulation results show that the derived controller is stable, robust to the disturbance and uncertainties, accurate, and implementable.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Holistic Optimization Framework for Energy Efficient UAV-assisted Fog Computing: Attitude Control, Trajectory Planning and Task Assignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14894v2)** | 2024-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have significantly enhanced fog computing by acting as both flexible computation platforms and communication mobile relays. In this paper, we propose a holistic framework that jointly optimizes the total latency and energy consumption for UAV-assisted fog computing in a three-dimensional spatial domain with varying terrain elevations and dynamic task generations. Our proposed framework considers three important and interdependent modules: attitude control, trajectory planning, and task assignment. We first establish a fuzzy proportional-integral-derivative control model to determine the UAV's attitude. Then, we propose an enhanced Ant Colony System (ACS) based algorithm, that includes a safety value and a decoupling mechanism to overcome the convergence issue in classical ACS, to compute the optimal UAV trajectory. Finally, we design an algorithm based on the Particle Swarm Optimization technique, to determine where each offloaded task should be executed. Under our proposed framework, the outcome of one module would affect the decision-making in one other, providing a holistic perspective of the system and thus leading to improved solutions. We demonstrate by extensive simulation results that our proposed framework can significantly improve the overall performance, measured by latency and energy consumption, compared to existing baseline approaches.</p></details> | 14 pages, 10 figures |

Such manoeuvring flight envelope variations, governed by the aircraft's complex nonlinear dynamics, are unpredictable by pilots and existing flight management systems. To prevent in-flight Loss of Control, post-failure trajectories must be optimal, planned in real-time, avoid terrain, and adhere to the impaired aircraft's reduced manoeuvrability and dynamic constraints. This paper presents a novel real-time trajectory optimization method for impaired aircraft based on a combination of differential flatness theory, the pseudospectral method, nonlinear programming, and inverse dynamics. In the proposed method, which utilizes a high-fidelity nonlinear six degree-of-freedom model, to conform to aircraft's altered dynamics a sequence of trim points is selected from the impaired aircraft's manoeuvring flight envelope based on the chosen optimization criteria, ensuring that the resulting three-dimensional trajectory observes terrain avoidance. Then, the required control inputs are obtained for each manoeuvre in less than a second. The method is applied to the NASA Generic Transport Model with rudder failure near a complex mountainous terrain. Both an optimal one-piece trajectory and a near-optimal piecewise path consisting of several optimal trajectories, are generated in non-real-time and real-time, respectively, and compared. Results show that the near-optimal real-time trajectory retains up to 80% of the optimality.</p></details> | <details><summary>56 pa...</summary><p>56 pages, 21 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[LC-LLM: Explainable Lane-Change Intention and Trajectory Predictions with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18344v2)** | 2024-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To ensure safe driving in dynamic environments, autonomous vehicles should possess the capability to accurately predict lane change intentions of surrounding vehicles in advance and forecast their future trajectories. Existing motion prediction approaches have ample room for improvement, particularly in terms of long-term prediction accuracy and interpretability. In this paper, we address these challenges by proposing LC-LLM, an explainable lane change prediction model that leverages the strong reasoning capabilities and self-explanation abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Essentially, we reformulate the lane change prediction task as a language modeling problem, processing heterogeneous driving scenario information as natural language prompts for LLMs and employing supervised fine-tuning to tailor LLMs specifically for lane change prediction task. Additionally, we finetune the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning to improve prediction transparency and reliability, and include explanatory requirements in the prompts during inference stage. Therefore, our LC-LLM model not only predicts lane change intentions and trajectories but also provides CoT reasoning and explanations for its predictions, enhancing its interpretability. Extensive experiments based on the large-scale highD dataset demonstrate the superior performance and interpretability of our LC-LLM in lane change prediction task. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to utilize LLMs for predicting lane change behavior. Our study shows that LLMs can effectively encode comprehensive interaction information for driving behavior understanding.</p></details> | 12 pages, 9 figures |

Due to a large amount of variability in brain anatomy between different individuals, we hypothesize that leveraging MRI time series can help improve specificity, by treating each patient as their own baseline. Here we turn to conditional variational autoencoders to generate individualized MRI predictions given the subject's age, disease status and one previous scan. Using serial imaging data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, we train a novel architecture to build a latent space distribution which can be sampled from to generate future predictions of changing anatomy. This enables us to extrapolate beyond the dataset and predict MRIs up to 10 years. We evaluated the model on a held-out set from ADNI and an independent dataset (from Open Access Series of Imaging Studies). By comparing to several alternatives, we show that our model produces more individualized images with higher resolution. Further, if an individual already has a follow-up MRI, we demonstrate a usage of our model to compute a likelihood ratio classifier for disease status. In practice, the model may be able to assist in early diagnosis of AD and provide a counterfactual baseline trajectory for treatment effect estimation. Furthermore, it generates a synthetic dataset that can potentially be used for downstream tasks such as anomaly detection and classification.</p></details> | <details><summary>MICCA...</summary><p>MICCAI 2024 LDTM workshop</p></details> |

In particular, the tasks of different types and service requirements in MEC network are offloaded from one UAV to another. To pursue the goal of low-carbon edge computing, we study the problem of minimizing system energy consumption by jointly optimizing computation resource allocation, task scheduling, service placement, and UAV trajectories. Considering the inherent unpredictability associated with task generation and the dynamic nature of wireless fading channels, addressing this problem presents a significant challenge. To overcome this issue, we reformulate the complicated non-convex problem as a Markov decision process and propose a soft actor-critic-based trajectory optimization and resource allocation algorithm to implement a flexible learning strategy. Numerical results illustrate that within a multi-UAV-enabled MEC network, the proposed algorithm effectively reduces the system energy consumption in heterogeneous tasks and services scenarios compared to other baseline solutions.</p></details> | 11 pages, 10 figures |

In the past, relatively simple physics-motivated priors have been considered for such approaches, using assumptions such as constant velocity or acceleration. This paper presents an approach to incorporating exogenous control inputs, such as velocity or acceleration commands, into the continuous Gaussian process state-estimation framework. It is shown that this approach generalizes across different domains in robotics, making it applicable to both the estimation of continuous-time trajectories for mobile robots and continuum-robot shapes. Results show that incorporating control inputs leads to more informed priors, potentially requiring less measurements and estimation nodes to obtain accurate estimates. This makes the approach particularly useful in situations in which limited sensing is available.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures, submitted to IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters</p></details> |

In this study, we focus on a scenario where a connected and autonomous vehicle (CAV) serves as the central agent, utilizing both sensors and communication technologies to perceive its surrounding traffics consisting of autonomous vehicles (AVs), connected vehicles (CVs), and human-driven vehicles (HDVs). Our trajectory prediction task is aimed at all the detected surrounding vehicles. To effectively integrate the multi-source data from both sensor and communication technologies, we propose a deep learning framework called MSMA utilizing a cross-attention module for multi-source data fusion. Vector map data is utilized to provide contextual information. The trajectory dataset is collected in CARLA simulator with synthesized data errors introduced. Numerical experiments demonstrate that in a mixed traffic flow scenario, the integration of data from different sources enhances our understanding of the environment. This notably improves trajectory prediction accuracy, particularly in situations with a high CV market penetration rate. The code is available at: https://github.com/xichennn/MSMA.</p></details> |  |

With the rapid advancement in connected technologies, such as vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication, valuable information from alternate views becomes accessible via wireless networks. The integration of information from alternative views has the potential to overcome the inherent limitations associated with a single viewpoint, such as occlusions and limited field of view. In this work, we introduce V2INet, a novel trajectory prediction framework designed to model multi-view data by extending existing single-view models. Unlike previous approaches where the multi-view data is manually fused or formulated as a separate training stage, our model supports end-to-end training, enhancing both flexibility and performance. Moreover, the predicted multimodal trajectories are calibrated by a post-hoc conformal prediction module to get valid and efficient confidence regions. We evaluated the entire framework using the real-world V2I dataset V2X-Seq. Our results demonstrate superior performance in terms of Final Displacement Error (FDE) and Miss Rate (MR) using a single GPU.

However, the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) are based on supervised deep learning - which leads to challenges when the distribution of trajectories changes due to such a shock. We provide a neuro-symbolic rule-based framework to conduct error correction and detection of these models to integrate into our movement trajectory platform. We provide a suite of experiments on several recent SOTA models where we show highly accurate error detection, the ability to improve accuracy with a changing test distribution, and accuracy improvement for the base use case in addition to a suite of theoretical properties that informed algorithm development. Specifically, we show an F1 scores for predicting errors of up to 0.984, significant performance increase for out-of distribution accuracy (8.51% improvement over SOTA for zero-shot accuracy), and accuracy improvement over the SOTA model.</p></details> |  |

ECM directly injects guidance gradients to the estimated clean manifold, eliminating extensive gradient backpropagation throughout the network. Our methodology streamlines the generative process, enabling practical applications with reduced computational overhead. Experimental validation on the large-scale Argoverse 2 dataset demonstrates our approach's superior performance, offering a viable solution for computationally efficient, high-quality joint trajectory prediction and controllable generation for autonomous driving.

In this process, the complexity of algorithms used for vehicle control has grown significantly. Model Predictive Control (MPC) is a prominent example, which has gained enormous popularity and is now widely used for vehicle motion planning and control. However, safety concerns constrain its practical application, especially since traditional procedures of functional safety (FS), with its universal standard ISO26262, reach their limits. Concomitantly, the new aspect of safety-of-the-intended-function (SOTIF) has moved into the center of attention, whose standard, ISO21448, has only been released in 2022. Thus, experience with SOTIF is low and few case studies are available in industry and research. Hence this paper aims to make two main contributions: (1) an analysis of the SOTIF for a generic MPC-based trajectory planner and (2) an interpretation and concrete application of the generic procedures described in ISO21448 for determining functional insufficiencies (FIs) and triggering conditions (TCs). Particular novelties of the paper include an approach for the out-of-context development of SOTIF-related elements (SOTIF-EooC), a compilation of important FIs and TCs for a MPC-based trajectory planner, and an optimized safety concept based on the identified FIs and TCs for the MPC-based trajectory planner.</p></details> | Extended Version |

We propose an expression exploration framework based on deep symbolic regression (DSR) integrated with a variable intersection selection (VIS) method to find variable combinations that encourage interpretable and parsimonious mathematical expressions. In the exploration learning process, two penalty terms are added to improve the reward function: (i) a complexity penalty to regulate the complexity of the explored expressions to be parsimonious, and (ii) a variable interaction penalty to encourage the expression exploration to focus on variable combinations that can best describe the data. We show the performance of the proposed method to learn several car-following dynamics models and discuss its limitations and future research directions.</p></details> |  |

Nonetheless, the potential of transformer-based diffusion models for effectively generating videos with controllable motion remains an area of limited exploration. This paper introduces Tora, the first trajectory-oriented DiT framework that integrates textual, visual, and trajectory conditions concurrently for video generation. Specifically, Tora consists of a Trajectory Extractor~(TE), a Spatial-Temporal DiT, and a Motion-guidance Fuser~(MGF). The TE encodes arbitrary trajectories into hierarchical spacetime motion patches with a 3D video compression network. The MGF integrates the motion patches into the DiT blocks to generate consistent videos following trajectories. Our design aligns seamlessly with DiT's scalability, allowing precise control of video content's dynamics with diverse durations, aspect ratios, and resolutions. Extensive experiments demonstrate Tora's excellence in achieving high motion fidelity, while also meticulously simulating the movement of the physical world.

Learning-based approaches for multi-agent trajectory prediction, such as primarily relying on graph neural networks, graph transformers, and hypergraph neural networks, have demonstrated outstanding performance on real-world datasets in recent years. However, the hypergraph transformer-based method for trajectory prediction is yet to be explored. Therefore, we present a MultiscAle Relational Transformer (MART) network for multi-agent trajectory prediction. MART is a hypergraph transformer architecture to consider individual and group behaviors in transformer machinery. The core module of MART is the encoder, which comprises a Pair-wise Relational Transformer (PRT) and a Hyper Relational Transformer (HRT). The encoder extends the capabilities of a relational transformer by introducing HRT, which integrates hyperedge features into the transformer mechanism, promoting attention weights to focus on group-wise relations. In addition, we propose an Adaptive Group Estimator (AGE) designed to infer complex group relations in real-world environments. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets (NBA, SDD, and ETH-UCY) demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, enhancing ADE/FDE by 3.9%/11.8% on the NBA dataset.

Due to the intractable growth of non-convex constraints with the number of agents, exploring various homotopy classes that imply different convex domains, is crucial for finding a feasible solution. However, existing methods struggle to explore various homotopy classes efficiently due to combining it with time-consuming precise trajectory solution finding. CSDO, addresses this limitation by separating them into different levels and integrating an efficient Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) algorithm to search homotopy classes. It first searches for a coarse initial guess using a large search step, identifying a specific homotopy class. Subsequent decentralized Quadratic Programming (QP) refinement processes this guess, resolving minor collisions efficiently. Experimental results demonstrate that CSDO outperforms existing MVTP algorithms in large-scale, high-density scenarios, achieving up to 95% success rate in 50m $\times$ 50m random scenarios around one second.

We introduce the Enhanced Transformer for Health Outcome Simulation (ETHOS), a novel application of the transformer deep-learning architecture for analyzing high-dimensional, heterogeneous, and episodic health data. ETHOS is trained using Patient Health Timelines (PHTs)-detailed, tokenized records of health events-to predict future health trajectories, leveraging a zero-shot learning approach. ETHOS represents a significant advancement in foundation model development for healthcare analytics, eliminating the need for labeled data and model fine-tuning. Its ability to simulate various treatment pathways and consider patient-specific factors positions ETHOS as a tool for care optimization and addressing biases in healthcare delivery.

Forward application of the model yields so called imagined trajectories (sequences of action, predicted state-reward) used to optimize the set of candidate actions that maximize expected reward. The outcome, an ideal imagined trajectory or plan, is imperfect and typically MBRL relies on model predictive control (MPC) to overcome this by continuously re-planning from scratch, incurring thus major computational cost and increasing complexity in tasks with longer receding horizon. We propose uncertainty estimation methods for online evaluation of imagined trajectories to assess whether further planned actions can be trusted to deliver acceptable reward. These methods include comparing the error after performing the last action with the standard expected error and using model uncertainty to assess the deviation from expected outcomes. Additionally, we introduce methods that exploit the forward propagation of the dynamics model to evaluate if the remainder of the plan aligns with expected results and assess the remainder of the plan in terms of the expected reward. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed uncertainty estimation methods by applying them to avoid unnecessary trajectory replanning in a shooting MBRL setting. Results highlight significant reduction on computational costs without sacrificing performance.</p></details> |  |

Stochastic Model Predictive Control (SMPC)-based planners provide non-conservative planning, but do not rule out a (small) probability of collision. We propose a control scheme that yields an efficient trajectory based on SMPC when the traffic scenario allows, still avoiding that the vehicle causes collisions with traffic participants if the latter move according to the prediction assumptions. If some traffic participant does not behave as anticipated, no safety guarantee can be given. Then, our approach yields a trajectory which minimizes the probability of collision, using Constraint Violation Probability Minimization techniques. Our algorithm can also be adapted to minimize the anticipated harm caused by a collision. We provide a thorough discussion of the benefits of our novel control scheme and compare it to a previous approach through numerical simulations from the CommonRoad database.</p></details> |  |

Our method constructs multiple trajectory sets tailored to different scene contexts, such as intersections and non-intersections, by leveraging map information and actor dynamics. We introduce a deterministic goal sampling algorithm that identifies relevant map regions and generates trajectories conditioned on the scene layout. Furthermore, we empirically investigate various sampling strategies and set sizes to optimize the trade-off between coverage and diversity. Experiments on the Argoverse 2 dataset demonstrate that our scene-specific sets achieve higher plausibility while maintaining diversity compared to traditional single-set approaches. The proposed Recursive In-Distribution Subsampling (RIDS) method effectively condenses the representation space and outperforms metric-driven sampling in terms of trajectory admissibility. Our work highlights the benefits of scene-aware trajectory set generation for capturing the complex and heterogeneous nature of actor behavior in real-world driving scenarios.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces Aircraft Trajectory Segmentation-based Contrastive Coding (ATSCC), a novel self-supervised time series representation learning framework designed to capture semantic information in air traffic trajectory data. The framework leverages the segmentable characteristic of trajectories and ensures consistency within the self-assigned segments. Intensive experiments were conducted on datasets from three different airports, totaling four datasets, comparing the learned representation's performance of downstream classification and clustering with other state-of-the-art representation learning techniques. The results show that ATSCC outperforms these methods by aligning with the labels defined by aeronautical procedures. ATSCC is adaptable to various airport configurations and scalable to incomplete trajectories. This research has expanded upon existing capabilities, achieving these improvements independently without predefined inputs such as airport configurations, maneuvering procedures, or labeled data.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 7 figures.

Typical stochastic mobility models, e.g., random waypoint model and Gauss Markov model, can hardly capture the distribution characteristics of users within real-world areas. State-of-the-art trace-based mobility models and existing learning-based trajectory generation methods, however, are frequently constrained by the inaccessibility of substantial real trajectories due to privacy concerns. In this paper, we harness the intrinsic correlation between street maps and trajectories and develop a novel zero-shot trajectory generation method, named Map2Traj, by exploiting the diffusion model. We incorporate street maps as a condition to consistently pilot the denoising process and train our model on diverse sets of real trajectories from various regions in Xi'an, China, and their corresponding street maps. With solely the street map of an unobserved area, Map2Traj generates synthetic trajectories that not only closely resemble the real-world mobility pattern but also offer comparable efficacy. Extensive experiments validate the efficacy of our proposed method on zero-shot trajectory generation tasks in terms of both trajectory and distribution similarities. In addition, a case study of employing Map2Traj in wireless network optimization is presented to validate its efficacy for downstream applications.</p></details> |  |

SAPI uses an abstract way to represent and encode surrounding environment by utilizing information from real-time map, right-of-way, and surrounding traffic. The proposed model consists of two convolutional network (CNN) and recurrent neural network (RNN)-based encoders and one decoder. A refiner is proposed to conduct a look-back operation inside the model, in order to make full use of raw history trajectory information. We evaluate SAPI on a proprietary dataset collected in real-world intersections through autonomous vehicles. It is demonstrated that SAPI shows promising performance when predicting vehicle trajectories at intersection, and outperforms benchmark methods. The average displacement error(ADE) and final displacement error(FDE) for 6-second prediction are 1.84m and 4.32m respectively. We also show that the proposed model can accurately predict vehicle trajectories in different scenarios.</p></details> |  |

Recent manifold learning-based methods have partially addressed the dimensionality and dataset size issues, but struggle with the complex text-conditional distribution. In this paper we propose a text-based trajectory generation model that attempts to address all three challenges while relying on only a handful of demonstration trajectory data. Our key idea is to leverage recent flow-based models capable of capturing complex conditional distributions, not directly in the high-dimensional trajectory space, but rather in the low-dimensional latent coordinate space of the motion manifold, with deliberately designed regularization terms to ensure smoothness of motions and robustness to text variations. We show that our {\it Motion Manifold Flow Primitive (MMFP)} framework can accurately generate qualitatively distinct motions for a wide range of text inputs, significantly outperforming existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 10 figures, under review</p></details> |
| **[Multi-Agent Trajectory Prediction with Difficulty-Guided Feature Enhancement Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18551v2)** | 2024-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction is crucial for autonomous driving as it aims to forecast the future movements of traffic participants. Traditional methods usually perform holistic inference on the trajectories of agents, neglecting the differences in prediction difficulty among agents. This paper proposes a novel Difficulty-Guided Feature Enhancement Network (DGFNet), which leverages the prediction difficulty differences among agents for multi-agent trajectory prediction. Firstly, we employ spatio-temporal feature encoding and interaction to capture rich spatio-temporal features. Secondly, a difficulty-guided decoder is used to control the flow of future trajectories into subsequent modules, obtaining reliable future trajectories. Then, feature interaction and fusion are performed through the future feature interaction module. Finally, the fused agent features are fed into the final predictor to generate the predicted trajectory distributions for multiple participants. Experimental results demonstrate that our DGFNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Argoverse 1\&2 motion forecasting benchmarks. Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of each module. Moreover, compared with SOTA methods, our method balances trajectory prediction accuracy and real-time inference speed.</p></details> |  |

Nevertheless, with the increasing granularity and complexity of vehicle-generated data, the lack of data quality audits raises concerns about multi-party mistrust in trajectory prediction tasks. In response, this paper proposes an asynchronous federated learning data sharing method based on an interpretable reputation quantization mechanism utilizing graph neural network tools. Data providers share data structures under differential privacy constraints to ensure security while reducing redundant data. We implement deep reinforcement learning to categorize vehicles by reputation level, which optimizes the aggregation efficiency of federated learning. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed data sharing scheme not only reinforces the security of the trajectory prediction task but also enhances prediction accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evaluating Human Trajectory Prediction with Metamorphic Testing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18756v1)** | 2024-07-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The prediction of human trajectories is important for planning in autonomous systems that act in the real world, e.g. automated driving or mobile robots. Human trajectory prediction is a noisy process, and no prediction does precisely match any future trajectory. It is therefore approached as a stochastic problem, where the goal is to minimise the error between the true and the predicted trajectory. In this work, we explore the application of metamorphic testing for human trajectory prediction. Metamorphic testing is designed to handle unclear or missing test oracles. It is well-designed for human trajectory prediction, where there is no clear criterion of correct or incorrect human behaviour. Metamorphic relations rely on transformations over source test cases and exploit invariants. A setting well-designed for human trajectory prediction where there are many symmetries of expected human behaviour under variations of the input, e.g. mirroring and rescaling of the input data. We discuss how metamorphic testing can be applied to stochastic human trajectory prediction and introduce the Wasserstein Violation Criterion to statistically assess whether a follow-up test case violates a label-preserving metamorphic relation.</p></details> | <details><summary>MET'2...</summary><p>MET'24: 9th ACM International Workshop on Metamorphic Testing</p></details> |

This approach significantly reduces the data requirements while retaining essential information. To process these representations, we use a Masked Space-time Transformer that effectively learns to aggregate information to facilitate few-shot action recognition.

| **[Trajectory Planning Using Reinforcement Learning for Interactive Overtaking Maneuvers in Autonomous Racing Scenarios](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10658v2)** | 2024-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conventional trajectory planning approaches for autonomous racing are based on the sequential execution of prediction of the opposing vehicles and subsequent trajectory planning for the ego vehicle. If the opposing vehicles do not react to the ego vehicle, they can be predicted accurately. However, if there is interaction between the vehicles, the prediction loses its validity. For high interaction, instead of a planning approach that reacts exclusively to the fixed prediction, a trajectory planning approach is required that incorporates the interaction with the opposing vehicles. This paper demonstrates the limitations of a widely used conventional sampling-based approach within a highly interactive blocking scenario. We show that high success rates are achieved for less aggressive blocking behavior but that the collision rate increases with more significant interaction. We further propose a novel Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based trajectory planning approach for racing that explicitly exploits the interaction with the opposing vehicle without requiring a prediction. In contrast to the conventional approach, the RL-based approach achieves high success rates even for aggressive blocking behavior. Furthermore, we propose a novel safety layer (SL) that intervenes when the trajectory generated by the RL-based approach is infeasible. In that event, the SL generates a sub-optimal but feasible trajectory, avoiding termination of the scenario due to a not found valid solution.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, accepted to be published at the 27th IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems, September 24 - 27, 2024, Edmonton, Canada</p></details> |
| **[Sampling-Based Hierarchical Trajectory Planning for Formation Flight](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17392v1)** | 2024-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Formation flight of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) poses significant challenges in terms of safety and formation keeping, particularly in cluttered environments. However, existing methods often struggle to simultaneously satisfy these two critical requirements. To address this issue, this paper proposes a sampling-based trajectory planning method with a hierarchical structure for formation flight in dense obstacle environments. To ensure reliable local sensing information sharing among UAVs, each UAV generates a safe flight corridor (SFC), which is transmitted to the leader UAV. Subsequently, a sampling-based formation guidance path generation method is designed as the front-end strategy, steering the formation to fly in the desired shape safely with the formation connectivity provided by the SFCs. Furthermore, a model predictive path integral (MPPI) based distributed trajectory optimization method is developed as the back-end part, which ensures the smoothness, safety and dynamics feasibility of the executable trajectory. To validate the efficiency of the developed algorithm, comprehensive simulation comparisons are conducted.

However, measuring real-world detouring behavior is challenging due to the need to track the movement of individual vehicles. Recent developments in high-resolution vehicle trajectory data have enabled transportation professionals to observe real-world detouring behaviors without the need to install and maintain hardware such as license plate reading cameras. This paper investigates the feasibility of vehicle probe trajectory data to capture commercial motor vehicle (CMV) detouring behavior under three unique case studies. Before doing so, a validation analysis was conducted to investigate the ability of CMV probe trajectory data to represent overall CMV volumes at well-calibrated count stations near virtual weigh stations (VWS) in Maryland. The validation analysis showed strong positive correlations (above 0.75) at all VWS stations. Upon validating the data, a methodology was applied to assess CMV detour behaviors associated with CMV enforcement activities, congestion avoidance, and incident induced temporary road closures.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at Transportation Research Board Annual Meeting 2024.

Existing methods often focus solely on either language or full trajectory control, lacking precision in synthesizing motions aligned with user-specified trajectories, especially for multi-joint control. To address these issues, we present TLControl, a novel method for realistic human motion synthesis, incorporating both low-level Trajectory and high-level Language semantics controls, through the integration of neural-based and optimization-based techniques. Specifically, we begin with training a VQ-VAE for a compact and well-structured latent motion space organized by body parts. We then propose a Masked Trajectories Transformer (MTT) for predicting a motion distribution conditioned on language and trajectory. Once trained, we use MTT to sample initial motion predictions given user-specified partial trajectories and text descriptions as conditioning. Finally, we introduce a test-time optimization to refine these coarse predictions for precise trajectory control, which offers flexibility by allowing users to specify various optimization goals and ensures high runtime efficiency. Comprehensive experiments show that TLControl significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art in trajectory accuracy and time efficiency, making it practical for interactive and high-quality animation generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reacting on human stubbornness in human-machine trajectory planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17275v1)** | 2024-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, a method for a cooperative trajectory planning between a human and an automation is extended by a behavioral model of the human. This model can characterize the stubbornness of the human, which measures how strong the human adheres to his preferred trajectory. Accordingly, a static model is introduced indicating a link between the force in haptically coupled human-robot interactions and humans's stubbornness. The introduced stubbornness parameter enables an application-independent reaction of the automation for the cooperative trajectory planning. Simulation results in the context of human-machine cooperation in a care application show that the proposed behavioral model can quantitatively estimate the stubbornness of the interacting human, enabling a more targeted adaptation of the automation to the human behavior.</p></details> |  |
| **[Context-aware Multi-task Learning for Pedestrian Intent and Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17162v1)** | 2024-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The advancement of socially-aware autonomous vehicles hinges on precise modeling of human behavior. Within this broad paradigm, the specific challenge lies in accurately predicting pedestrian's trajectory and intention. Traditional methodologies have leaned heavily on historical trajectory data, frequently overlooking vital contextual cues such as pedestrian-specific traits and environmental factors. Furthermore, there's a notable knowledge gap as trajectory and intention prediction have largely been approached as separate problems, despite their mutual dependence. To bridge this gap, we introduce PTINet (Pedestrian Trajectory and Intention Prediction Network), which jointly learns the trajectory and intention prediction by combining past trajectory observations, local contextual features (individual pedestrian behaviors), and global features (signs, markings etc.). The efficacy of our approach is evaluated on widely used public datasets: JAAD and PIE, where it has demonstrated superior performance over existing state-of-the-art models in trajectory and intention prediction. The results from our experiments and ablation studies robustly validate PTINet's effectiveness in jointly exploring intention and trajectory prediction for pedestrian behaviour modelling. The experimental evaluation indicates the advantage of using global and local contextual features for pedestrian trajectory and intention prediction. The effectiveness of PTINet in predicting pedestrian behavior paves the way for the development of automated systems capable of seamlessly interacting with pedestrians in urban settings.</p></details> |  |

| **[Simultaneous Trajectory Optimization and Contact Selection for Contact-rich Manipulation with High-Fidelity Geometry](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16976v1)** | 2024-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contact-implicit trajectory optimization (CITO) is an effective method to plan complex trajectories for various contact-rich systems including manipulation and locomotion. CITO formulates a mathematical program with complementarity constraints (MPCC) that enforces that contact forces must be zero when points are not in contact. However, MPCC solve times increase steeply with the number of allowable points of contact, which limits CITO's applicability to problems in which only a few, simple geometries are allowed to make contact. This paper introduces simultaneous trajectory optimization and contact selection (STOCS), as an extension of CITO that overcomes this limitation. The innovation of STOCS is to identify salient contact points and times inside the iterative trajectory optimization process. This effectively reduces the number of variables and constraints in each MPCC invocation. The STOCS framework, instantiated with key contact identification subroutines, renders the optimization of manipulation trajectories computationally tractable even for high-fidelity geometries consisting of tens of thousands of vertices.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2306.06465</p></details> |

However, mobility data can also reveal sensitive information about individuals, such as political opinions, religious beliefs, or sexual orientations. Existing privacy-preserving approaches for publishing this data face a significant utility-privacy trade-off. Releasing synthetic trajectory data generated through deep learning offers a promising solution. Due to the trajectories' sequential nature, most existing models are based on recurrent neural networks (RNNs). However, research in generative adversarial networks (GANs) largely employs convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image generation. This discrepancy raises the question of whether advances in computer vision can be applied to trajectory generation. In this work, we introduce a Reversible Trajectory-to-CNN Transformation (RTCT) that adapts trajectories into a format suitable for CNN-based models. We integrated this transformation with the well-known DCGAN in a proof-of-concept (PoC) and evaluated its performance against an RNN-based trajectory GAN using four metrics across two datasets. The PoC was superior in capturing spatial distributions compared to the RNN model but had difficulty replicating sequential and temporal properties. Although the PoC's utility is not sufficient for practical applications, the results demonstrate the transformation's potential to facilitate the use of CNNs for trajectory generation, opening up avenues for future research.

The approach uses deep neural networks to learn uncertain dynamics while still providing guarantees of transient tracking performance throughout the learning phase. Within the proposed approach, a disturbance estimation law is adopted to estimate the pointwise value of the uncertainty, with pre-computable estimation error bounds (EEBs). The learned dynamics, the estimated disturbances, and the EEBs are then incorporated in a robust Riemann energy condition to compute the control law that guarantees exponential convergence of actual trajectories to desired ones throughout the learning phase, even when the learned model is poor. On the other hand, with improved accuracy, the learned model can help improve the robustness of the tracking controller, e.g., against input delays, and can be incorporated to plan better trajectories with improved performance, e.g., lower energy consumption and shorter travel time.The proposed framework is validated on a planar quadrotor example.</p></details> | 18 pages, 8 figures |

However, existing mobility trajectory generation methods still require real-world human trajectories centrally collected as the training data, where there exists an inescapable risk of privacy leakage. To overcome this limitation, in this paper, we propose PateGail, a privacy-preserving imitation learning model to generate mobility trajectories, which utilizes the powerful generative adversary imitation learning model to simulate the decision-making process of humans. Further, in order to protect user privacy, we train this model collectively based on decentralized mobility data stored in user devices, where personal discriminators are trained locally to distinguish and reward the real and generated human trajectories. In the training process, only the generated trajectories and their rewards obtained based on personal discriminators are shared between the server and devices, whose privacy is further preserved by our proposed perturbation mechanisms with theoretical proof to satisfy differential privacy. Further, to better model the human decision-making process, we propose a novel aggregation mechanism of the rewards obtained from personal discriminators. We theoretically prove that under the reward obtained based on the aggregation mechanism, our proposed model maximizes the lower bound of the discounted total rewards of users. Extensive experiments show that the trajectories generated by our model are able to resemble real-world trajectories in terms of five key statistical metrics, outperforming state-of-the-art algorithms by over 48.03%. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the synthetic trajectories are able to efficiently support practical applications, including mobility prediction and location recommendation.</p></details> |  |

We frame constrained trajectory optimization as a novel form of constrained functional minimization over trajectory distributions, which avoids treating the constraints as a penalty in the objective and allows us to generate diverse sets of constraint-satisfying trajectories. Our method uses Stein Variational Gradient Descent (SVGD) to find a set of particles that approximates a distribution over low-cost trajectories while obeying constraints. CSVTO is applicable to problems with differentiable equality and inequality constraints and includes a novel particle re-sampling step to escape local minima. By explicitly generating diverse sets of trajectories, CSVTO is better able to avoid poor local minima and is more robust to initialization. We demonstrate that CSVTO outperforms baselines in challenging highly-constrained tasks, such as a 7DoF wrench manipulation task, where CSVTO outperforms all baselines both in success and constraint satisfaction.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 10 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

Biological knowledge suggests that it may be best to describe complex diseases at the level of underlying pathways, which may interact with one another. We propose a Bayesian approach that allows for characterising such correlation among different pathways through Dependent Gaussian Processes (DGP) and mapping the observed high-dimensional gene expression trajectories into unobserved low-dimensional pathway expression trajectories via Bayesian Sparse Factor Analysis. Our proposal is the first attempt to relax the classical assumption of independent factors for longitudinal data and has demonstrated a superior performance in recovering the shape of pathway expression trajectories, revealing the relationships between genes and pathways, and predicting gene expressions (closer point estimates and narrower predictive intervals), as demonstrated through simulations and real data analysis. To fit the model, we propose a Monte Carlo Expectation Maximization (MCEM) scheme that can be implemented conveniently by combining a standard Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampler and an R package GPFDA (Konzen and others, 2021), which returns the maximum likelihood estimates of DGP hyperparameters. The modular structure of MCEM makes it generalizable to other complex models involving the DGP model component. Our R package DGP4LCF that implements the proposed approach is available on CRAN.</p></details> |  |

However, configuring the skills' parameters for a specific task remains a manual and time-consuming endeavor. Existing approaches for learning or optimizing these parameters often require numerous real-world executions or do not work in dynamic environments. To address these challenges, we propose MuTT, a novel encoder-decoder transformer architecture designed to predict environment-aware executions of robot skills by integrating vision, trajectory, and robot skill parameters. Notably, we pioneer the fusion of vision and trajectory, introducing a novel trajectory projection. Furthermore, we illustrate MuTT's efficacy as a predictor when combined with a model-based robot skill optimizer. This approach facilitates the optimization of robot skill parameters for the current environment, without the need for real-world executions during optimization. Designed for compatibility with any representation of robot skills, MuTT demonstrates its versatility across three comprehensive experiments, showcasing superior performance across two different skill representations.</p></details> |  |

To study this, structured clinical variables from Electronic Health Records (EHRs) data have traditionally been employed by many researchers. Presently, Natural Language Processing models have received great attention in clinical research which expanded the possibilities of using clinical narratives.

The extracted prognostic pathways of these subgroups provide valuable insights into the dynamic trajectories of sepsis severity over time. Visualizing these pathways sheds light on the likelihood and direction of disease progression across various contexts and reveals patterns and pivotal factors or biomarkers influencing the transition between sepsis stages, whether toward deterioration or improvement.

Some leading methods in this domain prioritize long-range matching, involving the unrolling of training trajectories with a fixed number of steps (NS) on the synthetic dataset to align with various expert training trajectories. However, traditional long-range matching methods possess an overfitting-like problem, the fixed step size NS forces synthetic dataset to distortedly conform seen expert training trajectories, resulting in a loss of generality-especially to those from unencountered architecture. We refer to this as the Accumulated Mismatching Problem (AMP), and propose a new approach, Automatic Training Trajectories (ATT), which dynamically and adaptively adjusts trajectory length NS to address the AMP.

This paper presents a comprehensive survey of the most prevalent distance-based vessel trajectory clustering methods, which encompass two main steps: trajectory similarity measurement and clustering. Initially, we conducted a thorough literature review using relevant keywords to gather and summarize pertinent research papers and datasets. Then, this paper discussed the principal methods of data pre-processing that prepare data for further analysis. The survey progresses to detail the leading algorithms for measuring vessel trajectory similarity and the main clustering techniques used in the field today. Furthermore, the various applications of trajectory clustering within the maritime context are explored. Finally, the paper evaluates the effectiveness of different algorithm combinations and pre-processing methods through experimental analysis, focusing on their impact on the performance of distance-based trajectory clustering algorithms. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of various trajectory clustering algorithms and notably highlight the significant improvements that trajectory compression techniques contribute to the efficiency and accuracy of trajectory clustering. This comprehensive approach ensures a deep understanding of current capabilities and future directions in vessel trajectory clustering.</p></details> |  |
| **[Risk-Aware Vehicle Trajectory Prediction Under Safety-Critical Scenarios](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13480v1)** | 2024-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction is significant for intelligent vehicles to achieve high-level autonomous driving, and a lot of relevant research achievements have been made recently. Despite the rapid development, most existing studies solely focused on normal safe scenarios while largely neglecting safety-critical scenarios, particularly those involving imminent collisions. This oversight may result in autonomous vehicles lacking the essential predictive ability in such situations, posing a significant threat to safety. To tackle these, this paper proposes a risk-aware trajectory prediction framework tailored to safety-critical scenarios. Leveraging distinctive hazardous features, we develop three core risk-aware components. First, we introduce a risk-incorporated scene encoder, which augments conventional encoders with quantitative risk information to achieve risk-aware encoding of hazardous scene contexts. Next, we incorporate endpoint-risk-combined intention queries as prediction priors in the decoder to ensure that the predicted multimodal trajectories cover both various spatial intentions and risk levels. Lastly, an auxiliary risk prediction task is implemented for the ultimate risk-aware prediction. Furthermore, to support model training and performance evaluation, we introduce a safety-critical trajectory prediction dataset and tailored evaluation metrics. We conduct comprehensive evaluations and compare our model with several SOTA models. Results demonstrate the superior performance of our model, with a significant improvement in most metrics. This prediction advancement enables autonomous vehicles to execute correct collision avoidance maneuvers under safety-critical scenarios, eventually enhancing road traffic safety.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving Out-of-Distribution Generalization of Trajectory Prediction for Autonomous Driving via Polynomial Representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13431v1)** | 2024-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robustness against Out-of-Distribution (OoD) samples is a key performance indicator of a trajectory prediction model. However, the development and ranking of state-of-the-art (SotA) models are driven by their In-Distribution (ID) performance on individual competition datasets. We present an OoD testing protocol that homogenizes datasets and prediction tasks across two large-scale motion datasets. We introduce a novel prediction algorithm based on polynomial representations for agent trajectory and road geometry on both the input and output sides of the model. With a much smaller model size, training effort, and inference time, we reach near SotA performance for ID testing and significantly improve robustness in OoD testing. Within our OoD testing protocol, we further study two augmentation strategies of SotA models and their effects on model generalization. Highlighting the contrast between ID and OoD performance, we suggest adding OoD testing to the evaluation criteria of trajectory prediction models.</p></details> |  |

It's a way of generating a smooth and feasible path for the robot to follow over time. The process primarily takes several factors to generate the path, such as velocity, acceleration and jerk. The process deals with how the robot can follow a desired motion path in a suitable environment. This trajectory planning is extensively used in Automobile Industrial Robot, Manipulators, and Mobile Robots. Trajectory planning is a fundamental component of motion control systems. To perform tasks like pick and place operations, assembly, welding, painting, path following, and obstacle avoidance. This paper introduces a comparative analysis of trajectory planning algorithms and their key software elements working strategy in complex and dynamic environments. Adaptability and real-time analysis are the most common problems in trajectory planning. The paper primarily focuses on getting a better understanding of these unpredictable environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deterministic Trajectory Optimization through Probabilistic Optimal Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13316v1)** | 2024-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This article proposes two new algorithms tailored to discrete-time deterministic finite-horizon nonlinear optimal control problems or so-called trajectory optimization problems. Both algorithms are inspired by a novel theoretical paradigm known as probabilistic optimal control, that reformulates optimal control as an equivalent probabilistic inference problem. This perspective allows to address the problem using the Expectation-Maximization algorithm. We show that the application of this algorithm results in a fixed point iteration of probabilistic policies that converge to the deterministic optimal policy. Two strategies for policy evaluation are discussed, using state-of-the-art uncertainty quantification methods resulting into two distinct algorithms. The algorithms are structurally closest related to the differential dynamic programming algorithm and related methods that use sigma-point methods to avoid direct gradient evaluations. The main advantage of our work is an improved balance between exploration and exploitation over the iterations, leading to improved numerical stability and accelerated convergence. These properties are demonstrated on different nonlinear systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory Planning Using Tire Thermodynamics for Automated Drifting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12989v1)** | 2024-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated vehicles need to estimate tire-road friction information, as it plays a key role in safe trajectory planning and vehicle dynamics control. Notably, friction is not solely dependent on road surface conditions, but also varies significantly depending on the tire temperature. However, tire parameters such as the friction coefficient have been conventionally treated as constant values in automated vehicle motion planning. This paper develops a simple thermodynamic model that captures tire friction temperature variation. To verify the model, it is implemented into trajectory planning for automated drifting - a challenging application that requires leveraging an unstable, drifting equilibrium at the friction limits. The proposed method which captures the hidden tire dynamics provides a dynamically feasible trajectory, leading to more precise tracking during experiments with an LQR (Linear Quadratic Regulator) controller.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This manuscript was accepted from IEEE Intelligent Vehicle Symposium (IV 2024) and will be published late August</p></details> |
| **[Forward Invariance in Trajectory Spaces for Safety-critical Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12624v1)** | 2024-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Useful robot control algorithms should not only achieve performance objectives but also adhere to hard safety constraints. Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) have been developed to provably ensure system safety through forward invariance. However, they often unnecessarily sacrifice performance for safety since they are purely reactive. Receding horizon control (RHC), on the other hand, consider planned trajectories to account for the future evolution of a system. This work provides a new perspective on safety-critical control by introducing Forward Invariance in Trajectory Spaces (FITS). We lift the problem of safe RHC into the trajectory space and describe the evolution of planned trajectories as a controlled dynamical system. Safety constraints defined over states can be converted into sets in the trajectory space which we render forward invariant via a CBF framework. We derive an efficient quadratic program (QP) to synthesize trajectories that provably satisfy safety constraints. Our experiments support that FITS improves the adherence to safety specifications without sacrificing performance over alternative CBF and NMPC methods.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 figures |
| **[UniTE: A Survey and Unified Pipeline for Pre-training ST Trajectory Embeddings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12550v1)** | 2024-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal (ST) trajectories are sequences of timestamped locations, which enable a variety of analyses that in turn enable important real-world applications. It is common to map trajectories to vectors, called embeddings, before subsequent analyses. Thus, the qualities of embeddings are very important. Methods for pre-training embeddings, which leverage unlabeled trajectories for training universal embeddings, have shown promising applicability across different tasks, thus attracting considerable interest. However, research progress on this topic faces two key challenges: a lack of a comprehensive overview of existing methods, resulting in several related methods not being well-recognized, and the absence of a unified pipeline, complicating the development new methods and the analysis of methods. To overcome these obstacles and advance the field of pre-training of trajectory embeddings, we present UniTE, a survey and a unified pipeline for this domain. In doing so, we present a comprehensive list of existing methods for pre-training trajectory embeddings, which includes methods that either explicitly or implicitly employ pre-training techniques. Further, we present a unified and modular pipeline with publicly available underlying code, simplifying the process of constructing and evaluating methods for pre-training trajectory embeddings. Additionally, we contribute a selection of experimental results using the proposed pipeline on real-world datasets.</p></details> |  |

Established trajectory prediction methods primarily use agent tracks generated by a detection and tracking system and HD map as inputs. In this work, we propose a novel method that also incorporates visual input from surround-view cameras, allowing the model to utilize visual cues such as human gazes and gestures, road conditions, vehicle turn signals, etc, which are typically hidden from the model in prior methods. Furthermore, we use textual descriptions generated by a Vision-Language Model (VLM) and refined by a Large Language Model (LLM) as supervision during training to guide the model on what to learn from the input data. Despite using these extra inputs, our method achieves a latency of 53 ms, making it feasible for real-time processing, which is significantly faster than that of previous single-agent prediction methods with similar performance. Our experiments show that both the visual inputs and the textual descriptions contribute to improvements in trajectory prediction performance, and our qualitative analysis highlights how the model is able to exploit these additional inputs. Lastly, in this work we create and release the nuScenes-Text dataset, which augments the established nuScenes dataset with rich textual annotations for every scene, demonstrating the positive impact of utilizing VLM on trajectory prediction.

| **[Multi-Agent Probabilistic Ensembles with Trajectory Sampling for Connected Autonomous Vehicles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13910v3)** | 2024-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) have attracted significant attention in recent years and Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown remarkable performance in improving the autonomy of vehicles. In that regard, the widely adopted Model-Free RL (MFRL) promises to solve decision-making tasks in connected AVs (CAVs), contingent on the readiness of a significant amount of data samples for training. Nevertheless, it might be infeasible in practice and possibly lead to learning instability. In contrast, Model-Based RL (MBRL) manifests itself in sample-efficient learning, but the asymptotic performance of MBRL might lag behind the state-of-the-art MFRL algorithms. Furthermore, most studies for CAVs are limited to the decision-making of a single AV only, thus underscoring the performance due to the absence of communications. In this study, we try to address the decision-making problem of multiple CAVs with limited communications and propose a decentralized Multi-Agent Probabilistic Ensembles with Trajectory Sampling algorithm MA-PETS. In particular, in order to better capture the uncertainty of the unknown environment, MA-PETS leverages Probabilistic Ensemble (PE) neural networks to learn from communicated samples among neighboring CAVs. Afterwards, MA-PETS capably develops Trajectory Sampling (TS)-based model-predictive control for decision-making. On this basis, we derive the multi-agent group regret bound affected by the number of agents within the communication range and mathematically validate that incorporating effective information exchange among agents into the multi-agent learning scheme contributes to reducing the group regret bound in the worst case. Finally, we empirically demonstrate the superiority of MA-PETS in terms of the sample efficiency comparable to MFBL.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory and Power Optimization for Multi-UAV Enabled Emergency Wireless Communications Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11896v1)** | 2024-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) has attracted much attention due to its flexible deployment and controllable mobility. As the general communication network cannot meet the emergency requirements, in this paper we study the multi-UAV enabled wireless emergency communication system. Our goal is to maximize the capacity with jointly optimizing trajectory and allocating power. To tackle this non-convex optimization problem, we first decompose it into two sub-problems to optimize the trajectory and power allocation, respectively. Then, we propose the successive convex approximation technique and the block coordinate update algorithm to solve the two subproblems. The approximate optimal solution can be obtained after continuous iterations. Simulation results show that the capacity can be greatly increased using our proposed joint trajectory optimization and power allocation.</p></details> | 6 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Progressive Pretext Task Learning for Human Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11588v1)** | 2024-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human trajectory prediction is a practical task of predicting the future positions of pedestrians on the road, which typically covers all temporal ranges from short-term to long-term within a trajectory. However, existing works attempt to address the entire trajectory prediction with a singular, uniform training paradigm, neglecting the distinction between short-term and long-term dynamics in human trajectories. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a novel Progressive Pretext Task learning (PPT) framework, which progressively enhances the model's capacity of capturing short-term dynamics and long-term dependencies for the final entire trajectory prediction. Specifically, we elaborately design three stages of training tasks in the PPT framework. In the first stage, the model learns to comprehend the short-term dynamics through a stepwise next-position prediction task. In the second stage, the model is further enhanced to understand long-term dependencies through a destination prediction task. In the final stage, the model aims to address the entire future trajectory task by taking full advantage of the knowledge from previous stages. To alleviate the knowledge forgetting, we further apply a cross-task knowledge distillation. Additionally, we design a Transformer-based trajectory predictor, which is able to achieve highly efficient two-step reasoning by integrating a destination-driven prediction strategy and a group of learnable prompt embeddings. Extensive experiments on popular benchmarks have demonstrated that our proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance with high efficiency.

By leveraging natural language processing techniques, this study introduces the Scientific Concept Navigator (SciConNav), an embedding-based navigation model to infer the "knowledge pathway" from the research trajectories of millions of scholars. We validate that the learned representations effectively delineate disciplinary boundaries and capture the intricate relationships between diverse concepts. The utility of the inferred navigation space is showcased through multiple applications. Firstly, we demonstrated the multi-step analogy inferences within the knowledge space and the interconnectivity between concepts in different disciplines. Secondly, we formulated the attribute dimensions of knowledge across domains, observing the distributional shifts in the arrangement of 19 disciplines along these conceptual dimensions, including "Theoretical" to "Applied", and "Chemical" to "Biomedical', highlighting the evolution of functional attributes within knowledge domains. Lastly, by analyzing the high-dimensional knowledge network structure, we found that knowledge connects with shorter global pathways, and interdisciplinary knowledge plays a critical role in the accessibility of the global knowledge network. Our framework offers a novel approach to mining knowledge inheritance pathways in extensive scientific literature, which is of great significance for understanding scientific progression patterns, tailoring scientific learning trajectories, and accelerating scientific progress.</p></details> | <details><summary>21pag...</summary><p>21pages, 13 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |
| **[PRET: Planning with Directed Fidelity Trajectory for Vision and Language Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11487v1)** | 2024-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision and language navigation is a task that requires an agent to navigate according to a natural language instruction. Recent methods predict sub-goals on constructed topology map at each step to enable long-term action planning. However, they suffer from high computational cost when attempting to support such high-level predictions with GCN-like models. In this work, we propose an alternative method that facilitates navigation planning by considering the alignment between instructions and directed fidelity trajectories, which refers to a path from the initial node to the candidate locations on a directed graph without detours. This planning strategy leads to an efficient model while achieving strong performance. Specifically, we introduce a directed graph to illustrate the explored area of the environment, emphasizing directionality. Then, we firstly define the trajectory representation as a sequence of directed edge features, which are extracted from the panorama based on the corresponding orientation. Ultimately, we assess and compare the alignment between instruction and different trajectories during navigation to determine the next navigation target. Our method outperforms previous SOTA method BEVBert on RxR dataset and is comparable on R2R dataset while largely reducing the computational cost.

The system uses readily accessible information from customer smartphones and retail apps, including motion data, store maps, and purchase records. This eliminates the need for additional hardware installations/maintenance and ensures customers full data control. Specifically, RetailOpt first uses inertial navigation to recover relative trajectories from smartphone motion data. The store map and purchase records are cross-referenced to identify a list of visited shelves, providing anchors to localize the relative trajectories in a store through continuous and discrete optimization. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our system in five diverse environments. The system, if successful, would produce accurate customer movement data, essential for a broad range of retail applications including customer behavior analysis and in-store navigation.</p></details> |  |

As opposed to many existing control strategies, which do not consider spatial constraints, the proposed strategy considers spatial constraints on each degree of freedom movement of the UAV. Such consideration makes the design appealing for many practical applications, such as pipeline inspection, boundary tracking, etc. The proposed design accounts for the limited information about the inertia matrix, thereby affirming its inherent robustness against unmodeled dynamics and other imperfections. We rigorously show that the UAV will converge to its desired path by maintaining bounded position, orientation, and linear and angular speeds. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy through various numerical simulations.</p></details> |  |

Motivated by the pivotal role trajectory length plays in the training process, we introduce Ada-NAV, a novel adaptive trajectory length scheme designed to enhance the training sample efficiency of RL algorithms in robotic navigation tasks. Unlike traditional approaches that treat trajectory length as a fixed hyperparameter, we propose to dynamically adjust it based on the entropy of the underlying navigation policy. Interestingly, Ada-NAV can be applied to both existing on-policy and off-policy RL methods, which we demonstrate by empirically validating its efficacy on three popular RL methods: REINFORCE, Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), and Soft Actor-Critic (SAC). We demonstrate through simulated and real-world robotic experiments that Ada-NAV outperforms conventional methods that employ constant or randomly sampled trajectory lengths. Specifically, for a fixed sample budget, Ada-NAV achieves an 18\% increase in navigation success rate, a 20-38\% reduction in navigation path length, and a 9.32\% decrease in elevation costs. Furthermore, we showcase the versatility of Ada-NAV by integrating it with the Clearpath Husky robot, illustrating its applicability in complex outdoor environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 9 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

Strengthening attacks and uncovering vulnerabilities, especially common issues in VLP models (e.g., high transferable AEs), can advance reliable and practical VLP models. A recent work (i.e., Set-level guidance attack) indicates that augmenting image-text pairs to increase AE diversity along the optimization path enhances the transferability of adversarial examples significantly. However, this approach predominantly emphasizes diversity around the online adversarial examples (i.e., AEs in the optimization period), leading to the risk of overfitting the victim model and affecting the transferability. In this study, we posit that the diversity of adversarial examples towards the clean input and online AEs are both pivotal for enhancing transferability across VLP models. Consequently, we propose using diversification along the intersection region of adversarial trajectory to expand the diversity of AEs. To fully leverage the interaction between modalities, we introduce text-guided adversarial example selection during optimization. Furthermore, to further mitigate the potential overfitting, we direct the adversarial text deviating from the last intersection region along the optimization path, rather than adversarial images as in existing methods. Extensive experiments affirm the effectiveness of our method in improving transferability across various VLP models and downstream vision-and-language tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>ECCV2...</summary><p>ECCV2024.

This work introduces a novel approach that combines RL with trajectory optimization to manage this trade-off effectively. Our approach embeds safety constraints within the action space of a modified Markov Decision Process (MDP). The RL agent produces a sequence of actions that are transformed into safe trajectories by a trajectory optimizer, thereby effectively ensuring safety and increasing training stability. This novel approach excels in its performance on challenging Safety Gym tasks, achieving significantly higher rewards and near-zero safety violations during inference. The method's real-world applicability is demonstrated through a safe and effective deployment in a real robot task of box-pushing around obstacles.</p></details> |  |

However, generating factually consistent responses in knowledge-intensive scenarios remains a challenge due to issues such as hallucination, difficulty in acquiring long-tailed knowledge, and limited memory expansion. This paper introduces SMART, a novel multi-agent framework that leverages external knowledge to enhance the interpretability and factual consistency of LLM-generated responses. SMART comprises four specialized agents, each performing a specific sub-trajectory action to navigate complex knowledge-intensive tasks. We propose a multi-agent co-training paradigm, Long- and Short-Trajectory Learning, which ensures synergistic collaboration among agents while maintaining fine-grained execution by each agent. Extensive experiments on 5 tasks demonstrate SMART's superior performance compared to previous widely adopted methods.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we assemble 15 LLMs of four different size ranges and evaluate their output responses by preference ranking from the other LLMs as evaluators, such as System Star is better than System Square. We then evaluate the quality of ranking outputs introducing the Cognitive Bias Benchmark for LLMs as Evaluators (CoBBLEr), a benchmark to measure six different cognitive biases in LLM evaluation outputs, such as the Egocentric bias where a model prefers to rank its own outputs highly in evaluation. We find that LLMs are biased text quality evaluators, exhibiting strong indications on our bias benchmark (average of 40% of comparisons across all models) within each of their evaluations that question their robustness as evaluators. Furthermore, we examine the correlation between human and machine preferences and calculate the average Rank-Biased Overlap (RBO) score to be 49.6%, indicating that machine preferences are misaligned with humans. According to our findings, LLMs may still be unable to be utilized for automatic annotation aligned with human preferences.

These agents are postulated to excel across a myriad of tasks, potentially approaching general artificial intelligence. However, existing benchmarks fail to sufficiently challenge or showcase the full potential of LMMs in complex, real-world environments. To address this gap, we introduce VisualAgentBench (VAB), a comprehensive and pioneering benchmark specifically designed to train and evaluate LMMs as visual foundation agents across diverse scenarios, including Embodied, Graphical User Interface, and Visual Design, with tasks formulated to probe the depth of LMMs' understanding and interaction capabilities. Through rigorous testing across nine proprietary LMM APIs and eight open models, we demonstrate the considerable yet still developing agent capabilities of these models. Additionally, VAB constructs a trajectory training set constructed through hybrid methods including Program-based Solvers, LMM Agent Bootstrapping, and Human Demonstrations, promoting substantial performance improvements in LMMs through behavior cloning. Our work not only aims to benchmark existing models but also provides a solid foundation for future development into visual foundation agents.

Nowadays, countries try to merge their national patient-donor pools leading to international KEPs (IKEPs). As shown in the literature, long-term stability of an IKEP can be achieved through a credit-based system. In each round, every country is prescribed a "fair" initial allocation of kidney transplants. The initial allocation, which we obtain by using solution concepts from cooperative game theory, is adjusted by incorporating credits from the previous round, yielding the target allocation. The goal is to find, in each round, an optimal solution that closely approximates this target allocation. There is a known polynomial-time algorithm for finding an optimal solution that lexicographically minimizes the country deviations from the target allocation if only $2$-cycles (matchings) are permitted. In practice, kidney swaps along longer cycles may be performed. However, the problem of computing optimal solutions for maximum cycle length $\ell$ is NP-hard for every $\ell\geq 3$. This situation changes back to polynomial time once we allow unbounded cycle length. However, in contrast to the case where $\ell=2$, we show that for $\ell=\infty$, lexicographical minimization is only polynomial-time solvable under additional conditions (assuming P $\neq$ NP). Nevertheless, the fact that the optimal solutions themselves can be computed in polynomial time if $\ell=\infty$ still enables us to perform a large scale experimental study for showing how stability and total social welfare are affected when we set $\ell=\infty$ instead of $\ell=2$.</p></details> |  |

However, they pose a heightened risk of exposure to explicit content, raising growing concerns for the online safety of children and adolescents. Despite these concerns, few studies have addressed the issue of illicit image-based promotions of unsafe UGCGs on social media, which can inadvertently attract young users. This challenge arises from the difficulty of obtaining comprehensive training data for UGCG images and the unique nature of these images, which differ from traditional unsafe content. In this work, we take the first step towards studying the threat of illicit promotions of unsafe UGCGs. We collect a real-world dataset comprising 2,924 images that display diverse sexually explicit and violent content used to promote UGCGs by their game creators. Our in-depth studies reveal a new understanding of this problem and the urgent need for automatically flagging illicit UGCG promotions. We additionally create a cutting-edge system, UGCG-Guard, designed to aid social media platforms in effectively identifying images used for illicit UGCG promotions. This system leverages recently introduced large vision-language models (VLMs) and employs a novel conditional prompting strategy for zero-shot domain adaptation, along with chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning for contextual identification. UGCG-Guard achieves outstanding results, with an accuracy rate of 94% in detecting these images used for the illicit promotion of such games in real-world scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>To Ap...</summary><p>To Appear in the 33rd USENIX Security Symposium, August 14-16, 2024</p></details> |

Thus, in this research, we aim to create a taxonomy to conceptualize a comprehensive overview of the constituting characteristics that define RAG applications, facilitating the adoption of this technology in the IS community. To the best of our knowledge, no RAG application taxonomies have been developed so far. We describe our methodology for developing the taxonomy, which includes the criteria for selecting papers, an explanation of our rationale for employing a Large Language Model (LLM)-supported approach to extract and identify initial characteristics, and a concise overview of our systematic process for conceptualizing the taxonomy. Our systematic taxonomy development process includes four iterative phases designed to refine and enhance our understanding and presentation of RAG's core dimensions. We have developed a total of five meta-dimensions and sixteen dimensions to comprehensively capture the concept of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) applications. When discussing our findings, we also detail the specific research areas and pose key research questions to guide future information system researchers as they explore the emerging topics of RAG systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Review-driven Personalized Preference Reasoning with Large Language Models for Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06276v1)** | 2024-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional performance across a wide range of tasks, generating significant interest in their application to recommendation systems. However, existing methods have not fully capitalized on the potential of LLMs, often constrained by limited input information or failing to fully utilize their advanced reasoning capabilities. To address these limitations, we introduce EXP3RT, a novel LLM-based recommender designed to leverage rich preference information contained in user and item reviews. EXP3RT is basically fine-tuned through distillation from a teacher LLM to perform three key tasks in order: EXP3RT first extracts and encapsulates essential subjective preferences from raw reviews, aggregates and summarizes them according to specific criteria to create user and item profiles. It then generates detailed step-by-step reasoning followed by predicted rating, i.e., reasoning-enhanced rating prediction, by considering both subjective and objective information from user/item profiles and item descriptions. This personalized preference reasoning from EXP3RT enhances rating prediction accuracy and also provides faithful and reasonable explanations for recommendation. Extensive experiments show that EXP3RT outperforms existing methods on both rating prediction and candidate item reranking for top-k recommendation, while significantly enhancing the explainability of recommendation systems.</p></details> |  |

However, many LLMs exhibit significant performance discrepancies between high- and low-resource languages. To mitigate this challenge, we present FuxiTranyu, an open-source multilingual LLM, which is designed to satisfy the need of the research community for balanced and high-performing multilingual capabilities. FuxiTranyu-8B, the base model with 8 billion parameters, is trained from scratch on a meticulously balanced multilingual data repository that contains 600 billion tokens covering 43 natural languages and 16 programming languages. In addition to the base model, we also develop two instruction-tuned models: FuxiTranyu-8B-SFT that is fine-tuned on a diverse multilingual instruction dataset, and FuxiTranyu-8B-DPO that is further refined with DPO on a preference dataset for enhanced alignment ability. Extensive experiments on a wide range of multilingual benchmarks demonstrate the competitive performance of FuxiTranyu against existing multilingual LLMs, e.g., BLOOM-7B, PolyLM-13B, Llama-2-Chat-7B and Mistral-7B-Instruct. Interpretability analyses at both the neuron and representation level suggest that FuxiTranyu is able to learn consistent multilingual representations across different languages. To promote further research into multilingual LLMs and their working mechanisms, we release both the base and instruction-tuned FuxiTranyu models together with 58 pretraining checkpoints at HuggingFace and Github.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Large-Scale Study of Model Integration in ML-Enabled Software Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06226v1)** | 2024-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rise of machine learning (ML) and its embedding in systems has drastically changed the engineering of software-intensive systems. Traditionally, software engineering focuses on manually created artifacts such as source code and the process of creating them, as well as best practices for integrating them, i.e., software architectures. In contrast, the development of ML artifacts, i.e. ML models, comes from data science and focuses on the ML models and their training data. However, to deliver value to end users, these ML models must be embedded in traditional software, often forming complex topologies. In fact, ML-enabled software can easily incorporate many different ML models. While the challenges and practices of building ML-enabled systems have been studied to some extent, beyond isolated examples, little is known about the characteristics of real-world ML-enabled systems. Properly embedding ML models in systems so that they can be easily maintained or reused is far from trivial. We need to improve our empirical understanding of such systems, which we address by presenting the first large-scale study of real ML-enabled software systems, covering over 2,928 open source systems on GitHub. We classified and analyzed them to determine their characteristics, as well as their practices for reusing ML models and related code, and the architecture of these systems. Our findings provide practitioners and researchers with insight into practices for embedding and integrating ML models, bringing data science and software engineering closer together.</p></details> |  |
| **[On Effects of Steering Latent Representation for Large Language Model Unlearning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06223v1)** | 2024-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Representation Misdirection for Unlearning (RMU), which steers model representation in the intermediate layer to a target random representation, is an effective method for large language model (LLM) unlearning. Despite its high performance, the underlying cause and explanation remain underexplored. In this paper, we first theoretically demonstrate that steering forget representations in the intermediate layer reduces token confidence, causing LLMs to generate wrong or nonsense responses. Second, we investigate how the coefficient influences the alignment of forget-sample representations with the random direction and hint at the optimal coefficient values for effective unlearning across different network layers. Third, we show that RMU unlearned models are robust against adversarial jailbreak attacks. Last, our empirical analysis shows that RMU is less effective when applied to the middle and later layers in LLMs. To resolve this drawback, we propose Adaptive RMU -- a simple yet effective alternative method that makes unlearning effective with most layers. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Adaptive RMU significantly improves the unlearning performance compared to prior art while incurring no additional computational cost.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 5 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |
| **[Private Fine-tuning of Large Language Models with Zeroth-order Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04343v2)** | 2024-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD) allows models to be trained in a privacy-preserving manner, but has proven difficult to scale to the era of foundation models. We introduce DP-ZO, a private fine-tuning framework for large language models by privatizing zeroth order optimization methods. A key insight into the design of our method is that the direction of the gradient in the zeroth-order optimization we use is random and the only information from training data is the step size, i.e., a scalar. Therefore, we only need to privatize the scalar step size, which is memory-efficient. DP-ZO provides a strong privacy-utility trade-off across different tasks, and model sizes that are comparable to DP-SGD in $(\varepsilon,\delta)$-DP. Notably, DP-ZO possesses significant advantages over DP-SGD in memory efficiency, and obtains higher utility in $\varepsilon$-DP when using the Laplace mechanism.</p></details> |  |

However, these systems are often viewed as outdated, requiring extensive maintenance and modernization. Addressing this challenge necessitates innovative tools that can understand and interact with legacy codebases. To this end, we introduce XMainframe, a state-of-the-art large language model (LLM) specifically designed with knowledge of mainframe legacy systems and COBOL codebases. Our solution involves the creation of an extensive data collection pipeline to produce high-quality training datasets, enhancing XMainframe's performance in this specialized domain. Additionally, we present MainframeBench, a comprehensive benchmark for assessing mainframe knowledge, including multiple-choice questions, question answering, and COBOL code summarization. Our empirical evaluations demonstrate that XMainframe consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art LLMs across these tasks. Specifically, XMainframe achieves 30% higher accuracy than DeepSeek-Coder on multiple-choice questions, doubles the BLEU score of Mixtral-Instruct 8x7B on question answering, and scores six times higher than GPT-3.5 on COBOL summarization. Our work highlights the potential of XMainframe to drive significant advancements in managing and modernizing legacy systems, thereby enhancing productivity and saving time for software developers.</p></details> |  |

However, most current work only addresses this issue from a technical point of view, e.g., improving current methods relying on reinforcement learning from human feedback, neglecting what it means and is required for alignment to occur. Here, we propose to distinguish strong and weak value alignment. Strong alignment requires cognitive abilities (either human-like or different from humans) such as understanding and reasoning about agents' intentions and their ability to causally produce desired effects. We argue that this is required for AI systems like large language models (LLMs) to be able to recognize situations presenting a risk that human values may be flouted. To illustrate this distinction, we present a series of prompts showing ChatGPT's, Gemini's and Copilot's failures to recognize some of these situations. We moreover analyze word embeddings to show that the nearest neighbors of some human values in LLMs differ from humans' semantic representations. We then propose a new thought experiment that we call "the Chinese room with a word transition dictionary", in extension of John Searle's famous proposal. We finally mention current promising research directions towards a weak alignment, which could produce statistically satisfying answers in a number of common situations, however so far without ensuring any truth value.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in Scientific Reports, special issue on AI aligment</p></details> |

However, LLMs still fail in many specific tasks although understand the task instruction. In this paper, we focus on the problem of boosting the ability of black-box LLMs to solve downstream tasks. We propose ExpNote, an automated framework to help LLMs better adapt to unfamiliar tasks through reflecting and noting experiences from training data and retrieving them from external memory during testing. We evaluate ExpNote on multiple tasks and the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves the performance of black-box LLMs. The data and code are available at https://github.com/forangel2014/ExpNote</p></details> | EMNLP 2023 findings |

Traditional module-based systems are constrained by cumulative errors among cascaded modules and inflexible pre-set rules. In contrast, end-to-end autonomous driving systems have the potential to avoid error accumulation due to their fully data-driven training process, although they often lack transparency due to their "black box" nature, complicating the validation and traceability of decisions. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated abilities including understanding context, logical reasoning, and generating answers. A natural thought is to utilize these abilities to empower autonomous driving. By combining LLM with foundation vision models, it could open the door to open-world understanding, reasoning, and few-shot learning, which current autonomous driving systems are lacking. In this paper, we systematically review a research line about \textit{Large Language Models for Autonomous Driving (LLM4AD)}. This study evaluates the current state of technological advancements, distinctly outlining the principal challenges and prospective directions for the field.

A prime example of the latter is misinformation, including conspiracy theories, which flood the web. Recent advances in natural language processing, particularly the emergence of large language models (LLMs), have improved the prospects of accurate misinformation detection. However, most LLM-based approaches to conspiracy theory detection focus only on binary classification and fail to account for the important relationship between misinformation and affective features (i.e., sentiment and emotions). Driven by a comprehensive analysis of conspiracy text that reveals its distinctive affective features, we propose ConspEmoLLM, the first open-source LLM that integrates affective information and is able to perform diverse tasks relating to conspiracy theories. These tasks include not only conspiracy theory detection, but also classification of theory type and detection of related discussion (e.g., opinions towards theories). ConspEmoLLM is fine-tuned based on an emotion-oriented LLM using our novel ConDID dataset, which includes five tasks to support LLM instruction tuning and evaluation. We demonstrate that when applied to these tasks, ConspEmoLLM largely outperforms several open-source general domain LLMs and ChatGPT, as well as an LLM that has been fine-tuned using ConDID, but which does not use affective features. This project will be released on https://github.com/lzw108/ConspEmoLLM/.</p></details> | Work in progress |

The quest for models that can seamlessly integrate and interpret multimodal data is more pressing than ever. Imagine a system that can understand language with the depth and nuance of human cognition, while simultaneously interpreting the rich visual context of the world around it. We present ARPA, an architecture that fuses the unparalleled contextual understanding of large language models with the advanced feature extraction capabilities of transformers, which then pass through a custom Graph Neural Network (GNN) layer to learn intricate relationships and subtle nuances within the data. This innovative architecture not only sets a new benchmark in visual word disambiguation but also introduces a versatile framework poised to transform how linguistic and visual data interact by harnessing the synergistic strengths of its components, ensuring robust performance even in the most complex disambiguation scenarios. Through a series of experiments and comparative analysis, we reveal the substantial advantages of our model, underscoring its potential to redefine standards in the field. Beyond its architectural prowess, our architecture excels through experimental enrichments, including sophisticated data augmentation and multi-modal training techniques. ARPA's introduction marks a significant milestone in visual word disambiguation, offering a compelling solution that bridges the gap between linguistic and visual modalities. We invite researchers and practitioners to explore the capabilities of our model, envisioning a future where such hybrid models drive unprecedented advancements in artificial intelligence.</p></details> |  |

Previous membership inference methods may be misled by similar examples in vast amounts of training data. Additionally, these methods are often too complex for general users to understand and use, making them centralized, lacking transparency, and trustworthiness. To address these issues, we propose an alternative \textit{insert-and-detection} methodology, advocating that web users and content platforms employ \textbf{\textit{unique identifiers}} for reliable and independent membership inference. Users and platforms can create their own identifiers, embed them in copyrighted text, and independently detect them in future LLMs. As an initial demonstration, we introduce \textit{ghost sentences}, a primitive form of unique identifiers, consisting primarily of passphrases made up of random words. By embedding one ghost sentences in a few copyrighted texts, users can detect its membership using a perplexity test and a \textit{user-friendly} last-$k$ words test. The perplexity test is based on the fact that LLMs trained on natural language should exhibit high perplexity when encountering unnatural passphrases. As the repetition increases, users can leverage the verbatim memorization ability of LLMs to perform a last-$k$ words test by chatting with LLMs without writing any code. Both tests offer rigorous statistical guarantees for membership inference. For LLaMA-13B, a perplexity test on 30 ghost sentences with an average of 7 repetitions in 148K examples yields a 0.891 ROC AUC. For the last-$k$ words test with OpenLLaMA-3B, 11 out of 16 users, with an average of 24 examples each, successfully identify their data from 1.8M examples.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint, work in progress</p></details> |

This has led to lawsuits against tech companies accused of using protected content without permission. Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) aim to detect whether specific documents were used in a given LLM pretraining, but their effectiveness is undermined by biases such as time-shifts and n-gram overlaps. This paper addresses the evaluation of MIAs on LLMs with partially inferable training sets, under the ex-post hypothesis, which acknowledges inherent distributional biases between members and non-members datasets. We propose and validate algorithms to create ``non-biased'' and ``non-classifiable'' datasets for fairer MIA assessment. Experiments using the Gutenberg dataset on OpenLamma and Pythia show that neutralizing known biases alone is insufficient. Our methods produce non-biased ex-post datasets with AUC-ROC scores comparable to those previously obtained on genuinely random datasets, validating our approach. Globally, MIAs yield results close to random, with only one being effective on both random and our datasets, but its performance decreases when bias is removed.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we address this limitation by introducing a novel research problem of contextual object detection -- understanding visible objects within different human-AI interactive contexts. Three representative scenarios are investigated, including the language cloze test, visual captioning, and question answering. Moreover, we present ContextDET, a unified multimodal model that is capable of end-to-end differentiable modeling of visual-language contexts, so as to locate, identify, and associate visual objects with language inputs for human-AI interaction. Our ContextDET involves three key submodels: (i) a visual encoder for extracting visual representations, (ii) a pre-trained LLM for multimodal context decoding, and (iii) a visual decoder for predicting bounding boxes given contextual object words. The new generate-then-detect framework enables us to detect object words within human vocabulary. Extensive experiments show the advantages of ContextDET on our proposed CODE benchmark, open-vocabulary detection, and referring image segmentation.

These datasets must accommodate diverse user interaction modes, including text and voice, each presenting unique modeling challenges. Knowledge Graphs (KGs), with their structured and evolving nature, offer an ideal foundation for current and precise knowledge. Although human-curated KG-based conversational datasets exist, they struggle to keep pace with the rapidly changing user information needs. We present ConvKGYarn, a scalable method for generating up-to-date and configurable conversational KGQA datasets. Qualitative psychometric analyses confirm our method can generate high-quality datasets rivaling a popular conversational KGQA dataset while offering it at scale and covering a wide range of human-interaction configurations. We showcase its utility by testing LLMs on diverse conversations - exploring model behavior on conversational KGQA sets with different configurations grounded in the same KG fact set. Our results highlight the ability of ConvKGYarn to improve KGQA foundations and evaluate parametric knowledge of LLMs, thus offering a robust solution to the constantly evolving landscape of conversational assistants.</p></details> |  |

Among these, brand-based phishing detection that uses models from Computer Vision to detect if a given webpage is imitating a well-known brand has received widespread attention. However, such models are costly and difficult to maintain, as they need to be retrained with labeled dataset that has to be regularly and continuously collected. Besides, they also need to maintain a good reference list of well-known websites and related meta-data for effective performance. In this work, we take steps to study the efficacy of large language models (LLMs), in particular the multimodal LLMs, in detecting phishing webpages. Given that the LLMs are pretrained on a large corpus of data, we aim to make use of their understanding of different aspects of a webpage (logo, theme, favicon, etc.) to identify the brand of a given webpage and compare the identified brand with the domain name in the URL to detect a phishing attack. We propose a two-phase system employing LLMs in both phases: the first phase focuses on brand identification, while the second verifies the domain. We carry out comprehensive evaluations on a newly collected dataset. Our experiments show that the LLM-based system achieves a high detection rate at high precision; importantly, it also provides interpretable evidence for the decisions. Our system also performs significantly better than a state-of-the-art brand-based phishing detection system while demonstrating robustness against two known adversarial attacks.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in eCrime 2024</p></details> |

Herein, we introduce Visual Tokens Withdrawal (VTW), a plug-and-play module to boost MLLMs for rapid inference. Our approach is inspired by two intriguing phenomena we have observed: (1) the attention sink phenomenon that is prevalent in LLMs also persists in MLLMs, suggesting that initial tokens and nearest tokens receive the majority of attention, while middle vision tokens garner minimal attention in deep layers; (2) the presence of information migration, which implies that visual information is transferred to subsequent text tokens within the first few layers of MLLMs. As per our findings, we conclude that vision tokens are unnecessary in the deep layers of MLLMs. Thus, we strategically withdraw them at a certain layer, enabling only text tokens to engage in subsequent layers. To pinpoint the ideal layer for VTW, we initially analyze a limited set of tiny datasets and choose the first layer that meets the Kullback-Leibler divergence criterion. Our VTW approach can cut computational overhead by over 40\% across diverse multimodal tasks while maintaining performance. Our code is released at \url{https://github.com/lzhxmu/VTW}.</p></details> |  |

Despite their impressive capabilities and growing complexity, a key question remains-the theoretical foundations of large language models (LLMs). What makes Transformer so effective for powering intelligent language applications, such as translation and coding? What underlies LLMs' ability for In-Context Learning (ICL)? How does the LoRA scheme enhance the fine-tuning of LLMs? And what supports the practicality of pruning LLMs? To address these critical questions and explore the technological strategies within LLMs, we leverage the Universal Approximation Theory (UAT) to offer a theoretical backdrop, shedding light on the mechanisms that underpin these advancements.</p></details> |  |

The flexible nature of these models allows them to be used for many applications. In this paper, we present a novel study of large language models used for the challenging task of time series anomaly detection. This problem entails two aspects novel for LLMs: the need for the model to identify part of the input sequence (or multiple parts) as anomalous; and the need for it to work with time series data rather than the traditional text input. We introduce sigllm, a framework for time series anomaly detection using large language models. Our framework includes a time-series-to-text conversion module, as well as end-to-end pipelines that prompt language models to perform time series anomaly detection. We investigate two paradigms for testing the abilities of large language models to perform the detection task. First, we present a prompt-based detection method that directly asks a language model to indicate which elements of the input are anomalies. Second, we leverage the forecasting capability of a large language model to guide the anomaly detection process. We evaluated our framework on 11 datasets spanning various sources and 10 pipelines. We show that the forecasting method significantly outperformed the prompting method in all 11 datasets with respect to the F1 score. Moreover, while large language models are capable of finding anomalies, state-of-the-art deep learning models are still superior in performance, achieving results 30% better than large language models.</p></details> |  |

Developing this approach, we find that large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-3 and LLaMA-2 can surprisingly zero-shot extrapolate time series at a level comparable to or exceeding the performance of purpose-built time series models trained on the downstream tasks. To facilitate this performance, we propose procedures for effectively tokenizing time series data and converting discrete distributions over tokens into highly flexible densities over continuous values. We argue the success of LLMs for time series stems from their ability to naturally represent multimodal distributions, in conjunction with biases for simplicity, and repetition, which align with the salient features in many time series, such as repeated seasonal trends. We also show how LLMs can naturally handle missing data without imputation through non-numerical text, accommodate textual side information, and answer questions to help explain predictions. While we find that increasing model size generally improves performance on time series, we show GPT-4 can perform worse than GPT-3 because of how it tokenizes numbers, and poor uncertainty calibration, which is likely the result of alignment interventions such as RLHF.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2023.

| **[LLM Reasoners: New Evaluation, Library, and Analysis of Step-by-Step Reasoning with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05221v2)** | 2024-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating accurate step-by-step reasoning is essential for Large Language Models (LLMs) to address complex problems and enhance robustness and interpretability. Despite the flux of research on developing advanced reasoning approaches, systematically analyzing the diverse LLMs and reasoning strategies in generating reasoning chains remains a significant challenge. The difficulties stem from the lack of two key elements: (1) an automatic method for evaluating the generated reasoning chains on different tasks, and (2) a unified formalism and implementation of the diverse reasoning approaches for systematic comparison. This paper aims to close the gap: (1) We introduce AutoRace for fully automated reasoning chain evaluation. Existing metrics rely on expensive human annotations or pre-defined LLM prompts not adaptable to different tasks. In contrast, AutoRace automatically creates detailed evaluation criteria tailored for each task, and uses GPT-4 for accurate evaluation following the criteria.

Despite their success, they also have inherent limitations such as a lack of up-to-date knowledge and hallucination. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a state-of-the-art technique to mitigate these limitations. The key idea of RAG is to ground the answer generation of an LLM on external knowledge retrieved from a knowledge database. Existing studies mainly focus on improving the accuracy or efficiency of RAG, leaving its security largely unexplored. We aim to bridge the gap in this work. We find that the knowledge database in a RAG system introduces a new and practical attack surface. Based on this attack surface, we propose PoisonedRAG, the first knowledge corruption attack to RAG, where an attacker could inject a few malicious texts into the knowledge database of a RAG system to induce an LLM to generate an attacker-chosen target answer for an attacker-chosen target question. We formulate knowledge corruption attacks as an optimization problem, whose solution is a set of malicious texts. Depending on the background knowledge (e.g., black-box and white-box settings) of an attacker on a RAG system, we propose two solutions to solve the optimization problem, respectively. Our results show PoisonedRAG could achieve a 90% attack success rate when injecting five malicious texts for each target question into a knowledge database with millions of texts. We also evaluate several defenses and our results show they are insufficient to defend against PoisonedRAG, highlighting the need for new defenses.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in USENIX Security Symposium 2025.

One powerful tool in the arsenal of cybersecurity professionals is the attack graph, a representation of all potential attack paths within a system that an adversary might exploit to achieve a certain objective. Traditional methods of generating attack graphs involve expert knowledge, manual curation, and computational algorithms that might not cover the entire threat landscape due to the ever-evolving nature of vulnerabilities and exploits. This paper explores the approach of leveraging large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, to automate the generation of attack graphs by intelligently chaining Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) based on their preconditions and effects. It also shows how to utilize LLMs to create attack graphs from threat reports.</p></details> |  |

However, there is limited attention to end-to-end pre-training methods based on a hybrid architecture of CNN and Transformer, which can learn strong local and global representations simultaneously. To address this issue, we propose a generative pre-training strategy called Hybrid Sparse masKing (HySparK) based on masked image modeling and apply it to large-scale pre-training on medical images. First, we perform a bottom-up 3D hybrid masking strategy on the encoder to keep consistency masking. Then we utilize sparse convolution for the top CNNs and encode unmasked patches for the bottom vision Transformers. Second, we employ a simple hierarchical decoder with skip-connections to achieve dense multi-scale feature reconstruction. Third, we implement our pre-training method on a collection of multiple large-scale 3D medical imaging datasets. Extensive experiments indicate that our proposed pre-training strategy demonstrates robust transfer-ability in supervised downstream tasks and sheds light on HySparK's promising prospects.

| **[CodexGraph: Bridging Large Language Models and Code Repositories via Code Graph Databases](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03910v2)** | 2024-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in stand-alone code tasks like HumanEval and MBPP, but struggle with handling entire code repositories. This challenge has prompted research on enhancing LLM-codebase interaction at a repository scale. Current solutions rely on similarity-based retrieval or manual tools and APIs, each with notable drawbacks. Similarity-based retrieval often has low recall in complex tasks, while manual tools and APIs are typically task-specific and require expert knowledge, reducing their generalizability across diverse code tasks and real-world applications. To mitigate these limitations, we introduce CodexGraph, a system that integrates LLM agents with graph database interfaces extracted from code repositories. By leveraging the structural properties of graph databases and the flexibility of the graph query language, CodexGraph enables the LLM agent to construct and execute queries, allowing for precise, code structure-aware context retrieval and code navigation. We assess CodexGraph using three benchmarks: CrossCodeEval, SWE-bench, and EvoCodeBench. Additionally, we develop five real-world coding applications. With a unified graph database schema, CodexGraph demonstrates competitive performance and potential in both academic and real-world environments, showcasing its versatility and efficacy in software engineering.

| **[Kernel Density Estimators in Large Dimensions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05807v1)** | 2024-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper studies Kernel density estimation for a high-dimensional distribution $\rho(x)$. Traditional approaches have focused on the limit of large number of data points $n$ and fixed dimension $d$. We analyze instead the regime where both the number $n$ of data points $y_i$ and their dimensionality $d$ grow with a fixed ratio $\alpha=(\log n)/d$. Our study reveals three distinct statistical regimes for the kernel-based estimate of the density $\hat \rho_h^{\mathcal {D}}(x)=\frac{1}{n h^d}\sum_{i=1}^n K\left(\frac{x-y_i}{h}\right)$, depending on the bandwidth $h$: a classical regime for large bandwidth where the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) holds, which is akin to the one found in traditional approaches. Below a certain value of the bandwidth, $h_{CLT}(\alpha)$, we find that the CLT breaks down. The statistics of $\hat \rho_h^{\mathcal {D}}(x)$ for a fixed $x$ drawn from $\rho(x)$ is given by a heavy-tailed distribution (an alpha-stable distribution). In particular below a value $h_G(\alpha)$, we find that $\hat \rho_h^{\mathcal {D}}(x)$ is governed by extreme value statistics: only a few points in the database matter and give the dominant contribution to the density estimator. We provide a detailed analysis for high-dimensional multivariate Gaussian data. We show that the optimal bandwidth threshold based on Kullback-Leibler divergence lies in the new statistical regime identified in this paper. Our findings reveal limitations of classical approaches, show the relevance of these new statistical regimes, and offer new insights for Kernel density estimation in high-dimensional settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[C2P: Featuring Large Language Models with Causal Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18069v2)** | 2024-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Causal reasoning is the primary bottleneck that Large Language Models (LLMs) must overcome to attain human-level intelligence. To address this, we introduce the Causal Chain of Prompting (C2P) as the first reasoning framework that equips current LLMs with causal reasoning capabilities. C2P operates autonomously, avoiding reliance on external tools or modules during both the causal learning and reasoning phases, and can be seamlessly implemented during the training or fine-tuning of LLMs. Experimental results across various benchmark datasets demonstrate a significant improvement in causal learning and subsequent reasoning accuracy of LLMs. We illustrate how C2P enhances LLMs' ability to causally reason in real-world scenarios, addressing complex problems in fields such as healthcare, medicine, economics, education, social sciences, environmental science, and marketing. With few-shot learning, GPT-4 Turbo using C2P with as few as six examples achieves significant performance improvements, boasting over a 33% increase in reasoning accuracy over the most state-of-the-art LLMs, which perform nearly randomly in similar circumstances. This demonstrates the transformative potential of integrating C2P into LLM training or fine-tuning processes, thereby empowering these models with advanced causal reasoning capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2306.05836 by other authors</p></details> |

However, writing SQL queries requires specialized knowledge, which poses a challenge for non-professional users trying to access and query databases. Text-to-SQL parsing solves this issue by converting natural language queries into SQL queries, thus making database access more accessible for non-expert users. To take advantage of the recent developments in Large Language Models (LLMs), a range of new methods have emerged, with a primary focus on prompt engineering and fine-tuning. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of LLMs in text-to-SQL tasks, discussing benchmark datasets, prompt engineering, fine-tuning methods, and future research directions. We hope this review will enable readers to gain a broader understanding of the recent advances in this field and offer some insights into its future trajectory.</p></details> |  |
| **[UNK-VQA: A Dataset and a Probe into the Abstention Ability of Multi-modal Large Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10942v5)** | 2024-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Teaching Visual Question Answering (VQA) models to refrain from answering unanswerable questions is necessary for building a trustworthy AI system. Existing studies, though have explored various aspects of VQA but somewhat ignored this particular attribute. This paper aims to bridge the research gap by contributing a comprehensive dataset, called UNK-VQA. The dataset is specifically designed to address the challenge of questions that models do not know. To this end, we first augment the existing data via deliberate perturbations on either the image or question. In specific, we carefully ensure that the question-image semantics remain close to the original unperturbed distribution. By this means, the identification of unanswerable questions becomes challenging, setting our dataset apart from others that involve mere image replacement. We then extensively evaluate the zero- and few-shot performance of several emerging multi-modal large models and discover their significant limitations when applied to our dataset. Additionally, we also propose a straightforward method to tackle these unanswerable questions. This dataset, we believe, will serve as a valuable benchmark for enhancing the abstention capability of VQA models, thereby leading to increased trustworthiness of AI systems. We have made the dataset (https://github.com/guoyang9/UNK-VQA) available to facilitate further exploration in this area.</p></details> | Accepted by TPAMI |
| **[Reference-free Hallucination Detection for Large Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05767v1)** | 2024-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have made significant progress in recent years. While LVLMs exhibit excellent ability in language understanding, question answering, and conversations of visual inputs, they are prone to producing hallucinations. While several methods are proposed to evaluate the hallucinations in LVLMs, most are reference-based and depend on external tools, which complicates their practical application. To assess the viability of alternative methods, it is critical to understand whether the reference-free approaches, which do not rely on any external tools, can efficiently detect hallucinations. Therefore, we initiate an exploratory study to demonstrate the effectiveness of different reference-free solutions in detecting hallucinations in LVLMs. In particular, we conduct an extensive study on three kinds of techniques: uncertainty-based, consistency-based, and supervised uncertainty quantification methods on four representative LVLMs across two different tasks. The empirical results show that the reference-free approaches are capable of effectively detecting non-factual responses in LVLMs, with the supervised uncertainty quantification method outperforming the others, achieving the best performance across different settings.</p></details> |  |

Image modalities, enriched with profound semantic information and a more continuous mathematical nature compared to other modalities, greatly enhance the functionalities of MLLMs when integrated. However, this integration serves as a double-edged sword, providing attackers with expansive vulnerabilities to exploit for highly covert and harmful attacks. The pursuit of reliable AI systems like powerful MLLMs has emerged as a pivotal area of contemporary research. In this paper, we endeavor to demostrate the multifaceted risks associated with the incorporation of image modalities into MLLMs. Initially, we delineate the foundational components and training processes of MLLMs. Subsequently, we construct a threat model, outlining the security vulnerabilities intrinsic to MLLMs. Moreover, we analyze and summarize existing scholarly discourses on MLLMs' attack and defense mechanisms, culminating in suggestions for the future research on MLLM security. Through this comprehensive analysis, we aim to deepen the academic understanding of MLLM security challenges and propel forward the development of trustworthy MLLM systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 1 figure.

In this context, large language models (LLMs) have become a key technology to improve efficiency and promote intelligent progress in the power sector with their excellent natural language processing, logical reasoning, and generalization capabilities. Despite their potential, the absence of a performance evaluation benchmark for LLM in the power sector has limited the effective application of these technologies. Addressing this gap, our study introduces "ElecBench", an evaluation benchmark of LLMs within the power sector. ElecBench aims to overcome the shortcomings of existing evaluation benchmarks by providing comprehensive coverage of sector-specific scenarios, deepening the testing of professional knowledge, and enhancing decision-making precision. The framework categorizes scenarios into general knowledge and professional business, further divided into six core performance metrics: factuality, logicality, stability, security, fairness, and expressiveness, and is subdivided into 24 sub-metrics, offering profound insights into the capabilities and limitations of LLM applications in the power sector. To ensure transparency, we have made the complete test set public, evaluating the performance of eight LLMs across various scenarios and metrics. ElecBench aspires to serve as the standard benchmark for LLM applications in the power sector, supporting continuous updates of scenarios, metrics, and models to drive technological progress and application.</p></details> |  |
| **[Lifelong Personalized Low-Rank Adaptation of Large Language Models for Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03533v2)** | 2024-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We primarily focus on the field of large language models (LLMs) for recommendation, which has been actively explored recently and poses a significant challenge in effectively enhancing recommender systems with logical reasoning abilities and open-world knowledge. Current mainstream efforts mainly center around injecting personalized information from recommendation models into LLMs by customizing input templates or aligning representations between semantic and recommendation spaces at the prediction layer. However, they face three significant limitations: (1) LoRA is mostly used as a core component in existing works, but personalization is not well established in LoRA parameters as the LoRA matrix shared by every user may not cater to different users' characteristics, leading to suboptimal performance. (2) Although lifelong personalized behavior sequences are ideal for personalization, their use raises effectiveness and efficiency issues since LLMs require escalating training and inference time to extend text lengths. (3) Existing approaches aren't scalable for large datasets due to training efficiency constraints. Thus, LLMs only see a small fraction of the datasets (e.g., less than 10%) instead of the whole datasets, limiting their exposure to the full training space. To address these problems, we propose RecLoRA. This model incorporates a Personalized LoRA module that maintains independent LoRAs for different users and a Long-Short Modality Retriever that retrieves different history lengths for different modalities, significantly improving performance while adding minimal time cost. Furthermore, we design a Few2Many Learning Strategy, using a conventional recommendation model as a lens to magnify small training spaces to full spaces. Extensive experiments on public datasets demonstrate the efficacy of our RecLoRA compared to existing baseline models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hotfixing Large Language Models for Cod](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05727v1)** | 2024-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models for Code (LLM4Code) have become an integral part of developers' workflows, assisting with tasks such as code completion and generation. However, these models are found to exhibit undesired behaviors after their release, like generating buggy code, due to their extensive training on vast amounts of source code that contain such buggy code. The training data (usually coming from open-source software) keeps evolving, e.g., developers fix the buggy code. However, adapting such evolution to mitigate LLM4Code's undesired behaviors is non-trivial, as retraining models on the updated dataset usually takes much time and resources. This motivates us to propose the concept of hotfixing LLM4Code, mitigating LLM4Code's undesired behaviors effectively and efficiently with minimal negative effects. This paper mainly focuses on hotfixing LLM4Code to make them generate less buggy code and more fixed code. We begin by demonstrating that models from the popular CodeGen family frequently generate buggy code. Then, we define three learning objectives in hotfixing and design multiple loss functions for each objective: (1) learn the desired behaviors, (2) unlearn the undesired behaviors, and (3) retain knowledge of other code. We evaluate four different fine-tuning techniques for hotfixing the models and gain the following insights. Optimizing these three learning goals together, using LoRA (low-rank adaptation), effectively influences the model's behavior. Specifically, it increases the generation of fixed code by up to 108.42% and decreases the generation of buggy code by up to 50.47%. Statistical tests confirm that hotfixing does not significantly affect the models' functional correctness on the HumanEval benchmark. We also show that hotfixing demonstrates strong time efficiency.</p></details> | work in progress |

Recent efforts primarily focus on scaling up training datasets (i.e., charts, data tables, and question-answer (QA) pairs) through data collection and synthesis. However, our empirical study on existing MLLMs and CQA datasets reveals notable gaps. First, current data collection and synthesis focus on data volume and lack consideration of fine-grained visual encodings and QA tasks, resulting in unbalanced data distribution divergent from practical CQA scenarios. Second, existing work follows the training recipe of the base MLLMs initially designed for natural images, under-exploring the adaptation to unique chart characteristics, such as rich text elements. To fill the gap, we propose a visualization-referenced instruction tuning approach to guide the training dataset enhancement and model development. Specifically, we propose a novel data engine to effectively filter diverse and high-quality data from existing datasets and subsequently refine and augment the data using LLM-based generation techniques to better align with practical QA tasks and visual encodings. Then, to facilitate the adaptation to chart characteristics, we utilize the enriched data to train an MLLM by unfreezing the vision encoder and incorporating a mixture-of-resolution adaptation strategy for enhanced fine-grained recognition. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our approach. Even with fewer training examples, our model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art CQA models on established benchmarks. We also contribute a dataset split as a benchmark for future research. Source codes and datasets of this paper are available at https://github.com/zengxingchen/ChartQA-MLLM.</p></details> | 11 pages, 7 figures |

An Investigation into Limitations and Scalability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15720v2)** | 2024-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for many AI problems and exhibit remarkable in-context learning (ICL) capabilities. Compositional ability, solving unseen complex tasks that combine two or more simple tasks, is an essential reasoning ability for Artificial General Intelligence. Despite the tremendous success of LLMs, how they approach composite tasks, especially those not encountered during the pretraining phase, remains an open and largely underexplored question. In this study, we delve into the ICL capabilities of LLMs on composite tasks, with only simple tasks as in-context examples. We develop a test suite of composite tasks including linguistic and logical challenges and perform empirical studies across different LLM families. We observe that models exhibit divergent behaviors: (1) For simpler composite tasks that apply distinct mapping mechanisms to different input segments, the models demonstrate decent compositional ability, while scaling up the model enhances this ability; (2) for more complex composite tasks involving reasoning multiple steps, where each step represents one task, models typically underperform, and scaling up generally provides no improvements. We offer theoretical analysis in a simplified setting, explaining that models exhibit compositional capability when the task handles different input parts separately. We believe our work sheds new light on the capabilities of LLMs in solving composite tasks regarding the nature of the tasks and model scale.

| **[A Moment-assisted Approach for Improving Subsampling-based MLE with Large-scale data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09872v3)** | 2024-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The maximum likelihood estimation is computationally demanding for large datasets, particularly when the likelihood function includes integrals. Subsampling can reduce the computational burden, but it often results in efficiency loss. This paper proposes a moment-assisted subsampling (MAS) method that can improve the estimation efficiency of existing subsampling-based maximum likelihood estimators. The motivation behind this approach stems from the fact that sample moments can be efficiently computed even if the sample size of the whole data set is huge. Through the generalized method of moments, the proposed method incorporates informative sample moments of the whole data. The MAS estimator can be computed rapidly and is asymptotically normal with a smaller asymptotic variance than the corresponding estimator without incorporating sample moments of the whole data. The asymptotic variance of the proposed estimator depends on the specific sample moments incorporated. We derive the optimal moment that minimizes the resulting asymptotic variance in terms of Loewner order. The proposed MAS estimator can achieve the same estimation efficiency as the whole data-based estimator when the optimal moment is incorporated. Numerical results demonstrate the promising performance of the proposed method in both estimation and computational efficiency compared with existing subsampling methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large Language Model Tokenizer Bias: A Case Study and Solution on GPT-4o](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11214v2)** | 2024-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-4 and GPT-4o, have shown exceptional performance, especially in languages with abundant resources like English, thanks to extensive datasets that ensure robust training. Conversely, these models exhibit limitations when processing under-resourced languages such as Chinese and Korean, where issues including hallucinatory responses remain prevalent. This paper traces the roots of these disparities to the tokenization process inherent to these models. Specifically, it explores how the tokenizer vocabulary, often used to speed up the tokenization process and reduce tokens but constructed independently of the actual model training data, inadequately represents non-English languages. This misrepresentation results in the propagation of 'under-trained' or 'untrained' tokens, which perpetuate biases and pose serious concerns related to data security and ethical standards. We aim to dissect the tokenization mechanics of GPT-4o, illustrating how its simplified token-handling methods amplify these risks and offer strategic solutions to mitigate associated security and ethical issues. Through this study, we emphasize the critical need to rethink tokenization frameworks to foster more equitable and secure AI technologies.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 3 figures, and 5 tables</p></details> |

Unlike traditional heuristic or machine learning models that rely on static features and struggle to adapt to new threats and deep learning models that are computationally intensive, our model utilizes the advanced language processing capabilities of LLMs to learn granular features that are characteristic of phishing attacks. Furthermore, PhishLang operates with minimal data preprocessing and offers performance comparable to leading deep learning tools, while being significantly faster and less resource-intensive. Over a 3.5-month testing period, PhishLang successfully identified approximately 26K phishing URLs, many of which were undetected by popular antiphishing blocklists, thus demonstrating its potential to aid current detection measures. We also evaluate PhishLang against several realistic adversarial attacks and develop six patches that make it very robust against such threats. Furthermore, we integrate PhishLang with GPT-3.5 Turbo to create \textit{explainable blocklisting} - warnings that provide users with contextual information about different features that led to a website being marked as phishing. Finally, we have open-sourced the PhishLang framework and developed a Chromium-based browser extension and URL scanner website, which implement explainable warnings for end-users.</p></details> |  |

We discover that traditional continual training results in severe catastrophic forgetting, failing to outperform a zero-shot segmentation baseline. We introduce a novel training-free strategy, kNN-CLIP, which augments the model with a database of instance embeddings for semantic and panoptic segmentation that achieves zero forgetting. We demonstrate that kNN-CLIP can adapt to continually growing vocabularies without the need for retraining or large memory costs. kNN-CLIP enables open-vocabulary segmentation methods to expand their vocabularies on any domain with a single pass through the data, while only storing compact embeddings. This approach minimizes both compute and memory costs. kNN-CLIP achieves state-of-the-art performance across large-vocabulary semantic and panoptic segmentation datasets. We hope kNN-CLIP represents a significant step forward in enabling more efficient and adaptable continual segmentation, paving the way for advances in real-world large-vocabulary continual segmentation methods.</p></details> |  |

However, the development of deep learning models in this domain has been impeded by the scarcity of high-quality datasets. In this study, we construct a large, complex, and realistic safety clothing and helmet detection (SFCHD) dataset. SFCHD is derived from two authentic chemical plants, comprising 12,373 images, 7 categories, and 50,552 annotations. We partition the SFCHD dataset into training and testing sets with a ratio of 4:1 and validate its utility by applying several classic object detection algorithms. Furthermore, drawing inspiration from spatial and channel attention mechanisms, we design a spatial and channel attention-based low-light enhancement (SCALE) module. SCALE is a plug-and-play component with a high degree of flexibility. Extensive evaluations of the SCALE module on both the ExDark and SFCHD datasets have empirically demonstrated its efficacy in enhancing the performance of detectors under low-light conditions. The dataset and code are publicly available at https://github.com/lijfrank-open/SFCHD-SCALE.</p></details> | Submited |

However, LLMs still exhibit biases in evaluation and often struggle to generate coherent evaluations that align with human assessments. In this work, we first conduct a systematic study of the misalignment between LLM evaluators and human judgement, revealing that existing calibration methods aimed at mitigating biases are insufficient for effectively aligning LLM evaluators. Inspired by the use of preference data in RLHF, we formulate the evaluation as a ranking problem and introduce Pairwise-preference Search (PairS), an uncertainty-guided search method that employs LLMs to conduct pairwise comparisons and efficiently ranks candidate texts. PairS achieves state-of-the-art performance on representative evaluation tasks and demonstrates significant improvements over direct scoring. Furthermore, we provide insights into the role of pairwise preference in quantifying the transitivity of LLMs and demonstrate how PairS benefits from calibration.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by COLM 2024</p></details> |

Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) have emerged in recent years due to their strong video understanding capabilities. However, training and inference processes for VideoLLMs demand vast amounts of data, presenting significant challenges to data management, particularly regarding efficiency, robustness, and effectiveness. In this work, we present KeyVideoLLM, a text-video frame similarity-based keyframe selection method designed to manage VideoLLM data efficiently, robustly, and effectively. Specifically, KeyVideoLLM achieves a remarkable data compression rate of up to 60.9 times, substantially lowering disk space requirements, which proves its high efficiency. Additionally, it maintains a 100% selection success rate across all video formats and scales, enhances processing speed by up to 200 times compared to existing keyframe selection methods, and does not require hyperparameter tuning. Beyond its outstanding efficiency and robustness, KeyVideoLLM further improves model performance in video question-answering tasks during both training and inference stages. Notably, it consistently achieved the state-of-the-art (SoTA) experimental results on diverse datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Metacognitive Myopia in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05568v1)** | 2024-08-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit potentially harmful biases that reinforce culturally inherent stereotypes, cloud moral judgments, or amplify positive evaluations of majority groups. Previous explanations mainly attributed bias in LLMs to human annotators and the selection of training data. Consequently, they have typically been addressed with bottom-up approaches such as reinforcement learning or debiasing corpora. However, these methods only treat the effects of LLM biases by indirectly influencing the model architecture, but do not address the underlying causes in the computational process. Here, we propose metacognitive myopia as a cognitive-ecological framework that can account for a conglomerate of established and emerging LLM biases and provide a lever to address problems in powerful but vulnerable tools. Our theoretical framework posits that a lack of the two components of metacognition, monitoring and control, causes five symptoms of metacognitive myopia in LLMs: integration of invalid tokens and embeddings, susceptibility to redundant information, neglect of base rates in conditional computation, decision rules based on frequency, and inappropriate higher-order statistical inference for nested data structures. As a result, LLMs produce erroneous output that reaches into the daily high-stakes decisions of humans. By introducing metacognitive regulatory processes into LLMs, engineers and scientists can develop precise remedies for the underlying causes of these biases. Our theory sheds new light on flawed human-machine interactions and raises ethical concerns regarding the increasing, imprudent implementation of LLMs in organizational structures.</p></details> |  |

While large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 exhibit remarkable capabilities on natural language processing tasks, existing research indicates that their performance on chemistry tasks is discouragingly low. In this paper, however, we demonstrate that our developed LLMs can achieve very strong results on a comprehensive set of chemistry tasks, outperforming the most advanced GPT-4 and Claude 3 Opus by a substantial margin. To accomplish this, we propose SMolInstruct, a large-scale, comprehensive, and high-quality dataset for instruction tuning. It contains 14 selected chemistry tasks and over three million samples, laying a solid foundation for training and evaluating LLMs for chemistry. Using SMolInstruct, we fine-tune a set of open-source LLMs, among which, we find that Mistral serves as the best base model for chemistry tasks. Our analysis further demonstrates the critical role of the proposed dataset in driving the performance improvements.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by COLM 2024</p></details> |

Accurate prediction of key environmental variables over space and time can aid in informed policy and decision-making, thus improving people's livelihood. Recently, deep learning-based methods have shown promise in modeling the spatial-temporal relationships for predicting environmental variables. However, these approaches often fall short in handling incomplete features and distribution shifts, which are commonly observed in environmental data due to the substantial cost of data collection and malfunctions in measuring instruments. To address these issues, we propose LITE -- a multimodal large language model for environmental ecosystems modeling. Specifically, LITE unifies different environmental variables by transforming them into natural language descriptions and line graph images. Then, LITE utilizes unified encoders to capture spatial-temporal dynamics and correlations in different modalities. During this step, the incomplete features are imputed by a sparse Mixture-of-Experts framework, and the distribution shift is handled by incorporating multi-granularity information from past observations. Finally, guided by domain instructions, a language model is employed to fuse the multimodal representations for the prediction. Our experiments demonstrate that LITE significantly enhances performance in environmental spatial-temporal prediction across different domains compared to the best baseline, with a 41.25% reduction in prediction error. This justifies its effectiveness. Our data and code are available at https://github.com/hrlics/LITE.</p></details> | <details><summary>COLM ...</summary><p>COLM camera-ready version.

Among these cutting-edge developments, Google's Bard stands out for its remarkable multimodal capabilities, promoting comprehensive comprehension and reasoning across various domains. This work presents an early and holistic evaluation of LVLMs' multimodal abilities, with a particular focus on Bard, by proposing a lightweight variant of LVLM-eHub, named Tiny LVLM-eHub. In comparison to the vanilla version, Tiny LVLM-eHub possesses several appealing properties. Firstly, it provides a systematic assessment of six categories of multimodal capabilities, including visual perception, visual knowledge acquisition, visual reasoning, visual commonsense, object hallucination, and embodied intelligence, through quantitative evaluation of $42$ standard text-related visual benchmarks. Secondly, it conducts an in-depth analysis of LVLMs' predictions using the ChatGPT Ensemble Evaluation (CEE), which leads to a robust and accurate evaluation and exhibits improved alignment with human evaluation compared to the word matching approach. Thirdly, it comprises a mere $2.1$K image-text pairs, facilitating ease of use for practitioners to evaluate their own offline LVLMs. Through extensive experimental analysis, this study demonstrates that Bard outperforms previous LVLMs in most multimodal capabilities except object hallucination, to which Bard is still susceptible. Tiny LVLM-eHub serves as a baseline evaluation for various LVLMs and encourages innovative strategies aimed at advancing multimodal techniques.

This study delves into the capabilities of instruction-following LLMs for engaging with real-world graphs, aiming to offer empirical insights into how LLMs can effectively interact with graphs and generalize across graph tasks. We begin by constructing a dataset designed for instruction tuning, which comprises a diverse collection of 79 graph-related tasks from academic and e-commerce domains, featuring 44,240 training instances and 18,960 test samples. Utilizing this benchmark, our initial investigation focuses on identifying the optimal graph representation that serves as a conduit for LLMs to understand complex graph structures. Our findings indicate that JSON format for graph representation consistently outperforms natural language and code formats across various LLMs and graph types. Furthermore, we examine the key factors that influence the generalization abilities of instruction-tuned LLMs by evaluating their performance on both in-domain and out-of-domain graph tasks.</p></details> | COLM 2024 |

This achievement represents a significant step toward achieving artificial general intelligence (AGI). Despite these advancements, the effectiveness of LLMs often hinges on the specific prompting strategies employed, and there remains a lack of a robust framework to facilitate learning and generalization across diverse reasoning tasks. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel learning framework, THOUGHT-LIKE-PRO In this framework, we utilize imitation learning to imitate the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) process which is verified and translated from reasoning trajectories generated by a symbolic Prolog logic engine. This framework proceeds in a self-driven manner, that enables LLMs to formulate rules and statements from given instructions and leverage the symbolic Prolog engine to derive results. Subsequently, LLMs convert Prolog-derived successive reasoning trajectories into natural language CoT for imitation learning. Our empirical findings indicate that our proposed approach substantially enhances the reasoning abilities of LLMs and demonstrates robust generalization across out-of-distribution reasoning tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, their reliance on massive internet-sourced datasets for training brings notable privacy issues, which are exacerbated in critical domains (e.g., healthcare). Moreover, certain application-specific scenarios may require fine-tuning these models on private data. This survey critically examines the privacy threats associated with LLMs, emphasizing the potential for these models to memorize and inadvertently reveal sensitive information. We explore current threats by reviewing privacy attacks on LLMs and propose comprehensive solutions for integrating privacy mechanisms throughout the entire learning pipeline. These solutions range from anonymizing training datasets to implementing differential privacy during training or inference and machine unlearning after training. Our comprehensive review of existing literature highlights ongoing challenges, available tools, and future directions for preserving privacy in LLMs. This work aims to guide the development of more secure and trustworthy AI systems by providing a thorough understanding of privacy preservation methods and their effectiveness in mitigating risks.</p></details> | <details><summary>GitHu...</summary><p>GitHub repository: https://github.com/michele17284/Awesome-Privacy-Preserving-LLMs</p></details> |

Moving beyond conventional methods that employ a static top-k strategy for activating experts, AdaMoLE dynamically adjusts the activation threshold using a dedicated threshold network, adaptively responding to the varying complexities of different tasks. By replacing a single LoRA in a layer with multiple LoRA experts and integrating a gating function with the threshold mechanism, AdaMoLE effectively selects and activates the most appropriate experts based on the input context. Our extensive evaluations across a variety of commonsense reasoning and natural language processing tasks show that AdaMoLE exceeds baseline performance. This enhancement highlights the advantages of AdaMoLE's adaptive selection of LoRA experts, improving model effectiveness without a corresponding increase in the expert count. The experimental validation not only confirms AdaMoLE as a robust approach for enhancing LLMs but also suggests valuable directions for future research in adaptive expert selection mechanisms, potentially broadening the scope for optimizing model performance across diverse language processing tasks.</p></details> |  |

As direct search using the Dijkstra's algorithm results in a large search space, a plethora of complex-index-based approaches have been proposed to speedup the query processing. However, even with the current state-of-the-art approach, long query processing delays persist, along with significant space overhead and prohibitively long indexing time. In this paper, we depart from the complex index designs prevalent in existing literature and propose a simple index named KNN-Index. With KNN-Index, we can answer a kNN query optimally and progressively with small and size-bounded index. To improve the index construction performance, we propose a bidirectional construction algorithm which can effectively share the common computation during the construction. Theoretical analysis and experimental results on real road networks demonstrate the superiority of KNN-Index over the state-of-the-art approach in query processing performance, index size, and index construction efficiency.</p></details> | 15 pages, 15 figures |

However, existing toxicity benchmarks are overwhelmingly focused on English, posing serious risks to deploying LLMs in other languages. We address this by introducing PolygloToxicityPrompts (PTP), the first large-scale multilingual toxicity evaluation benchmark of 425K naturally occurring prompts spanning 17 languages. We overcome the scarcity of naturally occurring toxicity in web-text and ensure coverage across languages with varying resources by automatically scraping over 100M web-text documents. Using PTP, we investigate research questions to study the impact of model size, prompt language, and instruction and preference-tuning methods on toxicity by benchmarking over 60 LLMs. Notably, we find that toxicity increases as language resources decrease or model size increases. Although instruction- and preference-tuning reduce toxicity, the choice of preference-tuning method does not have any significant impact. Our findings shed light on crucial shortcomings of LLM safeguarding and highlight areas for future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to COLM 2024</p></details> |

As information curators for billions of users, LLMs must assess the accuracy and reliability of different sources. This paper audits eight widely used LLMs from three major providers -- OpenAI, Google, and Meta -- to evaluate their ability to discern credible and high-quality information sources from low-credibility ones. We find that while LLMs can rate most tested news outlets, larger models more frequently refuse to provide ratings due to insufficient information, whereas smaller models are more prone to hallucination in their ratings. For sources where ratings are provided, LLMs exhibit a high level of agreement among themselves (average Spearman's $\rho = 0.81$), but their ratings align only moderately with human expert evaluations (average $\rho = 0.59$). Analyzing news sources with different political leanings in the US, we observe a liberal bias in credibility ratings yielded by all LLMs in default configurations. Additionally, assigning partisan identities to LLMs consistently results in strong politically congruent bias in the ratings. These findings have important implications for the use of LLMs in curating news and political information.</p></details> | 11 pages, 8 figures |

In recent years, with the development of Vision Transformer (ViT) and self-supervised learning techniques, the performance of person ReID based on self-supervised pre-training has been greatly improved. Person ReID requires extracting highly discriminative local fine-grained features of the human body, while traditional ViT is good at extracting context-related global features, making it difficult to focus on local human body features. To this end, this article introduces the recently emerged Masked Image Modeling (MIM) self-supervised learning method into person ReID, and effectively extracts high-quality global and local features through large-scale unsupervised pre-training by combining masked image modeling and discriminative contrastive learning, and then conducts supervised fine-tuning training in the person ReID task. This person feature extraction method based on ViT with masked image modeling (PersonViT) has the good characteristics of unsupervised, scalable, and strong generalization capabilities, overcoming the problem of difficult annotation in supervised person ReID, and achieves state-of-the-art results on publicly available benchmark datasets, including MSMT17, Market1501, DukeMTMC-reID, and Occluded-Duke. The code and pre-trained models of the PersonViT method are released at https://github.com/hustvl/PersonViT to promote further research in the person ReID fie</p></details> |  |

However, SNPs often have weak effects on complex traits, leading to bias and low statistical efficiency in existing MR analysis due to weak instruments that are often used. The linkage disequilibrium (LD) among SNPs poses additional statistical hurdles. Specifically, existing MR methods often restrict analysis to independent SNPs via LD clumping and result in efficiency loss in estimating the causal effect. To address these issues, we propose the Debiased Estimating Equation Method (DEEM), a summary statistics-based MR approach that incorporates a large number of correlated weak-effect and invalid SNPs. DEEM not only effectively eliminates the weak IV bias but also improves the statistical efficiency of the causal effect estimation by leveraging information from many correlated SNPs. DEEM is a versatile method that allows for pleiotropic effects, adjusts for Winner's curse, and is applicable to both two-sample and one-sample MR analyses. Asymptotic analyses of the DEEM estimator demonstrate its attractive theoretical properties. Through extensive simulations and two real data examples, we demonstrate that DEEM improves the efficiency and robustness of MR analysis compared with existing methods.</p></details> |  |

With the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs), the very ability to open the black-box is increasingly limited especially when it comes to non-AI expert end-users. In this paper, we challenge the assumption of "opening" the black-box in the LLM era and argue for a shift in our XAI expectations. Highlighting the epistemic blind spots of an algorithm-centered XAI view, we argue that a human-centered perspective can be a path forward. We operationalize the argument by synthesizing XAI research along three dimensions: explainability outside the black-box, explainability around the edges of the black box, and explainability that leverages infrastructural seams. We conclude with takeaways that reflexively inform XAI as a domain.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACM HTTF 2024</p></details> |

Through comparative analyses across two studies, including various task performance outputs, we demonstrate that LLMs can serve as a reliable and even superior alternative to human raters in evaluating knowledge-based performance outputs, which are a key contribution of knowledge workers. Our results suggest that GPT ratings are comparable to human ratings but exhibit higher consistency and reliability. Additionally, combined multiple GPT ratings on the same performance output show strong correlations with aggregated human performance ratings, akin to the consensus principle observed in performance evaluation literature. However, we also find that LLMs are prone to contextual biases, such as the halo effect, mirroring human evaluative biases. Our research suggests that while LLMs are capable of extracting meaningful constructs from text-based data, their scope is currently limited to specific forms of performance evaluation. By highlighting both the potential and limitations of LLMs, our study contributes to the discourse on AI role in management studies and sets a foundation for future research to refine AI theoretical and practical applications in management.</p></details> | <details><summary>39 pa...</summary><p>39 pages, 8 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

Known for their expertise across diverse subject areas and quick adaptability to user-provided prompts, LLMs hold unique potential as Personalized Learning (PL) tools. Despite this potential, their application in K-12 education remains largely unexplored. This paper presents one of the first randomized controlled trials (n = 23) to evaluate the effectiveness of GPT-4 in personalizing educational science texts for middle school students. In this study, GPT-4 was used to profile student learning preferences based on choices made during a training session. For the experimental group, GPT-4 was used to rewrite science texts to align with the student's predicted profile while, for students in the control group, texts were rewritten to contradict their learning preferences. The results of a Mann-Whitney U test showed that students significantly preferred (at the .10 level) the rewritten texts when they were aligned with their profile (p = .059). These findings suggest that GPT-4 can effectively interpret and tailor educational content to diverse learner preferences, marking a significant advancement in PL technology. The limitations of this study and ethical considerations for using artificial intelligence in education are also discussed.</p></details> | 20 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Multi-Conditional Ranking with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00211v2)** | 2024-08-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Utilizing large language models (LLMs) to rank a set of items has become a common approach in recommendation and retrieval systems. Typically, these systems focus on ordering a substantial number of documents in a monotonic order based on a given query. However, real-world scenarios often present a different challenge: ranking a comparatively smaller set of items, but according to a variety of diverse and occasionally conflicting conditions. In this paper, we define and explore the task of multi-conditional ranking by introducing MCRank, a benchmark tailored for assessing multi-conditional ranking across various item types and conditions. Our analysis of LLMs using MCRank indicates a significant decrease in performance as the number and complexity of items and conditions grow. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel decomposed reasoning method, consisting of EXtracting and Sorting the conditions, and then Iteratively Ranking the items (EXSIR). Our extensive experiments show that this decomposed reasoning method enhances LLMs' performance significantly, achieving up to a 12% improvement over existing LLMs. We also provide a detailed analysis of LLMs performance across various condition categories, and examine the effectiveness of decomposition step. Furthermore, we compare our method with existing approaches such as Chain-of-Thought and existing ranking models, demonstrating the superiority of our approach and complexity of MCR task. We released our dataset and code.</p></details> |  |

POLARIS, a high-performance agent-based simulation platform, efficiently integrates advanced travel and freight demand modeling, dynamic traffic and transit assignment, and multimodal transportation simulation within a unified framework. We focus on POLARIS's transit routing, assignment, and simulation components, detailing its structural design and essential terminologies. We demonstrate how the model integrates upstream decision-making processes - activity generation, location and timing choices, and mode selection, particularly for transit-inclusive trips - followed by routing, assignment decisions, and the movement of travelers and vehicles within a multimodal network. This integration enables modeling of interactions among all agents, including travelers, vehicles, and transportation service providers. The study reviews literature on transportation system modeling tools, describes the transit modeling framework within POLARIS, and presents findings from large-scale analyses of various policy interventions. Results from numerical experiments reveal that measures such as congestion pricing, transit service improvements, first-mile-last-mile subsidies, increased e-commerce deliveries, and vehicle electrification significantly impact transit ridership, with some interactions between these levers exhibiting synergistic or canceling effects. The case study underscores the necessity of integrating transit modeling within a broader multimodal network simulation and decision-making context.</p></details> |  |

However, these techniques often suffer from high misclassification rates. Therefore, malicious code detection techniques could be enhanced by adopting advanced, more automated approaches to achieve high accuracy and a low misclassification rate. The goal of this study is to assist security analysts in detecting malicious packages through the empirical study of using Large Language Models (LLMs) to detect malicious code in the npm ecosystem. We present SecurityAI, a malicious code review workflow to detect malicious code using ChatGPT. We leverage a benchmark dataset of 5,115 npm packages, of which 2,180 packages have malicious code. We conducted a baseline comparison of GPT-3 and GPT- 4 models with the state-of-the-art CodeQL static analysis tool, using 39 custom CodeQL rules developed in prior research to detect malicious Javascript code. We compare the effectiveness of static analysis as a pre-screener with SecurityAI workflow, measuring the number of files that need to be analyzed and the associated costs. Additionally, we performed a qualitative study to understand the types of malicious packages detected or missed by our workflow. Our baseline comparison demonstrates a 16% and 9% improvement over static analysis in precision and F1 scores, respectively. We attained precision and F1 scores of 91% and 94% for GPT-3, and 99% & 97% for GPT-4, respectively, with GPT-3 offering a cost-effective balance. Pre-screening files with a static analyzer reduces the number of files requiring LLM analysis by 77.9% and decreases costs by 60.9% for GPT-3 and 76.1% for GPT-4.

In this paper, we introduce the Knowledge Graph Large Language Model (KG-LLM), a novel framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) for knowledge graph tasks. We first convert structured knowledge graph data into natural language and then use these natural language prompts to fine-tune LLMs to enhance multi-hop link prediction in KGs. By converting the KG to natural language prompts, our framework is designed to learn the latent representations of entities and their interrelations. To show the efficacy of the KG-LLM Framework, we fine-tune three leading LLMs within this framework, including Flan-T5, LLaMa2 and Gemma. Further, we explore the framework's potential to provide LLMs with zero-shot capabilities for handling previously unseen prompts. Experimental results show that KG-LLM significantly improves the models' generalization capabilities, leading to more accurate predictions in unfamiliar scenarios.</p></details> | 13 pages, 5 figures |

In our work, we address the challenges of scaling multi-modal hyperbolic models by orders of magnitude in terms of parameters (billions) and training complexity using the BLIP-2 architecture. Although hyperbolic embeddings offer potential insights into uncertainty not present in Euclidean embeddings, our analysis reveals that scaling these models is particularly difficult. We propose a novel training strategy for a hyperbolic version of BLIP-2, which allows to achieve comparable performance to its Euclidean counterpart, while maintaining stability throughout the training process and showing a meaningful indication of uncertainty with each embedding.</p></details> | <details><summary>ECCV ...</summary><p>ECCV 2024 - Beyond Euclidean Workshop</p></details> |

However, these models often suffer from the "hallucination problem", where outputs, though grammatically and logically coherent, lack factual accuracy or are entirely fabricated. A particularly troubling issue discovered and widely discussed recently is the numerical comparison error where multiple LLMs incorrectly infer that "9.11$>$9.9". We discovered that the order in which LLMs generate answers and reasoning impacts their consistency. Specifically, results vary significantly when an LLM generates an answer first and then provides the reasoning versus generating the reasoning process first and then the conclusion. Inspired by this, we propose a new benchmark method for assessing LLM consistency: comparing responses generated through these two different approaches. This benchmark effectively identifies instances where LLMs fabricate answers and subsequently generate justifications. Furthermore, we introduce a novel and straightforward prompt strategy designed to mitigate this issue. Experimental results demonstrate that this strategy improves performance across various LLMs compared to direct questioning. This work not only sheds light on a critical flaw in LLMs but also offers a practical solution to enhance their reliability.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, submitted to AAAI25</p></details> |

This study introduces a novel dataset named Img-Diff, designed to enhance fine-grained image recognition in MLLMs by leveraging insights from contrastive learning and image difference captioning. By analyzing object differences between similar images, we challenge models to identify both matching and distinct components. We utilize the Stable-Diffusion-XL model and advanced image editing techniques to create pairs of similar images that highlight object replacements. Our methodology includes a Difference Area Generator for object differences identifying, followed by a Difference Captions Generator for detailed difference descriptions. The result is a relatively small but high-quality dataset of "object replacement" samples. We use the the proposed dataset to finetune state-of-the-art (SOTA) MLLMs such as MGM-7B, yielding comprehensive improvements of performance scores over SOTA models that trained with larger-scale datasets, in numerous image difference and Visual Question Answering tasks. For instance, our trained models notably surpass the SOTA models GPT-4V and Gemini on the MMVP benchmark. Besides, we investigate alternative methods for generating image difference data through "object removal" and conduct a thorough evaluation to confirm the dataset's diversity, quality, and robustness, presenting several insights on the synthesis of such a contrastive dataset. To encourage further research and advance the field of multimodal data synthesis and enhancement of MLLMs' fundamental capabilities for image understanding, we release our codes and dataset at https://github.com/modelscope/data-juicer/tree/ImgDiff.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 9 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |

Traditional survival prediction models, relying on structured data, often lack precision. This study explores the potential of large language models (LLMs) to structure unstructured electronic health record (EHR) data, thereby improving survival prediction accuracy through comprehensive clinical information integration. Data from 34,276 patients treated with RT at Yonsei Cancer Center between 2013 and 2023 were analyzed, encompassing both structured and unstructured data. An open-source LLM was used to structure the unstructured EHR data via single-shot learning, with its performance compared against a domain-specific medical LLM and a smaller variant. Survival prediction models were developed using statistical, machine learning, and deep learning approaches, incorporating both structured and LLM-structured data. Clinical experts evaluated the accuracy of the LLM-structured data. The open-source LLM achieved 87.5% accuracy in structuring unstructured EHR data without additional training, significantly outperforming the domain-specific medical LLM, which reached only 35.8% accuracy. Larger LLMs were more effective, particularly in extracting clinically relevant features like general condition and disease extent, which closely correlated with patient survival. Incorporating LLM-structured clinical features into survival prediction models significantly improved accuracy, with the C-index of deep learning models increasing from 0.737 to 0.820. These models also became more interpretable by emphasizing clinically significant factors. This study shows that general-domain LLMs, even without specific medical training, can effectively structure large-scale unstructured EHR data, substantially enhancing the accuracy and interpretability of clinical predictive models.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 2 tables, 4 figures</p></details> |

However, privacy and computational requirements are problematic with commercial solutions and the use of LLMs. In this work, we focus on using LLMs with around 160 million parameters that are suitable for local execution and augmentation with retrieval from local projects. We train two models based on the transformer architecture, the generative model GPT-2 and the retrieval-adapted RETRO model, on open-source Python files, and empirically evaluate and compare them, confirming the benefits of vector embedding based retrieval. Further, we improve our models' performance with In-context retrieval-augmented generation, which retrieves code snippets based on the Jaccard similarity of tokens. We evaluate In-context retrieval-augmented generation on larger models and conclude that, despite its simplicity, the approach is more suitable than using the RETRO architecture. We highlight the key role of proper tokenization in achieving the full potential of LLMs in code completion.</p></details> | 28 pages, 14 figures |

Existing fusion methods primarily focus on the training mode that uses cross entropy on ground truth in a teacher-forcing setup to measure a model's advantage, which may provide limited insight towards model advantage. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach that enhances the fusion process by incorporating both the training and inference modes. Our method evaluates model advantage not only through cross entropy during training but also by considering inference outputs, providing a more comprehensive assessment. To combine the two modes effectively, we introduce ProFuser to progressively transition from inference mode to training mode. To validate ProFuser's effectiveness, we fused three models, including vicuna-7b-v1.5, Llama-2-7b-chat, and mpt-7b-8k-chat, and demonstrated the improved performance in knowledge, reasoning, and safety compared to baseline methods.</p></details> |  |

A large body of scholarship on LLM bias exists but it predominantly adopts a Western-centric frame and attends comparatively less to bias levels and potential harms in the Global South. In this paper, we quantify stereotypical bias in popular LLMs according to an Indian-centric frame through Indian-BhED, a first of its kind dataset, containing stereotypical and anti-stereotypical examples in the context of caste and religious stereotypes in India. We find that the majority of LLMs tested have a strong propensity to output stereotypes in the Indian context, especially when compared to axes of bias traditionally studied in the Western context, such as gender and race. Notably, we find that GPT-2, GPT-2 Large, and GPT 3.5 have a particularly high propensity for preferring stereotypical outputs as a percent of all sentences for the axes of caste (63-79%) and religion (69-72%). We finally investigate potential causes for such harmful behaviour in LLMs, and posit intervention techniques to reduce both stereotypical and anti-stereotypical biases. The findings of this work highlight the need for including more diverse voices when researching fairness in AI and evaluating LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be published in GoodIT '24, doi:10.1145/3677525.3678666. 14 pages</p></details> |

However, the extensive model size and high training and inference costs have hindered the widespread application of MLLMs in academia and industry. Thus, studying efficient and lightweight MLLMs has enormous potential, especially in edge computing scenarios. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive and systematic review of the current state of efficient MLLMs. Specifically, we summarize the timeline of representative efficient MLLMs, research state of efficient structures and strategies, and the applications.

| **[LLaVA-VSD: Large Language-and-Vision Assistant for Visual Spatial Description](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04957v1)** | 2024-08-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual Spatial Description (VSD) aims to generate texts that describe the spatial relationships between objects within images. Traditional visual spatial relationship classification (VSRC) methods typically output the spatial relationship between two objects in an image, often neglecting world knowledge and lacking general language capabilities. In this paper, we propose a Large Language-and-Vision Assistant for Visual Spatial Description, named LLaVA-VSD, which is designed for the classification, description, and open-ended description of visual spatial relationships. Specifically, the model first constructs a VSD instruction-following dataset using given figure-caption pairs for the three tasks. It then employs LoRA to fine-tune a Large Language and Vision Assistant for VSD, which has 13 billion parameters and supports high-resolution images. Finally, a large language model (Qwen-2) is used to refine the generated sentences, enhancing their diversity and accuracy. LLaVA-VSD demonstrates excellent multimodal conversational capabilities and can follow open-ended instructions to assist with inquiries about object relationships in images.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large Models for Aerial Edges: An Edge-Cloud Model Evolution and Communication Paradigm](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04927v1)** | 2024-08-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The future sixth-generation (6G) of wireless networks is expected to surpass its predecessors by offering ubiquitous coverage through integrated air-ground facility deployments in both communication and computing domains. In this network, aerial facilities, such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), conduct artificial intelligence (AI) computations based on multi-modal data to support diverse applications including surveillance and environment construction. However, these multi-domain inference and content generation tasks require large AI models, demanding powerful computing capabilities, thus posing significant challenges for UAVs. To tackle this problem, we propose an integrated edge-cloud model evolution framework, where UAVs serve as edge nodes for data collection and edge model computation. Through wireless channels, UAVs collaborate with ground cloud servers, providing cloud model computation and model updating for edge UAVs. With limited wireless communication bandwidth, the proposed framework faces the challenge of information exchange scheduling between the edge UAVs and the cloud server. To tackle this, we present joint task allocation, transmission resource allocation, transmission data quantization design, and edge model update design to enhance the inference accuracy of the integrated air-ground edge-cloud model evolution framework by mean average precision (mAP) maximization. A closed-form lower bound on the mAP of the proposed framework is derived, and the solution to the mAP maximization problem is optimized accordingly. Simulations, based on results from vision-based classification experiments, consistently demonstrate that the mAP of the proposed framework outperforms both a centralized cloud model framework and a distributed edge model framework across various communication bandwidths and data sizes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Synthetic Grid Generator: Synthesizing Large-Scale Power Distribution Grids using Open Street Map](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04923v1)** | 2024-08-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Nowadays, various stakeholders involved in the analysis of electric power distribution grids face difficulties in the data acquisition related to the grid topology and parameters of grid assets. To mitigate the problem and possibly accelerate the accomplishment of grid studies without access to real data, we propose a novel approach for generating synthetic distribution grids (Syngrids) of (almost) arbitrary size replicating the characteristics of real medium- and low-voltage distribution networks. The method enables large-scale testing without incurring the burden of retrieving and pre-processing real-world data. The proposed algorithm exploits the publicly available information of Open Street Map (OSM). By leveraging geospatial data of real buildings and road networks, the approach allows to construct a Syngrid of chosen size with realistic topology and electrical parameters. It is shown that typical power-flow and short-circuit calculations can be performed on Syngrids ensuring convergence. Within the context of validating the effectiveness of the algorithm and the meaningful similarity of the output to real grids, the topological and electrical characteristics of a Syngrid are compared to their real-world counterparts. Finally, an open-source web platform named as Synthetic Grid Generator (SGG) and based on the proposed algorithm can be used by various stakeholders for the creation of synthetic grids.</p></details> | 8 pages, 8 figures |
| **[GlitchProber: Advancing Effective Detection and Mitigation of Glitch Tokens in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04905v1)** | 2024-08-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have achieved unprecedented success in the field of natural language processing. However, the black-box nature of their internal mechanisms has brought many concerns about their trustworthiness and interpretability. Recent research has discovered a class of abnormal tokens in the model's vocabulary space and named them "glitch tokens". Those tokens, once included in the input, may induce the model to produce incorrect, irrelevant, or even harmful results, drastically undermining the reliability and practicality of LLMs. In this work, we aim to enhance the understanding of glitch tokens and propose techniques for their detection and mitigation. We first reveal the characteristic features induced by glitch tokens on LLMs, which are evidenced by significant deviations in the distributions of attention patterns and dynamic information from intermediate model layers. Based on the insights, we develop GlitchProber, a tool for efficient glitch token detection and mitigation. GlitchProber utilizes small-scale sampling, principal component analysis for accelerated feature extraction, and a simple classifier for efficient vocabulary screening. Taking one step further, GlitchProber rectifies abnormal model intermediate layer values to mitigate the destructive effects of glitch tokens. Evaluated on five mainstream open-source LLMs, GlitchProber demonstrates higher efficiency, precision, and recall compared to existing approaches, with an average F1 score of 0.86 and an average repair rate of 50.06%. GlitchProber unveils a novel path to address the challenges posed by glitch tokens and inspires future research toward more robust and interpretable LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unsupervised Episode Detection for Large-Scale News Events](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04873v1)** | 2024-08-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Episodic structures are inherently interpretable and adaptable to evolving large-scale key events. However, state-of-the-art automatic event detection methods overlook event episodes and, therefore, struggle with these crucial characteristics. This paper introduces a novel task, episode detection, aimed at identifying episodes from a news corpus containing key event articles. An episode describes a cohesive cluster of core entities (e.g., "protesters", "police") performing actions at a specific time and location. Furthermore, an episode is a significant part of a larger group of episodes under a particular key event. Automatically detecting episodes is challenging because, unlike key events and atomic actions, we cannot rely on explicit mentions of times and locations to distinguish between episodes or use semantic similarity to merge inconsistent episode co-references. To address these challenges, we introduce EpiMine, an unsupervised episode detection framework that (1) automatically identifies the most salient, key-event-relevant terms and segments, (2) determines candidate episodes in an article based on natural episodic partitions estimated through shifts in discriminative term combinations, and (3) refines and forms final episode clusters using large language model-based reasoning on the candidate episodes. We construct three diverse, real-world event datasets annotated at the episode level. EpiMine outperforms all baselines on these datasets by an average 59.2% increase across all metrics.</p></details> |  |

These agents are postulated to excel across a myriad of tasks, potentially approaching general artificial intelligence. However, existing benchmarks fail to sufficiently challenge or showcase the full potential of LMMs in complex, real-world environments. To address this gap, we introduce VisualAgentBench (VAB), a comprehensive and pioneering benchmark specifically designed to train and evaluate LMMs as visual foundation agents across diverse scenarios, including Embodied, Graphical User Interface, and Visual Design, with tasks formulated to probe the depth of LMMs' understanding and interaction capabilities. Through rigorous testing across nine proprietary LMM APIs and eight open models, we demonstrate the considerable yet still developing agent capabilities of these models. Additionally, VAB constructs a trajectory training set constructed through hybrid methods including Program-based Solvers, LMM Agent Bootstrapping, and Human Demonstrations, promoting substantial performance improvements in LMMs through behavior cloning. Our work not only aims to benchmark existing models but also provides a solid foundation for future development into visual foundation agents. Code, train \& test data, and part of fine-tuned open LMMs are available at \url{https://github.com/THUDM/VisualAgentBench}.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adapting a Foundation Model for Space-based Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05924v1)** | 2024-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models, e.g., large language models, possess attributes of intelligence which offer promise to endow a robot with the contextual understanding necessary to navigate complex, unstructured tasks in the wild. In the future of space robotics, we see three core challenges which motivate the use of a foundation model adapted to space-based applications: 1) Scalability of ground-in-the-loop operations; 2) Generalizing prior knowledge to novel environments; and 3) Multi-modality in tasks and sensor data. Therefore, as a first-step towards building a foundation model for space-based applications, we automatically label the AI4Mars dataset to curate a language annotated dataset of visual-question-answer tuples. We fine-tune a pretrained LLaVA checkpoint on this dataset to endow a vision-language model with the ability to perform spatial reasoning and navigation on Mars' surface. In this work, we demonstrate that 1) existing vision-language models are deficient visual reasoners in space-based applications, and 2) fine-tuning a vision-language model on extraterrestrial data significantly improves the quality of responses even with a limited training dataset of only a few thousand samples.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Billion-scale Foundation Model for Remote Sensing Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.05215v4)** | 2024-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As the potential of foundation models in visual tasks has garnered significant attention, pretraining these models before downstream tasks has become a crucial step. The three key factors in pretraining foundation models are the pretraining method, the size of the pretraining dataset, and the number of model parameters. Recently, research in the remote sensing field has focused primarily on the pretraining method and the size of the dataset, with limited emphasis on the number of model parameters. This paper addresses this gap by examining the effect of increasing the number of model parameters on the performance of foundation models in downstream tasks such as rotated object detection and semantic segmentation. We pretrained foundation models with varying numbers of parameters, including 86M, 605.26M, 1.3B, and 2.4B, to determine whether performance in downstream tasks improved with an increase in parameters. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first billion-scale foundation model in the remote sensing field. Furthermore, we propose an effective method for scaling up and fine-tuning a vision transformer in the remote sensing field. To evaluate general performance in downstream tasks, we employed the DOTA v2.0 and DIOR-R benchmark datasets for rotated object detection, and the Potsdam and LoveDA datasets for semantic segmentation. Experimental results demonstrated that, across all benchmark datasets and downstream tasks, the performance of the foundation models and data efficiency improved as the number of parameters increased. Moreover, our models achieve the state-of-the-art performance on several datasets including DIOR-R, Postdam, and LoveDA.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This manuscript is the accepted version for IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing (IEEE J-STARS)</p></details> |

However, this approach introduces an urgent problem: current deep learning models are predominantly serial, meaning that as the number of network layers increases, so do the training and inference times. This is unacceptable if deep learning is to continue advancing. Therefore, this paper proposes a deep learning parallelization strategy based on the Universal Approximation Theorem (UAT). From this foundation, we designed a parallel network called Para-Former to test our theory. Unlike traditional serial models, the inference time of Para-Former does not increase with the number of layers, significantly accelerating the inference speed of multi-layer networks. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of this network.</p></details> |  |

Generalist AI holds the potential to address these limitations due to its versatility in interpreting different data types and generating tailored outputs for diverse needs. However, existing biomedical generalist AI solutions are typically heavyweight and closed source to researchers, practitioners, and patients. Here, we propose BiomedGPT, the first open-source and lightweight vision-language foundation model, designed as a generalist capable of performing various biomedical tasks. BiomedGPT achieved state-of-the-art results in 16 out of 25 experiments while maintaining a computing-friendly model scale. We also conducted human evaluations to assess the capabilities of BiomedGPT in radiology visual question answering, report generation, and summarization. BiomedGPT exhibits robust prediction ability with a low error rate of 3.8% in question answering, satisfactory performance with an error rate of 8.3% in writing complex radiology reports, and competitive summarization ability with a nearly equivalent preference score to human experts. Our method demonstrates that effective training with diverse data can lead to more practical biomedical AI for improving diagnosis and workflow efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Fix i...</summary><p>Fix incorrect citations and add journal reference for the published version.

| **[Sampling Foundational Transformer: A Theoretical Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05822v1)** | 2024-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The versatility of self-attention mechanism earned transformers great success in almost all data modalities, with limitations on the quadratic complexity and difficulty of training. To apply transformers across different data modalities, practitioners have to make specific clever data-modality-dependent constructions. In this paper, we propose Sampling Foundational Transformer (SFT) that can work on multiple data modalities (e.g., point cloud, graph, and sequence) and constraints (e.g., rotational-invariant). The existence of such model is important as contemporary foundational modeling requires operability on multiple data sources. For efficiency on large number of tokens, our model relies on our context aware sampling-without-replacement mechanism for both linear asymptotic computational complexity and real inference time gain. For efficiency, we rely on our newly discovered pseudoconvex formulation of transformer layer to increase model's convergence rate. As a model working on multiple data modalities, SFT has achieved competitive results on many benchmarks, while being faster in inference, compared to other very specialized models.</p></details> |  |

Under default settings, HOI performance is nearly saturated, with many studies focusing on long-tail distribution and zero-shot/few-shot scenarios. Let us consider an intriguing problem:``What if there is only test dataset without training dataset, using multimodal visual foundation model in a training-free manner? '' This study uses two experimental settings: grounding truth and random arbitrary combinations. We get some interesting conclusion and find that the open vocabulary capabilities of the multimodal visual foundation model are not yet fully realized. Additionally, replacing the feature extraction with grounding DINO further confirms these findings.</p></details> |  |

Despite their success, current retinal foundation models are generally restricted to a single imaging modality, such as Color Fundus Photography (CFP) or Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT), limiting their versatility. Moreover, these models may struggle to fully leverage expert annotations and overlook the valuable domain knowledge essential for domain-specific representation learning. To overcome these limitations, we introduce UrFound, a retinal foundation model designed to learn universal representations from both multimodal retinal images and domain knowledge. UrFound is equipped with a modality-agnostic image encoder and accepts either CFP or OCT images as inputs. To integrate domain knowledge into representation learning, we encode expert annotation in text supervision and propose a knowledge-guided masked modeling strategy for model pre-training. It involves reconstructing randomly masked patches of retinal images while predicting masked text tokens conditioned on the corresponding retinal image. This approach aligns multimodal images and textual expert annotations within a unified latent space, facilitating generalizable and domain-specific representation learning. Experimental results demonstrate that UrFound exhibits strong generalization ability and data efficiency when adapting to various tasks in retinal image analysis. By training on ~180k retinal images, UrFound significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art retinal foundation model trained on up to 1.6 million unlabelled images across 8 public retinal datasets. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/yukkai/UrFound.</p></details> |  |

However, evaluating MLLMs in low-level visual perception and understanding remains a yet-to-explore domain. To this end, we design benchmark settings to emulate human language responses related to low-level vision: the low-level visual perception (A1) via visual question answering related to low-level attributes (e.g. clarity, lighting); and the low-level visual description (A2), on evaluating MLLMs for low-level text descriptions. Furthermore, given that pairwise comparison can better avoid ambiguity of responses and has been adopted by many human experiments, we further extend the low-level perception-related question-answering and description evaluations of MLLMs from single images to image pairs. Specifically, for perception (A1), we carry out the LLVisionQA+ dataset, comprising 2,990 single images and 1,999 image pairs each accompanied by an open-ended question about its low-level features; for description (A2), we propose the LLDescribe+ dataset, evaluating MLLMs for low-level descriptions on 499 single images and 450 pairs. Additionally, we evaluate MLLMs on assessment (A3) ability, i.e. predicting score, by employing a softmax-based approach to enable all MLLMs to generate quantifiable quality ratings, tested against human opinions in 7 image quality assessment (IQA) datasets. With 24 MLLMs under evaluation, we demonstrate that several MLLMs have decent low-level visual competencies on single images, but only GPT-4V exhibits higher accuracy on pairwise comparisons than single image evaluations (like humans). We hope that our benchmark will motivate further research into uncovering and enhancing these nascent capabilities of MLLMs. Datasets will be available at https://github.com/Q-Future/Q-Bench.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by TPAMI. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2309.14181</p></details> |

Conventional task-specific ECG analysis models require large numbers of expensive ECG annotations or associated labels to train. Transfer learning techniques have been shown to improve generalization and reduce reliance on labeled data. We present ECG-FM, an open foundation model for ECG analysis, and conduct a comprehensive study performed on a dataset of 1.66 million ECGs sourced from both publicly available and private institutional sources. ECG-FM adopts a transformer-based architecture and is pretrained on 2.5 million samples using ECG-specific augmentations and contrastive learning, as well as a continuous signal masking objective. Our transparent evaluation includes a diverse range of downstream tasks, where we predict ECG interpretation labels, reduced left ventricular ejection fraction, and abnormal cardiac troponin. Affirming ECG-FM's effectiveness as a foundation model, we demonstrate how its command of contextual information results in strong performance, rich pretrained embeddings, and reliable interpretability.

Recently, vision foundation models such as CLIP have gained significant attention, helping the vision community advance in finding robust, generalizable feature representations. With the majority of researchers within the wearable community relying on vision modalities to overcome the limited expressiveness of wearable data and accurately label their to-be-released benchmark datasets offline, we propose a novel, clustering-based annotation pipeline to significantly reduce the amount of data that needs to be annotated by a human annotator. We show that using our approach, the annotation of centroid clips suffices to achieve average labelling accuracies close to 90% across three publicly available HAR benchmark datasets. Using the weakly annotated datasets, we further demonstrate that we can match the accuracy scores of fully-supervised deep learning classifiers across all three benchmark datasets. Code as well as supplementary figures and results are publicly downloadable via github.com/mariusbock/weak_har.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures, accepted at ISWC'24: International Symposium on Wearable Computers, Oct, 2024</p></details> |

Current AI foundation models, although advanced by leveraging large and heterogeneous data, are often constrained by their size and data integration, limiting their effectiveness in addressing the full range of Earth system prediction challenges. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the Oak Ridge Base Foundation Model for Earth System Predictability (ORBIT), an advanced vision transformer model that scales up to 113 billion parameters using a novel hybrid tensor-data orthogonal parallelism technique. As the largest model of its kind, ORBIT surpasses the current climate AI foundation model size by a thousandfold. Performance scaling tests conducted on the Frontier supercomputer have demonstrated that ORBIT achieves 684 petaFLOPS to 1.6 exaFLOPS sustained throughput, with scaling efficiency maintained at 41% to 85% across 49,152 AMD GPUs. These breakthroughs establish new advances in AI-driven climate modeling and demonstrate promise to significantly improve the Earth system predictability.</p></details> |  |

However, a key hurdle in achieving this goal lies in the robots' ability to manipulate objects in their unstructured surrounding environments according to different tasks. The learning-based approach is considered an effective way to address generalization. The impressive performance of foundation models in the fields of computer vision and natural language suggests the potential of embedding foundation models into manipulation tasks as a viable path toward achieving general manipulation capability. However, we believe achieving general manipulation capability requires an overarching framework akin to auto driving. This framework should encompass multiple functional modules, with different foundation models assuming distinct roles in facilitating general manipulation capability. This survey focuses on the contributions of foundation models to robot learning for manipulation. We propose a comprehensive framework and detail how foundation models can address challenges in each module of the framework. What's more, we examine current approaches, outline challenges, suggest future research directions, and identify potential risks associated with integrating foundation models into this domain.</p></details> |  |

Inspired by this progress, we explore the potential of foundation models for time-series forecasting in smart agriculture, a field often plagued by limited data availability. Specifically, this work presents a novel application of $\texttt{TimeGPT}$, a state-of-the-art (SOTA) time-series foundation model, to predict soil water potential ($\psi_\mathrm{soil}$), a key indicator of field water status that is typically used for irrigation advice. Traditionally, this task relies on a wide array of input variables. We explore $\psi_\mathrm{soil}$'s ability to forecast $\psi_\mathrm{soil}$ in: ($i$) a zero-shot setting, ($ii$) a fine-tuned setting relying solely on historic $\psi_\mathrm{soil}$ measurements, and ($iii$) a fine-tuned setting where we also add exogenous variables to the model. We compare $\texttt{TimeGPT}$'s performance to established SOTA baseline models for forecasting $\psi_\mathrm{soil}$. Our results demonstrate that $\texttt{TimeGPT}$ achieves competitive forecasting accuracy using only historical $\psi_\mathrm{soil}$ data, highlighting its remarkable potential for agricultural applications. This research paves the way for foundation time-series models for sustainable development in agriculture by enabling forecasting tasks that were traditionally reliant on extensive data collection and domain expertise.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, accepted at KDD '24 - Fragile Earth Workshop https://openreview.net/forum?id=GZBGhi4JfE</p></details> |
| **[The Foundations of Tokenization: Statistical and Computational Concerns](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11606v2)** | 2024-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tokenization - the practice of converting strings of characters over an alphabet into sequences of tokens over a vocabulary - is a critical yet under-theorized step in the NLP pipeline. Notably, it remains the only major step not fully integrated into widely used end-to-end neural models. This paper aims to address this theoretical gap by laying the foundations of tokenization from a formal perspective. By articulating and extending basic properties about the category of stochastic maps, we propose a unified framework for representing and analyzing tokenizer models. This framework allows us to establish general conditions for the use of tokenizers. In particular, we formally establish the necessary and sufficient conditions for a tokenizer model to preserve the consistency of statistical estimators. Additionally, we discuss statistical and computational concerns crucial for the design and implementation of tokenizer models. The framework and results advanced in this paper represent a step toward a robust theoretical foundation for neural language modeling.</p></details> |  |

However, capturing high-resolution ground truth canopy height using LiDAR is expensive and not available globally. An efficient alternative is to train a canopy height estimator to operate on single-view remotely sensed imagery. The primary obstacle to this approach is that these methods require significant training data to generalize well globally and across uncommon edge cases. Recent monocular depth estimation foundation models have show strong zero-shot performance even for complex scenes. In this paper we leverage the representations learned by these models to transfer to the remote sensing domain for measuring canopy height. Our findings suggest that our proposed Depth Any Canopy, the result of fine-tuning the Depth Anything v2 model for canopy height estimation, provides a performant and efficient solution, surpassing the current state-of-the-art with superior or comparable performance using only a fraction of the computational resources and parameters. Furthermore, our approach requires less than \$1.30 in compute and results in an estimated carbon footprint of 0.14 kgCO2.

| **[PowerPM: Foundation Model for Power Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04057v1)** | 2024-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The emergence of abundant electricity time series (ETS) data provides ample opportunities for various applications in the power systems, including demand-side management, grid stability, and consumer behavior analysis. Deep learning models have advanced ETS modeling by effectively capturing sequence dependence. Nevertheless, learning a generic representation of ETS data for various applications remains challenging due to the inherently complex hierarchical structure of ETS data. Moreover, ETS data exhibits intricate temporal dependencies and is suscepti ble to the influence of exogenous variables. Furthermore, different instances exhibit diverse electricity consumption behavior. In this paper, we propose a foundation model PowerPM to model ETS data, providing a large-scale, off-the-shelf model for power systems. PowerPM consists of a temporal encoder and a hierarchical encoder. The temporal encoder captures both temporal dependencies in ETS data, considering exogenous variables. The hierarchical encoder models the correlation between hierarchy. Furthermore, PowerPM leverages a novel self-supervised pretraining framework consisting of masked ETS modeling and dual-view contrastive learning, which enable PowerPM to capture temporal dependency within ETS windows and aware the discrepancy across ETS windows, providing two different perspectives to learn generic representation. Our experiments involve five real world scenario datasets, comprising private and public data. Through pre-training on massive ETS data, PowerPM achieves SOTA performance on diverse downstream tasks within the private dataset. Impressively, when transferred to the public datasets, PowerPM maintains its superiority, showcasing its remarkable generalization ability across various tasks and domains. Moreover, ablation studies, few-shot experiments provide additional evidence of the effectiveness of our model.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 5 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |

Our contributions are (1) generalizing the theory of causal abstraction from mechanism replacement (i.e., hard and soft interventions) to arbitrary mechanism transformation (i.e., functionals from old mechanisms to new mechanisms), (2) providing a flexible, yet precise formalization for the core concepts of modular features, polysemantic neurons, and graded faithfulness, and (3) unifying a variety of mechanistic interpretability methodologies in the common language of causal abstraction, namely activation and path patching, causal mediation analysis, causal scrubbing, causal tracing, circuit analysis, concept erasure, sparse autoencoders, differential binary masking, distributed alignment search, and activation steering.</p></details> |  |

Traditionally reliant on manual interpretation and task-specific models, remote sensing has been significantly enhanced by the advent of foundation models--large-scale, pre-trained AI models capable of performing a wide array of tasks with unprecedented accuracy and efficiency. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of foundation models in the remote sensing domain, covering models released between June 2021 and June 2024. We categorize these models based on their applications in computer vision and domain-specific tasks, offering insights into their architectures, pre-training datasets, and methodologies. Through detailed performance comparisons, we highlight emerging trends and the significant advancements achieved by these foundation models. Additionally, we discuss the technical challenges, practical implications, and future research directions, addressing the need for high-quality data, computational resources, and improved model generalization. Our research also finds that pre-training methods, particularly self-supervised learning techniques like contrastive learning and masked autoencoders, significantly enhance the performance and robustness of foundation models in remote sensing tasks such as scene classification, object detection, and other applications. This survey aims to serve as a resource for researchers and practitioners by providing a panorama of advances and promising pathways for continued development and application of foundation models in remote sensing.</p></details> |  |
| **[Tool Learning with Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08354v3)** | 2024-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Humans possess an extraordinary ability to create and utilize tools, allowing them to overcome physical limitations and explore new frontiers. With the advent of foundation models, AI systems have the potential to be equally adept in tool use as humans. This paradigm, i.e., tool learning with foundation models, combines the strengths of specialized tools and foundation models to achieve enhanced accuracy, efficiency, and automation in problem-solving. Despite its immense potential, there is still a lack of a comprehensive understanding of key challenges, opportunities, and future endeavors in this field. To this end, we present a systematic investigation of tool learning in this paper. We first introduce the background of tool learning, including its cognitive origins, the paradigm shift of foundation models, and the complementary roles of tools and models. Then we recapitulate existing tool learning research into tool-augmented and tool-oriented learning. We formulate a general tool learning framework: starting from understanding the user instruction, models should learn to decompose a complex task into several subtasks, dynamically adjust their plan through reasoning, and effectively conquer each sub-task by selecting appropriate tools. We also discuss how to train models for improved tool-use capabilities and facilitate the generalization in tool learning. Considering the lack of a systematic tool learning evaluation in prior works, we experiment with 18 representative tools and show the potential of current foundation models in skillfully utilizing tools. Finally, we discuss several open problems that require further investigation for tool learning. In general, we hope this paper could inspire future research in integrating tools with foundation models.</p></details> |  |

The advent of Whole Slide Scanners and the development of deep learning technologies have significantly advanced the field, leading to extensive research and development in pathology AI (Artificial Intelligence). These advancements have contributed to reducing the workload of pathologists and supporting decision-making in treatment plans. Recently, large-scale AI models known as Foundation Models (FMs), which are more accurate and applicable to a wide range of tasks compared to traditional AI, have emerged, and expanded their application scope in the healthcare field. Numerous FMs have been developed in pathology, and there are reported cases of their application in various tasks, such as disease diagnosis, rare cancer diagnosis, patient survival prognosis prediction, biomarker expression prediction, and the scoring of immunohistochemical expression intensity. However, several challenges remain for the clinical application of FMs, which healthcare professionals, as users, must be aware of. Research is ongoing to address these challenges.

| **[Optimizing Cox Models with Stochastic Gradient Descent: Theoretical Foundations and Practical Guidances](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02839v1)** | 2024-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Optimizing Cox regression and its neural network variants poses substantial computational challenges in large-scale studies. Stochastic gradient descent (SGD), known for its scalability in model optimization, has recently been adapted to optimize Cox models. Unlike its conventional application, which typically targets a sum of independent individual loss, SGD for Cox models updates parameters based on the partial likelihood of a subset of data. Despite its empirical success, the theoretical foundation for optimizing Cox partial likelihood with SGD is largely underexplored. In this work, we demonstrate that the SGD estimator targets an objective function that is batch-size-dependent. We establish that the SGD estimator for the Cox neural network (Cox-NN) is consistent and achieves the optimal minimax convergence rate up to a polylogarithmic factor. For Cox regression, we further prove the $\sqrt{n}$-consistency and asymptotic normality of the SGD estimator, with variance depending on the batch size. Furthermore, we quantify the impact of batch size on Cox-NN training and its effect on the SGD estimator's asymptotic efficiency in Cox regression. These findings are validated by extensive numerical experiments and provide guidance for selecting batch sizes in SGD applications. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of SGD in a real-world application where GD is unfeasible due to the large scale of data.</p></details> |  |

Foundation models pretrained with these methods serve as a good basis for downstream tasks. However, the gap between natural and histopathological images hinders the direct application of existing methods. In this work, we present PathoDuet, a series of pretrained models on histopathological images, and a new self-supervised learning framework in histopathology. The framework is featured by a newly-introduced pretext token and later task raisers to explicitly utilize certain relations between images, like multiple magnifications and multiple stains. Based on this, two pretext tasks, cross-scale positioning and cross-stain transferring, are designed to pretrain the model on Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) images and transfer the model to immunohistochemistry (IHC) images, respectively. To validate the efficacy of our models, we evaluate the performance over a wide variety of downstream tasks, including patch-level colorectal cancer subtyping and whole slide image (WSI)-level classification in H&E field, together with expression level prediction of IHC marker, tumor identification and slide-level qualitative analysis in IHC field. The experimental results show the superiority of our models over most tasks and the efficacy of proposed pretext tasks.

| **[A Multimodal Knowledge-enhanced Whole-slide Pathology Foundation Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15362v2)** | 2024-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Remarkable strides in computational pathology have been made in the task-agnostic foundation model that advances the performance of a wide array of downstream clinical tasks. Despite the promising performance, there are still several challenges. First, prior works have resorted to either vision-only or vision-captions data, disregarding invaluable pathology reports and gene expression profiles which respectively offer distinct knowledge for versatile clinical applications. Second, the current progress in pathology FMs predominantly concentrates on the patch level, where the restricted context of patch-level pretraining fails to capture whole-slide patterns. Here we curated the largest multimodal dataset consisting of H\&E diagnostic whole slide images and their associated pathology reports and RNA-Seq data, resulting in 26,169 slide-level modality pairs from 10,275 patients across 32 cancer types. To leverage these data for CPath, we propose a novel whole-slide pretraining paradigm which injects multimodal knowledge at the whole-slide context into the pathology FM, called Multimodal Self-TAught PRetraining (mSTAR). The proposed paradigm revolutionizes the workflow of pretraining for CPath, which enables the pathology FM to acquire the whole-slide context. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to incorporate multimodal knowledge at the slide level for enhancing pathology FMs, expanding the modelling context from unimodal to multimodal knowledge and from patch-level to slide-level. To systematically evaluate the capabilities of mSTAR, extensive experiments including slide-level unimodal and multimodal applications, are conducted across 7 diverse types of tasks on 43 subtasks, resulting in the largest spectrum of downstream tasks. The average performance in various slide-level applications consistently demonstrates significant performance enhancements for mSTAR compared to SOTA FMs.</p></details> | 45 pages, 9 figures |

Some common limitations in MOT are varying object appearances, occlusions, or crowded scenes. To address these challenges, machine learning methods have been extensively deployed, leveraging large datasets, sophisticated models, and substantial computational resources. Due to practical limitations, access to the above is not always an option. However, with the recent release of foundation models by prominent AI companies, pretrained models have been trained on vast datasets and resources using state-of-the-art methods. This work tries to leverage one such foundation model, called DINOv2, through using knowledge distillation. The proposed method uses a teacher-student architecture, where DINOv2 is the teacher and the FairMOT backbone HRNetv2 W18 is the student. The results imply that although the proposed method shows improvements in certain scenarios, it does not consistently outperform the original FairMOT model.

However, the fast-growing capabilities and autonomy have also raised significant concerns about responsible AI and AI safety. Recently, there have been increasing attention toward implementing guardrails to ensure the runtime behavior of FM-based systems is safe and responsible. Given the early stage of FMs and their applications (such as agents), the design of guardrails have not yet been systematically studied. It remains underexplored which software qualities should be considered when designing guardrails and how these qualities can be ensured from a software architecture perspective. Therefore, in this paper, we present a taxonomy for guardrails to classify and compare the characteristics and design options of guardrails. Our taxonomy is organized into three main categories: the motivation behind adopting runtime guardrails, the quality attributes to consider, and the design options available. This taxonomy provides structured and concrete guidance for making architectural design decisions when designing guardrails and highlights trade-offs arising from the design decisions.</p></details> | 15 Pages |
| **[Enhancing Whole Slide Pathology Foundation Models through Stain Normalization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00380v2)** | 2024-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in digital pathology have led to the development of numerous foundational models that utilize self-supervised learning on patches extracted from gigapixel whole slide images (WSIs). While this approach leverages vast amounts of unlabeled data, we have discovered a significant issue: features extracted from these self-supervised models tend to cluster by individual WSIs, a phenomenon we term WSI-specific feature collapse. This problem can potentially limit the model's generalization ability and performance on various downstream tasks. To address this issue, we introduce Stain Normalized Pathology Foundational Model, a novel foundational model trained on patches that have undergone stain normalization. Stain normalization helps reduce color variability arising from different laboratories and scanners, enabling the model to learn more consistent features. Stain Normalized Pathology Foundational Model is trained using 285,153,903 patches extracted from a total of 34,795 WSIs, combining data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project. Our experiments demonstrate that Stain Normalized Pathology Foundational Model significantly mitigates the feature collapse problem, indicating that the model has learned more generalized features rather than overfitting to individual WSI characteristics. We compared Stain Normalized Pathology Foundational Model with state-of-the-art models across six downstream task datasets, and our results show that Stain Normalized Pathology Foundational Model achieves excellent performance relative to the number of WSIs used and the model's parameter count. This suggests that the application of stain normalization has substantially improved the model's efficiency and generalization capabilities.</p></details> | 13 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Towards A Generalizable Pathology Foundation Model via Unified Knowledge Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18449v2)** | 2024-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models pretrained on large-scale datasets are revolutionizing the field of computational pathology (CPath). The generalization ability of foundation models is crucial for the success in various downstream clinical tasks. However, current foundation models have only been evaluated on a limited type and number of tasks, leaving their generalization ability and overall performance unclear. To address this gap, we established a most comprehensive benchmark to evaluate the performance of off-the-shelf foundation models across six distinct clinical task types, encompassing a total of 39 specific tasks. Our findings reveal that existing foundation models excel at certain task types but struggle to effectively handle the full breadth of clinical tasks. To improve the generalization of pathology foundation models, we propose a unified knowledge distillation framework consisting of both expert and self knowledge distillation, where the former allows the model to learn from the knowledge of multiple expert models, while the latter leverages self-distillation to enable image representation learning via local-global alignment. Based on this framework, a Generalizable Pathology Foundation Model (GPFM) is pretrained on a large-scale dataset consisting of 190 million images from around 86,000 public H&E whole slides across 34 major tissue types. Evaluated on the established benchmark, GPFM achieves an impressive average rank of 1.36, with 29 tasks ranked 1st, while the the second-best model, UNI, attains an average rank of 2.96, with only 4 tasks ranked 1st. The superior generalization of GPFM demonstrates its exceptional modeling capabilities across a wide range of clinical tasks, positioning it as a new cornerstone for feature representation in CPath.</p></details> |  |

The intricate nature of the telecom network ecosystem presents challenges to effectively manage, operate, and optimize networks. To address these hurdles, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been widely adopted to solve different tasks in telecom networks. However, these conventional AI models are often designed for specific tasks, rely on extensive and costly-to-collect labeled data that require specialized telecom expertise for development and maintenance. The AI models usually fail to generalize and support diverse deployment scenarios and applications. In contrast, Foundation Models (FMs) show effective generalization capabilities in various domains in language, vision, and decision-making tasks. FMs can be trained on multiple data modalities generated from the telecom ecosystem and leverage specialized domain knowledge. Moreover, FMs can be fine-tuned to solve numerous specialized tasks with minimal task-specific labeled data and, in some instances, are able to leverage context to solve previously unseen problems. At the dawn of 6G, this paper investigates the potential opportunities of using FMs to shape the future of telecom technologies and standards. In particular, the paper outlines a conceptual process for developing Telecom FMs (TFMs) and discusses emerging opportunities for orchestrating specialized TFMs for network configuration, operation, and maintenance. Finally, the paper discusses the limitations and challenges of developing and deploying TFMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Importance of Downstream Networks in Digital Pathology Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17804v3)** | 2024-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Digital pathology has significantly advanced disease detection and pathologist efficiency through the analysis of gigapixel whole-slide images (WSI). In this process, WSIs are first divided into patches, for which a feature extractor model is applied to obtain feature vectors, which are subsequently processed by an aggregation model to predict the respective WSI label. With the rapid evolution of representation learning, numerous new feature extractor models, often termed foundational models, have emerged. Traditional evaluation methods rely on a static downstream aggregation model setup, encompassing a fixed architecture and hyperparameters, a practice we identify as potentially biasing the results. Our study uncovers a sensitivity of feature extractor models towards aggregation model configurations, indicating that performance comparability can be skewed based on the chosen configurations. By accounting for this sensitivity, we find that the performance of many current feature extractor models is notably similar. We support this insight by evaluating seven feature extractor models across three different datasets with 162 different aggregation model configurations. This comprehensive approach provides a more nuanced understanding of the feature extractors' sensitivity to various aggregation model configurations, leading to a fairer and more accurate assessment of new foundation models in digital pathology.</p></details> |  |

Previous methods utilized box-level supervision to identify the object that a person is looking at, but struggled with semantic ambiguity, ie, a single box may contain several items since objects are close together. The Vision foundation model (VFM) has improved in object segmentation using box prompts, which can reduce confusion by more precisely locating objects, offering advantages for fine-grained prediction of gaze objects. This paper presents a more challenging gaze object segmentation (GOS) task, which involves inferring the pixel-level mask corresponding to the object captured by human gaze behavior. In particular, we propose that the pixel-level supervision provided by VFM can be integrated into gaze object prediction to mitigate semantic ambiguity. This leads to our gaze object detection and segmentation framework that enables accurate pixel-level predictions. Different from previous methods that require additional head input or ignore head features, we propose to automatically obtain head features from scene features to ensure the model's inference efficiency and flexibility in the real world. Moreover, rather than directly fuse features to predict gaze heatmap as in existing methods, which may overlook spatial location and subtle details of the object, we develop a space-to-object gaze regression method to facilitate human-object gaze interaction. Specifically, it first constructs an initial human-object spatial connection, then refines this connection by interacting with semantically clear features in the segmentation branch, ultimately predicting a gaze heatmap for precise localization. Extensive experiments on GOO-Synth and GOO-Real datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.</p></details> | Accepted by ECCV2024 |

There is a wide variety of knowledge patterns embedded in the graph data, such as node properties and clusters, which are crucial to learning generalized representations for GFMs. However, existing surveys of GFMs have several shortcomings: they lack comprehensiveness regarding the most recent progress, have unclear categorization of self-supervised methods, and take a limited architecture-based perspective that is restricted to only certain types of graph models. As the ultimate goal of GFMs is to learn generalized graph knowledge, we provide a comprehensive survey of self-supervised GFMs from a novel knowledge-based perspective. We propose a knowledge-based taxonomy, which categorizes self-supervised graph models by the specific graph knowledge utilized. Our taxonomy consists of microscopic (nodes, links, etc.), mesoscopic (context, clusters, etc.), and macroscopic knowledge (global structure, manifolds, etc.). It covers a total of 9 knowledge categories and more than 25 pretext tasks for pre-training GFMs, as well as various downstream task generalization strategies. Such a knowledge-based taxonomy allows us to re-examine graph models based on new architectures more clearly, such as graph language models, as well as provide more in-depth insights for constructing GFMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 7 figures; work in progress</p></details> |

The more popular ones, such as Chat-GPT, are trained on large amounts of Internet data. However, it is becoming apparent that this data is likely to be exhausted soon, and technology companies are looking for new sources of data to train the next generation of foundation models. Reinforcement learning, RAG, prompt engineering and cognitive modelling are often used to fine-tune and augment the behaviour of foundation models. These techniques have been used to replicate people, such as Caryn Marjorie. These chatbots are not based on people's actual emotional and physiological responses to their environment, so they are, at best, a surface-level approximation to the characters they are imitating. To address these issues, we have developed a recording rig that captures what the wearer is seeing and hearing as well as their skin conductance (GSR), facial expression and brain state (14 channel EEG). AI algorithms are used to process this data into a rich picture of the environment and internal states of the subject. Foundation models trained on this data could replicate human behaviour much more accurately than the personality models that have been developed so far. This type of model has many potential applications, including recommendation, personal assistance, GAN systems, dating and recruitment. This paper gives some background to this work and describes the recording rig and preliminary tests of its functionality. It then suggests how a new type of foundation model could be created from the data captured by the rig and outlines some applications. Data gathering and model training are expensive, so we are currently working on the launch of a start-up that could raise funds for the next stage of the project.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 5 figures, 3 tables. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2408.00030</p></details> |

The more popular ones, such as Chat-GPT, are trained on large amounts of data from the Internet, and then reinforcement learning, RAG, prompt engineering and cognitive modelling are used to fine-tune and augment their behavior. This technology has been used to create models of individual people, such as Caryn Marjorie. However, these chatbots are not based on people's actual emotional and physiological responses to their environment, so they are, at best, surface-level approximations to the characters they are imitating. This paper describes how a new type of foundation model - a first-person foundation model - could be created from recordings of what a person sees and hears as well as their emotional and physiological reactions to these stimuli. A first-person foundation model would map environmental stimuli to a person's emotional and physiological states, and map a person's emotional and physiological states to their behavior. First-person foundation models have many exciting applications, including a new type of recommendation engine, personal assistants, generative adversarial networks, dating and recruitment. To obtain training data for a first-person foundation model, we have developed a recording rig that captures what the wearer is seeing and hearing as well as their emotional and physiological states.

The integration of the two has garnered significant attention from the AI research community. In this work, we attempt to provide an in-depth and comprehensive evaluation of the performance of MFM s on embodied task planning, aiming to shed light on their capabilities and limitations in this domain. To this end, based on the characteristics of embodied task planning, we first develop a systematic evaluation framework, which encapsulates four crucial capabilities of MFMs: object understanding, spatio-temporal perception, task understanding, and embodied reasoning. Following this, we propose a new benchmark, named MFE-ETP, characterized its complex and variable task scenarios, typical yet diverse task types, task instances of varying difficulties, and rich test case types ranging from multiple embodied question answering to embodied task reasoning. Finally, we offer a simple and easy-to-use automatic evaluation platform that enables the automated testing of multiple MFMs on the proposed benchmark. Using the benchmark and evaluation platform, we evaluated several state-of-the-art MFMs and found that they significantly lag behind human-level performance. The MFE-ETP is a high-quality, large-scale, and challenging benchmark relevant to real-world tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Benchmarking Histopathology Foundation Models for Ovarian Cancer Bevacizumab Treatment Response Prediction from Whole Slide Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20596v1)** | 2024-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bevacizumab is a widely studied targeted therapeutic drug used in conjunction with standard chemotherapy for the treatment of recurrent ovarian cancer. While its administration has shown to increase the progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with advanced stage ovarian cancer, the lack of identifiable biomarkers for predicting patient response has been a major roadblock in its effective adoption towards personalized medicine. In this work, we leverage the latest histopathology foundation models trained on large-scale whole slide image (WSI) datasets to extract ovarian tumor tissue features for predicting bevacizumab response from WSIs. Our extensive experiments across a combination of different histopathology foundation models and multiple instance learning (MIL) strategies demonstrate capability of these large models in predicting bevacizumab response in ovarian cancer patients with the best models achieving an AUC score of 0.86 and an accuracy score of 72.5%. Furthermore, our survival models are able to stratify high- and low-risk cases with statistical significance (p < 0.05) even among the patients with the aggressive subtype of high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma. This work highlights the utility of histopathology foundation models for the task of ovarian bevacizumab response prediction from WSIs. The high-attention regions of the WSIs highlighted by these models not only aid the model explainability but also serve as promising imaging biomarkers for treatment prognosis.</p></details> |  |
| **[The GPT Dilemma: Foundation Models and the Shadow of Dual-Use](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20442v1)** | 2024-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper examines the dual-use challenges of foundation models and the consequent risks they pose for international security. As artificial intelligence (AI) models are increasingly tested and deployed across both civilian and military sectors, distinguishing between these uses becomes more complex, potentially leading to misunderstandings and unintended escalations among states. The broad capabilities of foundation models lower the cost of repurposing civilian models for military uses, making it difficult to discern another state's intentions behind developing and deploying these models. As military capabilities are increasingly augmented by AI, this discernment is crucial in evaluating the extent to which a state poses a military threat. Consequently, the ability to distinguish between military and civilian applications of these models is key to averting potential military escalations. The paper analyzes this issue through four critical factors in the development cycle of foundation models: model inputs, capabilities, system use cases, and system deployment. This framework helps elucidate the points at which ambiguity between civilian and military applications may arise, leading to potential misperceptions. Using the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty as a case study, this paper proposes several strategies to mitigate the associated risks. These include establishing red lines for military competition, enhancing information-sharing protocols, employing foundation models to promote international transparency, and imposing constraints on specific weapon platforms. By managing dual-use risks effectively, these strategies aim to minimize potential escalations and address the trade-offs accompanying increasingly general AI models.</p></details> |  |

Inspired by this, we introduce Theia, a vision foundation model for robot learning that distills multiple off-the-shelf vision foundation models trained on varied vision tasks. Theia's rich visual representations encode diverse visual knowledge, enhancing downstream robot learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Theia outperforms its teacher models and prior robot learning models using less training data and smaller model sizes. Additionally, we quantify the quality of pre-trained visual representations and hypothesize that higher entropy in feature norm distributions leads to improved robot learning performance.

| **[Boosting Graph Foundation Model from Structural Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19941v1)** | 2024-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph foundation models have recently attracted significant attention due to its strong generalizability. Although existing methods resort to language models to learn unified semantic representations across domains, they disregard the unique structural characteristics of graphs from different domains. To address the problem, in this paper, we boost graph foundation model from structural perspective and propose BooG. The model constructs virtual super nodes to unify structural characteristics of graph data from different domains. Specifically, the super nodes fuse the information of anchor nodes and class labels, where each anchor node captures the information of a node or a graph instance to be classified. Instead of using the raw graph structure, we connect super nodes to all nodes within their neighborhood by virtual edges. This new structure allows for effective information aggregation while unifying cross-domain structural characteristics. Additionally, we propose a novel pre-training objective based on contrastive learning, which learns more expressive representations for graph data and generalizes effectively to different domains and downstream tasks. Experimental results on various datasets and tasks demonstrate the superior performance of BooG. We provide our code and data here: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/BooG-EE42/.</p></details> |  |
| **[Leveraging Foundation Models for Zero-Shot IoT Sensing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19893v1)** | 2024-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning models are increasingly deployed on edge Internet of Things (IoT) devices. However, these models typically operate under supervised conditions and fail to recognize unseen classes different from training. To address this, zero-shot learning (ZSL) aims to classify data of unseen classes with the help of semantic information. Foundation models (FMs) trained on web-scale data have shown impressive ZSL capability in natural language processing and visual understanding. However, leveraging FMs' generalized knowledge for zero-shot IoT sensing using signals such as mmWave, IMU, and Wi-Fi has not been fully investigated. In this work, we align the IoT data embeddings with the semantic embeddings generated by an FM's text encoder for zero-shot IoT sensing. To utilize the physics principles governing the generation of IoT sensor signals to derive more effective prompts for semantic embedding extraction, we propose to use cross-attention to combine a learnable soft prompt that is optimized automatically on training data and an auxiliary hard prompt that encodes domain knowledge of the IoT sensing task. To address the problem of IoT embeddings biasing to seen classes due to the lack of unseen class data during training, we propose using data augmentation to synthesize unseen class IoT data for fine-tuning the IoT feature extractor and embedding projector. We evaluate our approach on multiple IoT sensing tasks. Results show that our approach achieves superior open-set detection and generalized zero-shot learning performance compared with various baselines. Our code is available at https://github.com/schrodingho/FM\_ZSL\_IoT.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards a Knowledge guided Multimodal Foundation Model for Spatio-Temporal Remote Sensing Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19660v1)** | 2024-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, there is increased interest in foundation models for geoscience due to vast amount of earth observing satellite imagery. Existing remote sensing foundation models make use of the various sources of spectral imagery to create large models pretrained on masked reconstruction task. The embeddings from these foundation models are then used for various downstream remote sensing applications. In this paper we propose a foundational modeling framework for remote sensing geoscience applications, that goes beyond these traditional single modality masked autoencoder family of foundation models. This framework leverages the knowledge guided principles that the spectral imagery captures the impact of the physical drivers on the environmental system, and that the relationship between them is governed by the characteristics of the system. Specifically, our method, called MultiModal Variable Step Forecasting (MM-VSF), uses mutlimodal data (spectral imagery and weather) as its input and a variable step forecasting task as its pretraining objective. In our evaluation we show forecasting of satellite imagery using weather can be used as an effective pretraining task for foundation models. We further show the effectiveness of the embeddings from MM-VSF on the downstream task of pixel wise crop mapping, when compared with a model trained in the traditional setting of single modality input and masked reconstruction based pretraining.</p></details> | 9 pages |

Also controversial is the application of AI to facial imaging data. This work explores the intersection of these two areas to understand two core questions: "Who" these algorithms are being unfair to and equally important "Why". Recent work has shown that deep AD can be unfair to different groups despite being unsupervised with a recent study showing that for portraits of people: men of color are far more likely to be chosen to be outliers. We study the two main categories of AD algorithms: autoencoder-based and single-class-based which effectively try to compress all the instances with those that can not be easily compressed being deemed to be outliers. We experimentally verify sources of unfairness such as the under-representation of a group (e.g. people of color are relatively rare), spurious group features (e.g. men are often photographed with hats), and group labeling noise (e.g. race is subjective). We conjecture that lack of compressibility is the main foundation and the others cause it but experimental results show otherwise and we present a natural hierarchy amongst them.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 8 figures, AAAI/ACM AIES24</p></details> |

Consequently, these models can be used and fine-tuned for various purposes. Naturally, studying such models' use in the context of digital twins for cyber-physical systems (CPSs) is a relevant area of investigation. To this end, we provide perspectives on various aspects within the context of developing digital twins for CPSs, where foundation models can be used to increase the efficiency of creating digital twins, improve the effectiveness of the capabilities they provide, and used as specialized fine-tuned foundation models acting as digital twins themselves. We also discuss challenges in using foundation models in a more generic context. We use the case of an autonomous driving system as a representative CPS to give examples. Finally, we provide discussions and open research directions that we believe are valuable for the digital twin community.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving Representation of High-frequency Components for Medical Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14651v2)** | 2024-07-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models have recently attracted significant attention for their impressive generalizability across diverse downstream tasks. However, these models are demonstrated to exhibit great limitations in representing high-frequency components and fine-grained details. In many medical imaging tasks, the precise representation of such information is crucial due to the inherently intricate anatomical structures, sub-visual features, and complex boundaries involved. Consequently, the limited representation of prevalent foundation models can result in significant performance degradation or even failure in these tasks. To address these challenges, we propose a novel pretraining strategy, named Frequency-advanced Representation Autoencoder (Frepa). Through high-frequency masking and low-frequency perturbation combined with adversarial learning, Frepa encourages the encoder to effectively represent and preserve high-frequency components in the image embeddings. Additionally, we introduce an innovative histogram-equalized image masking strategy, extending the Masked Autoencoder approach beyond ViT to other architectures such as Swin Transformer and convolutional networks. We develop Frepa across nine medical modalities and validate it on 32 downstream tasks for both 2D images and 3D volume data. Without fine-tuning, Frepa can outperform other self-supervised pretraining methods and, in some cases, even surpasses task-specific trained models. This improvement is particularly significant for tasks involving fine-grained details, such as achieving up to a +15% increase in DSC for retina vessel segmentation and a +7% increase in IoU for lung nodule detection. Further experiments quantitatively reveal that Frepa enables superior high-frequency representations and preservation in the embeddings, underscoring its potential for developing more generalized and universal medical image foundation models.</p></details> |  |

However, such approaches cannot automatically integrate multiple complicated procedures to construct an intelligent agent, since each functionality is enabled by a separate model learned from independent climate datasets. The emergence of foundation models, especially multimodal foundation models, with their ability to process heterogeneous input data and execute complex tasks, offers a substantial opportunity to overcome this challenge. In this report, we want to explore a central question - how the state-of-the-art foundation model, i.e., GPT-4o, performs various atmospheric scientific tasks. Toward this end, we conduct a case study by categorizing the tasks into four main classes, including climate data processing, physical diagnosis, forecast and prediction, and adaptation and mitigation. For each task, we comprehensively evaluate the GPT-4o's performance along with a concrete discussion. We hope that this report may shed new light on future AI applications and research in atmospheric science.</p></details> | 28 pages, 12 figures |
| **[Feature Re-Embedding: Towards Foundation Model-Level Performance in Computational Pathology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17228v4)** | 2024-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiple instance learning (MIL) is the most widely used framework in computational pathology, encompassing sub-typing, diagnosis, prognosis, and more. However, the existing MIL paradigm typically requires an offline instance feature extractor, such as a pre-trained ResNet or a foundation model. This approach lacks the capability for feature fine-tuning within the specific downstream tasks, limiting its adaptability and performance. To address this issue, we propose a Re-embedded Regional Transformer (R$^2$T) for re-embedding the instance features online, which captures fine-grained local features and establishes connections across different regions. Unlike existing works that focus on pre-training powerful feature extractor or designing sophisticated instance aggregator, R$^2$T is tailored to re-embed instance features online. It serves as a portable module that can seamlessly integrate into mainstream MIL models. Extensive experimental results on common computational pathology tasks validate that: 1) feature re-embedding improves the performance of MIL models based on ResNet-50 features to the level of foundation model features, and further enhances the performance of foundation model features; 2) the R$^2$T can introduce more significant performance improvements to various MIL models; 3) R$^2$T-MIL, as an R$^2$T-enhanced AB-MIL, outperforms other latest methods by a large margin.The code is available at: https://github.com/DearCaat/RRT-MIL.</p></details> | Accepted by CVPR2024 |

These methods excel in tasks such as property prediction and molecule generation by learning contextualized representations of input tokens through self-supervised learning on large unlabeled corpora. Typically, this involves pre-training on unlabeled data followed by fine-tuning on specific tasks, reducing dependence on annotated datasets and broadening chemical language representation understanding.

The proposed foundation model supports different complex tasks, including quantum property prediction, and offer flexibility with two main variants (289M and $8\times289M$). Our experiments across multiple benchmark datasets validate the capacity of the proposed model in providing state-of-the-art results for different tasks.

Such research is expansive, ranging from the production of discriminatory, fake and toxic outputs, and privacy and copyright violations, to the unjust extraction of labor and natural resources. The same has not been the case in some of the most prominent AI governance initiatives in the global north like the UK's AI Safety Summit and the G7's Hiroshima process, which have influenced much of the international dialogue around AI governance. Despite the wealth of cautionary tales and evidence of algorithmic harm, there has been an ongoing over-emphasis within the AI governance discourse on technical matters of safety and global catastrophic or existential risks. This narrowed focus has tended to draw attention away from very pressing social and ethical challenges posed by the current brute-force industrialization of AI applications. To address such a visibility gap between real-world consequences and speculative risks, this paper offers a critical framework to account for the social, political, and environmental dimensions of foundation models and generative AI. We identify 14 categories of risks and harms and map them according to their individual, social, and biospheric impacts. We argue that this novel typology offers an integrative perspective to address the most urgent negative impacts of foundation models and their downstream applications. We conclude with recommendations on how this typology could be used to inform technical and normative interventions to advance responsible AI.</p></details> | <details><summary>ACM C...</summary><p>ACM Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency (FAccT '24).

The lack of human-annotated multi-modality aesthetic data further exacerbates this dilemma, resulting in MLLMs falling short of aesthetics perception capabilities. To address the above challenge, we first introduce a comprehensively annotated Aesthetic Multi-Modality Instruction Tuning (AesMMIT) dataset, which serves as the footstone for building multi-modality aesthetics foundation models. Specifically, to align MLLMs with human aesthetics perception, we construct a corpus-rich aesthetic critique database with 21,904 diverse-sourced images and 88K human natural language feedbacks, which are collected via progressive questions, ranging from coarse-grained aesthetic grades to fine-grained aesthetic descriptions. To ensure that MLLMs can handle diverse queries, we further prompt GPT to refine the aesthetic critiques and assemble the large-scale aesthetic instruction tuning dataset, i.e. AesMMIT, which consists of 409K multi-typed instructions to activate stronger aesthetic capabilities. Based on the AesMMIT database, we fine-tune the open-sourced general foundation models, achieving multi-modality Aesthetic Expert models, dubbed AesExpert. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed AesExpert models deliver significantly better aesthetic perception performances than the state-of-the-art MLLMs, including the most advanced GPT-4V and Gemini-Pro-Vision.

Our method exploits several foundation models as feature extractors to obtain a local representation of the image corresponding to a small region of the tissue, then, a global representation of the image is obtained by aggregating these local representations using attention-based Multiple Instance Learning. Our experimental study conducted on a dataset of 152 patients, shows the promising results of our methodology, notably by highlighting the advantage of using foundation models compared to conventional ImageNet pre-training. Moreover, the obtained results clearly demonstrates the potential of foundation models for characterizing histopathology images and generating more suited semantic representation for this task.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at MICCAI 2024 workshop MOVI</p></details> |

The core idea is to formulate a logifold structure and to interpret network models with restricted domains as local charts of datasets. In particular, this provides a mathematical foundation for ensemble machine learning. Our experiments demonstrate that logifolds can be implemented to identify fuzzy domains and improve accuracy compared to taking average of model outputs.

| **[Foundation Models for Autonomous Robots in Unstructured Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14296v2)** | 2024-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automating activities through robots in unstructured environments, such as construction sites, has been a long-standing desire. However, the high degree of unpredictable events in these settings has resulted in far less adoption compared to more structured settings, such as manufacturing, where robots can be hard-coded or trained on narrowly defined datasets. Recently, pretrained foundation models, such as Large Language Models (LLMs), have demonstrated superior generalization capabilities by providing zero-shot solutions for problems do not present in the training data, proposing them as a potential solution for introducing robots to unstructured environments. To this end, this study investigates potential opportunities and challenges of pretrained foundation models from a multi-dimensional perspective. The study systematically reviews application of foundation models in two field of robotic and unstructured environment and then synthesized them with deliberative acting theory. Findings showed that linguistic capabilities of LLMs have been utilized more than other features for improving perception in human-robot interactions. On the other hand, findings showed that the use of LLMs demonstrated more applications in project management and safety in construction, and natural hazard detection in disaster management. Synthesizing these findings, we located the current state-of-the-art in this field on a five-level scale of automation, placing them at conditional automation. This assessment was then used to envision future scenarios, challenges, and solutions toward autonomous safe unstructured environments. Our study can be seen as a benchmark to track our progress toward that future.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2312.07843, arXiv:2402.05741 by other authors</p></details> |
| **[Computer Audition: From Task-Specific Machine Learning to Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15672v1)** | 2024-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models (FMs) are increasingly spearheading recent advances on a variety of tasks that fall under the purview of computer audition -- the use of machines to understand sounds. They feature several advantages over traditional pipelines: among others, the ability to consolidate multiple tasks in a single model, the option to leverage knowledge from other modalities, and the readily-available interaction with human users. Naturally, these promises have created substantial excitement in the audio community, and have led to a wave of early attempts to build new, general-purpose foundation models for audio. In the present contribution, we give an overview of computational audio analysis as it transitions from traditional pipelines towards auditory foundation models. Our work highlights the key operating principles that underpin those models, and showcases how they can accommodate multiple tasks that the audio community previously tackled separately.</p></details> |  |
| **[Probing Fine-Grained Action Understanding and Cross-View Generalization of Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15605v1)** | 2024-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models (FMs) are large neural networks trained on broad datasets, excelling in downstream tasks with minimal fine-tuning. Human activity recognition in video has advanced with FMs, driven by competition among different architectures. However, high accuracies on standard benchmarks can draw an artificially rosy picture, as they often overlook real-world factors like changing camera perspectives. Popular benchmarks, mostly from YouTube or movies, offer diverse views but only coarse actions, which are insufficient for use-cases needing fine-grained, domain-specific actions. Domain-specific datasets (e.g., for industrial assembly) typically use data from limited static perspectives. This paper empirically evaluates how perspective changes affect different FMs in fine-grained human activity recognition. We compare multiple backbone architectures and design choices, including image- and video- based models, and various strategies for temporal information fusion, including commonly used score averaging and more novel attention-based temporal aggregation mechanisms. This is the first systematic study of different foundation models and specific design choices for human activity recognition from unknown views, conducted with the goal to provide guidance for backbone- and temporal- fusion scheme selection. Code and models will be made publicly available to the community.</p></details> |  |

However, these claims have not been thoroughly analyzed yet. Recently, foundation models have demonstrated unparalleled capabilities across diverse domains from language to computer vision, marking them as a potential cornerstone of future research for a multitude of computational tasks. In this paper, we conduct an extensive empirical study on representation learning for downstream Visual Question Answering (VQA), which requires an accurate compositional understanding of the scene. We thoroughly investigate the benefits and trade-offs of OC models and alternative approaches including large pre-trained foundation models on both synthetic and real-world data, and demonstrate a viable way to achieve the best of both worlds. The extensiveness of our study, encompassing over 800 downstream VQA models and 15 different types of upstream representations, also provides several additional insights that we believe will be of interest to the community at large.</p></details> |  |

This is a vital and challenging skill for embodied agents. However, existing methods suffer from inefficient training and poor generalization. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that combines visual foundation models(VFM) and offline reinforcement learning(offline RL) to empower embodied visual tracking. We use a pre-trained VFM, such as "Tracking Anything", to extract semantic segmentation masks with text prompts. We then train a recurrent policy network with offline RL, e.g., Conservative Q-Learning, to learn from the collected demonstrations without online interactions. To further improve the robustness and generalization of the policy network, we also introduce a mask re-targeting mechanism and a multi-level data collection strategy. In this way, we can train a robust policy within an hour on a consumer-level GPU, e.g., Nvidia RTX 3090. We evaluate our agent on several high-fidelity environments with challenging situations, such as distraction and occlusion. The results show that our agent outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of sample efficiency, robustness to distractors, and generalization to unseen scenarios and targets. We also demonstrate the transferability of the learned agent from virtual environments to a real-world robot.</p></details> | ECCV 2024 |

We introduce GPT-HyperAgent, an augmentation of GPT with HyperAgent for uncertainty-aware, scalable exploration in contextual bandits, a fundamental online decision problem involving natural language input. We prove that HyperAgent achieves fast incremental uncertainty estimation with $\tilde{O}(\log T)$ per-step computational complexity over $T$ periods under the linear realizable assumption. Our analysis demonstrates that HyperAgent's regret order matches that of exact Thompson sampling in linear contextual bandits, closing a significant theoretical gap in scalable exploration. Empirical results in real-world contextual bandit tasks, such as automated content moderation with human feedback, validate the practical effectiveness of GPT-HyperAgent for safety-critical decisions.

However, prior arts are seldom discussed under distribution shifts, which may be vulnerable in real-world applications. Recent Vision-Language Foundation Models, e.g., CLIP, have demonstrated remarkable performance in zero-shot out-of-distribution generalization, yet consuming heavy computation resources. In this paper, we discuss the extension of DFKD to Vision-Language Foundation Models without access to the billion-level image-text datasets. The objective is to customize a student model for distribution-agnostic downstream tasks with given category concepts, inheriting the out-of-distribution generalization capability from the pre-trained foundation models. In order to avoid generalization degradation, the primary challenge of this task lies in synthesizing diverse surrogate images driven by text prompts. Since not only category concepts but also style information are encoded in text prompts, we propose three novel Prompt Diversification methods to encourage image synthesis with diverse styles, namely Mix-Prompt, Random-Prompt, and Contrastive-Prompt. Experiments on out-of-distribution generalization datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods, with Contrastive-Prompt performing the best.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACMMM 2023</p></details> |
| **[Mapping the Unseen: Unified Promptable Panoptic Mapping with Dynamic Labeling using Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02162v2)** | 2024-07-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the field of robotics and computer vision, efficient and accurate semantic mapping remains a significant challenge due to the growing demand for intelligent machines that can comprehend and interact with complex environments. Conventional panoptic mapping methods, however, are limited by predefined semantic classes, thus making them ineffective for handling novel or unforeseen objects. In response to this limitation, we introduce the Unified Promptable Panoptic Mapping (UPPM) method. UPPM utilizes recent advances in foundation models to enable real-time, on-demand label generation using natural language prompts. By incorporating a dynamic labeling strategy into traditional panoptic mapping techniques, UPPM provides significant improvements in adaptability and versatility while maintaining high performance levels in map reconstruction. We demonstrate our approach on real-world and simulated datasets. Results show that UPPM can accurately reconstruct scenes and segment objects while generating rich semantic labels through natural language interactions. A series of ablation experiments validated the advantages of foundation model-based labeling over fixed label sets.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is under consideration at Pattern Recognition Letters</p></details> |

However, there has been limited work on integrating an additional, typically low-resource, language, while maintaining performance on the original language set. Fine-tuning, while simple, may degrade the accuracy of the original set. We compare three approaches that exploit adaptation parameters: soft language code tuning, train only the language code; soft prompt tuning, train prepended tokens; and LoRA where a small set of additional parameters are optimised. Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) offers an alternative compromise with the potential to maintain performance in specific target languages. Results show that direct fine-tuning yields the best performance for the new language but degrades existing language capabilities. EWC can address this issue for specific languages. If only adaptation parameters are used, the language capabilities are maintained but at the cost of performance in the new language.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods require pre-constructed 3D scenes and face scalability issues due to per-point feature vector learning, limiting their efficacy with complex queries. Our method overcomes these limitations by incrementally building instance-level 3D scene representations using 2D foundation models, efficiently aggregating instance-level details such as masks, feature vectors, names, and captions. We introduce fusion schemes for feature vectors to enhance their contextual knowledge and performance on complex queries. Additionally, we explore large language models for robust automatic annotation and spatial reasoning tasks. We evaluate our proposed approach on multiple scenes from ScanNet and Replica datasets demonstrating zero-shot generalization capabilities, exceeding current state-of-the-art methods in open world 3D scene understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://opensu3d.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[FoundPose: Unseen Object Pose Estimation with Foundation Features](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18809v2)** | 2024-07-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose FoundPose, a model-based method for 6D pose estimation of unseen objects from a single RGB image. The method can quickly onboard new objects using their 3D models without requiring any object- or task-specific training. In contrast, existing methods typically pre-train on large-scale, task-specific datasets in order to generalize to new objects and to bridge the image-to-model domain gap. We demonstrate that such generalization capabilities can be observed in a recent vision foundation model trained in a self-supervised manner. Specifically, our method estimates the object pose from image-to-model 2D-3D correspondences, which are established by matching patch descriptors from the recent DINOv2 model between the image and pre-rendered object templates. We find that reliable correspondences can be established by kNN matching of patch descriptors from an intermediate DINOv2 layer. Such descriptors carry stronger positional information than descriptors from the last layer, and we show their importance when semantic information is ambiguous due to object symmetries or a lack of texture. To avoid establishing correspondences against all object templates, we develop an efficient template retrieval approach that integrates the patch descriptors into the bag-of-words representation and can promptly propose a handful of similarly looking templates. Additionally, we apply featuremetric alignment to compensate for discrepancies in the 2D-3D correspondences caused by coarse patch sampling. The resulting method noticeably outperforms existing RGB methods for refinement-free pose estimation on the standard BOP benchmark with seven diverse datasets and can be seamlessly combined with an existing render-and-compare refinement method to achieve RGB-only state-of-the-art results.

| **[Semantic-CC: Boosting Remote Sensing Image Change Captioning via Foundational Knowledge and Semantic Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14032v1)** | 2024-07-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Remote sensing image change captioning (RSICC) aims to articulate the changes in objects of interest within bi-temporal remote sensing images using natural language. Given the limitations of current RSICC methods in expressing general features across multi-temporal and spatial scenarios, and their deficiency in providing granular, robust, and precise change descriptions, we introduce a novel change captioning (CC) method based on the foundational knowledge and semantic guidance, which we term Semantic-CC. Semantic-CC alleviates the dependency of high-generalization algorithms on extensive annotations by harnessing the latent knowledge of foundation models, and it generates more comprehensive and accurate change descriptions guided by pixel-level semantics from change detection (CD). Specifically, we propose a bi-temporal SAM-based encoder for dual-image feature extraction; a multi-task semantic aggregation neck for facilitating information interaction between heterogeneous tasks; a straightforward multi-scale change detection decoder to provide pixel-level semantic guidance; and a change caption decoder based on the large language model (LLM) to generate change description sentences. Moreover, to ensure the stability of the joint training of CD and CC, we propose a three-stage training strategy that supervises different tasks at various stages. We validate the proposed method on the LEVIR-CC and LEVIR-CD datasets. The experimental results corroborate the complementarity of CD and CC, demonstrating that Semantic-CC can generate more accurate change descriptions and achieve optimal performance across both tasks.</p></details> |  |

These capabilities allow FMs to be adapted for various tasks, including biomedical reasoning, hypothesis generation, and clinical decision-making. This review paper examines the foundational components of an ethical and trustworthy AI (ETAI) biomedical ecosystem centered on FMs, highlighting key challenges and solutions. The ETAI biomedical ecosystem is defined by seven key components which collectively integrate FMs into clinical settings: Data Lifecycle Management, Data Processing, Model Development, Model Evaluation, Clinical Translation, AI Governance and Regulation, and Stakeholder Engagement. While the potential of biomedical AI is immense, it requires heightened ethical vigilance and responsibility. For instance, biases can arise from data, algorithms, and user interactions, necessitating techniques to assess and mitigate bias prior to, during, and after model development. Moreover, interpretability, explainability, and accountability are key to ensuring the trustworthiness of AI systems, while workflow transparency in training, testing, and evaluation is crucial for reproducibility. Safeguarding patient privacy and security involves addressing challenges in data access, cloud data privacy, patient re-identification, membership inference attacks, and data memorization. Additionally, AI governance and regulation are essential for ethical AI use in biomedicine, guided by global standards. Furthermore, stakeholder engagement is essential at every stage of the AI pipeline and lifecycle for clinical translation. By adhering to these principles, we can harness the transformative potential of AI and develop an ETAI ecosystem.</p></details> | 3 figures, 3 tables |

For this reason, they are susceptible to the memorization and subsequent reproduction of training samples. In this paper, we introduce a training-as-compressing perspective, wherein the model's weights embody a compressed representation of the training data. From a copyright standpoint, this point of view implies that the weights could be considered a reproduction or a derivative work of a potentially protected set of works. We investigate the technical and legal challenges that emerge from this framing of the copyright of outputs generated by foundation models, including their implications for practitioners and researchers. We demonstrate that adopting an information-centric approach to the problem presents a promising pathway for tackling these emerging complex legal issues.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for spotlight presentation at GenLaw'24, see https://www.genlaw.org/2024-icml-papers#training-foundation-models-as-data-compression-on-information-model-weights-and-copyright-law</p></details> |

That we work predicatively means that we do not assume Voevodsky's propositional resizing axioms. Our work is constructive in the sense that we do not rely on excluded middle or the axiom of (countable) choice. Domain theory studies so-called directed complete posets (dcpos) and Scott continuous maps between them and has applications in a variety of fields, such as programming language semantics, higher-type computability and topology. A common approach to deal with size issues in a predicative foundation is to work with information systems, abstract bases or formal topologies rather than dcpos, and approximable relations rather than Scott continuous functions. In our type-theoretic approach, we instead accept that dcpos may be large and work with type universes to account for this. A priori one might expect that iterative constructions of dcpos may result in a need for ever-increasing universes and are predicatively impossible. We show, through a careful tracking of type universe parameters, that such constructions can be carried out in a predicative setting. In particular, we give a predicative reconstruction of Scott's $D_\infty$ model of the untyped $\lambda$-calculus. Our work is formalised in the Agda proof assistant and its ability to infer universe levels has been invaluable for our purposes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Based...</summary><p>Based on Ch. 3 and Sec. 5.1 of the author's PhD thesis (arXiv:2301.12405). v3: Updated Acknowledgements</p></details> |

That we work predicatively means that we do not assume Voevodsky's propositional resizing axioms. Our work is constructive in the sense that we do not rely on excluded middle or the axiom of (countable) choice. To deal with size issues and give a predicatively suitable definition of continuity of a dcpo, we follow Johnstone and Joyal's work on continuous categories. Adhering to the univalent perspective, we explicitly distinguish between data and property. To ensure that being continuous is a property of a dcpo, we turn to the propositional truncation, although we explain that some care is needed to avoid needing the axiom of choice. We also adapt the notion of a domain-theoretic basis to the predicative setting by imposing suitable smallness conditions, analogous to the categorical concept of an accessible category. All our running examples of continuous dcpos are then actually examples of dcpos with small bases which we show to be well behaved predicatively. In particular, such dcpos are exactly those presented by small ideals. As an application of the theory, we show that Scott's $D_\infty$ model of the untyped $\lambda$-calculus is an example of an algebraic dcpo with a small basis. Our work is formalised in the Agda proof assistant and its ability to infer universe levels has been invaluable for our purposes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Based...</summary><p>Based on Ch. 4 of the author's PhD thesis (arXiv:2301.12405). v3: Updated Acknowledgements</p></details> |

However, these models are susceptible to adversarial attacks, posing significant risks to the reliability and safety of autonomous vehicles. Adversaries can exploit these vulnerabilities to manipulate the vehicle's perception of its surroundings, leading to erroneous decisions and potentially catastrophic consequences. To address this challenge, we propose a novel Precision-Guided Adversarial Attack (PG-Attack) framework that combines two techniques: Precision Mask Perturbation Attack (PMP-Attack) and Deceptive Text Patch Attack (DTP-Attack). PMP-Attack precisely targets the attack region to minimize the overall perturbation while maximizing its impact on the target object's representation in the model's feature space. DTP-Attack introduces deceptive text patches that disrupt the model's understanding of the scene, further enhancing the attack's effectiveness. Our experiments demonstrate that PG-Attack successfully deceives a variety of advanced multi-modal large models, including GPT-4V, Qwen-VL, and imp-V1.

However, it is difficult to train a 3D foundation network directly due to the limited dataset and it remains under explored whether existing foundation models can be lifted to 3D space seamlessly. In this paper, we present PointSeg, a novel training-free paradigm that leverages off-the-shelf vision foundation models to address 3D scene perception tasks. PointSeg can segment anything in 3D scene by acquiring accurate 3D prompts to align their corresponding pixels across frames. Concretely, we design a two-branch prompts learning structure to construct the 3D point-box prompts pairs, combining with the bidirectional matching strategy for accurate point and proposal prompts generation. Then, we perform the iterative post-refinement adaptively when cooperated with different vision foundation models. Moreover, we design a affinity-aware merging algorithm to improve the final ensemble masks. PointSeg demonstrates impressive segmentation performance across various datasets, all without training. Specifically, our approach significantly surpasses the state-of-the-art specialist training-free model by 14.1$\%$, 12.3$\%$, and 12.6$\%$ mAP on ScanNet, ScanNet++, and KITTI-360 datasets, respectively. On top of that, PointSeg can incorporate with various foundation models and even surpasses the specialist training-based methods by 3.4$\%$-5.4$\%$ mAP across various datasets, serving as an effective generalist model.</p></details> |  |

Typically, speech is produced when air is forced from the lungs and is modulated by the vocal tract, where such actions are interspersed by moments of breathing in air (inhalation) to refill the lungs again. Respiratory rate (RR) is a vital metric that is used to assess the overall health, fitness, and general well-being of an individual. Existing approaches to measure RR (number of breaths one takes in a minute) are performed using specialized equipment or training. Studies have demonstrated that machine learning algorithms can be used to estimate RR using bio-sensor signals as input. Speech-based estimation of RR can offer an effective approach to measure the vital metric without requiring any specialized equipment or sensors. This work investigates a machine learning based approach to estimate RR from speech segments obtained from subjects speaking to a close-talking microphone device. Data were collected from N=26 individuals, where the groundtruth RR was obtained through commercial grade chest-belts and then manually corrected for any errors. A convolutional long-short term memory network (Conv-LSTM) is proposed to estimate respiration time-series data from the speech signal. We demonstrate that the use of pre-trained representations obtained from a foundation model, such as Wav2Vec2, can be used to estimate respiration-time-series with low root-mean-squared error and high correlation coefficient, when compared with the baseline. The model-driven time series can be used to estimate $RR$ with a low mean absolute error (MAE) ~ 1.6 breaths/min.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures, BioKDD workshop paper</p></details> |

To characterize the status quo, the Foundation Model Transparency Index was launched in October 2023 to measure the transparency of leading foundation model developers. The October 2023 Index (v1.0) assessed 10 major foundation model developers (e.g. OpenAI, Google) on 100 transparency indicators (e.g. does the developer disclose the wages it pays for data labor?). At the time, developers publicly disclosed very limited information with the average score being 37 out of 100. To understand how the status quo has changed, we conduct a follow-up study (v1.1) after 6 months: we score 14 developers against the same 100 indicators. While in v1.0 we searched for publicly available information, in v1.1 developers submit reports on the 100 transparency indicators, potentially including information that was not previously public. We find that developers now score 58 out of 100 on average, a 21 point improvement over v1.0. Much of this increase is driven by developers disclosing information during the v1.1 process: on average, developers disclosed information related to 16.6 indicators that was not previously public. We observe regions of sustained (i.e. across v1.0 and v1.1) and systemic (i.e. across most or all developers) opacity such as on copyright status, data access, data labor, and downstream impact. We publish transparency reports for each developer that consolidate information disclosures: these reports are based on the information disclosed to us via developers. Our findings demonstrate that transparency can be improved in this nascent ecosystem, the Foundation Model Transparency Index likely contributes to these improvements, and policymakers should consider interventions in areas where transparency has not improved.</p></details> | <details><summary>Autho...</summary><p>Authored by the Center for Research on Foundation Models (CRFM) at the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence (HAI).

We build a rigorous foundational framework for pMCMC algorithms that situates these methods within a unified 'extended phase space' measure-theoretic formalism. Drawing on our recent work that provides a comprehensive theory for reversible single proposal methods, we herein derive general criteria for multiproposal acceptance mechanisms which yield ergodic chains on general state spaces. Our formulation encompasses a variety of methodologies, including proposal cloud resampling and Hamiltonian methods, while providing a basis for the derivation of novel algorithms. In particular, we obtain a top-down picture for a class of methods arising from 'conditionally independent' proposal structures. As an immediate application, we identify several new algorithms including a multiproposal version of the popular preconditioned Crank-Nicolson (pCN) sampler suitable for high- and infinite-dimensional target measures which are absolutely continuous with respect to a Gaussian base measure. To supplement our theoretical results, we carry out a selection of numerical case studies that evaluate the efficacy of these novel algorithms. First, noting that the true potential of pMCMC algorithms arises from their natural parallelizability, we provide a limited parallelization study using TensorFlow and a graphics processing unit to scale pMCMC algorithms that leverage as many as 100k proposals at each step. Second, we use our multiproposal pCN algorithm (mpCN) to resolve a selection of problems in Bayesian statistical inversion for partial differential equations motivated by fluid measurement. These examples provide preliminary evidence of the efficacy of mpCN for high-dimensional target distributions featuring complex geometries and multimodal structures.</p></details> | <details><summary>Minor...</summary><p>Minor revisions from previous version</p></details> |
| **[Muting Whisper: A Universal Acoustic Adversarial Attack on Speech Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06134v2)** | 2024-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent developments in large speech foundation models like Whisper have led to their widespread use in many automatic speech recognition (ASR) applications. These systems incorporate `special tokens' in their vocabulary, such as $\texttt{<|endoftext|>}$, to guide their language generation process. However, we demonstrate that these tokens can be exploited by adversarial attacks to manipulate the model's behavior. We propose a simple yet effective method to learn a universal acoustic realization of Whisper's $\texttt{<|endoftext|>}$ token, which, when prepended to any speech signal, encourages the model to ignore the speech and only transcribe the special token, effectively `muting' the model. Our experiments demonstrate that the same, universal 0.64-second adversarial audio segment can successfully mute a target Whisper ASR model for over 97\% of speech samples. Moreover, we find that this universal adversarial audio segment often transfers to new datasets and tasks. Overall this work demonstrates the vulnerability of Whisper models to `muting' adversarial attacks, where such attacks can pose both risks and potential benefits in real-world settings: for example the attack can be used to bypass speech moderation systems, or conversely the attack can also be used to protect private speech data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Recipe Retrieval with Foundation Models: A Data Augmentation Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04763v2)** | 2024-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning recipe and food image representation in common embedding space is non-trivial but crucial for cross-modal recipe retrieval. In this paper, we propose a new perspective for this problem by utilizing foundation models for data augmentation. Leveraging on the remarkable capabilities of foundation models (i.e., Llama2 and SAM), we propose to augment recipe and food image by extracting alignable information related to the counterpart. Specifically, Llama2 is employed to generate a textual description from the recipe, aiming to capture the visual cues of a food image, and SAM is used to produce image segments that correspond to key ingredients in the recipe. To make full use of the augmented data, we introduce Data Augmented Retrieval framework (DAR) to enhance recipe and image representation learning for cross-modal retrieval. We first inject adapter layers to pre-trained CLIP model to reduce computation cost rather than fully fine-tuning all the parameters. In addition, multi-level circle loss is proposed to align the original and augmented data pairs, which assigns different penalties for positive and negative pairs. On the Recipe1M dataset, our DAR outperforms all existing methods by a large margin. Extensive ablation studies validate the effectiveness of each component of DAR.</p></details> | ECCV2024 |
| **[MAGIC-VFM: Meta-learning Adaptation for Ground Interaction Control with Visual Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12304v1)** | 2024-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Control of off-road vehicles is challenging due to the complex dynamic interactions with the terrain. Accurate modeling of these interactions is important to optimize driving performance, but the relevant physical phenomena are too complex to model from first principles. Therefore, we present an offline meta-learning algorithm to construct a rapidly-tunable model of residual dynamics and disturbances. Our model processes terrain images into features using a visual foundation model (VFM), then maps these features and the vehicle state to an estimate of the current actuation matrix using a deep neural network (DNN). We then combine this model with composite adaptive control to modify the last layer of the DNN in real time, accounting for the remaining terrain interactions not captured during offline training. We provide mathematical guarantees of stability and robustness for our controller and demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through simulations and hardware experiments with a tracked vehicle and a car-like robot. We evaluate our method outdoors on different slopes with varying slippage and actuator degradation disturbances, and compare against an adaptive controller that does not use the VFM terrain features. We show significant improvement over the baseline in both hardware experimentation and simulation.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Reference Architecture for Designing Foundation Model based Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.11090v5)** | 2024-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The release of ChatGPT, Gemini, and other large language model has drawn huge interests on foundations models. There is a broad consensus that foundations models will be the fundamental building blocks for future AI systems. However, there is a lack of systematic guidance on the architecture design. Particularly, the the rapidly growing capabilities of foundations models can eventually absorb other components of AI systems, posing challenges of moving boundary and interface evolution in architecture design. Furthermore, incorporating foundations models into AI systems raises significant concerns about responsible and safe AI due to their opaque nature and rapidly advancing intelligence. To address these challenges, the paper first presents an architecture evolution of AI systems in the era of foundation models, transitioning from "foundation-model-as-a-connector" to "foundation-model-as-a-monolithic architecture". The paper then identifies key design decisions and proposes a pattern-oriented reference architecture for designing responsible foundation-model-based systems. The patterns can enable the potential of foundation models while ensuring associated risks.</p></details> |  |
| **[An efficient framework based on large foundation model for cervical cytopathology whole slide image screening](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11486v1)** | 2024-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current cervical cytopathology whole slide image (WSI) screening primarily relies on detection-based approaches, which are limited in performance due to the expense and time-consuming annotation process. Multiple Instance Learning (MIL), a weakly supervised approach that relies solely on bag-level labels, can effectively alleviate these challenges. Nonetheless, MIL commonly employs frozen pretrained models or self-supervised learning for feature extraction, which suffers from low efficacy or inefficiency. In this paper, we propose an efficient framework for cervical cytopathology WSI classification using only WSI-level labels through unsupervised and weakly supervised learning. Given the sparse and dispersed nature of abnormal cells within cytopathological WSIs, we propose a strategy that leverages the pretrained foundation model to filter the top$k$ high-risk patches. Subsequently, we suggest parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) of a large foundation model using contrastive learning on the filtered patches to enhance its representation ability for task-specific signals. By training only the added linear adapters, we enhance the learning of patch-level features with substantially reduced time and memory consumption. Experiments conducted on the CSD and FNAC 2019 datasets demonstrate that the proposed method enhances the performance of various MIL methods and achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. The code and trained models are publicly available at https://github.com/CVIU-CSU/TCT-InfoNCE.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Foundation Model for Brain Lesion Segmentation with Mixture of Modality Experts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10246v2)** | 2024-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Brain lesion segmentation plays an essential role in neurological research and diagnosis. As brain lesions can be caused by various pathological alterations, different types of brain lesions tend to manifest with different characteristics on different imaging modalities. Due to this complexity, brain lesion segmentation methods are often developed in a task-specific manner. A specific segmentation model is developed for a particular lesion type and imaging modality. However, the use of task-specific models requires predetermination of the lesion type and imaging modality, which complicates their deployment in real-world scenarios. In this work, we propose a universal foundation model for 3D brain lesion segmentation, which can automatically segment different types of brain lesions for input data of various imaging modalities. We formulate a novel Mixture of Modality Experts (MoME) framework with multiple expert networks attending to different imaging modalities. A hierarchical gating network combines the expert predictions and fosters expertise collaboration. Furthermore, we introduce a curriculum learning strategy during training to avoid the degeneration of each expert network and preserve their specialization. We evaluated the proposed method on nine brain lesion datasets, encompassing five imaging modalities and eight lesion types. The results show that our model outperforms state-of-the-art universal models and provides promising generalization to unseen datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>The w...</summary><p>The work has been early accepted by MICCAI 2024</p></details> |
| **[Advancing Human Action Recognition with Foundation Models trained on Unlabeled Public Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08875v4)** | 2024-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increasing variety and quantity of tagged multimedia content on a variety of online platforms offer a unique opportunity to advance the field of human action recognition. In this study, we utilize 283,582 unique, unlabeled TikTok video clips, categorized into 386 hashtags, to train a domain-specific foundation model for action recognition. We employ VideoMAE V2, an advanced model integrating Masked Autoencoders (MAE) with Vision Transformers (ViT), pre-trained on this diverse collection of unstructured videos. Our model, fine-tuned on established action recognition benchmarks such as UCF101 and HMDB51, achieves state-of-the-art results: 99.05% on UCF101, 86.08% on HMDB51, 85.51% on Kinetics-400, and 74.27% on Something-Something V2 using the ViT-giant backbone. These results highlight the potential of using unstructured and unlabeled videos as a valuable source of diverse and dynamic content for training foundation models. Our investigation confirms that while initial increases in pre-training data volume significantly enhance model performance, the gains diminish as the dataset size continues to expand. Our findings emphasize two critical axioms in self-supervised learning for computer vision: (1) additional pre-training data can yield diminishing benefits for some datasets and (2) quality is more important than quantity in self-supervised learning, especially when building foundation models.</p></details> | 10 pages |
| **[OmniGenome: Aligning RNA Sequences with Secondary Structures in Genomic Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11242v1)** | 2024-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The structures of RNA sequences play a vital role in various cellular processes, while existing genomic foundation models (FMs) have struggled with precise sequence-structure alignment, due to the complexity of exponential combinations of nucleotide bases. In this study, we introduce OmniGenome, a foundation model that addresses this critical challenge of sequence-structure alignment in RNA FMs. OmniGenome bridges the sequences with secondary structures using structure-contextualized modeling, enabling hard in-silico genomic tasks that existing FMs cannot handle, e.g., RNA design tasks. The results on two comprehensive genomic benchmarks show that OmniGenome achieves state-of-the-art performance on complex RNA subtasks. For example, OmniGenome solved 74% of complex puzzles, compared to SpliceBERT which solved only 3% of the puzzles. Besides, OmniGenome solves most of the puzzles within $1$ hour, while the existing methods usually allocate $24$ hours for each puzzle. Overall, OmniGenome establishes wide genomic application cases and offers profound insights into biological mechanisms from the perspective of sequence-structure alignment.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted to NeurIPS 2024, 19 pages</p></details> |
| **[Foundational Autoraters: Taming Large Language Models for Better Automatic Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10817v1)** | 2024-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As large language models (LLMs) advance, it becomes more challenging to reliably evaluate their output due to the high costs of human evaluation. To make progress towards better LLM autoraters, we introduce FLAMe, a family of Foundational Large Autorater Models. FLAMe is trained on our large and diverse collection of 100+ quality assessment tasks comprising 5M+ human judgments, curated and standardized using publicly released human evaluations from previous research. FLAMe significantly improves generalization to a wide variety of held-out tasks, outperforming LLMs trained on proprietary data like GPT-4 and Claude-3 on many tasks. We show that FLAMe can also serve as a powerful starting point for further downstream fine-tuning, using reward modeling evaluation as a case study (FLAMe-RM). Notably, on RewardBench, our FLAMe-RM-24B model (with an accuracy of 87.8%) is the top-performing generative model trained exclusively on permissively licensed data, outperforming both GPT-4-0125 (85.9%) and GPT-4o (84.7%). Additionally, we explore a more computationally efficient approach using a novel tail-patch fine-tuning strategy to optimize our FLAMe multitask mixture for reward modeling evaluation (FLAMe-Opt-RM), offering competitive RewardBench performance while requiring approximately 25x less training datapoints. Overall, our FLAMe variants outperform all popular proprietary LLM-as-a-Judge models we consider across 8 out of 12 autorater evaluation benchmarks, encompassing 53 quality assessment tasks, including RewardBench and LLM-AggreFact. Finally, our analysis reveals that FLAMe is significantly less biased than these LLM-as-a-Judge models on the CoBBLEr autorater bias benchmark, while effectively identifying high-quality responses for code generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages, 5 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |

For the first time, we provide a preliminary investigation with similar interpretability methods for medical imaging. Specifically, we analyze the features from a ViT-Small encoder obtained from a pathology Foundation Model via application to two datasets: one dataset of pathology images, and one dataset of pathology images paired with spatial transcriptomics. We discover an interpretable representation of cell and tissue morphology, along with gene expression within the model embedding space. Our work paves the way for further exploration around interpretable feature dimensions and their utility for medical and clinical applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Aligning Neuronal Coding of Dynamic Visual Scenes with Foundation Vision Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10737v1)** | 2024-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Our brains represent the ever-changing environment with neurons in a highly dynamic fashion. The temporal features of visual pixels in dynamic natural scenes are entrapped in the neuronal responses of the retina. It is crucial to establish the intrinsic temporal relationship between visual pixels and neuronal responses. Recent foundation vision models have paved an advanced way of understanding image pixels. Yet, neuronal coding in the brain largely lacks a deep understanding of its alignment with pixels. Most previous studies employ static images or artificial videos derived from static images for emulating more real and complicated stimuli. Despite these simple scenarios effectively help to separate key factors influencing visual coding, complex temporal relationships receive no consideration. To decompose the temporal features of visual coding in natural scenes, here we propose Vi-ST, a spatiotemporal convolutional neural network fed with a self-supervised Vision Transformer (ViT) prior, aimed at unraveling the temporal-based encoding patterns of retinal neuronal populations. The model demonstrates robust predictive performance in generalization tests. Furthermore, through detailed ablation experiments, we demonstrate the significance of each temporal module. Furthermore, we introduce a visual coding evaluation metric designed to integrate temporal considerations and compare the impact of different numbers of neuronal populations on complementary coding. In conclusion, our proposed Vi-ST demonstrates a novel modeling framework for neuronal coding of dynamic visual scenes in the brain, effectively aligning our brain representation of video with neuronal activity.
