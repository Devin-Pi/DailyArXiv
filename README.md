Previous studies mainly explore large-scale hotspots by visual analysis or simple indexes, where hotspots usually cover the entire central business district, train stations, or dense residential areas, reaching a radius of hundreds or even thousands of meters. However, the spatial arrangement patterns of small-scale hotspots, reflecting the specific popular pick-up and drop-off locations, have not received much attention. This study quantitatively examines the spatial arrangement of fine-grained local hotspots in Wuhan and Beijing, China, using taxi trajectory data. Hotspots are adaptatively identified with sizes of 90m*90m in Wuhan and 105m*105m in Beijing according to identification method. Findings show popular hotspots are typically surrounded by less popular ones, though regions with many popular hotspots inhibit the presence of less popular ones. We term these configurations as hierarchical accompany and inhibiting patterns. Finally, inspired by both patterns, a KNN-based model is developed to describe these relationships, successfully reproducing the spatial distribution of less popular hotspots based on the most popular ones. These insights enhance understanding of local urban structures and support urban planning.</p></details> |  |
| **[ITINERA: Integrating Spatial Optimization with Large Language Models for Open-domain Urban Itinerary Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07204v3)** | 2024-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Citywalk, a recently popular form of urban travel, requires genuine personalization and understanding of fine-grained requests compared to traditional itinerary planning. In this paper, we introduce the novel task of Open-domain Urban Itinerary Planning (OUIP), which generates personalized urban itineraries from user requests in natural language. We then present ITINERA, an OUIP system that integrates spatial optimization with large language models to provide customized urban itineraries based on user needs. This involves decomposing user requests, selecting candidate points of interest (POIs), ordering the POIs based on cluster-aware spatial optimization, and generating the itinerary. Experiments on real-world datasets and the performance of the deployed system demonstrate our system's capacity to deliver personalized and spatially coherent itineraries compared to current solutions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatial Reuse in IEEE 802.11bn Coordinated Multi-AP WLANs: A Throughput Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16390v1)** | 2024-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>IEEE 802.11 networks continuously adapt to meet the stringent requirements of emerging applications like cloud gaming, eXtended Reality (XR), and video streaming services, which require high throughput, low latency, and high reliability. To address these challenges, Coordinated Spatial Reuse (C-SR) can potentially contribute to optimizing spectrum resource utilization. This mechanism is expected to enable a higher number of simultaneous transmissions, thereby boosting spectral efficiency in dense environments and increasing the overall network performance. In this paper, we focus on the performance analysis of C-SR in Wi-Fi 8 networks. In particular, we consider an implementation of C-SR where channel access and inter-Access Point (AP) communication are performed over-the-air using the Distributed Coordination Function (DCF). For such a purpose, we leverage the well-known Bianchi's throughput model and extend it to support multi-AP transmissions via C-SR. Numerical results in a WLAN network that consists of four APs show C-SR throughput gains ranging from 54% to 280% depending on the inter-AP distance and the position of the stations in the area.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mobius: A High Efficient Spatial-Temporal Parallel Training Paradigm for Text-to-Video Generation Task](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06617v4)** | 2024-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inspired by the success of the text-to-image (T2I) generation task, many researchers are devoting themselves to the text-to-video (T2V) generation task. Most of the T2V frameworks usually inherit from the T2I model and add extra-temporal layers of training to generate dynamic videos, which can be viewed as a fine-tuning task. However, the traditional 3D-Unet is a serial mode and the temporal layers follow the spatial layers, which will result in high GPU memory and training time consumption according to its serial feature flow. We believe that this serial mode will bring more training costs with the large diffusion model and massive datasets, which are not environmentally friendly and not suitable for the development of the T2V. Therefore, we propose a highly efficient spatial-temporal parallel training paradigm for T2V tasks, named Mobius. In our 3D-Unet, the temporal layers and spatial layers are parallel, which optimizes the feature flow and backpropagation. The Mobius will save 24% GPU memory and 12% training time, which can greatly improve the T2V fine-tuning task and provide a novel insight for the AIGC community. We will release our codes in the future.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion Transformer Captures Spatial-Temporal Dependencies: A Theory for Gaussian Process Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16134v1)** | 2024-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion Transformer, the backbone of Sora for video generation, successfully scales the capacity of diffusion models, pioneering new avenues for high-fidelity sequential data generation. Unlike static data such as images, sequential data consists of consecutive data frames indexed by time, exhibiting rich spatial and temporal dependencies. These dependencies represent the underlying dynamic model and are critical to validate the generated data. In this paper, we make the first theoretical step towards bridging diffusion transformers for capturing spatial-temporal dependencies. Specifically, we establish score approximation and distribution estimation guarantees of diffusion transformers for learning Gaussian process data with covariance functions of various decay patterns. We highlight how the spatial-temporal dependencies are captured and affect learning efficiency. Our study proposes a novel transformer approximation theory, where the transformer acts to unroll an algorithm. We support our theoretical results by numerical experiments, providing strong evidence that spatial-temporal dependencies are captured within attention layers, aligning with our approximation theory.</p></details> | 52 pages, 8 figures |
| **[SwinSF: Image Reconstruction from Spatial-Temporal Spike Streams](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15708v1)** | 2024-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The spike camera, with its high temporal resolution, low latency, and high dynamic range, addresses high-speed imaging challenges like motion blur. It captures photons at each pixel independently, creating binary spike streams rich in temporal information but challenging for image reconstruction. Current algorithms, both traditional and deep learning-based, still need to be improved in the utilization of the rich temporal detail and the restoration of the details of the reconstructed image. To overcome this, we introduce Swin Spikeformer (SwinSF), a novel model for dynamic scene reconstruction from spike streams. SwinSF is composed of Spike Feature Extraction, Spatial-Temporal Feature Extraction, and Final Reconstruction Module. It combines shifted window self-attention and proposed temporal spike attention, ensuring a comprehensive feature extraction that encapsulates both spatial and temporal dynamics, leading to a more robust and accurate reconstruction of spike streams. Furthermore, we build a new synthesized dataset for spike image reconstruction which matches the resolution of the latest spike camera, ensuring its relevance and applicability to the latest developments in spike camera imaging. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed network SwinSF sets a new benchmark, achieving state-of-the-art performance across a series of datasets, including both real-world and synthesized data across various resolutions. Our codes and proposed dataset will be available soon.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bayes-Optimal Estimation in Generalized Linear Models via Spatial Coupling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08404v2)** | 2024-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the problem of signal estimation in a generalized linear model (GLM). GLMs include many canonical problems in statistical estimation, such as linear regression, phase retrieval, and 1-bit compressed sensing. Recent work has precisely characterized the asymptotic minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) for GLMs with i.i.d. Gaussian sensing matrices. However, in many models there is a significant gap between the MMSE and the performance of the best known feasible estimators. In this work, we address this issue by considering GLMs defined via spatially coupled sensing matrices. We propose an efficient approximate message passing (AMP) algorithm for estimation and prove that with a simple choice of spatially coupled design, the MSE of a carefully tuned AMP estimator approaches the asymptotic MMSE in the high-dimensional limit. To prove the result, we first rigorously characterize the asymptotic performance of AMP for a GLM with a generic spatially coupled design. This characterization is in terms of a deterministic recursion (`state evolution') that depends on the parameters defining the spatial coupling. Then, using a simple spatially coupled design and a judicious choice of functions for the AMP algorithm, we analyze the fixed points of the resulting state evolution and show that it achieves the asymptotic MMSE. Numerical results for phase retrieval and rectified linear regression show that spatially coupled designs can yield substantially lower MSE than i.i.d. Gaussian designs at finite dimensions when used with AMP algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>41 pa...</summary><p>41 pages, 4 figures.

| **[Spatial-Temporal Cross-View Contrastive Pre-training for Check-in Sequence Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15899v1)** | 2024-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid growth of location-based services (LBS) has yielded massive amounts of data on human mobility. Effectively extracting meaningful representations for user-generated check-in sequences is pivotal for facilitating various downstream services. However, the user-generated check-in data are simultaneously influenced by the surrounding objective circumstances and the user's subjective intention. Specifically, the temporal uncertainty and spatial diversity exhibited in check-in data make it difficult to capture the macroscopic spatial-temporal patterns of users and to understand the semantics of user mobility activities. Furthermore, the distinct characteristics of the temporal and spatial information in check-in sequences call for an effective fusion method to incorporate these two types of information. In this paper, we propose a novel Spatial-Temporal Cross-view Contrastive Representation (STCCR) framework for check-in sequence representation learning. Specifically, STCCR addresses the above challenges by employing self-supervision from "spatial topic" and "temporal intention" views, facilitating effective fusion of spatial and temporal information at the semantic level. Besides, STCCR leverages contrastive clustering to uncover users' shared spatial topics from diverse mobility activities, while employing angular momentum contrast to mitigate the impact of temporal uncertainty and noise. We extensively evaluate STCCR on three real-world datasets and demonstrate its superior performance across three downstream tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Transformer-based RGB-T Tracking with Channel and Spatial Feature Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03177v2)** | 2024-07-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>How to better fuse cross-modal features is the core issue of RGB-T tracking. Some previous methods either insufficiently fuse RGB and TIR features, or depend on intermediaries containing information from both modalities to achieve cross-modal information interaction. The former does not fully exploit the potential of using only RGB and TIR information of the template or search region for channel and spatial feature fusion, and the latter lacks direct interaction between the template and search area, which limits the model's ability to fully exploit the original semantic information of both modalities. To alleviate these limitations, we explore how to improve the performance of a visual Transformer by using direct fusion of cross-modal channels and spatial features, and propose CSTNet. CSTNet uses ViT as a backbone and inserts cross-modal channel feature fusion modules (CFM) and cross-modal spatial feature fusion modules (SFM) for direct interaction between RGB and TIR features. The CFM performs parallel joint channel enhancement and joint multilevel spatial feature modeling of RGB and TIR features and sums the features, and then globally integrates the sum feature with the original features. The SFM uses cross-attention to model the spatial relationship of cross-modal features and then introduces a convolutional feedforward network for joint spatial and channel integration of multimodal features. We retrain the model with CSNet as the pre-training weights in the model with CFM and SFM removed, and propose CSTNet-small, which achieves 36% reduction in parameters and 24% reduction in Flops, and 50% speedup with a 1-2% performance decrease. Comprehensive experiments show that CSTNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on three public RGB-T tracking benchmarks. Code is available at https://github.com/LiYunfengLYF/CSTNet.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication.

| **[SpatialTouch: Exploring Spatial Data Visualizations in Cross-reality](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14833v1)** | 2024-07-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose and study a novel cross-reality environment that seamlessly integrates a monoscopic 2D surface (an interactive screen with touch and pen input) with a stereoscopic 3D space (an augmented reality HMD) to jointly host spatial data visualizations. This innovative approach combines the best of two conventional methods of displaying and manipulating spatial 3D data, enabling users to fluidly explore diverse visual forms using tailored interaction techniques. Providing such effective 3D data exploration techniques is pivotal for conveying its intricate spatial structures -- often at multiple spatial or semantic scales -- across various application domains and requiring diverse visual representations for effective visualization. To understand user reactions to our new environment, we began with an elicitation user study, in which we captured their responses and interactions. We observed that users adapted their interaction approaches based on perceived visual representations, with natural transitions in spatial awareness and actions while navigating across the physical surface. Our findings then informed the development of a design space for spatial data exploration in cross-reality. We thus developed cross-reality environments tailored to three distinct domains: for 3D molecular structure data, for 3D point cloud data, and for 3D anatomical data. In particular, we designed interaction techniques that account for the inherent features of interactions in both spaces, facilitating various forms of interaction, including mid-air gestures, touch interactions, pen interactions, and combinations thereof, to enhance the users' sense of presence and engagement. We assessed the usability of our environment with biologists, focusing on its use for domain research. In addition, we evaluated our interaction transition designs with virtual and mixed-reality experts to gather further insights.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 20 figures, IEEE VIS2024</p></details> |
| **[Normalizing Basis Functions: Approximate Stationary Models for Large Spatial Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13821v2)** | 2024-07-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In geostatistics, traditional spatial models often rely on the Gaussian Process (GP) to fit stationary covariances to data. It is well known that this approach becomes computationally infeasible when dealing with large data volumes, necessitating the use of approximate methods. A powerful class of methods approximate the GP as a sum of basis functions with random coefficients. Although this technique offers computational efficiency, it does not inherently guarantee a stationary covariance. To mitigate this issue, the basis functions can be "normalized" to maintain a constant marginal variance, avoiding unwanted artifacts and edge effects. This allows for the fitting of nearly stationary models to large, potentially non-stationary datasets, providing a rigorous base to extend to more complex problems. Unfortunately, the process of normalizing these basis functions is computationally demanding. To address this, we introduce two fast and accurate algorithms to the normalization step, allowing for efficient prediction on fine grids. The practical value of these algorithms is showcased in the context of a spatial analysis on a large dataset, where significant computational speedups are achieved. While implementation and testing are done specifically within the LatticeKrig framework, these algorithms can be adapted to other basis function methods operating on regular grids.</p></details> | Version 2 |
| **[I Know About "Up"! Enhancing Spatial Reasoning in Visual Language Models Through 3D Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14133v1)** | 2024-07-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual Language Models (VLMs) are essential for various tasks, particularly visual reasoning tasks, due to their robust multi-modal information integration, visual reasoning capabilities, and contextual awareness. However, existing \VLMs{}' visual spatial reasoning capabilities are often inadequate, struggling even with basic tasks such as distinguishing left from right. To address this, we propose the \ours{} model, designed to enhance the visual spatial reasoning abilities of VLMS. ZeroVLM employs Zero-1-to-3, a 3D reconstruction model for obtaining different views of the input images and incorporates a prompting mechanism to further improve visual spatial reasoning. Experimental results on four visual spatial reasoning datasets show that our \ours{} achieves up to 19.48% accuracy improvement, which indicates the effectiveness of the 3D reconstruction and prompting mechanisms of our ZeroVLM.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatially-clustered spatial autoregressive models with application to agricultural market concentration in Europe](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15874v1)** | 2024-07-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we present an extension of the spatially-clustered linear regression models, namely, the spatially-clustered spatial autoregression (SCSAR) model, to deal with spatial heterogeneity issues in clustering procedures. In particular, we extend classical spatial econometrics models, such as the spatial autoregressive model, the spatial error model, and the spatially-lagged model, by allowing the regression coefficients to be spatially varying according to a cluster-wise structure. Cluster memberships and regression coefficients are jointly estimated through a penalized maximum likelihood algorithm which encourages neighboring units to belong to the same spatial cluster with shared regression coefficients. Motivated by the increase of observed values of the Gini index for the agricultural production in Europe between 2010 and 2020, the proposed methodology is employed to assess the presence of local spatial spillovers on the market concentration index for the European regions in the last decade. Empirical findings support the hypothesis of fragmentation of the European agricultural market, as the regions can be well represented by a clustering structure partitioning the continent into three-groups, roughly approximated by a division among Western, North Central and Southeastern regions. Also, we detect heterogeneous local effects induced by the selected explanatory variables on the regional market concentration. In particular, we find that variables associated with social, territorial and economic relevance of the agricultural sector seem to act differently throughout the spatial dimension, across the clusters and with respect to the pooled model, and temporal dimension.</p></details> |  |
| **[ReGround: Improving Textual and Spatial Grounding at No Cost](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13589v3)** | 2024-07-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When an image generation process is guided by both a text prompt and spatial cues, such as a set of bounding boxes, do these elements work in harmony, or does one dominate the other? Our analysis of a pretrained image diffusion model that integrates gated self-attention into the U-Net reveals that spatial grounding often outweighs textual grounding due to the sequential flow from gated self-attention to cross-attention. We demonstrate that such bias can be significantly mitigated without sacrificing accuracy in either grounding by simply rewiring the network architecture, changing from sequential to parallel for gated self-attention and cross-attention. This surprisingly simple yet effective solution does not require any fine-tuning of the network but significantly reduces the trade-off between the two groundings. Our experiments demonstrate significant improvements from the original GLIGEN to the rewired version in the trade-off between textual grounding and spatial grounding.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ECCV 2024.

| **[Context-Guided Spatial Feature Reconstruction for Efficient Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06228v2)** | 2024-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semantic segmentation is an important task for numerous applications but it is still quite challenging to achieve advanced performance with limited computational costs. In this paper, we present CGRSeg, an efficient yet competitive segmentation framework based on context-guided spatial feature reconstruction. A Rectangular Self-Calibration Module is carefully designed for spatial feature reconstruction and pyramid context extraction. It captures the axial global context in both horizontal and vertical directions to explicitly model rectangular key areas. A shape self-calibration function is designed to make the key areas closer to foreground objects. Besides, a lightweight Dynamic Prototype Guided head is proposed to improve the classification of foreground objects by explicit class embedding. Our CGRSeg is extensively evaluated on ADE20K, COCO-Stuff, and Pascal Context benchmarks, and achieves state-of-the-art semantic performance. Specifically, it achieves $43.6\%$ mIoU on ADE20K with only $4.0$ GFLOPs, which is $0.9\%$ and $2.5\%$ mIoU better than SeaFormer and SegNeXt but with about $38.0\%$ fewer GFLOPs.

| **[SpaDiT: Diffusion Transformer for Spatial Gene Expression Prediction using scRNA-seq](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13182v1)** | 2024-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid development of spatial transcriptomics (ST) technologies is revolutionizing our understanding of the spatial organization of biological tissues. Current ST methods, categorized into next-generation sequencing-based (seq-based) and fluorescence in situ hybridization-based (image-based) methods, offer innovative insights into the functional dynamics of biological tissues. However, these methods are limited by their cellular resolution and the quantity of genes they can detect. To address these limitations, we propose SpaDiT, a deep learning method that utilizes a diffusion generative model to integrate scRNA-seq and ST data for the prediction of undetected genes. By employing a Transformer-based diffusion model, SpaDiT not only accurately predicts unknown genes but also effectively generates the spatial structure of ST genes. We have demonstrated the effectiveness of SpaDiT through extensive experiments on both seq-based and image-based ST data. SpaDiT significantly contributes to ST gene prediction methods with its innovative approach. Compared to eight leading baseline methods, SpaDiT achieved state-of-the-art performance across multiple metrics, highlighting its substantial bioinformatics contribution.</p></details> |  |
| **[ODMixer: Fine-grained Spatial-temporal MLP for Metro Origin-Destination Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15734v3)** | 2024-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Metro Origin-Destination (OD) prediction is a crucial yet challenging spatial-temporal prediction task in urban computing, which aims to accurately forecast cross-station ridership for optimizing metro scheduling and enhancing overall transport efficiency. Analyzing fine-grained and comprehensive relations among stations effectively is imperative for metro OD prediction. However, existing metro OD models either mix information from multiple OD pairs from the station's perspective or exclusively focus on a subset of OD pairs. These approaches may overlook fine-grained relations among OD pairs, leading to difficulties in predicting potential anomalous conditions. To address these challenges, we analyze traffic variations from the perspective of all OD pairs and propose a fine-grained spatial-temporal MLP architecture for metro OD prediction, namely ODMixer. Specifically, our ODMixer has double-branch structure and involves the Channel Mixer, the Multi-view Mixer, and the Bidirectional Trend Learner. The Channel Mixer aims to capture short-term temporal relations among OD pairs, the Multi-view Mixer concentrates on capturing relations from both origin and destination perspectives. To model long-term temporal relations, we introduce the Bidirectional Trend Learner. Extensive experiments on two large-scale metro OD prediction datasets HZMOD and SHMO demonstrate the advantages of our ODMixer.

| **[Enhancing Gene Expression Prediction from Histology Images with Spatial Transcriptomics Completion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13027v1)** | 2024-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial Transcriptomics is a novel technology that aligns histology images with spatially resolved gene expression profiles. Although groundbreaking, it struggles with gene capture yielding high corruption in acquired data. Given potential applications, recent efforts have focused on predicting transcriptomic profiles solely from histology images. However, differences in databases, preprocessing techniques, and training hyperparameters hinder a fair comparison between methods. To address these challenges, we present a systematically curated and processed database collected from 26 public sources, representing an 8.6-fold increase compared to previous works. Additionally, we propose a state-of-the-art transformer based completion technique for inferring missing gene expression, which significantly boosts the performance of transcriptomic profile predictions across all datasets. Altogether, our contributions constitute the most comprehensive benchmark of gene expression prediction from histology images to date and a stepping stone for future research on spatial transcriptomics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bayesian spatial functional data clustering: applications in disease surveillance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12633v1)** | 2024-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Our method extends the application of random spanning trees to cases where the response variable belongs to the exponential family, making it suitable for a wide range of real-world scenarios, including non-Gaussian likelihoods. The proposed model addresses the limitations of previous spatial clustering methods by allowing all within-cluster model parameters to be cluster-specific, thus offering greater flexibility. Additionally, we propose a Bayesian inference algorithm that overcomes the computational challenges associated with the reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo (RJ-MCMC) algorithm by employing composition sampling and the integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA) to compute the marginal distribution necessary for the acceptance probability. This enhancement improves the mixing and feasibility of Bayesian inference for complex models. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through simulation studies and apply it to real-world disease mapping applications: COVID-19 in the United States of America, and dengue fever in the states of Minas Gerais and S\~ao Paulo, Brazil. Our results highlight the model's capability to uncover meaningful spatial patterns and temporal dynamics in disease outbreaks, providing valuable insights for public health decision-making and resource allocation.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Scheduler for Real-Time Service in Wi-Fi 8 Multi-AP Networks With Parameterized Spatial Reuse](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12523v1)** | 2024-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-time applications (RTAs) require low delays and impose a significant challenge to Wi-Fi. In Wi-Fi, high delays are often caused by waiting for the channel to become idle. This problem can be solved with Parameterized Spatial Reuse (PSR), which allows a station (STA) to transmit its frame with reduced power simultaneously with a triggered uplink transmission in an overlapping network. The PSR opportunity depends on the pathloss between involved STAs, so the same transmission may allow PSR for one STA but not for another one. Thus, to satisfy tight delay constraints in dense overlapping networks, access points (APs) in the same area shall often allow PSR for every STA with RTA traffic. This letter proposes a fast scheduler enabling frequent PSR transmissions for RTA traffic. The scheduler uses Multi-AP coordination, the feature of upcoming Wi-Fi 8. With simulations, we show that it almost halves the delay for RTA traffic and does not deteriorate the quality of service for other traffic compared with an airtime fairness scheduler.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Natural Language-Guided Drones: GeoText-1652 Benchmark with Spatial Relation Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12751v3)** | 2024-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Navigating drones through natural language commands remains challenging due to the dearth of accessible multi-modal datasets and the stringent precision requirements for aligning visual and textual data. To address this pressing need, we introduce GeoText-1652, a new natural language-guided geo-localization benchmark. This dataset is systematically constructed through an interactive human-computer process leveraging Large Language Model (LLM) driven annotation techniques in conjunction with pre-trained vision models. GeoText-1652 extends the established University-1652 image dataset with spatial-aware text annotations, thereby establishing one-to-one correspondences between image, text, and bounding box elements. We further introduce a new optimization objective to leverage fine-grained spatial associations, called blending spatial matching, for region-level spatial relation matching. Extensive experiments reveal that our approach maintains a competitive recall rate comparing other prevailing cross-modality methods. This underscores the promising potential of our approach in elevating drone control and navigation through the seamless integration of natural language commands in real-world scenarios.</p></details> | ECCV 2024 |
| **[Sensor-based Multi-agent Coverage Control with Spatial Separation in Unstructured Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01710v3)** | 2024-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-robot systems have increasingly become instrumental in tackling search and coverage problems. However, the challenge of optimizing task efficiency without compromising task success still persists, particularly in expansive, unstructured environments with dense obstacles. This paper presents an innovative, decentralized Voronoi-based approach for search and coverage to reactively navigate these complexities while maintaining safety. This approach leverages the active sensing capabilities of multi-robot systems to supplement GIS (Geographic Information System), offering a more comprehensive and real-time understanding of the environment. Based on point cloud data, which is inherently non-convex and unstructured, this method efficiently generates collision-free Voronoi regions using only local sensing information through spatial decomposition and spherical mirroring techniques. Then, deadlock-aware guided map integrated with a gradient-optimized, centroid Voronoi-based coverage control policy, is constructed to improve efficiency by avoiding exhaustive searches and local sensing pitfalls. The effectiveness of our algorithm has been validated through extensive numerical simulations in high-fidelity environments, demonstrating significant improvements in both task success rate, coverage ratio, and task execution time compared with others.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatial Coherence Loss: All Objects Matter in Salient and Camouflaged Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18698v2)** | 2024-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generic object detection is a category-independent task that relies on accurate modeling of objectness. We show that for accurate semantic analysis, the network needs to learn all object-level predictions that appear at any stage of learning, including the pre-defined ground truth (GT) objects and the ambiguous decoy objects that the network misidentifies as foreground. Yet, most relevant models focused mainly on improving the learning of the GT objects. A few methods that consider decoy objects utilize loss functions that only focus on the single-response, i.e., the loss response of a single ambiguous pixel, and thus do not benefit from the wealth of information that an object-level ambiguity learning design can provide. Inspired by the human visual system, which first discerns the boundaries of ambiguous regions before delving into the semantic meaning, we propose a novel loss function, Spatial Coherence Loss (SCLoss), that incorporates the mutual response between adjacent pixels into the widely-used single-response loss functions. We demonstrate that the proposed SCLoss can gradually learn the ambiguous regions by detecting and emphasizing their boundaries in a self-adaptive manner. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that replacing popular loss functions with SCLoss can improve the performance of current state-of-the-art (SOTA) salient or camouflaged object detection (SOD or COD) models. We also demonstrate that combining SCLoss with other loss functions can further improve performance and result in SOTA outcomes for different applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Spatial Explanations: Explainable Face Recognition in the Frequency Domain](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11941v1)** | 2024-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The need for more transparent face recognition (FR), along with other visual-based decision-making systems has recently attracted more attention in research, society, and industry. The reasons why two face images are matched or not matched by a deep learning-based face recognition system are not obvious due to the high number of parameters and the complexity of the models. However, it is important for users, operators, and developers to ensure trust and accountability of the system and to analyze drawbacks such as biased behavior. While many previous works use spatial semantic maps to highlight the regions that have a significant influence on the decision of the face recognition system, frequency components which are also considered by CNNs, are neglected. In this work, we take a step forward and investigate explainable face recognition in the unexplored frequency domain. This makes this work the first to propose explainability of verification-based decisions in the frequency domain, thus explaining the relative influence of the frequency components of each input toward the obtained outcome. To achieve this, we manipulate face images in the spatial frequency domain and investigate the impact on verification outcomes. In extensive quantitative experiments, along with investigating two special scenarios cases, cross-resolution FR and morphing attacks (the latter in supplementary material), we observe the applicability of our proposed frequency-based explanations.</p></details> |  |
| **[SCP-Diff: Spatial-Categorical Joint Prior for Diffusion Based Semantic Image Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09638v2)** | 2024-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semantic image synthesis (SIS) shows good promises for sensor simulation. However, current best practices in this field, based on GANs, have not yet reached the desired level of quality. As latent diffusion models make significant strides in image generation, we are prompted to evaluate ControlNet, a notable method for its dense control capabilities. Our investigation uncovered two primary issues with its results: the presence of weird sub-structures within large semantic areas and the misalignment of content with the semantic mask. Through empirical study, we pinpointed the cause of these problems as a mismatch between the noised training data distribution and the standard normal prior applied at the inference stage. To address this challenge, we developed specific noise priors for SIS, encompassing spatial, categorical, and a novel spatial-categorical joint prior for inference. This approach, which we have named SCP-Diff, has set new state-of-the-art results in SIS on Cityscapes, ADE20K and COCO-Stuff, yielding a FID as low as 10.53 on Cityscapes. The code and models can be accessed via the project page.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://air-discover.github.io/SCP-Diff/</p></details> |
| **[Spatial-spectral Cell-free Networks: A Large-scale Case Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11389v1)** | 2024-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper studies the large-scale cell-free networks where dense distributed access points (APs) serve many users. As a promising next-generation network architecture, cell-free networks enable ultra-reliable connections and minimal fading/blockage, which are much favorable to the millimeter wave and Terahertz transmissions. However, conventional beam management with large phased arrays in a cell is very time-consuming in the higher-frequencies, and could be worsened when deploying a large number of coordinated APs in the cell-free systems. To tackle this challenge, the spatial-spectral cell-free networks with the leaky-wave antennas are established by coupling the propagation angles with frequencies. The beam training overhead in this direction can be significantly reduced through exploiting such spatial-spectral coupling effects. In the considered large-scale spatial-spectral cell-free networks, a novel subchannel allocation solution at sub-terahertz bands is proposed by leveraging the relationship between cross-entropy method and mixture model. Since initial access and AP clustering play a key role in achieving scalable large-scale cell-free networks, a hierarchical AP clustering solution is proposed to make the joint initial access and cluster formation, which is adaptive and has no need to initialize the number of AP clusters. After AP clustering, a subchannel allocation solution is devised to manage the interference between AP clusters. Numerical results are presented to confirm the efficiency of the proposed solutions and indicate that besides subchannel allocation, AP clustering can also have a big impact on the large-scale cell-free network performance at sub-terahertz bands.</p></details> |  |

By reconstructing missing pixel/voxel information in visible patches, a ViT encoder can aggregate contextual information for downstream tasks. But, existing MAE pre-training methods, which were specifically developed with the ViT architecture, lack the ability to capture geometric shape and spatial information, which is critical for medical image segmentation tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel extension of known MAEs for self pre-training (i.e., models pre-trained on the same target dataset) for 3D medical image segmentation. (1) We propose a new topological loss to preserve geometric shape information by computing topological signatures of both the input and reconstructed volumes, learning geometric shape information. (2) We introduce a pre-text task that predicts the positions of the centers and eight corners of 3D crops, enabling the MAE to aggregate spatial information. (3) We extend the MAE pre-training strategy to a hybrid state-of-the-art (SOTA) medical image segmentation architecture and co-pretrain it alongside the ViT. (4) We develop a fine-tuned model for downstream segmentation tasks by complementing the pre-trained ViT encoder with our pre-trained SOTA model. Extensive experiments on five public 3D segmentation datasets show the effectiveness of our new approach.</p></details> |  |

While population sizes are commonly available for large administrative areas, such as wards in India, practical applications often demand knowledge of population density at smaller spatial scales. We explore the integration of alternative data sources, specifically satellite-derived products, including land cover, land use, street density, building heights, vegetation coverage, and drainage density. Using a case study focused on Bangalore City, India, with a ward-level population dataset for 198 wards and satellite-derived sources covering 786,702 pixels at a resolution of 30mX30m, we propose a semiparametric Bayesian spatial regression model for obtaining pixel-level population estimates. Given the high dimensionality of the problem, exact Bayesian inference is deemed impractical; we discuss an approximate Bayesian inference scheme based on the recently proposed max-and-smooth approach, a combination of Laplace approximation and Markov chain Monte Carlo. A simulation study validates the reasonable performance of our inferential approach. Mapping pixel-level estimates to the ward level demonstrates the effectiveness of our method in capturing the spatial distribution of population sizes. While our case study focuses on a demographic application, the methodology developed here readily applies to count-type spatial datasets from various scientific disciplines, where high-resolution alternative data sources are available.</p></details> | <details><summary>30 pa...</summary><p>30 pages, 7 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

Despite advancements in deep learning (DL) for automatic cine CMR segmentation, generalizability on unseen data remains a significant challenge. Recently, the segment-anything-model (SAM) has been invented as a segmentation foundation model, known for its accurate segmentation and more importantly, zero-shot generalization. SAM was trained on two-dimensional (2D) natural images; to adapt it for comprehensive cine CMR segmentation, we propose cineCMR-SAM which incorporates both temporal and spatial information through a modified model architecture. Compared to other state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, our model achieved superior data-specific model segmentation accuracy on the STACOM2011 when fine-tuned on this dataset and demonstrated superior zero-shot generalization on two other large public datasets (ACDC and M&Ms) unseen during fine-tuning. Additionally, we introduced a text prompt feature in cineCMR-SAM to specify the view type of input slices (short-axis or long-axis), enhancing performance across all view types.</p></details> | 10 pages, 3 figures |

However, real-world point cloud data inevitably contains noise, impacting model robustness. While recent efforts focus on enhancing robustness through various strategies, there still remains a gap in comprehensive analyzes from the standpoint of network architecture design. Unlike traditional methods that rely on generic techniques, our approach optimizes model robustness to noise corruption through network architecture design. Inspired by the token-mixing technique applied in 2D images, we propose Set-Mixer, a noise-robust aggregation module which facilitates communication among all points to extract geometric shape information and mitigating the influence of individual noise points. A sorting strategy is designed to enable our module to be invariant to point permutation, which also tackles the unordered structure of point cloud and introduces consistent relative spatial information. Experiments conducted on ModelNet40-C indicate that Set-Mixer significantly enhances the model performance on noisy point clouds, underscoring its potential to advance real-world applicability in 3D recognition and perception tasks.</p></details> | 22 pages, 9 figures |

By utilizing only a portion of IoV data instead of the entire dataset, the significant overheads associated with collecting and processing large amounts of data can be avoided. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework that utilizes sparse IoV data to achieve cost-effective TSE. Particularly, we propose a novel spatial-temporal attention model called the convolutional retentive network (CRNet) to improve the TSE accuracy by mining spatial-temporal traffic state correlations. The model employs the convolutional neural network (CNN) for spatial correlation aggregation and the retentive network (RetNet) based on the attention mechanism to extract temporal correlations. Extensive simulations on a real-world IoV dataset validate the advantage of the proposed TSE approach in achieving accurate TSE using sparse IoV data, demonstrating its cost effectiveness and practicality for real-world applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>need ...</summary><p>need further improvement</p></details> |

We encounter such geospatial videos on a daily basis and such videos have been growing in volume significantly. Yet, we do not have data management systems that allow users to interact with such data effectively. In this paper, we describe Spatialyze, a new framework for end-to-end querying of geospatial videos. Spatialyze comes with a domain-specific language where users can construct geospatial video analytic workflows using a 3-step, declarative, build-filter-observe paradigm. Internally, Spatialyze leverages the declarative nature of such workflows, the temporal-spatial metadata stored with videos, and physical behavior of real-world objects to optimize the execution of workflows. Our results using real-world videos and workflows show that Spatialyze can reduce execution time by up to 5.3x, while maintaining up to 97.1% accuracy compared to unoptimized execution.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://spatialyze.github.io</p></details> |

Accurate prediction of future network connectivity is essential for effective resource allocation in such environments. In this paper, we introduce the Spatial-Temporal Graph Encoder-Decoder (STGED) framework for Tactical Communication Networks that leverages both spatial and temporal features of network states to learn latent tactical behaviors effectively. STGED hierarchically utilizes graph-based attention mechanism to spatially encode a series of communication network states, leverages a recurrent neural network to temporally encode the evolution of states, and a fully-connected feed-forward network to decode the connectivity in the future state. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that STGED consistently outperforms baseline models by large margins across different time-steps input, achieving an accuracy of up to 99.2\% for the future state prediction task of tactical communication networks.</p></details> |  |

However, many factors complicate the task, including variability in different target categories and interference from complex backgrounds. In this paper, we utilize the knowledge of Deformable Convolution V3 (DCNv3) and multi-object segmentation to optimize our Spatially Adaptive Convolution Network (SACNet) in three aspects: feature extraction, model architecture, and loss constraint, simultaneously enhancing the perception of different segmentation targets. Firstly, we propose the Adaptive Receptive Field Module (ARFM), which combines DCNv3 with a series of customized block-level and architecture-level designs similar to transformers. This module can capture the unique features of different organs by adaptively adjusting the receptive field according to various targets. Secondly, we utilize ARFM as building blocks to construct the encoder-decoder of SACNet and partially share parameters between the encoder and decoder, making the network wider rather than deeper. This design achieves a shared lightweight decoder and a more parameter-efficient and effective framework. Lastly, we propose a novel continuity dynamic adjustment loss function, based on t-vMF dice loss and cross-entropy loss, to better balance easy and complex classes in segmentation. Experiments on 3D slice datasets from ACDC and Synapse demonstrate that SACNet delivers superior segmentation performance in multi-organ segmentation tasks compared to several existing methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[3D Small Object Detection with Dynamic Spatial Pruning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.03716v4)** | 2024-07-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose an efficient feature pruning strategy for 3D small object detection. Conventional 3D object detection methods struggle on small objects due to the weak geometric information from a small number of points. Although increasing the spatial resolution of feature representations can improve the detection performance on small objects, the additional computational overhead is unaffordable. With in-depth study, we observe the growth of computation mainly comes from the upsampling operation in the decoder of 3D detector. Motivated by this, we present a multi-level 3D detector named DSPDet3D which benefits from high spatial resolution to achieves high accuracy on small object detection, while reducing redundant computation by only focusing on small object areas. Specifically, we theoretically derive a dynamic spatial pruning (DSP) strategy to prune the redundant spatial representation of 3D scene in a cascade manner according to the distribution of objects. Then we design DSP module following this strategy and construct DSPDet3D with this efficient module. On ScanNet and TO-SCENE dataset, our method achieves leading performance on small object detection. Moreover, DSPDet3D trained with only ScanNet rooms can generalize well to scenes in larger scale. It takes less than 2s to directly process a whole building consisting of more than 4500k points while detecting out almost all objects, ranging from cups to beds, on a single RTX 3090 GPU.

| **[Spatial-Domain Wireless Jamming with Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13773v2)** | 2024-07-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Wireless communication infrastructure is a cornerstone of modern digital society, yet it remains vulnerable to the persistent threat of wireless jamming. Attackers can easily create radio interference to overshadow legitimate signals, leading to denial of service. The broadcast nature of radio signal propagation makes such attacks possible in the first place, but at the same time poses a challenge for the attacker: The jamming signal does not only reach the victim device but also other neighboring devices, preventing precise attack targeting. In this work, we solve this challenge by leveraging the emerging RIS technology, for the first time, for precise delivery of jamming signals. In particular, we propose a novel approach that allows for environment-adaptive spatial control of wireless jamming signals, granting a new degree of freedom to perform jamming attacks. We explore this novel method with extensive experimentation and demonstrate that our approach can disable the wireless communication of one or multiple victim devices while leaving neighboring devices unaffected. Notably, our method extends to challenging scenarios where wireless devices are very close to each other: We demonstrate complete denial-of-service of a Wi-Fi device while a second device located at a distance as close as 5 mm remains unaffected, sustaining wireless communication at a data rate of 25 Mbit/s. Lastly, we conclude by proposing potential countermeasures to thwart RIS-based spatial domain wireless jamming attacks.</p></details> |  |

Existing ICMH methods are limited by high training and storage overheads due to heavy design of task-specific networks. To address this issue, in this paper, we develop a novel lightweight adapter-based tuning framework for ICMH, named Adapt-ICMH, that better balances task performance and bitrates with reduced overheads. We propose a spatial-frequency modulation adapter (SFMA) that simultaneously eliminates non-semantic redundancy with a spatial modulation adapter, and enhances task-relevant frequency components and suppresses task-irrelevant frequency components with a frequency modulation adapter. The proposed adapter is plug-and-play and compatible with almost all existing learned image compression models without compromising the performance of pre-trained models. Experiments demonstrate that Adapt-ICMH consistently outperforms existing ICMH frameworks on various machine vision tasks with fewer fine-tuned parameters and reduced computational complexity.

Recently, most approaches address inconsistency problem using an auto-regressive manner conditioned on previous image-sentence pairs. However, they overlook the fact that story context is dispersed across all sentences. The auto-regressive approach fails to encode information from susequent image-sentence pairs, thus unable to capture the entirety of the story context. To address this, we introduce TemporalStory, leveraging Spatial-Temporal attention to model complex spatial and temporal dependencies in images, enabling the generation of coherent images based on a given storyline. In order to better understand the storyline context, we introduce a text adapter capable of integrating information from other sentences into the embedding of the current sentence. Additionally, to utilize scene changes between story images as guidance for the model, we propose the StoryFlow Adapter to measure the degree of change between images. Through extensive experiments on two popular benchmarks, PororoSV and FlintstonesSV, our TemporalStory outperforms the previous state-of-the-art in both story visualization and story continuation tasks.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, to address the issue of low accuracy in long-term forecasting of spatial-temporal big data on traffic flow, we propose an innovative model called Spatial-Temporal Retentive Network (ST-RetNet). We extend the Retentive Network to address the task of traffic flow forecasting. At the spatial scale, we integrate a topological graph structure into Spatial Retentive Network(S-RetNet), utilizing an adaptive adjacency matrix to extract dynamic spatial features of the road network. We also employ Graph Convolutional Networks to extract static spatial features of the road network. These two components are then fused to capture dynamic and static spatial correlations. At the temporal scale, we propose the Temporal Retentive Network(T-RetNet), which has been demonstrated to excel in capturing long-term dependencies in traffic flow patterns compared to other time series models, including Recurrent Neural Networks based and transformer models. We achieve the spatial-temporal traffic flow forecasting task by integrating S-RetNet and T-RetNet to form ST-RetNet. Through experimental comparisons conducted on four real-world datasets, we demonstrate that ST-RetNet outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches in traffic flow forecasting.</p></details> |  |

Wearable devices, such as wrist-worn sensors that monitor gross motor activity, have become prevalent and have kindled the emerging field of ``spatial energetics'' in environmental health sciences. We devise a Bayesian inferential framework for analyzing such data while accounting for information available on specific spatial coordinates comprising a trajectory or path using a Global Positioning System (GPS) device embedded within the wearable device. We offer full probabilistic inference with uncertainty quantification using spatial-temporal process models adapted for data generated from ``actigraph'' units as the subject traverses a path or trajectory in their daily routine. Anticipating the need for fast inference for mobile health data, we pursue exact inference using conjugate Bayesian models and employ predictive stacking to assimilate inference across these individual models. This circumvents issues with iterative estimation algorithms such as Markov chain Monte Carlo. We devise Bayesian predictive stacking in this context for models that treat time as discrete epochs and that treat time as continuous. We illustrate our methods with simulation experiments and analysis of data from the Physical Activity through Sustainable Transport Approaches (PASTA-LA) study conducted by the Fielding School of Public Health at the University of California, Los Angeles.</p></details> | 38 pages, 13 figures |

To demonstrate the merits of our approach, we have adapted the Mini-Splatting architecture to integrate textured Gaussians without increasing the number of Gaussians. Our experiments across multiple real-world datasets show that Textured-GS consistently outperforms both the baseline Mini-Splatting and standard 3DGS in terms of visual fidelity. The results highlight the potential of Textured-GS to advance Gaussian-based rendering technologies, promising more efficient and high-quality scene reconstructions.</p></details> | 9 pages |

Common models involve several stages of data resampling, in which the resolution of feature maps is first reduced to aggregate information and then increased to generate a high-resolution output. Previous works have shown that resampling operations are subject to artifacts such as aliasing. During downsampling, aliases have been shown to compromise the prediction stability of image classifiers. During upsampling, they have been leveraged to detect generated content. Yet, the effect of aliases during upsampling has not yet been discussed w.r.t. the stability and robustness of pixel-wise predictions. While falling under the same term (aliasing), the challenges for correct upsampling in neural networks differ significantly from those during downsampling: when downsampling, some high frequencies can not be correctly represented and have to be removed to avoid aliases. However, when upsampling for pixel-wise predictions, we actually require the model to restore such high frequencies that can not be encoded in lower resolutions. The application of findings from signal processing is therefore a necessary but not a sufficient condition to achieve the desirable output. In contrast, we find that the availability of large spatial context during upsampling allows to provide stable, high-quality pixel-wise predictions, even when fully learning all filter weights.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ECCV 2024</p></details> |

Spatial Photonic Ising Machines have proven to be advantageous for simulating fully connected large-scale spin systems. However, fine control of a general interaction matrix $J$ has so far only been accomplished through eigenvalue decomposition methods that either limit the scalability or increase the execution time of the optimization process. We introduce and experimentally validate a SPIM instance that enables direct control over the full interaction matrix, enabling the encoding of Ising Hamiltonians with arbitrary couplings and connectivity. We demonstrate the conformity of the experimentally measured Ising energy with the theoretically expected values and then proceed to solve both the unweighted and weighted graph partitioning problems, showcasing a systematic convergence to an optimal solution via simulated annealing. Our approach greatly expands the applicability of SPIMs for real-world applications without sacrificing any of the inherent advantages of the system, and paves the way to encoding the full range of NP problems that are known to be equivalent to Ising models, on SPIM devices.</p></details> | 7 pages, 4 figures |

Most existing methods are tailored for individual forecasting or imputation tasks but are not designed for both. Additionally, they are less effective for zero-shot and few-shot learning. While large language models (LLMs) have exhibited strong pattern recognition and reasoning abilities across various tasks, including few-shot and zero-shot learning, their development in understanding spatial-temporal data has been constrained by insufficient modeling of complex correlations such as the temporal correlations, spatial connectivity, non-pairwise and high-order spatial-temporal correlations within data. In this paper, we propose STD-LLM for understanding both spatial and temporal properties of \underline{S}patial-\underline{T}emporal \underline{D}ata with \underline{LLM}s, which is capable of implementing both spatial-temporal forecasting and imputation tasks. STD-LLM understands spatial-temporal correlations via explicitly designed spatial and temporal tokenizers as well as virtual nodes. Topology-aware node embeddings are designed for LLMs to comprehend and exploit the topology structure of data. Additionally, to capture the non-pairwise and higher-order correlations, we design a hypergraph learning module for LLMs, which can enhance the overall performance and improve efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that STD-LLM exhibits strong performance and generalization capabilities across the forecasting and imputation tasks on various datasets. Moreover, STD-LLM achieves promising results on both few-shot and zero-shot learning tasks.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods often decompose 3D shapes into a sequence of localized components, treating each element in isolation without considering spatial consistency. As a result, these approaches exhibit limited versatility in 3D data representation and shape generation, hindering their ability to generate highly diverse 3D shapes that comply with the specified constraints. In this paper, we introduce a novel spatial-aware 3D shape generation framework that leverages 2D plane representations for enhanced 3D shape modeling. To ensure spatial coherence and reduce memory usage, we incorporate a hybrid shape representation technique that directly learns a continuous signed distance field representation of the 3D shape using orthogonal 2D planes. Additionally, we meticulously enforce spatial correspondences across distinct planes using a transformer-based autoencoder structure, promoting the preservation of spatial relationships in the generated 3D shapes. This yields an algorithm that consistently outperforms state-of-the-art 3D shape generation methods on various tasks, including unconditional shape generation, multi-modal shape completion, single-view reconstruction, and text-to-shape synthesis.

To improve the policy generalization, we introduce spatially-grounded parameterized motion primitives in our method HACMan++. Specifically, we propose an action representation consisting of three components: what primitive type (such as grasp or push) to execute, where the primitive will be grounded (e.g. where the gripper will make contact with the world), and how the primitive motion is executed, such as parameters specifying the push direction or grasp orientation. These three components define a novel discrete-continuous action space for reinforcement learning. Our framework enables robot agents to learn to chain diverse motion primitives together and select appropriate primitive parameters to complete long-horizon manipulation tasks. By grounding the primitives on a spatial location in the environment, our method is able to effectively generalize across object shape and pose variations. Our approach significantly outperforms existing methods, particularly in complex scenarios demanding both high-level sequential reasoning and object generalization. With zero-shot sim-to-real transfer, our policy succeeds in challenging real-world manipulation tasks, with generalization to unseen objects.

Furthermore, minimizing data collection can significantly reduce overhead. However, limited data can lead to inaccuracies and instability in TFE. To address this, we introduce the spatial-temporal Mamba (ST-Mamba), a deep learning model combining a convolutional neural network (CNN) with a Mamba framework. ST-Mamba is designed to enhance TFE accuracy and stability by effectively capturing the spatial-temporal patterns within traffic flow. Our model aims to achieve results comparable to those from extensive data sets while only utilizing minimal data. Simulations using real-world datasets have validated our model's ability to deliver precise and stable TFE across an urban landscape based on limited data, establishing a cost-efficient solution for TFE.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by 2024 IEEE/CIC International Conference on Communications in China (ICCC)</p></details> |
| **[Global Spatial-Temporal Information-based Residual ConvLSTM for Video Space-Time Super-Resolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08466v1)** | 2024-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>By converting low-frame-rate, low-resolution videos into high-frame-rate, high-resolution ones, space-time video super-resolution techniques can enhance visual experiences and facilitate more efficient information dissemination. We propose a convolutional neural network (CNN) for space-time video super-resolution, namely GIRNet. To generate highly accurate features and thus improve performance, the proposed network integrates a feature-level temporal interpolation module with deformable convolutions and a global spatial-temporal information-based residual convolutional long short-term memory (convLSTM) module. In the feature-level temporal interpolation module, we leverage deformable convolution, which adapts to deformations and scale variations of objects across different scene locations. This presents a more efficient solution than conventional convolution for extracting features from moving objects. Our network effectively uses forward and backward feature information to determine inter-frame offsets, leading to the direct generation of interpolated frame features. In the global spatial-temporal information-based residual convLSTM module, the first convLSTM is used to derive global spatial-temporal information from the input features, and the second convLSTM uses the previously computed global spatial-temporal information feature as its initial cell state. This second convLSTM adopts residual connections to preserve spatial information, thereby enhancing the output features. Experiments on the Vimeo90K dataset show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in peak signal-to-noise-ratio (by 1.45 dB, 1.14 dB, and 0.02 dB over STARnet, TMNet, and 3DAttGAN, respectively), structural similarity index(by 0.027, 0.023, and 0.006 over STARnet, TMNet, and 3DAttGAN, respectively), and visually.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatially-Variant Degradation Model for Dataset-free Super-resolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08252v1)** | 2024-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper focuses on the dataset-free Blind Image Super-Resolution (BISR). Unlike existing dataset-free BISR methods that focus on obtaining a degradation kernel for the entire image, we are the first to explicitly design a spatially-variant degradation model for each pixel. Our method also benefits from having a significantly smaller number of learnable parameters compared to data-driven spatially-variant BISR methods. Concretely, each pixel's degradation kernel is expressed as a linear combination of a learnable dictionary composed of a small number of spatially-variant atom kernels. The coefficient matrices of the atom degradation kernels are derived using membership functions of fuzzy set theory. We construct a novel Probabilistic BISR model with tailored likelihood function and prior terms. Subsequently, we employ the Monte Carlo EM algorithm to infer the degradation kernels for each pixel. Our method achieves a significant improvement over other state-of-the-art BISR methods, with an average improvement of 1 dB (2x).Code will be released at https://github.com/shaojieguoECNU/SVDSR.</p></details> |  |

However, current popular spatial transcriptomics techniques either have shallow sequencing depth or low resolution. We present stEnTrans, a deep learning method based on Transformer architecture that provides comprehensive predictions for gene expression in unmeasured areas or unexpectedly lost areas and enhances gene expression in original and inputed spots. Utilizing a self-supervised learning approach, stEnTrans establishes proxy tasks on gene expression profile without requiring additional data, mining intrinsic features of the tissues as supervisory information. We evaluate stEnTrans on six datasets and the results indicate superior performance in enhancing spots resolution and predicting gene expression in unmeasured areas compared to other deep learning and traditional interpolation methods.

| **[Multimodal contrastive learning for spatial gene expression prediction using histology images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08216v1)** | 2024-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, the advent of spatial transcriptomics (ST) technology has unlocked unprecedented opportunities for delving into the complexities of gene expression patterns within intricate biological systems. Despite its transformative potential, the prohibitive cost of ST technology remains a significant barrier to its widespread adoption in large-scale studies. An alternative, more cost-effective strategy involves employing artificial intelligence to predict gene expression levels using readily accessible whole-slide images (WSIs) stained with Hematoxylin and Eosin (H\&E). However, existing methods have yet to fully capitalize on multimodal information provided by H&E images and ST data with spatial location. In this paper, we propose \textbf{mclSTExp}, a multimodal contrastive learning with Transformer and Densenet-121 encoder for Spatial Transcriptomics Expression prediction. We conceptualize each spot as a "word", integrating its intrinsic features with spatial context through the self-attention mechanism of a Transformer encoder. This integration is further enriched by incorporating image features via contrastive learning, thereby enhancing the predictive capability of our model. Our extensive evaluation of \textbf{mclSTExp} on two breast cancer datasets and a skin squamous cell carcinoma dataset demonstrates its superior performance in predicting spatial gene expression. Moreover, mclSTExp has shown promise in interpreting cancer-specific overexpressed genes, elucidating immune-related genes, and identifying specialized spatial domains annotated by pathologists.

| **[Spatial-Temporal Generative AI for Traffic Flow Estimation with Sparse Data of Connected Vehicles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08034v1)** | 2024-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic flow estimation (TFE) is crucial for intelligent transportation systems. Traditional TFE methods rely on extensive road sensor networks and typically incur significant costs. Sparse mobile crowdsensing enables a cost-effective alternative by utilizing sparsely distributed probe vehicle data (PVD) provided by connected vehicles. However, as pointed out by the central limit theorem, the sparsification of PVD leads to the degradation of TFE accuracy. In response, this paper introduces a novel and cost-effective TFE framework that leverages sparse PVD and improves accuracy by applying the spatial-temporal generative artificial intelligence (GAI) framework. Within this framework, the conditional encoder mines spatial-temporal correlations in the initial TFE results derived from averaging vehicle speeds of each region, and the generative decoder generates high-quality and accurate TFE outputs. Additionally, the design of the spatial-temporal neural network is discussed, which is the backbone of the conditional encoder for effectively capturing spatial-temporal correlations. The effectiveness of the proposed TFE approach is demonstrated through evaluations based on real-world connected vehicle data. The experimental results affirm the feasibility of our sparse PVD-based TFE framework and highlight the significant role of the spatial-temporal GAI framework in enhancing the accuracy of TFE.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose a robust video object segmentation framework equipped with spatial-semantic features and discriminative object queries to address the above issues. Specifically, we construct a spatial-semantic network comprising a semantic embedding block and spatial dependencies modeling block to associate the pretrained ViT features with global semantic features and local spatial features, providing a comprehensive target representation. In addition, we develop a masked cross-attention module to generate object queries that focus on the most discriminative parts of target objects during query propagation, alleviating noise accumulation and ensuring effective long-term query propagation. The experimental results show that the proposed method set a new state-of-the-art performance on multiple datasets, including the DAVIS2017 test (89.1%), YoutubeVOS 2019 (88.5%), MOSE (75.1%), LVOS test (73.0%), and LVOS val (75.1%), which demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization capacity of the proposed method.

However, existing quality enhancement methods are limited by slow inference speed and the requirement for temporal information contained in future frames, making it challenging to deploy them directly in online tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel method, STLVQE, specifically designed to address the rarely studied online video quality enhancement (Online-VQE) problem. Our STLVQE designs a new VQE framework which contains a Module-Agnostic Feature Extractor that greatly reduces the redundant computations and redesign the propagation, alignment, and enhancement module of the network. A Spatial-Temporal Look-up Tables (STL) is proposed, which extracts spatial-temporal information in videos while saving substantial inference time. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to exploit the LUT structure to extract temporal information in video tasks. Extensive experiments on the MFQE 2.0 dataset demonstrate that our STLVQE achieves a satisfactory performance-speed trade-off.</p></details> |  |

| **[Investigating opioid vulnerability profiles through a spatial Kalman filter: insights from social and environmental factors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07008v1)** | 2024-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study investigates the national opioid crisis by exploring three key social and environmental drivers: opioid-related mortality rates, opioid prescription dispensing rates, and disability rank ordered rates. We introduce a spatial Kalman filter to examine each factor individually and their potential intra-relationships. This study utilizes county level data, spanning the years 2014 through 2020, on the rates of opioid-related mortality, opioid prescription dispensing, and disability. To successfully estimate and predict trends in these opioid-related socioenvironmental factors, we augment the Kalman Filter with a novel spatial component. Through this construction we analyze opioid vulnerability at the national scale, creating heat maps and a hotspot analysis. Our spatial Kalman filter demonstrates strong predictive performance. These predictions are used to uncover pronounced vulnerability profiles for both the rates of opioid-related mortality and disability, finding that the Appalachian region is likely the nation's most vulnerable area to these two factors. This contrasts with a chaotic vulnerability profile found for the dispensing rates. We suggest that the rates of opioid-related mortality and disability are connected and propose that this connection is unlikely to be found in the realm of prescription opioids. Our analysis indicates that prescription opioids are not the primary drivers of opioid-related deaths across the country. We advocate for comprehensive solutions which extend beyond limiting prescription opioids.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adaptive Multi-modal Fusion of Spatially Variant Kernel Refinement with Diffusion Model for Blind Image Super-Resolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05808v2)** | 2024-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pre-trained diffusion models utilized for image generation encapsulate a substantial reservoir of a priori knowledge pertaining to intricate textures. Harnessing the potential of leveraging this a priori knowledge in the context of image super-resolution presents a compelling avenue. Nonetheless, prevailing diffusion-based methodologies presently overlook the constraints imposed by degradation information on the diffusion process. Furthermore, these methods fail to consider the spatial variability inherent in the estimated blur kernel, stemming from factors such as motion jitter and out-of-focus elements in open-environment scenarios. This oversight results in a notable deviation of the image super-resolution effect from fundamental realities. To address these concerns, we introduce a framework known as Adaptive Multi-modal Fusion of \textbf{S}patially Variant Kernel Refinement with Diffusion Model for Blind Image \textbf{S}uper-\textbf{R}esolution (SSR). Within the SSR framework, we propose a Spatially Variant Kernel Refinement (SVKR) module. SVKR estimates a Depth-Informed Kernel, which takes the depth information into account and is spatially variant. Additionally, SVKR enhance the accuracy of depth information acquired from LR images, allowing for mutual enhancement between the depth map and blur kernel estimates. Finally, we introduce the Adaptive Multi-Modal Fusion (AMF) module to align the information from three modalities: low-resolution images, depth maps, and blur kernels. This alignment can constrain the diffusion model to generate more authentic SR results.</p></details> |  |

In this scheme, the adaptive spatial modulation (ASM)-based antennas selection works at the receiver by employing the characteristics of the RIS in each time slot, where the signal-to-noise ratio at specific selected antennas can be further enhanced with near few powers. Besides for the bits from constellation symbols, the extra bits can be mapped into the indices of receive antenna combinations and conveyed to the receiver through the ASM-based antenna-combination selection, thus providing higher spectral efficiency. To explicitly present the RASM scheme, the analytical performance of bit error rate of it is discussed in this paper. As a trade-off selection, the proposed scheme shows higher spectral efficiency and remains the satisfactory error performance. Simulation and analytical results demonstrate the better performance and exhibit more potential to apply in practical wireless communication.</p></details> |  |
| **[SilverCycling: Exploring the Impact of Bike-Based Locomotion on Spatial Orientation for Older Adults in VR](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06846v1)** | 2024-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial orientation is essential for people to effectively navigate and interact with the environment in everyday life. With age-related cognitive decline, providing VR locomotion techniques with better spatial orientation performance for older adults becomes important. Such advancements not only make VR more accessible to older adults but also enable them to reap the potential health benefits of VR technology. Natural motion-based locomotion has been shown to be effective in enhancing younger users' performance in VR navigation tasks that require spatial orientation. However, there is a lack of understanding regarding the impact of natural motion-based locomotion on spatial orientation for older adults in VR. To address this gap, we selected the SilverCycling system, a VR bike-based locomotion technique that we developed, as a representative of natural motion-based locomotion, guided by findings from our pilot study. We conducted a user study with 16 older adults to compare SilverCycling with the joystick-based controller. The findings suggest SilverCycling's potential to significantly enhance spatial orientation in the open-road urban environment for older adults, offering a better user experience. Based on our findings, we identify key factors influencing spatial orientation and propose design recommendations to make VR locomotion more accessible and user-friendly for older adults.</p></details> | 19 pages, 6 figures |

A crucial step towards understanding the neurological status, is to estimate the brain age using structural MRI volumes, in order to measure its deviation from chronological age. Factors that contribute to brain age are best captured using a data-driven approach, such as deep learning. However, it places a huge demand on the availability of diverse datasets. In this work, we propose a robust brain age estimation paradigm that utilizes a 3D CNN model, by-passing the need for model-retraining across datasets. The proposed model consists of seven 3D CNN layers, with a shared spatial attention layer incorporated at each CNN layer followed by five dense layers. The novelty of the proposed method lies in the idea of spatial attention module, with shared weights across the CNN layers. This weight sharing ensures directed attention to specific brain regions, for localizing age-related features within the data, lending robustness. The proposed model, trained on ADNI dataset comprising 516 T1 weighted MRI volumes of healthy subjects, resulted in Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 1.662 years, which is an improvement of 1.688 years over the state-of-the-art (SOTA) model, based on disjoint test samples from the same repository. To illustrate generalizability, the same pipeline was utilized on volumes from a publicly available source called OASIS3. From OASIS3, MRI volumes 890 healthy subjects were utilized resulting in MAE of 2.265 years. Due to diversity in acquisitions across multiple sites, races and genetic factors, traditional CNN models are not guaranteed to prioritize brain regions crucial for age estimation. In contrast, the proposed weight-shared spatial attention module, directs attention on specific regions, required for the estimation.</p></details> |  |

Despite the success of recent Sp-AAD algorithms, their performance is hindered by trial-specific features in EEG data. This study aims to improve decoding performance against these features. Studies in neuroscience indicate that spatial auditory attention can be reflected in the topological distribution of EEG energy across different frequency bands. This insight motivates us to propose Prototype Training, a neuroscience-inspired method for Sp-AAD. This method constructs prototypes with enhanced energy distribution representations and reduced trial-specific characteristics, enabling the model to better capture auditory attention features. To implement prototype training, an EEGWaveNet that employs the wavelet transform of EEG is further proposed. Detailed experiments indicate that the EEGWaveNet with prototype training outperforms other competitive models on various datasets, and the effectiveness of the proposed method is also validated. As a training method independent of model architecture, prototype training offers new insights into the field of Sp-AAD.</p></details> |  |

A possible approach is to search for a transfer function that quantitatively relates physical descriptors to conceptual model parameters. This paper introduces a Hybrid Data Assimilation and Parameter Regionalization (HDA-PR) approach incorporating learnable regionalization mappings, based on either multi-linear regressions or artificial neural networks (ANNs), into a differentiable hydrological model. This approach demonstrates how two differentiable codes can be linked and their gradients chained, enabling the exploitation of heterogeneous datasets across extensive spatio-temporal computational domains within a high-dimensional regionalization context, using accurate adjoint-based gradients. The inverse problem is tackled with a multi-gauge calibration cost function accounting for information from multiple observation sites. HDA-PR was tested on high-resolution, hourly and kilometric regional modeling of 126 flash-flood-prone catchments in the French Mediterranean region. The results highlight a strong regionalization performance of HDA-PR especially in the most challenging upstream-to-downstream extrapolation scenario with ANN, achieving median Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) scores from 0.6 to 0.71 for spatial, temporal, spatio-temporal validations, and improving NSE by up to 30% on average compared to the baseline model calibrated with lumped parameters. ANN enables to learn a non-linear descriptors-to-parameters mapping which provides better model controllability than a linear mapping for complex calibration cases.</p></details> |  |

Current state-of-the-art methods either require multiple independent stages of processing that employ motion cues or, in the case of end-to-end trainable networks, lack in segmentation accuracy, in part due to the difficulty of learning segmentation maps from videos with transient object presence. This limits the application of WSVOS for semantic annotation of surgical videos where multiple surgical tools frequently move in and out of the field of view, a problem that is more difficult than typically encountered in WSVOS. This paper introduces Video Spatio-Temporal Disentanglement Networks (VDST-Net), a framework to disentangle spatiotemporal information using semi-decoupled knowledge distillation to predict high-quality class activation maps (CAMs). A teacher network designed to resolve temporal conflicts when specifics about object location and timing in the video are not provided works with a student network that integrates information over time by leveraging temporal dependencies. We demonstrate the efficacy of our framework on a public reference dataset and on a more challenging surgical video dataset where objects are, on average, present in less than 60\% of annotated frames. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques and generates superior segmentation masks under video-level weak supervision.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 6 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |

Thus, large amounts of video samples are continuously required for traditional data-driven training. However, samples are not always sufficient in real-world scenarios, promoting few-shot action recognition (FSAR) research. We observe that most recent FSAR works build spatio-temporal relation of video samples via temporal alignment after spatial feature extraction, cutting apart spatial and temporal features within samples. They also capture motion information via narrow perspectives between adjacent frames without considering density, leading to insufficient motion information capturing. Therefore, we propose a novel plug-and-play architecture for FSAR called Spatio-tempOral frAme tuPle enhancer (SOAP) in this paper. The model we designed with such architecture refers to SOAP-Net. Temporal connections between different feature channels and spatio-temporal relation of features are considered instead of simple feature extraction. Comprehensive motion information is also captured, using frame tuples with multiple frames containing more motion information than adjacent frames. Combining frame tuples of diverse frame counts further provides a broader perspective. SOAP-Net achieves new state-of-the-art performance across well-known benchmarks such as SthSthV2, Kinetics, UCF101, and HMDB51. Extensive empirical evaluations underscore the competitiveness, pluggability, generalization, and robustness of SOAP.

These deep learning based methods learn ST correlations to support the downstream tasks in the fields such as smart mobility, smart city and other intelligent transportation systems. Despite their effectiveness, ST data fusion and forecasting methods face practical challenges in real-world scenarios. First, forecasting performance for ST data-insufficient area is inferior, making it necessary to transfer meta knowledge from heterogeneous area to enhance the sparse representations. Second, it is nontrivial to accurately forecast in multi-transportation-mode scenarios due to the fine-grained ST features of similar transportation modes, making it necessary to distinguish and measure the ST correlations to alleviate the influence caused by entangled ST features. At last, partial data modalities (e.g., transportation mode) are lost due to privacy or technical issues in certain scenarios, making it necessary to effectively fuse the multimodal sparse ST features and enrich the ST representations. To tackle these challenges, our research work aim to develop effective fusion and forecasting methods for multimodal ST data in smart mobility scenario. In this paper, we will introduce our recent works that investigates the challenges in terms of various real-world applications and establish the open challenges in this field for future work.</p></details> | 4 pages |

Although Bayesian methods are common in spatio-temporal modeling, standard Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques are usually slow for large datasets such as house price data. To tackle this problem, we propose a divide-and-conquer spatio-temporal modeling approach. This method involves partitioning the data into multiple subsets and applying an appropriate Gaussian process model to each subset in parallel. The results from each subset are then combined using the Wasserstein barycenter technique to obtain the global parameters for the original problem. The proposed methodology allows for multiple observations per spatial and time unit, thereby offering added benefits for practitioners. As a real-life application, we analyze house price data of more than 0.6 million transactions from 983 middle layer super output areas in London over a period of eight years. The methodology provides insightful findings about the effects of various amenities, trend patterns, and the relationship between prices and carbon emissions. Furthermore, as demonstrated through a cross-validation study, it shows good predictive accuracy while balancing computational efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Suppl...</summary><p>Supplementary material is available from the authors upon request</p></details> |

The Stochastic Partial Differential Equation (SPDE) approach has proven to be effective for the estimation and the prediction in a spatial context. We present here the advection-diffusion SPDE with first order derivative in time which defines a large class of nonseparable spatio-temporal models. A Gaussian Markov random field approximation of the solution to the SPDE is built by discretizing the temporal derivative with a finite difference method (implicit Euler) and by solving the spatial SPDE with a finite element method (continuous Galerkin) at each time step. The ''Streamline Diffusion'' stabilization technique is introduced when the advection term dominates the diffusion. Computationally efficient methods are proposed to estimate the parameters of the SPDE and to predict the spatio-temporal field by kriging, as well as to perform conditional simulations. The approach is applied to a solar radiation dataset. Its advantages and limitations are discussed.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Spatio-Temporal Approach with Self-Corrective Causal Inference for Flight Delay Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15185v1)** | 2024-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate flight delay prediction is crucial for the secure and effective operation of the air traffic system. Recent advances in modeling inter-airport relationships present a promising approach for investigating flight delay prediction from the multi-airport scenario. However, the previous prediction works only accounted for the simplistic relationships such as traffic flow or geographical distance, overlooking the intricate interactions among airports and thus proving inadequate. In this paper, we leverage causal inference to precisely model inter-airport relationships and propose a self-corrective spatio-temporal graph neural network (named CausalNet) for flight delay prediction. Specifically, Granger causality inference coupled with a self-correction module is designed to construct causality graphs among airports and dynamically modify them based on the current airport's delays. Additionally, the features of the causality graphs are adaptively extracted and utilized to address the heterogeneity of airports. Extensive experiments are conducted on the real data of top-74 busiest airports in China. The results show that CausalNet is superior to baselines. Ablation studies emphasize the power of the proposed self-correction causality graph and the graph feature extraction module. All of these prove the effectiveness of the proposed methodology.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Source and Test-Time Domain Adaptation on Multivariate Signals using Spatio-Temporal Monge Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14303v1)** | 2024-07-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine learning applications on signals such as computer vision or biomedical data often face significant challenges due to the variability that exists across hardware devices or session recordings. This variability poses a Domain Adaptation (DA) problem, as training and testing data distributions often differ. In this work, we propose Spatio-Temporal Monge Alignment (STMA) to mitigate these variabilities. This Optimal Transport (OT) based method adapts the cross-power spectrum density (cross-PSD) of multivariate signals by mapping them to the Wasserstein barycenter of source domains (multi-source DA). Predictions for new domains can be done with a filtering without the need for retraining a model with source data (test-time DA). We also study and discuss two special cases of the method, Temporal Monge Alignment (TMA) and Spatial Monge Alignment (SMA). Non-asymptotic concentration bounds are derived for the mappings estimation, which reveals a bias-plus-variance error structure with a variance decay rate of $\mathcal{O}(n_\ell^{-1/2})$ with $n_\ell$ the signal length. This theoretical guarantee demonstrates the efficiency of the proposed computational schema. Numerical experiments on multivariate biosignals and image data show that STMA leads to significant and consistent performance gains between datasets acquired with very different settings. Notably, STMA is a pre-processing step complementary to state-of-the-art deep learning methods.</p></details> |  |

Owing to the outstanding performance in dealing with structure learning potentials, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are often used to capture such complex spatio-temporal features in multivariate time series. However, these data-driven models often fail to capture the essential spatio-temporal relationships when significant signal corruption occurs. Additionally, calculating the high-order neighbor nodes in these models is of high computational complexity. To address these problems, we propose a novel higher-order spatio-temporal physics-incorporated GNN (HSPGNN). Firstly, the dynamic Laplacian matrix can be obtained by the spatial attention mechanism. Then, the generic inhomogeneous partial differential equation (PDE) of physical dynamic systems is used to construct the dynamic higher-order spatio-temporal GNN to obtain the missing time series values. Moreover, we estimate the missing impact by Normalizing Flows (NF) to evaluate the importance of each node in the graph for better explainability. Experimental results on four benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HSPGNN and the superior performance when combining various order neighbor nodes. Also, graph-like optical flow, dynamic graphs, and missing impact can be obtained naturally by HSPGNN, which provides better dynamic analysis and explanation than traditional data-driven models.

Traditional methods rely on hand-crafted features and machine learning techniques, which often struggle to model the complex dynamics of human motion. Recent deep learning-based methods have achieved success by learning spatio-temporal representations of motion, but these models often overlook the reliability of motion data. Additionally, the temporal and spatial dependencies of skeleton nodes are distinct. The temporal relationship captures motion information over time, while the spatial relationship describes body structure and the relationships between different nodes. In this paper, we propose a novel spatio-temporal branching network using incremental information for HMP, which decouples the learning of temporal-domain and spatial-domain features, extracts more motion information, and achieves complementary cross-domain knowledge learning through knowledge distillation. Our approach effectively reduces noise interference and provides more expressive information for characterizing motion by separately extracting temporal and spatial features. We evaluate our approach on standard HMP benchmarks and outperform state-of-the-art methods in terms of prediction accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>The i...</summary><p>The incremental information of our paper includes the displacement information from the last frame of the historical sequence, derived from the motion information of the first frame in the future sequence and the motion information of the last frame of the historical sequence.

Existing methods either utilize multi-modal information in video-text pairs or apply global and local alignment techniques to promote alignment precision. However, these methods often fail to fully explore the spatio-temporal relationships among vision tokens within video and across different video-text pairs. In this paper, we propose a novel Spatio-Temporal Graph Transformer module to uniformly learn spatial and temporal contexts for video-language alignment pre-training (dubbed STGT). Specifically, our STGT combines spatio-temporal graph structure information with attention in transformer block, effectively utilizing the spatio-temporal contexts. In this way, we can model the relationships between vision tokens, promoting video-text alignment precision for benefiting downstream tasks. In addition, we propose a self-similarity alignment loss to explore the inherent self-similarity in the video and text. With the initial optimization achieved by contrastive learning, it can further promote the alignment accuracy between video and text. Experimental results on challenging downstream tasks, including video-text retrieval and video question answering, verify the superior performance of our method.</p></details> | under review |

Changes in the size, shape and movement of the chambers can be important markers for cardiac disease and modeling this in relation to clinical demography or disease is therefore of interest. Existing methods for spatio-temporal modeling of the human heart require shape correspondence over time or suffer from large memory requirements, making it difficult to use for complex anatomies. We introduce a novel conditional generative model, where the shape and movement is modeled implicitly in the form of a spatio-temporal neural distance field and conditioned on clinical demography. The model is based on an auto-decoder architecture and aims to disentangle the individual variations from that related to the clinical demography. It is tested on the left atrium (including the left atrial appendage), where it outperforms current state-of-the-art methods for anatomical sequence completion and generates synthetic sequences that realistically mimics the shape and motion of the real left atrium. In practice, this means we can infer functional measurements from a static image, generate synthetic populations with specified demography or disease and investigate how non-imaging clinical data effect the shape and motion of cardiac anatomies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for MICCAI2024</p></details> |

However, estimating incidence or mortality rates associated with rare cancers presents important difficulties and poses new statistical methodological challenges. In this paper, we expand the collection of multivariate spatio-temporal models by introducing adaptable shared spatio-temporal components to enable a comprehensive analysis of both incidence and cancer mortality in rare cancer cases. These models allow the modulation of spatio-temporal effects between incidence and mortality, allowing for changes in their relationship over time. The new models have been implemented in INLA using r-generic constructions. We conduct a simulation study to evaluate the performance of the new spatio-temporal models. Our results show that multivariate spatio-temporal models incorporating a flexible shared spatio-temporal term outperform conventional multivariate spatio-temporal models that include specific spatio-temporal effects for each health outcome. We use these models to analyze incidence and mortality data for pancreatic cancer and leukaemia among males across 142 administrative health care districts of Great Britain over a span of nine biennial periods (2002-2019).</p></details> | 40 pages, 12 figures |

To address this limitation, this paper presents the spatio-temporal GraphFormer framework for 3D human pose estimation in video, which integrates body structure graph-based representations with spatio-temporal information. Specifically, we develop a spatio-temporal criss-cross graph (STG) attention mechanism. This approach is designed to learn the long-range dependencies in data across both time and space, integrating graph information directly into the respective attention layers. Furthermore, we introduce the dual-path modulated hop-wise regular GCN (MHR-GCN) module, which utilizes modulation to optimize parameter usage and employs spatio-temporal hop-wise skip connections to acquire higher-order information. Additionally, this module processes temporal and spatial dimensions independently to learn their respective features while avoiding mutual influence. Finally, we demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in 3D human pose estimation on the Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP datasets.</p></details> |  |

These programs are being increasingly asked to provide forest parameter estimates for spatial and temporal extents smaller than their current design and accompanying design-based methods can deliver with desired levels of uncertainty. Many NFI designs and estimation methods focus on status and are not well equipped to provide acceptable estimates for trend and change parameters, especially over small spatial domains and/or short time periods. Fine-scale space-time indexed estimates are critical to a variety of environmental, ecological, and economic monitoring efforts. Estimates for forest carbon status, trend, and change are of particular importance to international initiatives to track carbon dynamics. Model-based small area estimation (SAE) methods for NFI and similar ecological monitoring data typically pursue inference on status within small spatial domains, with few demonstrated methods that account for spatio-temporal dependence needed for trend and change estimation. We propose a spatio-temporal Bayesian model framework that delivers statistically valid estimates with full uncertainty quantification for status, trend, and change. The framework accommodates a variety of space and time dependency structures, and we detail model configurations for different settings. Through analysis of simulated datasets, we compare the relative performance of candidate models and a traditional direct estimator. We then apply candidate models to a large-scale NFI dataset to demonstrate the utility of the proposed framework for providing unique quantification of forest carbon dynamics in the contiguous United States. We also provide computationally efficient algorithms, software, and data to reproduce our results and for benchmarking.</p></details> |  |

The restoration and enhancement have proven to be highly beneficial. However, there are only a limited number of enhancement methods explicitly designed for videos acquired in low-light conditions. We propose a Spatio-Temporal Aligned SUNet (STA-SUNet) model using a Swin Transformer as a backbone to capture low light video features and exploit their spatio-temporal correlations. The STA-SUNet model is trained on a novel, fully registered dataset (BVI), which comprises dynamic scenes captured under varying light conditions. It is further analysed comparatively against various other models over three test datasets. The model demonstrates superior adaptivity across all datasets, obtaining the highest PSNR and SSIM values. It is particularly effective in extreme low-light conditions, yielding fairly good visualisation results.</p></details> |  |

In this regard, covariance properties with respect to geometric image transformations in the earliest layers of the visual hierarchy are essential for expressing robust image operations, and for formulating invariant visual operations at higher levels. This paper defines and proves a set of joint covariance properties for spatio-temporal receptive fields in terms of spatio-temporal derivative operators applied to spatio-temporally smoothed image data under compositions of spatial scaling transformations, spatial affine transformations, Galilean transformations and temporal scaling transformations. Specifically, the derived relations show how the parameters of the receptive fields need to be transformed, in order to match the output from spatio-temporal receptive fields under composed spatio-temporal image transformations. For this purpose, we also fundamentally extend the notion of scale-normalized derivatives to affine-normalized derivatives, that are computed based on spatial smoothing with affine Gaussian kernels, and analyze the covariance properties of the resulting affine-normalized derivatives for the affine group as well as for important subgroups thereof. We conclude with a geometric analysis, showing how the derived joint covariance properties make it possible to relate or match spatio-temporal receptive field responses, when observing, possibly moving, local surface patches from different views, under locally linearized perspective or projective transformations, as well as when observing different instances of spatio-temporal events, that may occur either faster or slower between different views of similar spatio-temporal events.</p></details> | <details><summary>41 pa...</summary><p>41 pages, 13 figures.

Designing spatio-temporal forecasting models separately in a task-wise and city-wise manner to forecast demand and supply-demand gap in a ride-hailing system poses a burden for the expanding transportation network companies. Therefore, a multi-task learning architecture is proposed in this study by developing gated ensemble of spatio-temporal mixture of experts network (GESME-Net) with convolutional recurrent neural network (CRNN), convolutional neural network (CNN), and recurrent neural network (RNN) for simultaneously forecasting these spatio-temporal tasks in a city as well as across different cities. Furthermore, a task adaptation layer is integrated with the architecture for learning joint representation in multi-task learning and revealing the contribution of the input features utilized in prediction. The proposed architecture is tested with data from Didi Chuxing for: (i) simultaneously forecasting demand and supply-demand gap in Beijing, and (ii) simultaneously forecasting demand across Chengdu and Xian. In both scenarios, models from our proposed architecture outperformed the single-task and multi-task deep learning benchmarks and ensemble-based machine learning algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2012.08868</p></details> |

If an AV can predict its surrounding vehicles' future trajectories, it can make safe and efficient manoeuvre decisions. In this paper, we present such a Deep Spatio-Temporal Context-Aware decision Network (DST-CAN) model for predictive manoeuvre planning of AVs. A memory neuron network is used to predict future trajectories of its surrounding vehicles. The driving environment's spatio-temporal information (past, present, and predicted future trajectories) are embedded into a context-aware grid. The proposed DST-CAN model employs these context-aware grids as inputs to a convolutional neural network to understand the spatial relationships between the vehicles and determine a safe and efficient manoeuvre decision. The DST-CAN model also uses information of human driving behavior on a highway. Performance evaluation of DST-CAN has been carried out using two publicly available NGSIM US-101 and I-80 datasets. Also, rule-based ground truth decisions have been compared with those generated by DST-CAN. The results clearly show that DST-CAN can make much better decisions with 3-sec of predicted trajectories of neighboring vehicles compared to currently existing methods that do not use this prediction.</p></details> | 12 pages, 8 figures |

Traditional methods based on generative adversarial networks(GAN) or joint learning frameworks can achieve good prediction accuracy under low observation ratios, but they usually have high computational costs. In view of this, this paper proposes a spatio-temporal encoding and decoding-based method for future human activity skeleton synthesis. Firstly, algorithms such as time control, discrete cosine transform, and low-pass filtering are used to cut or pad the skeleton sequences. Secondly, the encoder and decoder are responsible for extracting intermediate semantic encoding from observed skeleton sequences and inferring future sequences from the intermediate semantic encoding, respectively. Finally, joint displacement error, velocity error, and acceleration error, three higher-order kinematic features, are used as key components of the loss function to optimize model parameters. Experimental results show that the proposed future skeleton synthesis algorithm performs better than some existing algorithms. It generates skeleton sequences with smaller errors and fewer model parameters, effectively providing future information for early activity prediction.</p></details> |  |

To address these problems, this study proposes a spatio-temporal model that incorporates skewness while maintaining mean and variance, by applying the flexible subclass of the closed skew-normal distribution. An efficient sampling method is introduced, leveraging the autoregressive representation of the model. Additionally, the model's symmetry concerning spatial order is demonstrated, and Mardia's skewness and kurtosis are derived, showing independence from the mean and variance. Simulation studies compare the estimation performance of the proposed model with that of the Gaussian model. The result confirms its superiority in high skewness and low observation noise scenarios. The identification of Cobb-Douglas production functions across US states is examined as an application to real data, revealing that the proposed model excels in both goodness-of-fit and predictive performance.</p></details> |  |

Most of the existing models achieve either spectral or spatial compression, and do not jointly consider the spatio-spectral redundancies present in HSIs. To address this problem, in this paper we focus our attention on the High Fidelity Compression (HiFiC) model (which is proven to be highly effective for spatial compression problems) and adapt it to perform spatio-spectral compression of HSIs. In detail, we introduce two new models: i) HiFiC using Squeeze and Excitation (SE) blocks (denoted as HiFiC$_{SE}$); and ii) HiFiC with 3D convolutions (denoted as HiFiC$_{3D}$) in the framework of compression of HSIs. We analyze the effectiveness of HiFiC$_{SE}$ and HiFiC$_{3D}$ in compressing the spatio-spectral redundancies with channel attention and inter-dependency analysis. Experimental results show the efficacy of the proposed models in performing spatio-spectral compression, while reconstructing images at reduced bitrates with higher reconstruction quality.

Multicasting has garnered consistent attention as a means to fulfill the increasing demand for more efficient data transmission methods. Nevertheless, leveraging multicast wireless networks for spatio-temporally asynchronous data requests poses challenges. In this context, this paper introduces a new multicast mechanism called \emph{set-up based merged multicast (SMMC)} to minimize the delivery time of the requested file in wireless networks by considering the uncertainties inherent in wireless channels. The proposed mechanism comprises two phases. The first phase involves gathering asynchronous requests for a file from users experiencing diverse channel conditions. During this phase, packets of the requested file are transmitted individually in unicast mode within a specified set-up time. Following this, the second phase initiates multicast transmission, which sequentially handles the remaining packets of the file in multicast mode. In the proposed mechanism, we optimize the set-up time and transmission rates of both unicast and multicast modes to minimize the expected file delivery time by jointly taking into account the statistical characteristics of wireless channels, users' locations, and file popularity. Additionally, we also delve into a \emph{fine-tuned SMMC} by utilizing posterior information on the multicast group size and further improve the performance. Our performance evaluations reveal that the proposed SMMC outperforms conventional unicast methods, especially with high-demand data.</p></details> |  |

HD EEG devices improve the spatial resolution of EEG by placing more electrodes on the scalp, meeting the requirements of clinical diagnostic applications such as epilepsy focus localization. However, this technique faces challenges such as high acquisition costs and limited usage scenarios. In this paper, spatio-temporal adaptive diffusion models (STADMs) are proposed to pioneer the use of diffusion models for achieving spatial SR reconstruction from low-resolution (LR, 64 channels or fewer) EEG to high-resolution (HR, 256 channels) EEG. Specifically, a spatio-temporal condition module is designed to extract the spatio-temporal features of LR EEG, which then serve as conditional inputs to guide the reverse denoising process of diffusion models. Additionally, a multi-scale Transformer denoising module is constructed to leverage multi-scale convolution blocks and cross-attention-based diffusion Transformer blocks for conditional guidance to generate subject-adaptive SR EEG. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively enhances the spatial resolution of LR EEG and quantitatively outperforms existing methods. Furthermore, STADMs demonstrate their value by applying synthetic SR EEG to classification and source localization tasks of epilepsy patients, indicating their potential to significantly improve the spatial resolution of LR EEG.</p></details> |  |

In a graphon particle system, the interactions among particles are characterized by the coupled mean field terms through an underlying graphon and the randomness of the coefficients comes from the stochastic processes associated with the particle labels. By constructing two-level approximated sequences converging in 2-Wasserstein distance, we prove the existence and uniqueness of the solution to the system. Besides, by constructing two-level approximated functions converging to the graphon mean field terms, we establish the law of large numbers, which reveals that if the number of particles tends to infinity and the discretization step tends to zero, then the discrete-time interacting particle system over a large-scale network converges to the graphon particle system. As a byproduct, we discover that the graphon particle system can describe the limiting dynamics of the distributed stochastic gradient descent algorithm over the large-scale network and prove that if the gradients of the local cost functions are Lipschitz continuous, then the graphon particle system can be regarded as the spatio-temporal approximation of the discrete-time distributed stochastic gradient descent algorithm as the number of network nodes tends to infinity and the algorithm step size tends to zero.</p></details> |  |

Despite remarkable breakthroughs in pretrained natural language models that enable one model to handle diverse tasks, a universal solution for spatio-temporal prediction remains challenging Existing prediction approaches are typically tailored for specific spatio-temporal scenarios, requiring task-specific model designs and extensive domain-specific training data. In this study, we introduce UniST, a universal model designed for general urban spatio-temporal prediction across a wide range of scenarios. Inspired by large language models, UniST achieves success through: (i) utilizing diverse spatio-temporal data from different scenarios, (ii) effective pre-training to capture complex spatio-temporal dynamics, (iii) knowledge-guided prompts to enhance generalization capabilities. These designs together unlock the potential of building a universal model for various scenarios Extensive experiments on more than 20 spatio-temporal scenarios demonstrate UniST's efficacy in advancing state-of-the-art performance, especially in few-shot and zero-shot prediction.

In this work, we target enhancing VLMs with a fine-grained structural spatio-temporal alignment learning method (namely Finsta). First of all, we represent the input texts and videos with fine-grained scene graph (SG) structures, both of which are further unified into a holistic SG (HSG) for bridging two modalities. Then, an SG-based framework is built, where the textual SG (TSG) is encoded with a graph Transformer, while the video dynamic SG (DSG) and the HSG are modeled with a novel recurrent graph Transformer for spatial and temporal feature propagation. A spatial-temporal Gaussian differential graph Transformer is further devised to strengthen the sense of the changes in objects across spatial and temporal dimensions. Next, based on the fine-grained structural features of TSG and DSG, we perform object-centered spatial alignment and predicate-centered temporal alignment respectively, enhancing the video-language grounding in both the spatiality and temporality. We design our method as a plug&play system, which can be integrated into existing well-trained VLMs for further representation augmentation, without training from scratch or relying on SG annotations in downstream applications. On 6 representative VL modeling tasks over 12 datasets in both standard and long-form video scenarios, Finsta consistently improves the existing 13 strong-performing VLMs persistently, and refreshes the current state-of-the-art end task performance significantly in both the fine-tuning and zero-shot settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE TPAMI 2024</p></details> |

However, current works for evaluating the spatio-temporal understanding capability of LLMs are somewhat limited and biased. These works either fail to incorporate the latest language models or only focus on assessing the memorized spatio-temporal knowledge. To address this gap, this paper dissects LLMs' capability of spatio-temporal data into four distinct dimensions: knowledge comprehension, spatio-temporal reasoning, accurate computation, and downstream applications. We curate several natural language question-answer tasks for each category and build the benchmark dataset, namely STBench, containing 13 distinct tasks and over 60,000 QA pairs. Moreover, we have assessed the capabilities of 13 LLMs, such as GPT-4o, Gemma and Mistral. Experimental results reveal that existing LLMs show remarkable performance on knowledge comprehension and spatio-temporal reasoning tasks, with potential for further enhancement on other tasks through in-context learning, chain-of-though prompting, and fine-tuning. The code and datasets of STBench are released on https://github.com/LwbXc/STBench.</p></details> |  |

Recent advancements in foundational models, particularly those employing self-attention mechanisms, have significantly enhanced our ability to comprehend the semantics of diverse data types. One such area that could highly benefit from multi-modality is in understanding geospatial data, which inherently has multiple modalities. However, current Natural Language Processing (NLP) mechanisms struggle to effectively address geospatial queries. Existing pre-trained LLMs are inadequately equipped to meet the unique demands of geospatial data, lacking the ability to retrieve precise spatio-temporal data in real-time, thus leading to significantly reduced accuracy in answering complex geospatial queries. To address these limitations, we introduce Geode--a pioneering system designed to tackle zero-shot geospatial question-answering tasks with high precision using spatio-temporal data retrieval. Our approach represents a significant improvement in addressing the limitations of current LLM models, demonstrating remarkable improvement in geospatial question-answering abilities compared to existing state-of-the-art pre-trained models.</p></details> |  |

However, both architectures have inherent shortcomings: CNN are constrained by a limited receptive field that may hinder their ability to capture broader spatial contexts, while Transformers are computationally intensive, making them costly to train and deploy on large datasets. Recently, the Mamba architecture, based on state space models, has shown remarkable performance in a series of natural language processing tasks, which can effectively compensate for the shortcomings of the above two architectures. In this paper, we explore for the first time the potential of the Mamba architecture for remote sensing CD tasks. We tailor the corresponding frameworks, called MambaBCD, MambaSCD, and MambaBDA, for binary change detection (BCD), semantic change detection (SCD), and building damage assessment (BDA), respectively. All three frameworks adopt the cutting-edge Visual Mamba architecture as the encoder, which allows full learning of global spatial contextual information from the input images. For the change decoder, which is available in all three architectures, we propose three spatio-temporal relationship modeling mechanisms, which can be naturally combined with the Mamba architecture and fully utilize its attribute to achieve spatio-temporal interaction of multi-temporal features, thereby obtaining accurate change information. On five benchmark datasets, our proposed frameworks outperform current CNN- and Transformer-based approaches without using any complex training strategies or tricks, fully demonstrating the potential of the Mamba architecture in CD tasks. Further experiments show that our architecture is quite robust to degraded data.

While a few researchers focus on learning ice layer patterns from echogram images captured by airborne snow radar sensors via different convolutional neural networks, the noise in the echogram images proves to be a major obstacle. Instead, we focus on geometric deep learning based on graph neural networks to learn the spatio-temporal patterns from thickness information of shallow ice layers and make predictions for deep layers. In this paper, we propose a physics-informed hybrid graph neural network that combines the GraphSAGE framework for graph feature learning with the long short-term memory (LSTM) structure for learning temporal changes, and introduce measurements of physical ice properties from Model Atmospheric Regional (MAR) weather model as physical node features. We found that our proposed network can consistently outperform the current non-inductive or non-physical model in predicting deep ice layer thickness.</p></details> |  |

OFOS platforms offer dynamic allocation incentives to users and merchants through diverse marketing campaigns to encourage payments while maintaining the platforms' budget efficiency. Despite significant progress, the marketing domain continues to face two primary challenges: (i) how to allocate a limited budget with greater efficiency, demanding precision in predicting users' monotonic response (i.e. sensitivity) to incentives, and (ii) ensuring spatio-temporal adaptability and robustness in diverse marketing campaigns across different times and locations. To address these issues, we propose a Constrained Monotonic Adaptive Network (CoMAN) method for spatio-temporal perception within marketing pricing. Specifically, we capture spatio-temporal preferences within attribute features through two foundational spatio-temporal perception modules. To further enhance catching the user sensitivity differentials to incentives across varied times and locations, we design modules for learning spatio-temporal convexity and concavity as well as for expressing sensitivity functions. CoMAN can achieve a more efficient allocation of incentive investments during pricing, thus increasing the conversion rate and orders while maintaining budget efficiency. Extensive offline and online experimental results within our diverse marketing campaigns demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach while outperforming the monotonic state-of-the-art method.</p></details> | 7 pages |

Matrix factorization is employed to decompose spatio-temporal data into spatial and temporal components. To improve clarity in the temporal patterns, we introduce a nonnegativity constraint on the time domain along with regularization in the frequency domain. Specifically, regularization in the frequency domain involves selecting features in the frequency space, making an interpretation in the frequency domain more convenient. We propose two methods in the frequency domain: soft and hard regularizations, and provide convergence guarantees to first-order stationary points of the corresponding constrained optimization problem. While our primary motivation stems from geophysical data analysis based on GRACE (Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment) data, our methodology has the potential for wider application. Consequently, when applying our methodology to GRACE data, we find that the results with the proposed methodology are comparable to previous research in the field of geophysical sciences but offer clearer interpretability.</p></details> | <details><summary>35 pa...</summary><p>35 pages, Final version</p></details> |

Despite their advantages, a significant gap persists between real-world scenarios, where detection speed is critical, and existing proposals, which operate on large graphs representing several hours of traffic. This gap results in unrealistic operational conditions and impractical detection delays. Moreover, existing models do not generalize well across different networks, hampering their deployment in production environments. To address these issues, we introduce PPTGNN, a practical spatio-temporal GNN for intrusion detection. PPTGNN enables near real-time predictions, while better capturing the spatio-temporal dynamics of network attacks. PPTGNN employs self-supervised pre-training for improved performance and reduced dependency on labeled data. We evaluate PPTGNN on three public datasets and show that it significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models, such as E-ResGAT and E-GraphSAGE, with an average accuracy improvement of 10.38%. Finally, we show that a pre-trained PPTGNN can easily be fine-tuned to unseen networks with minimal labeled examples. This highlights the potential of PPTGNN as a general, large-scale pre-trained model that can effectively operate in diverse network environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper currently under review.

While limiting the variety of training data can make training easier, it can also lead to a lack of knowledge and information for the model, resulting in a decrease in performance. To address this challenge, we presented an innovative paradigm that incorporates three separate forms of curriculum learning specifically targeting from spatial, temporal, and quantile perspectives. Furthermore, our framework incorporates a stacking fusion module to combine diverse information from three types of curriculum learning, resulting in a strong and thorough learning process. We demonstrated the effectiveness of this framework with extensive empirical evaluations, highlighting its better performance in addressing complex ST challenges. We provided thorough ablation studies to investigate the effectiveness of our curriculum and to explain how it contributes to the improvement of learning efficiency on ST data.</p></details> |  |

Premature predictions may yield a higher rate of false alarms, whereas delaying predictions to gather more information can render them too late to be useful. In applications such as wildfires, crimes, and traffic jams, timely forecasting are vital for safeguarding human life and property. Consequently, finding a balance between accuracy and timeliness is crucial. In this paper, we propose an early spatio-temporal forecasting model based on Multi-Objective reinforcement learning that can either implement an optimal policy given a preference or infer the preference based on a small number of samples. The model addresses two primary challenges: 1) enhancing the accuracy of early forecasting and 2) providing the optimal policy for determining the most suitable prediction time for each area. Our method demonstrates superior performance on three large-scale real-world datasets, surpassing existing methods in early spatio-temporal forecasting tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted paper in KDD 2024</p></details> |

This paper proposes a Multi-level Multi-view Augmented Spatio-temporal Transformer (LVSTformer) for traffic prediction. The model aims to capture spatial dependencies from three different levels: local geographic, global semantic, and pivotal nodes, along with long- and short-term temporal dependencies. Specifically, we design three spatial augmented views to delve into the spatial information from the perspectives of local, global, and pivotal nodes. By combining three spatial augmented views with three parallel spatial self-attention mechanisms, the model can comprehensively captures spatial dependencies at different levels. We design a gated temporal self-attention mechanism to effectively capture long- and short-term temporal dependencies. Furthermore, a spatio-temporal context broadcasting module is introduced between two spatio-temporal layers to ensure a well-distributed allocation of attention scores, alleviating overfitting and information loss, and enhancing the generalization ability and robustness of the model. A comprehensive set of experiments is conducted on six well-known traffic benchmarks, the experimental results demonstrate that LVSTformer achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to competing baselines, with the maximum improvement reaching up to 4.32%.</p></details> |  |

Inspired by a recently proposed state space model named Mamba, which has shown remarkable capability of capturing long-range dependency, we propose a new STG forecasting framework named SpoT-Mamba. SpoT-Mamba generates node embeddings by scanning various node-specific walk sequences. Based on the node embeddings, it conducts temporal scans to capture long-range spatio-temporal dependencies.

In this paper, we focus on NCA models used for texture synthesis, where the update rule is inspired by partial differential equations (PDEs) describing reaction-diffusion systems. To train the NCA model, the spatio-temporal domain is discretized, and Euler integration is used to numerically simulate the PDE. However, whether a trained NCA truly learns the continuous dynamic described by the corresponding PDE or merely overfits the discretization used in training remains an open question. We study NCA models at the limit where space-time discretization approaches continuity. We find that existing NCA models tend to overfit the training discretization, especially in the proximity of the initial condition, also called "seed". To address this, we propose a solution that utilizes uniform noise as the initial condition. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in preserving the consistency of NCA dynamics across a wide range of spatio-temporal granularities. Our improved NCA model enables two new test-time interactions by allowing continuous control over the speed of pattern formation and the scale of the synthesized patterns. We demonstrate this new NCA feature in our interactive online demo. Our work reveals that NCA models can learn continuous dynamics and opens new venues for NCA research from a dynamical system's perspective.</p></details> | 9 pages, 12 figures |

Specifically, in the context of estimation, we seek the most likely evolution realizing measured spatio-temporal marginals of killed particles. In the context of control, we seek a suitable control action directing the killed process toward spatio-temporal probabilistic constraints. To this end, we derive a new Schr\"odinger system of coupled, in space and time, partial differential equations to construct the solution of the proposed problem. Further, we show that a Fortet-Sinkhorn type of algorithm is available to attain the associated bridge. A key feature of our framework is that the obtained bridge retains the Markovian structure in the prior process, and thereby, the corresponding controller takes the form of state feedback.</p></details> | 6 pages, 2 figures |

Mainstream approaches employ bidirectional feature propagation, spatio-temporal transformers, or a combination of both to extract information from the video sequence. However, limitations in memory and computational resources constraints the temporal window length of the spatio-temporal transformer, preventing the extraction of longer temporal contextual information from the video sequence. Additionally, bidirectional feature propagation is highly sensitive to inaccurate optical flow in blurry frames, leading to error accumulation during the propagation process. To address these issues, we propose \textbf{BSSTNet}, \textbf{B}lur-aware \textbf{S}patio-temporal \textbf{S}parse \textbf{T}ransformer Network. It introduces the blur map, which converts the originally dense attention into a sparse form, enabling a more extensive utilization of information throughout the entire video sequence. Specifically, BSSTNet (1) uses a longer temporal window in the transformer, leveraging information from more distant frames to restore the blurry pixels in the current frame. (2) introduces bidirectional feature propagation guided by blur maps, which reduces error accumulation caused by the blur frame. The experimental results demonstrate the proposed BSSTNet outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on the GoPro and DVD datasets.</p></details> | CVPR 2024 |

Spatio-temporal data, on the other hand, is vital for analyzing phenomena in both space and time, providing a dynamic perspective on complex system interactions. Recently, diffusion models have seen widespread application in time series and spatio-temporal data mining. Not only do they enhance the generative and inferential capabilities for sequential and temporal data, but they also extend to other downstream tasks. In this survey, we comprehensively and thoroughly review the use of diffusion models in time series and spatio-temporal data, categorizing them by model category, task type, data modality, and practical application domain. In detail, we categorize diffusion models into unconditioned and conditioned types and discuss time series and spatio-temporal data separately. Unconditioned models, which operate unsupervised, are subdivided into probability-based and score-based models, serving predictive and generative tasks such as forecasting, anomaly detection, classification, and imputation. Conditioned models, on the other hand, utilize extra information to enhance performance and are similarly divided for both predictive and generative tasks. Our survey extensively covers their application in various fields, including healthcare, recommendation, climate, energy, audio, and transportation, providing a foundational understanding of how these models analyze and generate data.

However, significant individual variation in the organisation of the human cerebral cortex makes it difficult to identify population-level trends in these signals. Recently, Surface Vision Transformers (SiTs) have emerged as a promising approach for modelling cortical signals, yet they face some limitations in low-data scenarios due to the lack of inductive biases in their architecture. To address these challenges, this paper proposes the surface Masked AutoEncoder (sMAE) and video surface Masked AutoEncoder (vsMAE) - for multivariate and spatio-temporal pre-training of cortical signals over regular icosahedral grids. These models are trained to reconstruct cortical feature maps from masked versions of the input by learning strong latent representations of cortical structure and function. Such representations translate into better modelling of individual phenotypes and enhanced performance in downstream tasks. The proposed approach was evaluated on cortical phenotype regression using data from the young adult Human Connectome Project (HCP) and developing HCP (dHCP). Results show that (v)sMAE pre-trained models improve phenotyping prediction performance on multiple tasks by $\ge 26\%$, and offer faster convergence relative to models trained from scratch. Finally, we show that pre-training vision transformers on large datasets, such as the UK Biobank (UKB), supports transfer learning to low-data regimes. Our code and pre-trained models are publicly available at https://github.com/metrics-lab/surface-masked-autoencoders .</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publications for MIDL 2024; 20 figures; 7 figures</p></details> |

Considering the spatio-temporal nature of EEG data, one of our frameworks is based on a CNN-BiLSTM model. The other involves a CNN-Transformer architecture which inherently involves the more versatile attention based learning paradigm. In both cases, a special 1D-CNN feature extraction module is used to generate the initial embeddings with 1D convolutions in the time and the EEG channel domains. Considering the EEG signals are noisy, non stationary and the discriminative features are even less clear (than in semantically structured data such as text or image), we also follow a window-based classification followed by majority voting during inference, to yield labels at a signal level. To illustrate how brain patterns correlate with different image classes, we visualize t-SNE plots of the BiLSTM embeddings alongside brain activation maps for the top 10 classes. These visualizations provide insightful revelations into the distinct neural signatures associated with each visual category, showcasing the BiLSTM's capability to capture and represent the discriminative brain activity linked to visual stimuli.

However, tackling the video camouflage object detection (VCOD) task presents a unique challenge. Camouflaged objects typically blend into the background, making them difficult to distinguish in still images. Additionally, ensuring temporal consistency in this context is a challenging problem. As a result, SAM encounters limitations and falls short when applied to the VCOD task. To overcome these challenges, we propose a new method called the SAM Propagation Module (SAM-PM). Our propagation module enforces temporal consistency within SAM by employing spatio-temporal cross-attention mechanisms. Moreover, we exclusively train the propagation module while keeping the SAM network weights frozen, allowing us to integrate task-specific insights with the vast knowledge accumulated by the large model. Our method effectively incorporates temporal consistency and domain-specific expertise into the segmentation network with an addition of less than 1% of SAM's parameters. Extensive experimentation reveals a substantial performance improvement in the VCOD benchmark when compared to the most recent state-of-the-art techniques. Code and pre-trained weights are open-sourced at https://github.com/SpiderNitt/SAM-PM</p></details> |  |

The prediction of the remaining useful life (RUL) of batteries is crucial for ensuring reliable and efficient operation, as well as reducing maintenance costs. However, determining the life cycle of batteries in real-world scenarios is challenging, and existing methods have limitations in predicting the number of cycles iteratively. In addition, existing works often oversimplify the datasets, neglecting important features of the batteries such as temperature, internal resistance, and material type. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a two-stage RUL prediction scheme for Lithium-ion batteries using a spatio-temporal multimodal attention network (ST-MAN). The proposed ST-MAN is to capture the complex spatio-temporal dependencies in the battery data, including the features that are often neglected in existing works. Despite operating without prior knowledge of end-of-life (EOL) events, our method consistently achieves lower error rates, boasting mean absolute error (MAE) and mean square error (MSE) of 0.0275 and 0.0014, respectively, compared to existing convolutional neural networks (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM)-based methods. The proposed method has the potential to improve the reliability and efficiency of battery operations and is applicable in various industries.</p></details> |  |

We propose novel approaches to improve mesh-agnostic spatio-temporal prediction of transient flow fields using graph U-Nets, enabling accurate prediction on diverse mesh configurations. Key enhancements to the graph U-Net architecture, including the Gaussian mixture model convolutional operator and noise injection approaches, provide increased flexibility in modeling node dynamics: the former reduces prediction error by 95\% compared to conventional convolutional operators, while the latter improves long-term prediction robustness, resulting in an error reduction of 86\%. We also investigate transductive and inductive-learning perspectives of graph U-Nets with proposed improvements. In the transductive setting, they effectively predict quantities for unseen nodes within the trained graph. In the inductive setting, they successfully perform in mesh scenarios with different vortex-shedding periods, showing 98\% improvement in predicting the future flow fields compared to a model trained without the inductive settings. It is found that graph U-Nets without pooling operations, i.e. without reducing and restoring the node dimensionality of the graph data, perform better in inductive settings due to their ability to learn from the detailed structure of each graph. Meanwhile, we also discover that the choice of normalization technique significantly impacts graph U-Net performance.</p></details> |  |

Considering the sparsity of data due to the high maintenance cost of the stations, good inference algorithms can effectively save the cost and refine the data granularity.

Although these methods have shown some potential in creating immersive experiences, two drawbacks limit their ubiquity: (i) a significant reduction in reconstruction quality when the computing budget is limited, and (ii) a lack of semantic understanding of the underlying scenes. To address these issues, we introduce Gear-NeRF, which leverages semantic information from powerful image segmentation models. Our approach presents a principled way for learning a spatio-temporal (4D) semantic embedding, based on which we introduce the concept of gears to allow for stratified modeling of dynamic regions of the scene based on the extent of their motion. Such differentiation allows us to adjust the spatio-temporal sampling resolution for each region in proportion to its motion scale, achieving more photo-realistic dynamic novel view synthesis. At the same time, almost for free, our approach enables free-viewpoint tracking of objects of interest - a functionality not yet achieved by existing NeRF-based methods. Empirical studies validate the effectiveness of our method, where we achieve state-of-the-art rendering and tracking performance on multiple challenging datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper accepted to IEEE/CVF CVPR 2024 (Spotlight).

Computations are done through a Gaussian Markov random field approximation of the solution of the SPDE, which is constructed through a finite volume method. The new flexible non-separable model is compared to a flexible separable model both for reconstruction and forecasting and evaluated in terms of root mean square errors and continuous rank probability scores. A simulation study demonstrates that the non-separable model performs better when the data is simulated with non-separable effects such as diffusion and advection. Further, we estimate surrogate models for emulating the output of a ocean model in Trondheimsfjorden, Norway, and simulate observations of autonoumous underwater vehicles. The results show that the flexible non-separable model outperforms the flexible separable model for real-time prediction of unobserved locations.</p></details> |  |

In recent years, they have gained considerable research interest. However, existing SNNs predominantly rely on the Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) model and are primarily suited for simple, static tasks. They lack the ability to effectively model long-term temporal dependencies and facilitate spatial information interaction, which is crucial for tackling complex, dynamic spatio-temporal prediction tasks. To tackle these challenges, this paper draws inspiration from the concept of autaptic synapses in biology and proposes a novel Spatio-Temporal Circuit (STC) model. The STC model integrates two learnable adaptive pathways, enhancing the spiking neurons' temporal memory and spatial coordination. We conduct a theoretical analysis of the dynamic parameters in the STC model, highlighting their contribution in establishing long-term memory and mitigating the issue of gradient vanishing. Through extensive experiments on multiple spatio-temporal prediction datasets, we demonstrate that our model outperforms other adaptive models. Furthermore, our model is compatible with existing spiking neuron models, thereby augmenting their dynamic representations. In essence, our work enriches the specificity and topological complexity of SNNs.</p></details> | Accepted by ICML2024 |

The existing video adversarial attack methods mainly take a gradient-based approach and generate adversarial videos with noticeable perturbations. In this paper, we propose a novel Sparse Adversarial Video Attack via Spatio-Temporal Invertible Neural Networks (SVASTIN) to generate adversarial videos through spatio-temporal feature space information exchanging. It consists of a Guided Target Video Learning (GTVL) module to balance the perturbation budget and optimization speed and a Spatio-Temporal Invertible Neural Network (STIN) module to perform spatio-temporal feature space information exchanging between a source video and the target feature tensor learned by GTVL module. Extensive experiments on UCF-101 and Kinetics-400 demonstrate that our proposed SVASTIN can generate adversarial examples with higher imperceptibility than the state-of-the-art methods with the higher fooling rate.

For example, in landscape genetics, the aim is to infer spatial mechanisms that govern gene flow in populations. Existing statistical approaches in landscape genetics do not account for temporal dependence in the data and may be computationally prohibitive. We infer mechanisms with a Bayesian hierarchical dyadic model that scales well with large data sets and that accounts for spatial and temporal dependence. We construct a fully-connected network comprising spatio-temporal data for the dyadic model and use normalized composite likelihoods to account for the dependence structure in space and time. We develop a dyadic model to account for physical mechanisms commonly found in physical-statistical models and apply our methods to ancient human DNA data to infer the mechanisms that affected human movement in Bronze Age Europe.</p></details> | <details><summary>46 pa...</summary><p>46 pages, 7 figures, 3 appendices, code on GitHub</p></details> |

Many recent studies have concentrated on meticulously reconciling various advantages, leading to designed models that are neither simple nor practical. To address this issue, this paper presents a systematic study on existing shortcomings faced by off-the-shelf models, including lack of local fidelity, poor prediction performance over long time-steps,low scalability, and inefficiency. To systematically address the aforementioned problems, we propose an EarthFarseer, a concise framework that combines parallel local convolutions and global Fourier-based transformer architectures, enabling dynamically capture the local-global spatial interactions and dependencies. EarthFarseer also incorporates a multi-scale fully convolutional and Fourier architectures to efficiently and effectively capture the temporal evolution. Our proposal demonstrates strong adaptability across various tasks and datasets, with fast convergence and better local fidelity in long time-steps predictions. Extensive experiments and visualizations over eight human society physical and natural physical datasets demonstrates the state-of-the-art performance of EarthFarseer.

Consequently, methods for predicting and preventing traffic accidents have been researched for many years. With advancements in the field of artificial intelligence, various studies have applied Machine Learning and Deep Learning techniques to traffic accident prediction. Modern traffic conditions change rapidly by the minute, and these changes vary significantly across different roads. In other words, the risk of traffic accidents changes minute by minute in various patterns for each road. Therefore, it is desirable to predict traffic accident risk at the Minute-Level and Road-Level. However, because roads have close and complex relationships with adjacent roads, research on predicting traffic accidents at the Minute-Level and Road-Level is challenging. Thus, it is essential to build a model that can reflect the spatial and temporal characteristics of roads for traffic accident prediction. Consequently, recent attempts have been made to use Graph Convolutional Networks to capture the spatial characteristics of roads and Recurrent Neural Networks to capture their temporal characteristics for predicting traffic accident risk. This paper proposes the Sequential based Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Networks (SST-GCN), which combines GCN and LSTM, to predict traffic accidents at the Minute-Level and Road-Level using a road dataset constructed in Seoul, the capital of South Korea. Experiments have demonstrated that SST-GCN outperforms other state-of-the-art models in Minute-Level predictions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatio-Spectral Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19121v2)** | 2024-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial Message Passing Graph Neural Networks (MPGNNs) are widely used for learning on graph-structured data. However, key limitations of l-step MPGNNs are that their "receptive field" is typically limited to the l-hop neighborhood of a node and that information exchange between distant nodes is limited by over-squashing. Motivated by these limitations, we propose Spatio-Spectral Graph Neural Networks (S$^2$GNNs) -- a new modeling paradigm for Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) that synergistically combines spatially and spectrally parametrized graph filters. Parameterizing filters partially in the frequency domain enables global yet efficient information propagation. We show that S$^2$GNNs vanquish over-squashing and yield strictly tighter approximation-theoretic error bounds than MPGNNs. Further, rethinking graph convolutions at a fundamental level unlocks new design spaces. For example, S$^2$GNNs allow for free positional encodings that make them strictly more expressive than the 1-Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) test. Moreover, to obtain general-purpose S$^2$GNNs, we propose spectrally parametrized filters for directed graphs. S$^2$GNNs outperform spatial MPGNNs, graph transformers, and graph rewirings, e.g., on the peptide long-range benchmark tasks, and are competitive with state-of-the-art sequence modeling. On a 40 GB GPU, S$^2$GNNs scale to millions of nodes.</p></details> | <details><summary>46 pa...</summary><p>46 pages, 27 figures, 12 tables</p></details> |

Digital Subtraction Angiography (DSA) sequences, recognized as the golden standard for diagnosing CVDs, can clearly visualize the dynamic flow and reveal pathological conditions within the cerebrovasculature. Therefore, precise segmentation of cerebral arteries (CAs) and classification between their main trunks and branches are crucial for physicians to accurately quantify diseases. However, achieving accurate CA segmentation in DSA sequences remains a challenging task due to small vessels with low contrast, and ambiguity between vessels and residual skull structures. Moreover, the lack of publicly available datasets limits exploration in the field. In this paper, we introduce a DSA Sequence-based Cerebral Artery segmentation dataset (DSCA), the first publicly accessible dataset designed specifically for pixel-level semantic segmentation of CAs. Additionally, we propose DSANet, a spatio-temporal network for CA segmentation in DSA sequences. Unlike existing DSA segmentation methods that focus only on a single frame, the proposed DSANet introduces a separate temporal encoding branch to capture dynamic vessel details across multiple frames. To enhance small vessel segmentation and improve vessel connectivity, we design a novel TemporalFormer module to capture global context and correlations among sequential frames. Furthermore, we develop a Spatio-Temporal Fusion (STF) module to effectively integrate spatial and temporal features from the encoder. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DSANet outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in CA segmentation, achieving a Dice of 0.9033.</p></details> |  |

The increase of wearables such as GPS sensors has provided analysts with large fine-grained datasets detailing player performance. Traditional analysis of this data focuses on individual athletes with measures of internal and external loading such as distance covered in speed zones or rate of perceived exertion. However these metrics do not provide enough information to understand team dynamics within field sports. The spatio-temporal nature of match play necessitates an investment in date-engineering to adequately transform the data into a suitable format to extract features such as areas of activity. In this paper we present an approach to construct Time-Window Spatial Activity Graphs (TWGs) for field sports. Using GPS data obtained from Gaelic Football matches we demonstrate how our approach can be utilised to extract spatio-temporal features from GPS sensor data</p></details> |  |

The primary challenge in achieving precise load forecasting for EVCS lies in accounting for the nonlinear of charging behaviors, the spatial interactions among different stations, and the intricate temporal variations in usage patterns. To address these challenges, we propose a Multiscale Spatio-Temporal Enhanced Model (MSTEM) for effective load forecasting at EVCS. MSTEM incorporates a multiscale graph neural network to discern hierarchical nonlinear temporal dependencies across various time scales. Besides, it also integrates a recurrent learning component and a residual fusion mechanism, enhancing its capability to accurately capture spatial and temporal variations in charging patterns. The effectiveness of the proposed MSTEM has been validated through comparative analysis with six baseline models using three evaluation metrics. The case studies utilize real-world datasets for both fast and slow charging loads at EVCS in Perth, UK. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of MSTEM in short-term continuous load forecasting for EVCS.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 1 figure, AEEES 2024</p></details> |

This work addresses this task from a multimodal supervision perspective, proposing a framework for spatio-temporal action grounding trained on loose video and subtitle supervision only, without human annotation. To this end, we combine local representation learning, which focuses on leveraging fine-grained spatial information, with a global representation encoding that captures higher-level representations and incorporates both in a joint approach. To evaluate this challenging task in a real-life setting, a new benchmark dataset is proposed providing dense spatio-temporal grounding annotations in long, untrimmed, multi-action instructional videos for over 5K events. We evaluate the proposed approach and other methods on the proposed and standard downstream tasks showing that our method improves over current baselines in various settings, including spatial, temporal, and untrimmed multi-action spatio-temporal grounding.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be presented at CVPR 2024.

However, this is a nontrivial problem and poses two critical challenges: sparse spatio-temporal correlation between audio-video pairs and multimodal correlation overwriting that forgets audio-video relations. To tackle this problem, we propose a new continual audio-video pre-training method with two novel ideas: (1) Localized Patch Importance Scoring: we introduce a multimodal encoder to determine the importance score for each patch, emphasizing semantically intertwined audio-video patches. (2) Replay-guided Correlation Assessment: to reduce the corruption of previously learned audiovisual knowledge due to drift, we propose to assess the correlation of the current patches on the past steps to identify the patches exhibiting high correlations with the past steps. Based on the results from the two ideas, we perform probabilistic patch selection for effective continual audio-video pre-training. Experimental validation on multiple benchmarks shows that our method achieves a 3.69%p of relative performance gain in zero-shot retrieval tasks compared to strong continual learning baselines, while reducing memory consumption by ~45%.</p></details> | ICML 2024 |

Despite the significant strides made by graph-based networks in spatio-temporal forecasting, there remain two pivotal factors closely related to forecasting performance that need further consideration: time delays in propagation dynamics and multi-scale high-dimensional interactions. In this work, we present a Series-Aligned Multi-Scale Graph Learning (SAMSGL) framework, aiming to enhance forecasting performance. In order to handle time delays in spatial interactions, we propose a series-aligned graph convolution layer to facilitate the aggregation of non-delayed graph signals, thereby mitigating the influence of time delays for the improvement in accuracy. To understand global and local spatio-temporal interactions, we develop a spatio-temporal architecture via multi-scale graph learning, which encompasses two essential components: multi-scale graph structure learning and graph-fully connected (Graph-FC) blocks. The multi-scale graph structure learning includes a global graph structure to learn both delayed and non-delayed node embeddings, as well as a local one to learn node variations influenced by neighboring factors. The Graph-FC blocks synergistically fuse spatial and temporal information to boost prediction accuracy. To evaluate the performance of SAMSGL, we conduct experiments on meteorological and traffic forecasting datasets, which demonstrate its effectiveness and superiority.</p></details> | Accepted by Chaos |

In order to summarise information encompassed in such data, we combine two well known statistical modelling methods. To account for the spatial dimension, we use the intrinsic modification of the conditional autoregression, and incorporate it with the hidden Markov model, allowing the spatial patterns to vary over time. We apply our method into parish register data considering deaths caused by measles in Finland in 1750-1850, and gain novel insight of previously undiscovered infection dynamics. Five distinctive, reoccurring states describing spatially and temporally differing infection burden and potential routes of spread are identified. We also find that there is a change in the occurrences of the most typical spatial patterns circa 1812, possibly due to changes in communication routes after major administrative transformations in Finland.</p></details> |  |

To address this, we propose a two-stage spatio-temporal graph neural network (STGNN) framework. The first stage uses a pre-trained STGNN to process telecom data, while the second stage integrates directional and geographic insights for accurate prediction.

This issue is particularly challenging in spatio-temporal analyses, where it has been less explored so far. To study the effects of air pollution on mortality in Italy, we argue that a model that simultaneously accounts for spatio-temporal confounding and for the non-linear form of the effect of interest is needed. To this end, we propose a Bayesian dynamic generalized linear model, which allows for a non-linear association and for a decomposition of the exposure effect into two components. This decomposition accommodates associations with the outcome at fine and coarse temporal and spatial scales of variation. These features, when combined, allow reducing the spatio-temporal confounding bias and recovering the true shape of the association, as demonstrated through simulation studies. The results from the real-data application indicate that the exposure effect seems to have different magnitudes in different seasons, with peaks in the summer. We hypothesize that this could be due to possible interactions between the exposure variable with air temperature and unmeasured confounders.</p></details> | 40 pages, 11 figures |

These include simultaneous confidence intervals and tests of hypotheses, whose asymptotics is borne by a non-trivial functional central limit theorem tailored to martingale differences.

Recently, transformer based models have shown remarkable potential in weather forecasting achieving state-of-the-art results. However, transformers are discrete models which limit their ability to learn the continuous spatio-temporal features of the dynamical weather system. We address this issue with STC-ViT, a Spatio-Temporal Continuous Vision Transformer for weather forecasting. STC-ViT incorporates the continuous time Neural ODE layers with multi-head attention mechanism to learn the continuous weather evolution over time. The attention mechanism is encoded as a differentiable function in the transformer architecture to model the complex weather dynamics. We evaluate STC-ViT against a operational Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) model and several deep learning based weather forecasting models. STC-ViT performs competitively with current data-driven methods in global forecasting while only being trained at lower resolution data and with less compute power.</p></details> |  |

However, prevailing methodologies, often focusing on synchronous BOLD signals from functional MRI (fMRI), may not capture directional influences among brain regions and rarely tackle temporal functional dynamics. In this study, we first construct the brain-effective network via the dynamic causal model. Subsequently, we introduce an interpretable graph learning framework termed Spatio-Temporal Embedding ODE (STE-ODE). This framework incorporates specifically designed directed node embedding layers, aiming at capturing the dynamic interplay between structural and effective networks via an ordinary differential equation (ODE) model, which characterizes spatial-temporal brain dynamics. Our framework is validated on several clinical phenotype prediction tasks using two independent publicly available datasets (HCP and OASIS). The experimental results clearly demonstrate the advantages of our model compared to several state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

Existing equivariant Graph Neural Network (GNN) based methods have encapsulated the symmetry of physics, \emph{e.g.}, translations, rotations, etc, leading to better generalization ability. Nevertheless, their frame-to-frame formulation of the task overlooks the non-Markov property mainly incurred by unobserved dynamics in the environment. In this paper, we reformulate dynamics simulation as a spatio-temporal prediction task, by employing the trajectory in the past period to recover the Non-Markovian interactions. We propose Equivariant Spatio-Temporal Attentive Graph Networks (ESTAG), an equivariant version of spatio-temporal GNNs, to fulfill our purpose. At its core, we design a novel Equivariant Discrete Fourier Transform (EDFT) to extract periodic patterns from the history frames, and then construct an Equivariant Spatial Module (ESM) to accomplish spatial message passing, and an Equivariant Temporal Module (ETM) with the forward attention and equivariant pooling mechanisms to aggregate temporal message.

However, their performance is constrained by the reliance on extensive data for training on specific tasks, which limits their adaptability to new urban domains with varied demands. Although transfer learning has been proposed to address this problem by leveraging knowledge across domains, cross-task generalization remains underexplored in spatio-temporal graph transfer learning methods due to the absence of a unified framework. To bridge this gap, we propose Spatio-Temporal Graph Prompting (STGP), a prompt-enhanced transfer learning framework capable of adapting to diverse tasks in data-scarce domains. Specifically, we first unify different tasks into a single template and introduce a task-agnostic network architecture that aligns with this template. This approach enables the capture of spatio-temporal dependencies shared across tasks. Furthermore, we employ learnable prompts to achieve domain and task transfer in a two-stage prompting pipeline, enabling the prompts to effectively capture domain knowledge and task-specific properties at each stage. Extensive experiments demonstrate that STGP outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in three downstream tasks forecasting, kriging, and extrapolation by a notable margin.</p></details> |  |

Although deep learning approaches have achieved considerable success in predicting RUL, challenges such as low prediction accuracy and interpretability pose significant challenges, hindering their practical implementation. In this work, we introduce a Spatio-temporal Attention-based Hidden Physics-informed Neural Network (STA-HPINN) for RUL prediction, which can utilize the associated physics of the system degradation. The spatio-temporal attention mechanism can extract important features from the input data. With the self-attention mechanism on both the sensor dimension and time step dimension, the proposed model can effectively extract degradation information. The hidden physics-informed neural network is utilized to capture the physics mechanisms that govern the evolution of RUL. With the constraint of physics, the model can achieve higher accuracy and reasonable predictions. The approach is validated on a benchmark dataset, demonstrating exceptional performance when compared to cutting-edge methods, especially in the case of complex conditions.</p></details> |  |

The co-dynamics can be mediated by immunosuppression or -modulation, shared environmental or climatic drivers, or competition for susceptible hosts. Research and statistical methods in epidemiology often concentrate on large pooled datasets, or high quality data from cities, leaving rural areas underrepresented in literature. Data considering rural populations are typically sparse and scarce, especially in the case of historical data sources, which may introduce considerable methodological challenges. In order to overcome many obstacles due to such data, we present a general Bayesian spatio-temporal model for disease co-dynamics. Applying the proposed model on historical (1820-1850) Finnish parish register data, we study the spread of infectious diseases in pre-healthcare Finland. We observe that measles, pertussis, and smallpox exhibit positively correlated dynamics, which could be attributed to immunosuppressive effects or, for example, the general weakening of the population due to recurring infections or poor nutritional conditions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Khronos: A Unified Approach for Spatio-Temporal Metric-Semantic SLAM in Dynamic Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13817v2)** | 2024-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Perceiving and understanding highly dynamic and changing environments is a crucial capability for robot autonomy. While large strides have been made towards developing dynamic SLAM approaches that estimate the robot pose accurately, a lesser emphasis has been put on the construction of dense spatio-temporal representations of the robot environment. A detailed understanding of the scene and its evolution through time is crucial for long-term robot autonomy and essential to tasks that require long-term reasoning, such as operating effectively in environments shared with humans and other agents and thus are subject to short and long-term dynamics. To address this challenge, this work defines the Spatio-temporal Metric-semantic SLAM (SMS) problem, and presents a framework to factorize and solve it efficiently. We show that the proposed factorization suggests a natural organization of a spatio-temporal perception system, where a fast process tracks short-term dynamics in an active temporal window, while a slower process reasons over long-term changes in the environment using a factor graph formulation. We provide an efficient implementation of the proposed spatio-temporal perception approach, that we call Khronos, and show that it unifies exiting interpretations of short-term and long-term dynamics and is able to construct a dense spatio-temporal map in real-time. We provide simulated and real results, showing that the spatio-temporal maps built by Khronos are an accurate reflection of a 3D scene over time and that Khronos outperforms baselines across multiple metrics. We further validate our approach on two heterogeneous robots in challenging, large-scale real-world environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Robotics: Science and Systems, 2024.

| **[UrbanGPT: Spatio-Temporal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00813v3)** | 2024-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal prediction aims to forecast and gain insights into the ever-changing dynamics of urban environments across both time and space. Its purpose is to anticipate future patterns, trends, and events in diverse facets of urban life, including transportation, population movement, and crime rates. Although numerous efforts have been dedicated to developing neural network techniques for accurate predictions on spatio-temporal data, it is important to note that many of these methods heavily depend on having sufficient labeled data to generate precise spatio-temporal representations. Unfortunately, the issue of data scarcity is pervasive in practical urban sensing scenarios. Consequently, it becomes necessary to build a spatio-temporal model with strong generalization capabilities across diverse spatio-temporal learning scenarios. Taking inspiration from the remarkable achievements of large language models (LLMs), our objective is to create a spatio-temporal LLM that can exhibit exceptional generalization capabilities across a wide range of downstream urban tasks. To achieve this objective, we present the UrbanGPT, which seamlessly integrates a spatio-temporal dependency encoder with the instruction-tuning paradigm. This integration enables LLMs to comprehend the complex inter-dependencies across time and space, facilitating more comprehensive and accurate predictions under data scarcity. To validate the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct extensive experiments on various public datasets, covering different spatio-temporal prediction tasks. The results consistently demonstrate that our UrbanGPT, with its carefully designed architecture, consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. These findings highlight the potential of building large language models for spatio-temporal learning, particularly in zero-shot scenarios where labeled data is scarce.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by KDD'2024 as Full Paper</p></details> |
| **[Open-Vocabulary Spatio-Temporal Action Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10832v1)** | 2024-05-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal action detection (STAD) is an important fine-grained video understanding task. Current methods require box and label supervision for all action classes in advance. However, in real-world applications, it is very likely to come across new action classes not seen in training because the action category space is large and hard to enumerate. Also, the cost of data annotation and model training for new classes is extremely high for traditional methods, as we need to perform detailed box annotations and re-train the whole network from scratch. In this paper, we propose a new challenging setting by performing open-vocabulary STAD to better mimic the situation of action detection in an open world. Open-vocabulary spatio-temporal action detection (OV-STAD) requires training a model on a limited set of base classes with box and label supervision, which is expected to yield good generalization performance on novel action classes. For OV-STAD, we build two benchmarks based on the existing STAD datasets and propose a simple but effective method based on pretrained video-language models (VLM). To better adapt the holistic VLM for the fine-grained action detection task, we carefully fine-tune it on the localized video region-text pairs. This customized fine-tuning endows the VLM with better motion understanding, thus contributing to a more accurate alignment between video regions and texts. Local region feature and global video feature fusion before alignment is adopted to further improve the action detection performance by providing global context. Our method achieves a promising performance on novel classes.</p></details> |  |

In the 1990s, the US EPA enacted the reformulated gasoline program in select areas of the US, which drastically reduced ambient TRAP in affected areas. This created an ideal quasi-experiment to study the effects of TRAP on childhood hematologic cancers. However, existing methods for quasi-experimental analyses can perform poorly when outcomes are rare and unstable, as with childhood cancer incidence. We develop Bayesian spatio-temporal matrix completion methods to conduct causal inference in quasi-experimental settings with rare outcomes. Selective information sharing across space and time enables stable estimation, and the Bayesian approach facilitates uncertainty quantification. We evaluate the methods through simulations and apply them to estimate the causal effects of TRAP on childhood leukemia and lymphoma.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Tidy Framework and Infrastructure to Systematically Assemble Spatio-temporal Indexes from Multivariate Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05812v2)** | 2024-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Indexes are useful for summarizing multivariate information into single metrics for monitoring, communicating, and decision-making. While most work has focused on defining new indexes for specific purposes, more attention needs to be directed towards making it possible to understand index behavior in different data conditions, and to determine how their structure affects their values and variation in values. Here we discuss a modular data pipeline recommendation to assemble indexes. It is universally applicable to index computation and allows investigation of index behavior as part of the development procedure. One can compute indexes with different parameter choices, adjust steps in the index definition by adding, removing, and swapping them to experiment with various index designs, calculate uncertainty measures, and assess indexes robustness. The paper presents three examples to illustrate the pipeline framework usage: comparison of two different indexes designed to monitor the spatio-temporal distribution of drought in Queensland, Australia; the effect of dimension reduction choices on the Global Gender Gap Index (GGGI) on countries ranking; and how to calculate bootstrap confidence intervals for the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI). The methods are supported by a new R package, called tidyindex.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fighter flight trajectory prediction based on spatio-temporal graphcial attention network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08034v1)** | 2024-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quickly and accurately predicting the flight trajectory of a blue army fighter in close-range air combat helps a red army fighter gain a dominant situation, which is the winning factor in later air combat. However,due to the high speed and even hypersonic capabilities of advanced fighters, the diversity of tactical maneuvers,and the instantaneous nature of situational transitions,it is difficult to meet the requirements of practical combat applications in terms of prediction accuracy.To improve prediction accuracy,this paper proposes a spatio-temporal graph attention network (ST-GAT) using encoding and decoding structures to predict the flight trajectory. The encoder adopts a parallel structure of Transformer and GAT branches embedded with the multi-head self-attention mechanism in each front end. The Transformer branch network is used to extract the temporal characteristics of historical trajectories and capture the impact of the fighter's historical state on future trajectories, while the GAT branch network is used to extract spatial features in historical trajectories and capture potential spatial correlations between fighters.Then we concatenate the outputs of the two branches into a new feature vector and input it into a decoder composed of a fully connected network to predict the future position coordinates of the blue army fighter.The computer simulation results show that the proposed network significantly improves the prediction accuracy of flight trajectories compared to the enhanced CNN-LSTM network (ECNN-LSTM), with improvements of 47% and 34% in both ADE and FDE indicators,providing strong support for subsequent autonomous combat missions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Residual-based Attention Physics-informed Neural Networks for Efficient Spatio-Temporal Lifetime Assessment of Transformers Operated in Renewable Power Plants](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06443v1)** | 2024-05-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformers are vital assets for the reliable and efficient operation of power and energy systems. They support the integration of renewables to the grid through improved grid stability and operation efficiency. Monitoring the health of transformers is essential to ensure grid reliability and efficiency. Thermal insulation ageing is a key transformer failure mode, which is generally tracked by monitoring the hotspot temperature (HST). However, HST measurement is complex and expensive and often estimated from indirect measurements. Existing computationally-efficient HST models focus on space-agnostic thermal models, providing worst-case HST estimates. This article introduces an efficient spatio-temporal model for transformer winding temperature and ageing estimation, which leverages physics-based partial differential equations (PDEs) with data-driven Neural Networks (NN) in a Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) configuration to improve prediction accuracy and acquire spatio-temporal resolution. The computational efficiency of the PINN model is improved through the implementation of the Residual-Based Attention scheme that accelerates the PINN model convergence. PINN based oil temperature predictions are used to estimate spatio-temporal transformer winding temperature values, which are validated through PDE resolution models and fiber optic sensor measurements, respectively. Furthermore, the spatio-temporal transformer ageing model is inferred, aiding transformer health management decision-making and providing insights into localized thermal ageing phenomena in the transformer insulation. Results are validated with a distribution transformer operated on a floating photovoltaic power plant.</p></details> | 18 pages, 16 figures |

Neuromorphic disciplines view the brain as a coevolved system, simultaneously optimizing the hardware and the algorithms running on it. There are clear efficiency gains when bringing the computations into a physical substrate, but we presently lack theories to guide efficient implementations. Here, we present a principled computational model for neuromorphic systems in terms of spatio-temporal receptive fields, based on affine Gaussian kernels over space and leaky-integrator and leaky integrate-and-fire models over time. Our theory is provably covariant to spatial affine and temporal scaling transformations, and with close similarities to the visual processing in mammalian brains. We use these spatio-temporal receptive fields as a prior in an event-based vision task, and show that this improves the training of spiking networks, which otherwise is known as problematic for event-based vision. This work combines efforts within scale-space theory and computational neuroscience to identify theoretically well-founded ways to process spatio-temporal signals in neuromorphic systems. Our contributions are immediately relevant for signal processing and event-based vision, and can be extended to other processing tasks over space and time, such as memory and control.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code available at https://github.com/jegp/nrf</p></details> |

Despite significant strides in ST modeling in recent years, there remains a need to emphasize harnessing the potential of information from different modalities. Robust MoST forecasting is more challenging because it possesses (i) high-dimensional and complex internal structures and (ii) dynamic heterogeneity caused by temporal, spatial, and modality variations. In this study, we propose a novel MoST learning framework via Self-Supervised Learning, namely MoSSL, which aims to uncover latent patterns from temporal, spatial, and modality perspectives while quantifying dynamic heterogeneity. Experiment results on two real-world MoST datasets verify the superiority of our approach compared with the state-of-the-art baselines.

We provide a polynomial-time algorithm which decides whether a given graph is a Burling graph and if it is, constructs its intersection model by rectangular frames. That model enables a polynomial-time algorithm for the maximum independent set problem in Burling graphs. As a consequence, we establish Burling graphs as the first known hereditary class of graphs that admits such an algorithm while not being $\chi$-bounded.</p></details> |  |

Traditional methods for extracting knowledge from these graphs often depend on feature engineering or deep learning. Feature engineering is limited by the manual and time-intensive nature of crafting features, while deep learning approaches suffer from high inference latency, making them impractical for real-time applications. This paper introduces Deep-Graph-Sprints (DGS), a novel deep learning architecture designed for efficient representation learning on CTDGs with low-latency inference requirements. We benchmark DGS against state-of-the-art feature engineering and graph neural network methods using five diverse datasets. The results indicate that DGS achieves competitive performance while improving inference speed up to 12x compared to other deep learning approaches on our tested benchmarks. Our method effectively bridges the gap between deep representation learning and low-latency application requirements for CTDGs.</p></details> |  |

Existing data contribution methods have been applied to various data types, including tabular data, images, and texts; however, their primary focus has been on i.i.d. settings. Despite the pressing need for principled approaches tailored to time series datasets, the problem of estimating data contribution in such settings remains unexplored, possibly due to challenges associated with handling inherent temporal dependencies. This paper introduces TimeInf, a data contribution estimation method for time-series datasets. TimeInf uses influence functions to attribute model predictions to individual time points while preserving temporal structures. Our extensive empirical results demonstrate that TimeInf outperforms state-of-the-art methods in identifying harmful anomalies and helpful time points for forecasting. Additionally, TimeInf offers intuitive and interpretable attributions of data values, allowing us to easily distinguish diverse anomaly patterns through visualizations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Real-Time Interactions Between Human Controllers and Remote Devices in Metaverse](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16591v1)** | 2024-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Supporting real-time interactions between human controllers and remote devices remains a challenging goal in the Metaverse due to the stringent requirements on computing workload, communication throughput, and round-trip latency. In this paper, we establish a novel framework for real-time interactions through the virtual models in the Metaverse. Specifically, we jointly predict the motion of the human controller for 1) proactive rendering in the Metaverse and 2) generating control commands to the real-world remote device in advance. The virtual model is decoupled into two components for rendering and control, respectively. To dynamically adjust the prediction horizons for rendering and control, we develop a two-step human-in-the-loop continuous reinforcement learning approach and use an expert policy to improve the training efficiency. An experimental prototype is built to verify our algorithm with different communication latencies. Compared with the baseline policy without prediction, our proposed method can reduce 1) the Motion-To-Photon (MTP) latency between human motion and rendering feedback and 2) the root mean squared error (RMSE) between human motion and real-world remote devices significantly.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted with minor revisions by IEEE MetroXRAINE 2024</p></details> |

Precise modeling of this phenomena usually requires utilization of the large systems of nonlinear ordinary differential equations and intensive computations. We concentrate on performance of three explicit Runge-Kutta time-integration methods and provide simulations for two types of problems: finding of equilibrium solutions and simulations for kinetics with periodic solutions. The first class of problems may be analyzed through the relaxation of the solution to the stationary state after large time. In this case, the adaptive time-stepping may help to reach it using big steps reducing cost of the calculations without loss of accuracy. In the second case, the problem becomes numerically unstable at certain points of the phase space and may require tiny steps making the simulations very time-consuming. Adaptive criteria allows to increase the steps for most of points and speedup simulations significantly.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 3 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[MicroEmo: Time-Sensitive Multimodal Emotion Recognition with Micro-Expression Dynamics in Video Dialogues](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16552v1)** | 2024-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable multimodal emotion recognition capabilities, integrating multimodal cues from visual, acoustic, and linguistic contexts in the video to recognize human emotional states. However, existing methods ignore capturing local facial features of temporal dynamics of micro-expressions and do not leverage the contextual dependencies of the utterance-aware temporal segments in the video, thereby limiting their expected effectiveness to a certain extent. In this work, we propose MicroEmo, a time-sensitive MLLM aimed at directing attention to the local facial micro-expression dynamics and the contextual dependencies of utterance-aware video clips. Our model incorporates two key architectural contributions: (1) a global-local attention visual encoder that integrates global frame-level timestamp-bound image features with local facial features of temporal dynamics of micro-expressions; (2) an utterance-aware video Q-Former that captures multi-scale and contextual dependencies by generating visual token sequences for each utterance segment and for the entire video then combining them. Preliminary qualitative experiments demonstrate that in a new Explainable Multimodal Emotion Recognition (EMER) task that exploits multi-modal and multi-faceted clues to predict emotions in an open-vocabulary (OV) manner, MicroEmo demonstrates its effectiveness compared with the latest methods.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we show that certain characteristics of datasets, such as varsortability (Reisach et al. 2021) and $R^2$-sortability (Reisach et al. 2023), also occur in datasets for autocorrelated stationary time series. We illustrate this empirically using four types of data: simulated data based on SVAR models and Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graphs, the data used in the 2019 causality-for-climate challenge (Runge et al. 2019), real-world river stream datasets, and real-world data generated by the Causal Chamber of (Gamella et al. 2024). To do this, we adapt var- and $R^2$-sortability to time series data. We also investigate the extent to which the performance of score-based causal discovery methods goes hand in hand with high sortability. Arguably, our most surprising finding is that the investigated real-world datasets exhibit high varsortability and low $R^2$-sortability indicating that scales may carry a significant amount of causal information.</p></details> | <details><summary>Contr...</summary><p>Contribution for the Causal Inference for Time Series Data Workshop at the 40th Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (CI4TS 2024)</p></details> |

A benchmark and analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16445v1)** | 2024-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the field of machine learning and artificial intelligence, time series forecasting plays a pivotal role across various domains such as finance, healthcare, and weather. However, the task of selecting the most suitable forecasting method for a given dataset is a complex task due to the diversity of data patterns and characteristics. This research aims to address this challenge by proposing a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating and ranking time series forecasting methods across a wide range of datasets. This study investigates the comparative performance of many methods from two prominent time series forecasting frameworks, AutoGluon-Timeseries, and sktime to shed light on their applicability in different real-world scenarios. This research contributes to the field of time series forecasting by providing a robust benchmarking methodology and facilitating informed decision-making when choosing forecasting methods for achieving optimal prediction.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bayesian Autoregressive Online Change-Point Detection with Time-Varying Parameters](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16376v1)** | 2024-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Change points in real-world systems mark significant regime shifts in system dynamics, possibly triggered by exogenous or endogenous factors. These points define regimes for the time evolution of the system and are crucial for understanding transitions in financial, economic, social, environmental, and technological contexts. Building upon the Bayesian approach introduced in \cite{c:07}, we devise a new method for online change point detection in the mean of a univariate time series, which is well suited for real-time applications and is able to handle the general temporal patterns displayed by data in many empirical contexts. We first describe time series as an autoregressive process of an arbitrary order. Second, the variance and correlation of the data are allowed to vary within each regime driven by a scoring rule that updates the value of the parameters for a better fit of the observations. Finally, a change point is detected in a probabilistic framework via the posterior distribution of the current regime length. By modeling temporal dependencies and time-varying parameters, the proposed approach enhances both the estimate accuracy and the forecasting power. Empirical validations using various datasets demonstrate the method's effectiveness in capturing memory and dynamic patterns, offering deeper insights into the non-stationary dynamics of real-world systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>38 pa...</summary><p>38 pages, 9 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

We propose a novel method, FACTTRACK, for tracking atomic facts and addressing factual contradictions. Crucially, FACTTRACK also maintains time-aware validity intervals for each fact, allowing for change over time. At a high level, FACTTRACK consists of a four-step pipeline to update a world state data structure for each new event: (1) decompose the event into directional atomic facts; (2) determine the validity interval of each atomic fact using the world state; (3) detect contradictions with existing facts in the world state; and finally (4) add new facts to the world state and update existing atomic facts. When we apply FACTTRACK to contradiction detection on structured story outlines, we find that FACTTRACK using LLaMA2-7B-Chat substantially outperforms a fair baseline using LLaMA2-7B-Chat, and achieves performance comparable to a GPT4 baseline. Moreover, when using GPT4, FACTTRACK significantly outperforms the GPT4 baseline.</p></details> | 22 pages |

Our method relies on reversing the dynamics of the forward process and using this to learn a score function, which, via Doob's $h$-transform, gives us a bridged diffusion process; that is, a process conditioned on an endpoint. In contrast to prior methods, ours learns the score term $\nabla_x \log p(t, x; T, y)$, for given $t, Y$ directly, completely avoiding the need for first learning a time reversal. We compare the performance of our algorithm with existing methods and see that it outperforms using the (learned) time-reversals to learn the score term.

| **[Two Results on LPT: A Near-Linear Time Algorithm and Parcel Delivery using Drones](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16323v1)** | 2024-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The focus of this paper is to increase our understanding of the Longest Processing Time First (LPT) heuristic. LPT is a classical heuristic for the fundamental problem of uniform machine scheduling. For different machine speeds, LPT was first considered by Gonzalez et al (SIAM J. Computing, 1977). Since then, extensive work has been done to improve the approximation factor of the LPT heuristic. However, all known implementations of the LPT heuristic take $O(mn)$ time, where $m$ is the number of machines and $n$ is the number of jobs. In this work, we come up with the first near-linear time implementation for LPT. Specifically, the running time is $O((n+m)(\log^2{m}+\log{n}))$. Somewhat surprisingly, the result is obtained by mapping the problem to dynamic maintenance of lower envelope of lines, which has been well studied in the computational geometry community. Our second contribution is to analyze the performance of LPT for the Drones Warehouse Problem (DWP), which is a natural generalization of the uniform machine scheduling problem motivated by drone-based parcel delivery from a warehouse. In this problem, a warehouse has multiple drones and wants to deliver parcels to several customers. Each drone picks a parcel from the warehouse, delivers it, and returns to the warehouse (where it can also get charged). The speeds and battery lives of the drones could be different, and due to the limited battery life, each drone has a bounded range in which it can deliver parcels. The goal is to assign parcels to the drones so that the time taken to deliver all the parcels is minimized. We prove that the natural approach of solving this problem via the LPT heuristic has an approximation factor of $\phi$, where $\phi \approx 1.62$ is the golden ratio.</p></details> |  |

Moreover, we provide a new $\ell_{1,\infty}$ identity with mathematical proof and experimental validation.

| **[Performing global sensitivity analysis on simulations of a continuous-time Markov chain model motivated by epidemiology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.07277v4)** | 2024-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper we apply a methodology introduced in Navarro Jimenez et al (2016) in the framework of chemical reaction networks to perform a global sensitivity analysis on simulations of a continuous-time Markov chain model motivated by epidemiology. Our goal is to quantify not only the effects of uncertain parameters such as epidemic parameters (transmission rate, mean sojourn duration in compartments), but also those of intrinsic randomness and interactions between epidemic parameters and intrinsic randomness. For that purpose, following what was proposed in Navarro Jimenez et al, we leverage three exact simulation algorithms for continuous-time Markov chains from the state of the art which we combine with common tools from variance-based sensitivity analysis as introduced in Sobol (1993). Also, we discuss the impact of the choice of the simulation algorithm used for the simulations on the results of sensitivity analysis. Such a discussion is new, at least to our knowledge. In a numerical section, we implement and compare three sensitivity analyses based on simulations obtained from different exact simulation algorithms of a SARS-CoV-2 epidemic model.</p></details> |  |

As such, all the uncertainties which could appear should be considered into an extended model of the plant. After such an uncertain plant is formed, an adequate controller which ensures a minimum set of performances for each situation should be computed. As such, the continuous-time robust control paradigm is suitable for such scenarios. However, the problem is generally solved only for linear and time invariant plants.

However, this worst-case measure often yields pessimistic estimates and is challenging to infer from observations. In this paper, we advocate for the use of the average-mixing time as a more optimistic and demonstrably easier-to-estimate alternative. We further illustrate its applicability across a range of settings, from two-point to countable spaces, and discuss some practical implications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Elementary Quantum Recursion Schemes That Capture Quantum Polylogarithmic Time Computability of Quantum Functions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15884v3)** | 2024-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum computing has been studied over the past four decades based on two computational models of quantum circuits and quantum Turing machines. To capture quantum polynomial-time computability, a new recursion-theoretic approach was taken lately by Yamakami [J. Symb. Logic 80, pp.~1546--1587, 2020] by way of recursion schematic definition, which constitutes six initial quantum functions and three construction schemes of composition, branching, and multi-qubit quantum recursion. By taking a similar approach, we look into quantum polylogarithmic-time computability and further explore the expressing power of elementary schemes designed for such quantum computation. In particular, we introduce an elementary form of the quantum recursion, called the fast quantum recursion, and formulate $EQS$ (elementary quantum schemes) of ``elementary'' quantum functions. This class $EQS$ captures exactly quantum polylogarithmic-time computability, which forms the complexity class BQPOLYLOGTIME. We also demonstrate the separation of BQPOLYLOGTIME from NLOGTIME and PPOLYLOGTIME. As a natural extension of $EQS$, we further consider an algorithmic procedural scheme that implements the well-known divide-and-conquer strategy. This divide-and-conquer scheme helps compute the parity function but the scheme cannot be realized within our system $EQS$.</p></details> | <details><summary>(A4, ...</summary><p>(A4, 10pt, 29 pages) This is a corrected and expanded version of the preliminary report that has appeared, under a different title, in the Proceedings of the 28th International Conference on Logic, Language, Information, and Computation (WoLLIC 2022), Ia\c{s}i, Romania, September 20--23, 2022, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, vol. 13468, pp. 88-104, Springer, 2022</p></details> |
| **[CloudFixer: Test-Time Adaptation for 3D Point Clouds via Diffusion-Guided Geometric Transformation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16193v1)** | 2024-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D point clouds captured from real-world sensors frequently encompass noisy points due to various obstacles, such as occlusion, limited resolution, and variations in scale. These challenges hinder the deployment of pre-trained point cloud recognition models trained on clean point clouds, leading to significant performance degradation. While test-time adaptation (TTA) strategies have shown promising results on this issue in the 2D domain, their application to 3D point clouds remains under-explored. Among TTA methods, an input adaptation approach, which directly converts test instances to the source domain using a pre-trained diffusion model, has been proposed in the 2D domain. Despite its robust TTA performance in practical situations, naively adopting this into the 3D domain may be suboptimal due to the neglect of inherent properties of point clouds, and its prohibitive computational cost. Motivated by these limitations, we propose CloudFixer, a test-time input adaptation method tailored for 3D point clouds, employing a pre-trained diffusion model. Specifically, CloudFixer optimizes geometric transformation parameters with carefully designed objectives that leverage the geometric properties of point clouds. We also substantially improve computational efficiency by avoiding backpropagation through the diffusion model and a prohibitive generation process. Furthermore, we propose an online model adaptation strategy by aligning the original model prediction with that of the adapted input. Extensive experiments showcase the superiority of CloudFixer over various TTA baselines, excelling in handling common corruptions and natural distribution shifts across diverse real-world scenarios.

Instead of deploying soft sensors on the Cloud, this study shift towards employing on-device soft sensors, promising heightened efficiency and bolstering data security. Our approach substantially improves energy efficiency by deploying Artificial Intelligence (AI) directly on devices within a wireless sensor network. Furthermore, the synergistic integration of the Microcontroller Unit and Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) leverages the rapid AI inference capabilities of the latter. Empirical evidence from our real-world use case demonstrates that FPGA-based soft sensors achieve inference times ranging remarkably from 1.04 to 12.04 microseconds.

| **[Optimal camera-robot pose estimation in linear time from points and lines](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16151v1)** | 2024-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Camera pose estimation is a fundamental problem in robotics. This paper focuses on two issues of interest: First, point and line features have complementary advantages, and it is of great value to design a uniform algorithm that can fuse them effectively; Second, with the development of modern front-end techniques, a large number of features can exist in a single image, which presents a potential for highly accurate robot pose estimation. With these observations, we propose AOPnP(L), an optimal linear-time camera-robot pose estimation algorithm from points and lines. Specifically, we represent a line with two distinct points on it and unify the noise model for point and line measurements where noises are added to 2D points in the image. By utilizing Plucker coordinates for line parameterization, we formulate a maximum likelihood (ML) problem for combined point and line measurements. To optimally solve the ML problem, AOPnP(L) adopts a two-step estimation scheme. In the first step, a consistent estimate that can converge to the true pose is devised by virtue of bias elimination. In the second step, a single Gauss-Newton iteration is executed to refine the initial estimate. AOPnP(L) features theoretical optimality in the sense that its mean squared error converges to the Cramer-Rao lower bound. Moreover, it owns a linear time complexity. These properties make it well-suited for precision-demanding and real-time robot pose estimation. Extensive experiments are conducted to validate our theoretical developments and demonstrate the superiority of AOPnP(L) in both static localization and dynamic odometry systems.</p></details> |  |

However, keeping the knowledge in LLMs up-to-date remains a challenge once pretraining is complete. It is thus essential to design effective methods to both update obsolete knowledge and induce new knowledge into LLMs. Existing locate-and-edit knowledge editing (KE) method suffers from two limitations. First, the post-edit LLMs by such methods generally have poor capability in answering complex queries that require multi-hop reasoning. Second, the long run-time of such locate-and-edit methods to perform knowledge edits make it infeasible for large scale KE in practice. In this paper, we explore Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques as an alternative for KE. We curate a more comprehensive temporal KE dataset with both knowledge update and knowledge injection examples for KE performance benchmarking. We further probe the effect of fine-tuning on a range of layers in an LLM for the multi-hop QA task. We find that PEFT performs better than locate-and-edit techniques for time-sensitive knowledge edits.</p></details> | ACL 2024 main |

In contemporary research, there has been a notable upsurge in exploring feature extraction through random sampling. Unlike deep convolutional networks, these methods sidestep elaborate training procedures, yet they often necessitate generating a surplus of features to comprehensively encapsulate time series nuances. Consequently, some features may lack relevance to labels or exhibit multi-collinearity with others. In this paper, we propose a novel hierarchical feature selection method aided by ANOVA variance analysis to address this challenge. Through meticulous experimentation, we demonstrate that our method substantially reduces features by over 94% while preserving accuracy -- a significant advancement in the field of time series analysis and feature selection.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 5 figures, IEEE Machine Learning and Signal processing 2024</p></details> |

Unlike existing techniques for network utility maximization, which only consider first-order statistics, this framework models every random process by its mean and temporal variance. The inclusion of temporal variance makes this framework well-suited for modeling Markovian fading wireless channels and emerging network performance metrics such as age-of-information (AoI) and timely-throughput. Using this framework, we sharply characterize the second-order capacity region of wireless access networks. We also propose a simple scheduling policy and prove that it can achieve every interior point in the second-order capacity region. To demonstrate the utility of this framework, we apply it to an unsolved network optimization problem where some clients wish to minimize AoI while others wish to maximize timely-throughput. We show that this framework accurately characterizes AoI and timely-throughput. Moreover, it leads to a tractable scheduling policy that outperforms other existing work.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2201.06486</p></details> |

This paper introduces Test-Time Low-rank adaptation (TTL) as an alternative to prompt tuning for zero-shot generalization of large-scale VLMs. Taking inspiration from recent advancements in efficiently fine-tuning large language models, TTL offers a test-time parameter-efficient adaptation approach that updates the attention weights of the transformer encoder by maximizing prediction confidence. The self-supervised confidence maximization objective is specified using a weighted entropy loss that enforces consistency among predictions of augmented samples. TTL introduces only a small amount of trainable parameters for low-rank adapters in the model space while keeping the prompts and backbone frozen. Extensive experiments on a variety of natural distribution and cross-domain tasks show that TTL can outperform other techniques for test-time optimization of VLMs in strict zero-shot settings. Specifically, TTL outperforms test-time prompt tuning baselines with a significant improvement on average.

While their superior performance offers considerable benefits, their inherent complexity often decreases human trust, which slows their application in high-risk decision-making domains, such as finance. The field of eXplainable AI (XAI) seeks to bridge this gap, aiming to make AI models more understandable. This survey, focusing on published work from the past five years, categorizes XAI approaches that predict financial time series. In this paper, explainability and interpretability are distinguished, emphasizing the need to treat these concepts separately as they are not applied the same way in practice. Through clear definitions, a rigorous taxonomy of XAI approaches, a complementary characterization, and examples of XAI's application in the finance industry, this paper provides a comprehensive view of XAI's current role in finance. It can also serve as a guide for selecting the most appropriate XAI approach for future applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>35 pa...</summary><p>35 pages, This is the author's version of the work.

Existing TTA methods often focus on improving recognition performance specifically for test data associated with classes in the training set. However, during the open-world inference process, there are inevitably test data instances from unknown classes, commonly referred to as outliers. This paper pays attention to the problem that conducts both sample recognition and outlier rejection during inference while outliers exist. To address this problem, we propose a new approach called STAble Memory rePlay (STAMP), which performs optimization over a stable memory bank instead of the risky mini-batch. In particular, the memory bank is dynamically updated by selecting low-entropy and label-consistent samples in a class-balanced manner. In addition, we develop a self-weighted entropy minimization strategy that assigns higher weight to low-entropy samples. Extensive results demonstrate that STAMP outperforms existing TTA methods in terms of both recognition and outlier detection performance.

Specifically, we identify conditions sufficient for ETDRK schemes to maintain the original energy dissipation. Our analysis reveals that commonly used third-order and fourth-order ETDRK schemes fail to meet these conditions. To address this, we introduce new third-order ETDRK schemes, designed with appropriate stabilization, which satisfy these conditions and thus guarantee the unconditional energy decaying property. We conduct extensive numerical experiments with these new schemes to verify their accuracy, stability, behavior under large time steps, long-term evolution, and adaptive time stepping strategy across various gradient flows. This study is the first to examine the unconditional energy stability of high-order ETDRK methods, and we are optimistic that our framework will enable the development of ETDRK schemes beyond the third order that are unconditionally energy stable.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we examine whether such agents can perform realistic and time-consuming tasks on the web, e.g., monitoring real-estate markets or locating relevant nearby businesses. We introduce AssistantBench, a challenging new benchmark consisting of 214 realistic tasks that can be automatically evaluated, covering different scenarios and domains. We find that AssistantBench exposes the limitations of current systems, including language models and retrieval-augmented language models, as no model reaches an accuracy of more than 25 points. While closed-book LMs perform well, they exhibit low precision since they tend to hallucinate facts. State-of-the-art web agents reach a score of near zero. Additionally, we introduce SeePlanAct (SPA), a new web agent that significantly outperforms previous agents, and an ensemble of SPA and closed-book models reaches the best overall performance. Moreover, we analyze failures of current systems and highlight that web navigation remains a major challenge.</p></details> |  |
| **[Energy-consistent Petrov-Galerkin time discretization of port-Hamiltonian systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12480v2)** | 2024-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For a general class of nonlinear port-Hamiltonian systems we develop a high-order time discretization scheme with certain structure preservation properties. The finite or infinite-dimensional system under consideration possesses a Hamiltonian function, which represents an energy in the system and is conserved or dissipated along solutions. For infinite-dimensional systems this structure is preserved under suitable Galerkin discretization in space. The numerical scheme is energy-consistent in the sense that the Hamiltonian of the approximate solutions at time grid points behaves accordingly. This structure preservation property is achieved by specific design of a continuous Petrov-Galerkin (cPG) method in time. It coincides with standard cPG methods in special cases, in which the latter are energy-consistent. Examples of port-Hamiltonian ODEs and PDEs are presented to visualize the framework. In numerical experiments the energy consistency is verified and the convergence behavior is investigated.</p></details> | 29 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Time-Domain Channel Measurements and Small-Scale Fading Characterization for RIS-Assisted Wireless Communication Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15776v2)** | 2024-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) have attracted extensive attention from industry and academia. In RIS-assisted wireless communication systems, practical channel measurements and modeling serve as the foundation for system design, network optimization, and performance evaluation. In this paper, a RIS time-domain channel measurement system, based on a software defined radio platform, is developed for the first time to investigate the small-scale fading characteristics of RIS-assisted channels. We present RIS channel measurements in corridor and laboratory scenarios and compare the power delay profile of the channel without RIS, with RIS specular reflection, and with RIS intelligent reflection. The multipath component parameters and cluster parameters based on the Saleh-Valenzuela model are extracted. We find that the power delay profiles (PDPs) of the RIS-assisted channel fit the power-law decay model better than the common exponential decay model and approximate the law of square decay. Through intelligent reflection, the RIS can decrease the delay and concentrate the energy of the virtual line-of-sight (VLoS) path, thereby reducing the delay spread and mitigating multipath fading. Furthermore, the cluster characteristics of RIS-assisted channels are highly dependent on the measurement environment. In the laboratory scenario, a single cluster dominated by the VLoS path with smooth envelope is observed. On the other hand, in the corridor scenario, some additional clusters introduced by the RIS reflection are created.</p></details> |  |

Unlike existing end-to-end deep learning models, our proposed method explicitly models BWE using excitation and linear time-varying (LTV) filter stages. The excitation stage broadens the spectrum of the input, while the filtering stage properly shapes it based on outputs from an acoustic feature predictor. To this end, an acoustic feature loss term can implicitly promote the excitation subnetwork to produce white spectra in the upper frequency band to be synthesized. Experimental results demonstrate that the added inductive bias provided by our approach can improve upon BWE results using the generators from both SEANet or HiFi-GAN as exciters, and that our means of adapting processing with acoustic feature predictions is more effective than that used in HiFi-GAN-2. Secondary contributions include extensions of the SEANet model to accommodate local conditioning information, as well as the application of HiFi-GAN-2 for the BWE problem.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 3 figures.

| **[Dual Test-time Training for Out-of-distribution Recommender System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15620v1)** | 2024-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning has been widely applied in recommender systems, which has achieved revolutionary progress recently. However, most existing learning-based methods assume that the user and item distributions remain unchanged between the training phase and the test phase. However, the distribution of user and item features can naturally shift in real-world scenarios, potentially resulting in a substantial decrease in recommendation performance. This phenomenon can be formulated as an Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) recommendation problem. To address this challenge, we propose a novel Dual Test-Time-Training framework for OOD Recommendation, termed DT3OR. In DT3OR, we incorporate a model adaptation mechanism during the test-time phase to carefully update the recommendation model, allowing the model to specially adapt to the shifting user and item features. To be specific, we propose a self-distillation task and a contrastive task to assist the model learning both the user's invariant interest preferences and the variant user/item characteristics during the test-time phase, thus facilitating a smooth adaptation to the shifting features. Furthermore, we provide theoretical analysis to support the rationale behind our dual test-time training framework. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first work to address OOD recommendation via a test-time-training strategy. We conduct experiments on three datasets with various backbones. Comprehensive experimental results have demonstrated the effectiveness of DT3OR compared to other state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Estimation and variable selection in a joint model of survival times and longitudinal outcomes with random effects](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16765v2)** | 2024-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper considers a joint survival and mixed-effects model to explain the survival time from longitudinal data and high-dimensional covariates. The longitudinal data is modeled using a nonlinear effects model, where the regression function serves as a link function incorporated into a Cox model as a covariate. In that way, the longitudinal data is related to the survival time at a given time. Additionally, the Cox model takes into account the inclusion of high-dimensional covariates. The main objectives of this research are two-fold: first, to identify the relevant covariates that contribute to explaining survival time, and second, to estimate all unknown parameters of the joint model. For that purpose, we consider the maximization of a Lasso penalized likelihood. To tackle the optimization problem, we implement a pre-conditioned stochastic gradient to handle the latent variables of the nonlinear mixed-effects model associated with a proximal operator to manage the non-differentiability of the penalty. We provide relevant simulations that showcase the performance of the proposed variable selection and parameters' estimation method in the joint modeling of a Cox and logistic model.</p></details> |  |

Whereas traditional Markowitz-based mean-variance portfolios are widespread, network-based optimisation techniques have built upon these developments. However, most studies do not contain firms at risk of default and remove any firms that drop off indices over a certain time. This is the first study to incorporate risky firms and use all the firms in portfolio optimisation. We propose and empirically test a novel method that leverages Graph Attention networks (GATs), a subclass of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). GNNs, as deep learning-based models, can exploit network data to uncover nonlinear relationships. Their ability to handle high-dimensional features and accommodate customised layers for specific purposes makes them particularly appealing for large-scale problems such as mid- and small-cap portfolio optimization. This study utilises 30 years of data on mid-cap firms, creating graphs of firms using distance correlation and the Triangulated Maximally Filtered Graph approach. These graphs are the inputs to a GAT model that we train using custom layers which impose weight and allocation constraints and a loss function derived from the Sharpe ratio, thus directly maximising portfolio risk-adjusted returns. This new model is benchmarked against a network characteristic-based portfolio, a mean variance-based portfolio, and an equal-weighted portfolio. The results show that the portfolio produced by the GAT-based model outperforms all benchmarks and is consistently superior to other strategies over a long period while also being informative of market dynamics.</p></details> | <details><summary>37 pa...</summary><p>37 pages, 7 figures, v1</p></details> |

Among these, SegRNN, a robust RNN-driven model, has gained considerable attention in LTSF analysis for achieving state-of-the-art results while maintaining a remarkably streamlined architecture. Concurrently, the Mamba structure has demonstrated its advantages in small to medium-sized models due to its capability for information selection. This study introduces a variant of SegRNN that preprocesses information using a fine-tuned single-layer Mamba structure. Additionally, it incorporates implicit segmentation and residual structures into the model's encoding section to further reduce the inherent data iterative cycles of RNN architectures and implicitly integrate inter-channel correlations. This variant, named MSegRNN, utilizes the Mamba structure to select useful information, resulting in a transformed sequence. The linear-strategy-adapted derivative retains the superior memory efficiency of the original SegRNN while demonstrating enhanced performance. Empirical evaluations on real-world LTSF datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our model, thereby contributing to the advancement of LTSF methodologies.</p></details> |  |
| **[SpotDiffusion: A Fast Approach For Seamless Panorama Generation Over Time](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15507v1)** | 2024-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating high-resolution images with generative models has recently been made widely accessible by leveraging diffusion models pre-trained on large-scale datasets. Various techniques, such as MultiDiffusion and SyncDiffusion, have further pushed image generation beyond training resolutions, i.e., from square images to panorama, by merging multiple overlapping diffusion paths or employing gradient descent to maintain perceptual coherence. However, these methods suffer from significant computational inefficiencies due to generating and averaging numerous predictions, which is required in practice to produce high-quality and seamless images. This work addresses this limitation and presents a novel approach that eliminates the need to generate and average numerous overlapping denoising predictions. Our method shifts non-overlapping denoising windows over time, ensuring that seams in one timestep are corrected in the next. This results in coherent, high-resolution images with fewer overall steps. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through qualitative and quantitative evaluations, comparing it with MultiDiffusion, SyncDiffusion, and StitchDiffusion. Our method offers several key benefits, including improved computational efficiency and faster inference times while producing comparable or better image quality.</p></details> |  |

Green hydrogen production via electrolysis offers a viable solution for converting and storing this volatile renewable energy. However, the inherent fluctuations of renewable energy sources present challenges for consistent utilization and integration of green hydrogen. This work proposes a two-stage optimization approach, combining site-wide optimization and real-time optimization for managing systems of electrolyzers. By adapting an existing static optimization model, dual use is achieved in both site-wide optimization and real-time optimization. The hierarchical optimization structure, characterized by distinct temporal resolutions, enables effective responses to both dynamic changes and long-term trends. The side-wide optimization layer generates long-term plans based on forecast data, while the real-time optimization layer refines these plans in real-time, accommodating immediate fluctuations and ensuring efficient operation. The results from the case study on a system of electrolyzers demonstrate the method's effectiveness in aligning electrolyzer operation with actual availability of renewable energy. This approach offers a robust framework for optimizing the operation of electrolyzers but also other types of flexible energy resources, contributing to sustainable and economically viable energy management.</p></details> | Updated version |

Domain generalization (DG) or domain adaptation (DA) techniques are therefore adopted in the offline training stage to adapt the model to the unobserved or observed test domain by referring to all the available source domain data. However, in rPPG estimation problems, the adapted model usually confronts challenges of estimating target data with various domain information, such as different video capturing settings, individuals of different age ranges, or of different HR distributions. In contrast, Test-Time Adaptation (TTA), by online adapting to unlabeled target data without referring to any source data, enables the model to adaptively estimate rPPG signals of various unseen domains. In this paper, we first propose a novel TTA-rPPG benchmark, which encompasses various domain information and HR distributions, to simulate the challenges encountered in rPPG estimation. Next, we propose a novel synthetic signal-guided rPPG estimation framework with a two-fold purpose. First, we design an effective spectral-based entropy minimization to enforce the rPPG model to learn new target domain information. Second, we develop a synthetic signal-guided feature learning, by synthesizing pseudo rPPG signals as pseudo ground-truths to guide a conditional generator to generate latent rPPG features. The synthesized rPPG signals and the generated rPPG features are used to guide the rPPG model to broadly cover various HR distributions. Our extensive experiments on the TTA-rPPG benchmark show that the proposed method achieves superior performance and outperforms previous DG and DA methods across most protocols of the proposed TTA-rPPG benchmark.</p></details> |  |
| **[Constrained Online Recursive Source Separation Framework for Real-time Electrophysiological Signal Processing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05655v2)** | 2024-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Electrophysiological signal processing often requires blind source separation (BSS) techniques due to the nature of mixing source signals. However, its complex computational demands make real-time applicability challenging. In this study, we propose a Constrained Online Recursive Source Separation (CORSS) framework for real time electrophysiological signals processing. With a stepwise recursive unmixing matrix learning rule, the algorithm achieves real-time updates with minimal computational overhead. By incorporating prior information of target signals to optimize the cost function, the algorithm converges more readily to ideal sources, yielding more accurate results. Two downstream tasks, real-time surface electromyogram (sEMG) decomposition and real-time respiratory intent monitoring based on diaphragmatic electromyogram (sEMGdi) extraction, were employed to assess the efficacy of our method. The results demonstrated superior performance compared to alternative methods, achieving a matching rate of 96.00% for the sEMG decomposition task and 98.12% for the sEMGdi extraction task. Moreover, compared to Online PFP, our method exhibits minimal time delay during computation, reflecting its streamlined processing and excellent real-time capabilities. Our approach demonstrates strong performance across various real-time processing tasks of electrophysiological signals, highlighting its significance for applications in real-time human-computer interaction and clinical monitoring.</p></details> |  |

Considering non-linear engagement kinematics and a system lag to capture the effect of interceptor autopilot as present in realistic interception scenarios, the guidance schemes use the time-to-go estimates of the interceptors in order to achieve simultaneous interception of a stationary target at a pre-determined impact time. The guidance scheme ensures that consensus among the time-to-go estimates of the interceptors is achieved within a settling time whose upper bound can be pre-specified arbitrarily independent of the initial conditions or design parameters. The efficacy of the proposed guidance strategy is demonstrated using numerical simulations with varied conditions of initial position, velocities and heading angle errors of the interceptors as well as different desired impact times.</p></details> |  |

| **[Pandora's Box Problem Over Time](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15261v1)** | 2024-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Pandora's Box problem models the search for the best alternative when evaluation is costly. In its simplest variant, a decision maker is presented with $n$ boxes, each associated with a cost of inspection and a distribution over the reward hidden within. The decision maker inspects a subset of these boxes one after the other, in a possibly adaptive ordering, and obtains as utility the difference between the largest reward uncovered and the sum of the inspection costs. While this classic version of the problem is well understood (Weitzman 1979), recent years have seen a flourishing of the literature on variants of the problem. In this paper, we introduce a general framework -- the Pandora's Box Over Time problem -- that captures a wide range of variants where time plays a role, e.g., as it might constrain the schedules of exploration and influence both costs and rewards. In the Pandora's Box Over Time problem, each box is characterized by time-dependent rewards and costs, and inspecting it might require a box-specific processing time. Moreover, once a box is inspected, its reward may deteriorate over time, possibly differently for each box. Our main result is an efficient $21.3$-approximation to the optimal strategy, which is NP-hard to compute in general. We further obtain improved results for the natural special cases where boxes have no processing time, or when costs and reward distributions do not depend on time (but rewards may deteriorate after inspecting).</p></details> |  |

Wherever static or mobile robots, such as automated guided vehicles, operate autonomously, a protected environment for personnel and machines must be provided by, e.g., safe, deterministic and low-latency technologies. Another trend in this area is the increased use of wireless communication, offering a high flexibility, modularity, and reduced installation and maintenance efforts. This work presents a testbed implementation that integrates a wireless framework, employing IO-Link Wireless (IOLW) and a private 5G cellular network, to orchestrate a complete example process from sensors and actuators up into the edge, represented by a programmable logic controller (PLC). Latency assessments identify the systems cycle time as well as opportunities for improvement.

Adversarial Data Augmentation (ADA) is a commonly used approach that enhances model adaptability by incorporating synthetic samples, designed to simulate potential unseen samples. While ADA effectively addresses amplitude-related distribution shifts, it falls short in managing temporal shifts, which are essential for time series data. To address this limitation, we propose the Temporal Adversarial Data Augmentation for time teries Data (TADA), which incorporates a time warping technique specifically targeting temporal shifts. Recognizing the challenge of non-differentiability in traditional time warping, we make it differentiable by leveraging phase shifts in the frequency domain. Our evaluations across diverse domains demonstrate that TADA significantly outperforms existing ADA variants, enhancing model performance across time series datasets with varied distributions.</p></details> |  |

Previous efforts focusing on generative modeling have fallen short of precisely capturing the multi-modal, high-dimensional grasp distribution. To address this, we propose exploiting a special kind of Deep Generative Model (DGM) based on Normalizing Flows (NFs), an expressive model for learning complex probability distributions. Specifically, we first observed an encouraging improvement in diversity by directly applying a single conditional NFs (cNFs), dubbed FFHFlow-cnf, to learn a grasp distribution conditioned on the incomplete point cloud. However, we also recognized limited performance gains due to restricted expressivity in the latent space. This motivated us to develop a novel flow-based d Deep Latent Variable Model (DLVM), namely FFHFlow-lvm, which facilitates more reasonable latent features, leading to both diverse and accurate grasp synthesis for unseen objects. Unlike Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), the proposed DLVM counteracts typical pitfalls such as mode collapse and mis-specified priors by leveraging two cNFs for the prior and likelihood distributions, which are usually restricted to being isotropic Gaussian. Comprehensive experiments in simulation and real-robot scenarios demonstrate that our method generates more accurate and diverse grasps than the VAE baselines. Additionally, a run-time comparison is conducted to reveal its high potential for real-time applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>First...</summary><p>First two authors contributed equally, whose ordering decided via coin-tossing</p></details> |

The emergence of LTSF-Linear, with its straightforward linear architecture, has notably outperformed transformer-based counterparts, prompting a reevaluation of the transformer's utility in time series forecasting. In response, this paper presents an adaptation of a recent architecture termed extended LSTM (xLSTM) for LTSF. xLSTM incorporates exponential gating and a revised memory structure with higher capacity that has good potential for LTSF. Our adopted architecture for LTSF termed as xLSTMTime surpasses current approaches. We compare xLSTMTime's performance against various state-of-the-art models across multiple real-world da-tasets, demonstrating superior forecasting capabilities. Our findings suggest that refined recurrent architectures can offer competitive alternatives to transformer-based models in LTSF tasks, po-tentially redefining the landscape of time series forecasting.</p></details> |  |

This paper proposes GLOP (Global and Local Optimization Policies), a unified hierarchical framework that efficiently scales toward large-scale routing problems. GLOP partitions large routing problems into Travelling Salesman Problems (TSPs) and TSPs into Shortest Hamiltonian Path Problems. For the first time, we hybridize non-autoregressive neural heuristics for coarse-grained problem partitions and autoregressive neural heuristics for fine-grained route constructions, leveraging the scalability of the former and the meticulousness of the latter. Experimental results show that GLOP achieves competitive and state-of-the-art real-time performance on large-scale routing problems, including TSP, ATSP, CVRP, and PCTSP.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at AAAI 2024</p></details> |

| **[Real-Time 3D Occupancy Prediction via Geometric-Semantic Disentanglement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13155v2)** | 2024-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Occupancy prediction plays a pivotal role in autonomous driving (AD) due to the fine-grained geometric perception and general object recognition capabilities. However, existing methods often incur high computational costs, which contradicts the real-time demands of AD. To this end, we first evaluate the speed and memory usage of most public available methods, aiming to redirect the focus from solely prioritizing accuracy to also considering efficiency. We then identify a core challenge in achieving both fast and accurate performance: \textbf{the strong coupling between geometry and semantic}. To address this issue, 1) we propose a Geometric-Semantic Dual-Branch Network (GSDBN) with a hybrid BEV-Voxel representation. In the BEV branch, a BEV-level temporal fusion module and a U-Net encoder is introduced to extract dense semantic features. In the voxel branch, a large-kernel re-parameterized 3D convolution is proposed to refine sparse 3D geometry and reduce computation. Moreover, we propose a novel BEV-Voxel lifting module that projects BEV features into voxel space for feature fusion of the two branches. In addition to the network design, 2) we also propose a Geometric-Semantic Decoupled Learning (GSDL) strategy. This strategy initially learns semantics with accurate geometry using ground-truth depth, and then gradually mixes predicted depth to adapt the model to the predicted geometry. Extensive experiments on the widely-used Occ3D-nuScenes benchmark demonstrate the superiority of our method, which achieves a 39.4 mIoU with 20.0 FPS. This result is $\sim 3 \times$ faster and +1.9 mIoU higher compared to FB-OCC, the winner of CVPR2023 3D Occupancy Prediction Challenge. Our code will be made open-source.</p></details> |  |

The outaged lines form a pattern in the transmission network. We extract these patterns from utility outage data, determine some key statistics of these patterns, and then show how to generate new patterns consistent with these statistics. The generated patterns provide a new and easily feasible way to model the overall effect of the protection system at the scale of a large transmission system. This new generative modeling of protection is expected to contribute to simulations of disturbances in large grids so that they can better quantify the risk of blackouts. Analysis of the pattern sizes suggests an index that describes how much outages spread in the transmission network at the fast timescale.</p></details> |  |

Therefore, automobile fault diagnosis and early warning technologies have become urgent problems in the current academic world. The premise of real-time accurate diagnosis and early warning of automobiles is to obtain high-quality information data in real time, but the automobile operating environment is complex and changeable, resulting in the measured information data under the influence of multiple factors, such as equipment performance and signal interference. There is an unpredictable measurement error, which greatly affects the reliability of fault diagnosis and early warning systems. In this paper, on the basis of studying the structure and operation characteristics of automobiles, we design a method that can be used for real-time diagnosis and early warning of automobile faults; through the study of fractional-order calculus theory, we establish a mathematical model of information data fusion based on fractional-order differential operators. By providing high-quality information data to automobile fault diagnosis and early warning systems, real-time and accurate diagnosis and early warning functions for automobile faults can be realized. The feasibility and effectiveness of the method were verified through an experiment applying the technology in automobile fault diagnosis and early warning. The research results are of great significance for promoting the development of the automobile industry and ensuring the safety of drivers' lives and property.</p></details> |  |

In time-critical systems, it is essential to verify the timing predictability of the system, and the application of scheduling mechanisms in TSN can also bring about changes in system timing. Therefore, schedulability analysis techniques can be used to verify that the system is scheduled according to the scheduling mechanism and meets the timing requirements. In this paper, we provide a clear overview of the state-of-the-art works on the topic of schedulability analysis in TSN in an attempt to clarify the purpose of schedulability analysis, categorize the methods of schedulability analysis and compare their respective strengths and weaknesses, point out the scheduling mechanisms under analyzing and the corresponding traffic classes, clarify the network scenarios constructed during the evaluation and list the challenges and directions still needing to be worked on in schedulability analysis in TSN. To this end, we conducted a systematic literature review and finally identified 123 relevant research papers published in major conferences and journals in the past 15 years. Based on a comprehensive review of the relevant literature, we have identified several key findings and emphasized the future challenges in schedulability analysis for TSN.</p></details> |  |

| **[FMamba: Mamba based on Fast-attention for Multivariate Time-series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14814v1)** | 2024-07-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In multivariate time-series forecasting (MTSF), extracting the temporal correlations of the input sequences is crucial. While popular Transformer-based predictive models can perform well, their quadratic computational complexity results in inefficiency and high overhead. The recently emerged Mamba, a selective state space model, has shown promising results in many fields due to its strong temporal feature extraction capabilities and linear computational complexity. However, due to the unilateral nature of Mamba, channel-independent predictive models based on Mamba cannot attend to the relationships among all variables in the manner of Transformer-based models. To address this issue, we combine fast-attention with Mamba to introduce a novel framework named FMamba for MTSF. Technically, we first extract the temporal features of the input variables through an embedding layer, then compute the dependencies among input variables via the fast-attention module. Subsequently, we use Mamba to selectively deal with the input features and further extract the temporal dependencies of the variables through the multi-layer perceptron block (MLP-block). Finally, FMamba obtains the predictive results through the projector, a linear layer. Experimental results on eight public datasets demonstrate that FMamba can achieve state-of-the-art performance while maintaining low computational overhead.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bernstein-von Mises theorems for time evolution equations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14781v1)** | 2024-07-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider a class of infinite-dimensional dynamical systems driven by non-linear parabolic partial differential equations with initial condition $\theta$ modelled by a Gaussian process `prior' probability measure. Given discrete samples of the state of the system evolving in space-time, one obtains updated `posterior' measures on a function space containing all possible trajectories. We give a general set of conditions under which these non-Gaussian posterior distributions are approximated, in Wasserstein distance for the supremum-norm metric, by the law of a Gaussian random function. We demonstrate the applicability of our results to periodic non-linear reaction diffusion equations \begin{align*} \frac{\partial}{\partial t} u - \Delta u &= f(u) \\ u(0) &= \theta \end{align*} where $f$ is any smooth and compactly supported reaction function. In this case the limiting Gaussian measure can be characterised as the solution of a time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation with `rough' Gaussian initial conditions whose covariance operator we describe.</p></details> | 52 pages |

However, existing CTDG models encounter challenges stemming from noise and limited historical data. Graph Data Augmentation (GDA) emerges as a critical solution, yet current approaches primarily focus on static graphs and struggle to effectively address the dynamics inherent in CTDGs. Moreover, these methods often demand substantial domain expertise for parameter tuning and lack theoretical guarantees for augmentation efficacy. To address these issues, we propose Conda, a novel latent diffusion-based GDA method tailored for CTDGs. Conda features a sandwich-like architecture, incorporating a Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE) and a conditional diffusion model, aimed at generating enhanced historical neighbor embeddings for target nodes. Unlike conventional diffusion models trained on entire graphs via pre-training, Conda requires historical neighbor sequence embeddings of target nodes for training, thus facilitating more targeted augmentation. We integrate Conda into the CTDG model and adopt an alternating training strategy to optimize performance. Extensive experimentation across six widely used real-world datasets showcases the consistent performance improvement of our approach, particularly in scenarios with limited historical data.</p></details> | Accepted by KDD 2024 |
| **[Modeling Time-Varying Random Objects and Dynamic Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.04628v2)** | 2024-07-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Samples of dynamic or time-varying networks and other random object data such as time-varying probability distributions are increasingly encountered in modern data analysis. Common methods for time-varying data such as functional data analysis are infeasible when observations are time courses of networks or other complex non-Euclidean random objects that are elements of general metric spaces. In such spaces, only pairwise distances between the data objects are available and a strong limitation is that one cannot carry out arithmetic operations due to the lack of an algebraic structure. We combat this complexity by a generalized notion of mean trajectory taking values in the object space. For this, we adopt pointwise Fr\'echet means and then construct pointwise distance trajectories between the individual time courses and the estimated Fr\'echet mean trajectory, thus representing the time-varying objects and networks by functional data. Functional principal component analysis of these distance trajectories can reveal interesting features of dynamic networks and object time courses and is useful for downstream analysis. Our approach also makes it possible to study the empirical dynamics of time-varying objects, including dynamic regression to the mean or explosive behavior over time. We demonstrate desirable asymptotic properties of sample based estimators for suitable population targets under mild assumptions. The utility of the proposed methodology is illustrated with dynamic networks, time-varying distribution data and longitudinal growth data.</p></details> |  |

However, we have observed the phenomenon of inter-class similarity and intra-class inconsistency in the datasets from the UCR archive and further analyzed how this phenomenon adversely affects the "FC+SoftMax" paradigm. To address the issue, we introduce ECR, which, for the first time to our knowledge, applies deep learning-based retrieval algorithm to the TSC problem and integrates classification and retrieval models. Experimental results on 112 UCR datasets demonstrate that ECR is state-of-the-art(sota) compared to existing deep learning-based methods. Furthermore, we have developed a more precise classifier, ECRTime, which is an ensemble of ECR. ECRTime surpasses the currently most accurate deep learning classifier, InceptionTime, in terms of accuracy, achieving this with reduced training time and comparable scalability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Identifying Causal Effects using Instrumental Time Series: Nuisance IV and Correcting for the Past](http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.06056v3)** | 2024-07-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Instrumental variable (IV) regression relies on instruments to infer causal effects from observational data with unobserved confounding. We consider IV regression in time series models, such as vector auto-regressive (VAR) processes. Direct applications of i.i.d. techniques are generally inconsistent as they do not correctly adjust for dependencies in the past. In this paper, we outline the difficulties that arise due to time structure and propose methodology for constructing identifying equations that can be used for consistent parametric estimation of causal effects in time series data. One method uses extra nuisance covariates to obtain identifiability (an idea that can be of interest even in the i.i.d. case). We further propose a graph marginalization framework that allows us to apply nuisance IV and other IV methods in a principled way to time series. Our methods make use of a version of the global Markov property, which we prove holds for VAR(p) processes. For VAR(1) processes, we prove identifiability conditions that relate to Jordan forms and are different from the well-known rank conditions in the i.i.d. case (they do not require as many instruments as covariates, for example). We provide methods, prove their consistency, and show how the inferred causal effect can be used for distribution generalization. Simulation experiments corroborate our theoretical results. We provide ready-to-use Python code.</p></details> |  |

However, existing countermeasures still serve a classification purpose and fail to perform meaningful analysis of the start and end timestamps of partial forgery segments. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel coarse-to-fine proposal refinement framework (CFPRF) that incorporates a frame-level detection network (FDN) and a proposal refinement network (PRN) for audio temporal forgery detection and localization. Specifically, the FDN aims to mine informative inconsistency cues between real and fake frames to obtain discriminative features that are beneficial for roughly indicating forgery regions. The PRN is responsible for predicting confidence scores and regression offsets to refine the coarse-grained proposals derived from the FDN. To learn robust discriminative features, we devise a difference-aware feature learning (DAFL) module guided by contrastive representation learning to enlarge the sensitive differences between different frames induced by minor manipulations. We further design a boundary-aware feature enhancement (BAFE) module to capture the contextual information of multiple transition boundaries and guide the interaction between boundary information and temporal features via a cross-attention mechanism. Extensive experiments show that our CFPRF achieves state-of-the-art performance on various datasets, including LAV-DF, ASVS2019PS, and HAD.</p></details> | <details><summary>9page...</summary><p>9pages, 3figures.

Current state-of-the-art methods either require multiple independent stages of processing that employ motion cues or, in the case of end-to-end trainable networks, lack in segmentation accuracy, in part due to the difficulty of learning segmentation maps from videos with transient object presence. This limits the application of WSVOS for semantic annotation of surgical videos where multiple surgical tools frequently move in and out of the field of view, a problem that is more difficult than typically encountered in WSVOS. This paper introduces Video Spatio-Temporal Disentanglement Networks (VDST-Net), a framework to disentangle spatiotemporal information using semi-decoupled knowledge distillation to predict high-quality class activation maps (CAMs). A teacher network designed to resolve temporal conflicts when specifics about object location and timing in the video are not provided works with a student network that integrates information over time by leveraging temporal dependencies. We demonstrate the efficacy of our framework on a public reference dataset and on a more challenging surgical video dataset where objects are, on average, present in less than 60\% of annotated frames. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques and generates superior segmentation masks under video-level weak supervision.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 6 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |

We consider two variants depending on whether an edge is blocked. In the locally-informed variant, the traveller learns if an edge is blocked upon reaching one of its endpoints, while in the uninformed variant, they discover this only when the edge is supposed to appear. We provide a polynomial algorithm for each shortest path variant in the uninformed case. This algorithm also solves the case of directed acyclic non-temporal graphs. In the locally-informed case, we prove that finding a winning strategy is PSPACE-complete. Moreover, we establish that the problem is polynomial-time solvable when $k=1$ but NP-hard for $k\geq 2$. Additionally, we show that the standard (non-temporal) Canadian Traveller Problem is NP-hard when there are $k\geq 4$ blocked edges, which is, to the best of our knowledge, the first hardness result for CTP for a constant number of blocked edges.</p></details> |  |

How do these digital traces change in response to events happening in the real world? We leverage Reddit conversation data, exploiting its community-based structure, to elucidate how offline events influence online user interactions and behavior. Online conversations, as posts and comments, are analysed along their temporal and semantic dimensions. Conversations tend to become repetitive with a more limited vocabulary, develop at a faster pace and feature heightened emotions. As the event approaches, the shifts occurring in conversations are reflected in the users' dynamics. Users become more active and they exchange information with a growing audience, despite using a less rich vocabulary and repetitive messages. The recurring patterns we discovered are persistent across a wide range of events and several contexts, representing a fingerprint of how online dynamics change in response to real-world occurrences.</p></details> |  |
| **[SOAP: Enhancing Spatio-Temporal Relation and Motion Information Capturing for Few-Shot Action Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16344v1)** | 2024-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High frame-rate (HFR) videos of action recognition improve fine-grained expression while reducing the spatio-temporal relation and motion information density. Thus, large amounts of video samples are continuously required for traditional data-driven training. However, samples are not always sufficient in real-world scenarios, promoting few-shot action recognition (FSAR) research. We observe that most recent FSAR works build spatio-temporal relation of video samples via temporal alignment after spatial feature extraction, cutting apart spatial and temporal features within samples. They also capture motion information via narrow perspectives between adjacent frames without considering density, leading to insufficient motion information capturing. Therefore, we propose a novel plug-and-play architecture for FSAR called Spatio-tempOral frAme tuPle enhancer (SOAP) in this paper. The model we designed with such architecture refers to SOAP-Net. Temporal connections between different feature channels and spatio-temporal relation of features are considered instead of simple feature extraction. Comprehensive motion information is also captured, using frame tuples with multiple frames containing more motion information than adjacent frames. Combining frame tuples of diverse frame counts further provides a broader perspective. SOAP-Net achieves new state-of-the-art performance across well-known benchmarks such as SthSthV2, Kinetics, UCF101, and HMDB51. Extensive empirical evaluations underscore the competitiveness, pluggability, generalization, and robustness of SOAP.

Most of the T2V frameworks usually inherit from the T2I model and add extra-temporal layers of training to generate dynamic videos, which can be viewed as a fine-tuning task. However, the traditional 3D-Unet is a serial mode and the temporal layers follow the spatial layers, which will result in high GPU memory and training time consumption according to its serial feature flow. We believe that this serial mode will bring more training costs with the large diffusion model and massive datasets, which are not environmentally friendly and not suitable for the development of the T2V. Therefore, we propose a highly efficient spatial-temporal parallel training paradigm for T2V tasks, named Mobius. In our 3D-Unet, the temporal layers and spatial layers are parallel, which optimizes the feature flow and backpropagation. The Mobius will save 24% GPU memory and 12% training time, which can greatly improve the T2V fine-tuning task and provide a novel insight for the AIGC community. We will release our codes in the future.</p></details> |  |

The knowledge tree enables the visualization of hierarchical interrelation within the STKG, while the knowledge net elucidates semantic relationships among knowledge entities. Additionally, the knowledge map displays spatial and temporal distributions via spatial maps and time axes, respectively. Our visualization technology addresses the limitations inherent in single-view approaches and the deficiency of interaction in spatio-temporal perspectives evident in existing visualization methods. Moreover, we have encapsulated this technology within an integrated, open-source platform named GeoViz.

Nevertheless, occurrence time may not be the only relevant factor, other contextual data, termed covariates, may also impact the event evolution. Incorporating such covariates into the model is beneficial, while distinguishing their relevance to the event dynamics is of great practical significance. In this work, we propose a Transformer-based covariate temporal point process (TransFeat-TPP) model to improve the interpretability of deep covariate-TPPs while maintaining powerful expressiveness. TransFeat-TPP can effectively model complex relationships between events and covariates, and provide enhanced interpretability by discerning the importance of various covariates. Experimental results on synthetic and real datasets demonstrate improved prediction accuracy and consistently interpretable feature importance when compared to existing deep covariate-TPPs.</p></details> |  |

Unlike static data such as images, sequential data consists of consecutive data frames indexed by time, exhibiting rich spatial and temporal dependencies. These dependencies represent the underlying dynamic model and are critical to validate the generated data. In this paper, we make the first theoretical step towards bridging diffusion transformers for capturing spatial-temporal dependencies. Specifically, we establish score approximation and distribution estimation guarantees of diffusion transformers for learning Gaussian process data with covariance functions of various decay patterns. We highlight how the spatial-temporal dependencies are captured and affect learning efficiency. Our study proposes a novel transformer approximation theory, where the transformer acts to unroll an algorithm. We support our theoretical results by numerical experiments, providing strong evidence that spatial-temporal dependencies are captured within attention layers, aligning with our approximation theory.</p></details> | 52 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Towards Effective Fusion and Forecasting of Multimodal Spatio-temporal Data for Smart Mobility](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16123v1)** | 2024-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid development of location based services, multimodal spatio-temporal (ST) data including trajectories, transportation modes, traffic flow and social check-ins are being collected for deep learning based methods. These deep learning based methods learn ST correlations to support the downstream tasks in the fields such as smart mobility, smart city and other intelligent transportation systems. Despite their effectiveness, ST data fusion and forecasting methods face practical challenges in real-world scenarios. First, forecasting performance for ST data-insufficient area is inferior, making it necessary to transfer meta knowledge from heterogeneous area to enhance the sparse representations. Second, it is nontrivial to accurately forecast in multi-transportation-mode scenarios due to the fine-grained ST features of similar transportation modes, making it necessary to distinguish and measure the ST correlations to alleviate the influence caused by entangled ST features. At last, partial data modalities (e.g., transportation mode) are lost due to privacy or technical issues in certain scenarios, making it necessary to effectively fuse the multimodal sparse ST features and enrich the ST representations. To tackle these challenges, our research work aim to develop effective fusion and forecasting methods for multimodal ST data in smart mobility scenario. In this paper, we will introduce our recent works that investigates the challenges in terms of various real-world applications and establish the open challenges in this field for future work.</p></details> | 4 pages |

We propose a novel deep learning framework named EfficientCD, specifically designed for remote sensing image change detection. The framework employs EfficientNet as its backbone network for feature extraction. To enhance the information exchange between bi-temporal image feature maps, we have designed a new Feature Pyramid Network module targeted at remote sensing change detection, named ChangeFPN. Additionally, to make full use of the multi-level feature maps in the decoding stage, we have developed a layer-by-layer feature upsampling module combined with Euclidean distance to improve feature fusion and reconstruction during the decoding stage. The EfficientCD has been experimentally validated on four remote sensing datasets: LEVIR-CD, SYSU-CD, CLCD, and WHUCD. The experimental results demonstrate that EfficientCD exhibits outstanding performance in change detection accuracy. The code and pretrained models will be released at https://github.com/dyzy41/mmrscd.</p></details> |  |

It captures photons at each pixel independently, creating binary spike streams rich in temporal information but challenging for image reconstruction. Current algorithms, both traditional and deep learning-based, still need to be improved in the utilization of the rich temporal detail and the restoration of the details of the reconstructed image. To overcome this, we introduce Swin Spikeformer (SwinSF), a novel model for dynamic scene reconstruction from spike streams. SwinSF is composed of Spike Feature Extraction, Spatial-Temporal Feature Extraction, and Final Reconstruction Module. It combines shifted window self-attention and proposed temporal spike attention, ensuring a comprehensive feature extraction that encapsulates both spatial and temporal dynamics, leading to a more robust and accurate reconstruction of spike streams. Furthermore, we build a new synthesized dataset for spike image reconstruction which matches the resolution of the latest spike camera, ensuring its relevance and applicability to the latest developments in spike camera imaging. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed network SwinSF sets a new benchmark, achieving state-of-the-art performance across a series of datasets, including both real-world and synthesized data across various resolutions. Our codes and proposed dataset will be available soon.</p></details> |  |
| **[A divide-and-conquer approach for spatio-temporal analysis of large house price data from Greater London](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15905v1)** | 2024-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Statistical research in real estate markets, particularly in understanding the spatio-temporal dynamics of house prices, has garnered significant attention in recent times. Although Bayesian methods are common in spatio-temporal modeling, standard Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques are usually slow for large datasets such as house price data. To tackle this problem, we propose a divide-and-conquer spatio-temporal modeling approach. This method involves partitioning the data into multiple subsets and applying an appropriate Gaussian process model to each subset in parallel. The results from each subset are then combined using the Wasserstein barycenter technique to obtain the global parameters for the original problem. The proposed methodology allows for multiple observations per spatial and time unit, thereby offering added benefits for practitioners. As a real-life application, we analyze house price data of more than 0.6 million transactions from 983 middle layer super output areas in London over a period of eight years. The methodology provides insightful findings about the effects of various amenities, trend patterns, and the relationship between prices and carbon emissions. Furthermore, as demonstrated through a cross-validation study, it shows good predictive accuracy while balancing computational efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Suppl...</summary><p>Supplementary material is available from the authors upon request</p></details> |

To address this challenging task, we propose DynoSurf, an unsupervised learning framework integrating a template surface representation with a learnable deformation field. Specifically, we design a coarse-to-fine strategy for learning the template surface based on the deformable tetrahedron representation. Furthermore, we propose a learnable deformation representation based on the learnable control points and blending weights, which can deform the template surface non-rigidly while maintaining the consistency of the local shape. Experimental results demonstrate the significant superiority of DynoSurf over current state-of-the-art approaches, showcasing its potential as a powerful tool for dynamic mesh reconstruction.

| **[Spatial-Temporal Cross-View Contrastive Pre-training for Check-in Sequence Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15899v1)** | 2024-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid growth of location-based services (LBS) has yielded massive amounts of data on human mobility. Effectively extracting meaningful representations for user-generated check-in sequences is pivotal for facilitating various downstream services. However, the user-generated check-in data are simultaneously influenced by the surrounding objective circumstances and the user's subjective intention. Specifically, the temporal uncertainty and spatial diversity exhibited in check-in data make it difficult to capture the macroscopic spatial-temporal patterns of users and to understand the semantics of user mobility activities. Furthermore, the distinct characteristics of the temporal and spatial information in check-in sequences call for an effective fusion method to incorporate these two types of information. In this paper, we propose a novel Spatial-Temporal Cross-view Contrastive Representation (STCCR) framework for check-in sequence representation learning. Specifically, STCCR addresses the above challenges by employing self-supervision from "spatial topic" and "temporal intention" views, facilitating effective fusion of spatial and temporal information at the semantic level. Besides, STCCR leverages contrastive clustering to uncover users' shared spatial topics from diverse mobility activities, while employing angular momentum contrast to mitigate the impact of temporal uncertainty and noise. We extensively evaluate STCCR on three real-world datasets and demonstrate its superior performance across three downstream tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[The SPDE approach for spatio-temporal datasets with advection and diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.14015v4)** | 2024-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the task of predicting spatio-temporal fields in environmental science using statistical methods, introducing statistical models inspired by the physics of the underlying phenomena that are numerically efficient is of growing interest. Large space-time datasets call for new numerical methods to efficiently process them. The Stochastic Partial Differential Equation (SPDE) approach has proven to be effective for the estimation and the prediction in a spatial context. We present here the advection-diffusion SPDE with first order derivative in time which defines a large class of nonseparable spatio-temporal models. A Gaussian Markov random field approximation of the solution to the SPDE is built by discretizing the temporal derivative with a finite difference method (implicit Euler) and by solving the spatial SPDE with a finite element method (continuous Galerkin) at each time step. The ''Streamline Diffusion'' stabilization technique is introduced when the advection term dominates the diffusion. Computationally efficient methods are proposed to estimate the parameters of the SPDE and to predict the spatio-temporal field by kriging, as well as to perform conditional simulations. The approach is applied to a solar radiation dataset. Its advantages and limitations are discussed.</p></details> |  |
| **[T-MAE: Temporal Masked Autoencoders for Point Cloud Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10217v3)** | 2024-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The scarcity of annotated data in LiDAR point cloud understanding hinders effective representation learning. Consequently, scholars have been actively investigating efficacious self-supervised pre-training paradigms. Nevertheless, temporal information, which is inherent in the LiDAR point cloud sequence, is consistently disregarded. To better utilize this property, we propose an effective pre-training strategy, namely Temporal Masked Auto-Encoders (T-MAE), which takes as input temporally adjacent frames and learns temporal dependency. A SiamWCA backbone, containing a Siamese encoder and a windowed cross-attention (WCA) module, is established for the two-frame input. Considering that the movement of an ego-vehicle alters the view of the same instance, temporal modeling also serves as a robust and natural data augmentation, enhancing the comprehension of target objects. SiamWCA is a powerful architecture but heavily relies on annotated data. Our T-MAE pre-training strategy alleviates its demand for annotated data. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that T-MAE achieves the best performance on both Waymo and ONCE datasets among competitive self-supervised approaches.

Methods have been proposed to convert human motion and texts into features to achieve accurate correspondence between them. Despite these efforts to align language and motion representations, we claim that the temporal element is often overlooked, especially for compound actions, resulting in chronological inaccuracies. To shed light on the temporal alignment in motion-language latent spaces, we propose Chronologically Accurate Retrieval (CAR) to evaluate the chronological understanding of the models. We decompose textual descriptions into events, and prepare negative text samples by shuffling the order of events in compound action descriptions. We then design a simple task for motion-language models to retrieve the more likely text from the ground truth and its chronologically shuffled version. CAR reveals many cases where current motion-language models fail to distinguish the event chronology of human motion, despite their impressive performance in terms of conventional evaluation metrics. To achieve better temporal alignment between text and motion, we further propose to use these texts with shuffled sequence of events as negative samples during training to reinforce the motion-language models. We conduct experiments on text-motion retrieval and text-to-motion generation using the reinforced motion-language models, which demonstrate improved performance over conventional approaches, indicating the necessity to consider temporal elements in motion-language alignment.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear at ECCV 2024.

In prior research, pre-dating the advent of deep learning (DL) approaches to biometric analysis, a strong relationship between temporal persistence, as indexed by the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), and biometric performance (Equal Error Rate, EER) was noted. More generally, the claim was made that good biometric performance resulted from a relatively large set of weakly intercorrelated features with high ICC. The present study aimed to determine whether the same relationships are found in a state-of-the-art DL-based eye movement biometric system (``Eye-Know-You-Too''), as applied to two publicly available eye movement datasets. To this end, we manipulate various aspects of eye-tracking signal quality, which produces variation in biometric performance, and relate that performance to the temporal persistence and intercorrelation of the resulting embeddings. Data quality indices were related to EER with either linear or logarithmic fits, and the resulting model R^2 was noted. As a general matter, we found that temporal persistence was an important predictor of DL-based biometric performance, and also that DL-learned embeddings were generally weakly intercorrelated.</p></details> | 18 pages, 7 Figures |
| **[Evidence-Based Temporal Fact Verification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15291v1)** | 2024-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated fact verification plays an essential role in fostering trust in the digital space. Despite the growing interest, the verification of temporal facts has not received much attention in the community. Temporal fact verification brings new challenges where cues of the temporal information need to be extracted and temporal reasoning involving various temporal aspects of the text must be applied. In this work, we propose an end-to-end solution for temporal fact verification that considers the temporal information in claims to obtain relevant evidence sentences and harness the power of large language model for temporal reasoning. Recognizing that temporal facts often involve events, we model these events in the claim and evidence sentences. We curate two temporal fact datasets to learn time-sensitive representations that encapsulate not only the semantic relationships among the events, but also their chronological proximity. This allows us to retrieve the top-k relevant evidence sentences and provide the context for a large language model to perform temporal reasoning and outputs whether a claim is supported or refuted by the retrieved evidence sentences. Experiment results demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly enhances the accuracy of temporal claim verification, thereby advancing current state-of-the-art in automated fact verification.</p></details> |  |
| **[Temporal Abstraction in Reinforcement Learning with Offline Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15241v1)** | 2024-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Standard reinforcement learning algorithms with a single policy perform poorly on tasks in complex environments involving sparse rewards, diverse behaviors, or long-term planning. This led to the study of algorithms that incorporate temporal abstraction by training a hierarchy of policies that plan over different time scales. The options framework has been introduced to implement such temporal abstraction by learning low-level options that act as extended actions controlled by a high-level policy. The main challenge in applying these algorithms to real-world problems is that they suffer from high sample complexity to train multiple levels of the hierarchy, which is impossible in online settings. Motivated by this, in this paper, we propose an offline hierarchical RL method that can learn options from existing offline datasets collected by other unknown agents. This is a very challenging problem due to the distribution mismatch between the learned options and the policies responsible for the offline dataset and to our knowledge, this is the first work in this direction. In this work, we propose a framework by which an online hierarchical reinforcement learning algorithm can be trained on an offline dataset of transitions collected by an unknown behavior policy. We validate our method on Gym MuJoCo locomotion environments and robotic gripper block-stacking tasks in the standard as well as transfer and goal-conditioned settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[$R^2$-Tuning: Efficient Image-to-Video Transfer Learning for Video Temporal Grounding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00801v2)** | 2024-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video temporal grounding (VTG) is a fine-grained video understanding problem that aims to ground relevant clips in untrimmed videos given natural language queries. Most existing VTG models are built upon frame-wise final-layer CLIP features, aided by additional temporal backbones (e.g., SlowFast) with sophisticated temporal reasoning mechanisms. In this work, we claim that CLIP itself already shows great potential for fine-grained spatial-temporal modeling, as each layer offers distinct yet useful information under different granularity levels. Motivated by this, we propose Reversed Recurrent Tuning ($R^2$-Tuning), a parameter- and memory-efficient transfer learning framework for video temporal grounding. Our method learns a lightweight $R^2$ Block containing only 1.5% of the total parameters to perform progressive spatial-temporal modeling. Starting from the last layer of CLIP, $R^2$ Block recurrently aggregates spatial features from earlier layers, then refines temporal correlation conditioning on the given query, resulting in a coarse-to-fine scheme. $R^2$-Tuning achieves state-of-the-art performance across three VTG tasks (i.e., moment retrieval, highlight detection, and video summarization) on six public benchmarks (i.e., QVHighlights, Charades-STA, Ego4D-NLQ, TACoS, YouTube Highlights, and TVSum) even without the additional backbone, demonstrating the significance and effectiveness of the proposed scheme.

Recent advances in modeling inter-airport relationships present a promising approach for investigating flight delay prediction from the multi-airport scenario. However, the previous prediction works only accounted for the simplistic relationships such as traffic flow or geographical distance, overlooking the intricate interactions among airports and thus proving inadequate. In this paper, we leverage causal inference to precisely model inter-airport relationships and propose a self-corrective spatio-temporal graph neural network (named CausalNet) for flight delay prediction. Specifically, Granger causality inference coupled with a self-correction module is designed to construct causality graphs among airports and dynamically modify them based on the current airport's delays. Additionally, the features of the causality graphs are adaptively extracted and utilized to address the heterogeneity of airports. Extensive experiments are conducted on the real data of top-74 busiest airports in China. The results show that CausalNet is superior to baselines. Ablation studies emphasize the power of the proposed self-correction causality graph and the graph feature extraction module. All of these prove the effectiveness of the proposed methodology.</p></details> |  |
| **[TADA: Temporal Adversarial Data Augmentation for Time Series Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15174v1)** | 2024-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Domain generalization involves training machine learning models to perform robustly on unseen samples from out-of-distribution datasets. Adversarial Data Augmentation (ADA) is a commonly used approach that enhances model adaptability by incorporating synthetic samples, designed to simulate potential unseen samples. While ADA effectively addresses amplitude-related distribution shifts, it falls short in managing temporal shifts, which are essential for time series data. To address this limitation, we propose the Temporal Adversarial Data Augmentation for time teries Data (TADA), which incorporates a time warping technique specifically targeting temporal shifts. Recognizing the challenge of non-differentiability in traditional time warping, we make it differentiable by leveraging phase shifts in the frequency domain. Our evaluations across diverse domains demonstrate that TADA significantly outperforms existing ADA variants, enhancing model performance across time series datasets with varied distributions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Semi-Supervised Pipe Video Temporal Defect Interval Localization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15170v1)** | 2024-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In sewer pipe Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) inspection, accurate temporal defect localization is essential for effective defect classification, detection, segmentation and quantification. Industry standards typically do not require time-interval annotations, even though they are more informative than time-point annotations for defect localization, resulting in additional annotation costs when fully supervised methods are used. Additionally, differences in scene types and camera motion patterns between pipe inspections and Temporal Action Localization (TAL) hinder the effective transfer of point-supervised TAL methods. Therefore, this study introduces a Semi-supervised multi-Prototype-based method incorporating visual Odometry for enhanced attention guidance (PipeSPO). PipeSPO fully leverages unlabeled data through unsupervised pretext tasks and utilizes time-point annotated data with a weakly supervised multi-prototype-based method, relying on visual odometry features to capture camera pose information. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that PipeSPO achieves 41.89% average precision across Intersection over Union (IoU) thresholds of 0.1-0.7, improving by 8.14% over current state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | 13 pages, 3 figures |

Our approach does not assume access to any rigging or intermediate shape keyframes, produces geometrically and temporally consistent motions, and can be used to transfer long motion sequences. Central to our approach are two coupled neural networks that individually predict local geometric and temporal changes that are subsequently integrated, spatially and temporally, to produce the final animated meshes. The two networks are jointly trained, complement each other in producing spatial and temporal signals, and are supervised directly with 3D positional information. During inference, in the absence of keyframes, our method essentially solves a motion extrapolation problem. We test our setup on diverse meshes (synthetic and scanned shapes) to demonstrate its superiority in generating realistic and natural-looking animations on unseen body shapes against SoTA alternatives.

| **[Temporal Complexity of a Hopfield-Type Neural Model in Random and Scale-Free Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12895v2)** | 2024-07-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Hopfield network model and its generalizations were introduced as a model of associative, or content-addressable, memory. They were widely investigated both as a unsupervised learning method in artificial intelligence and as a model of biological neural dynamics in computational neuroscience. The complexity features of biological neural networks are attracting the interest of scientific community since the last two decades. More recently, concepts and tools borrowed from complex network theory were applied to artificial neural networks and learning, thus focusing on the topological aspects. However, the temporal structure is also a crucial property displayed by biological neural networks and investigated in the framework of systems displaying complex intermittency. The Intermittency-Driven Complexity (IDC) approach indeed focuses on the metastability of self-organized states, whose signature is a power-decay in the inter-event time distribution or a scaling behavior in the related event-driven diffusion processes. The investigation of IDC in neural dynamics and its relationship with network topology is still in its early stages. In this work we present the preliminary results of a IDC analysis carried out on a bio-inspired Hopfield-type neural network comparing two different connectivities, i.e., scale-free vs. random network topology. We found that random networks can trigger complexity features similar to that of scale-free networks, even if with some differences and for different parameter values, in particular for different noise levels.</p></details> |  |
| **[TTT: A Temporal Refinement Heuristic for Tenuously Tractable Discrete Time Reachability Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14394v1)** | 2024-07-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reachable set computation is an important tool for analyzing control systems. Simulating a control system can show that the system is generally functioning as desired, but a formal tool like reachability analysis can provide a guarantee of correctness. For linear systems, reachability analysis is straightforward and fast, but as more complex components are added to the control system such as nonlinear dynamics or a neural network controller, reachability analysis may slow down or become overly conservative. To address these challenges, much literature has focused on spatial refinement, e.g., tuning the discretization of the input sets and intermediate reachable sets. However, this paper addresses a different dimension: temporal refinement. The basic idea of temporal refinement is to automatically choose when along the horizon of the reachability problem to execute slow symbolic queries which incur less approximation error versus fast concrete queries which incur more approximation error. Temporal refinement can be combined with other refinement approaches and offers an additional ``tuning knob'' with which to trade off tractability and tightness in approximate reachable set computation. Here, we introduce an automatic framework for performing temporal refinement and we demonstrate the effectiveness of this technique on computing approximate reachable sets for nonlinear systems with neural network control policies. We demonstrate the calculation of reachable sets of varying approximation error under varying computational budget and show that our algorithm is able to generate approximate reachable sets with a similar amount of error to the baseline approach in 20-70% less time.</p></details> |  |

This variability poses a Domain Adaptation (DA) problem, as training and testing data distributions often differ. In this work, we propose Spatio-Temporal Monge Alignment (STMA) to mitigate these variabilities. This Optimal Transport (OT) based method adapts the cross-power spectrum density (cross-PSD) of multivariate signals by mapping them to the Wasserstein barycenter of source domains (multi-source DA). Predictions for new domains can be done with a filtering without the need for retraining a model with source data (test-time DA). We also study and discuss two special cases of the method, Temporal Monge Alignment (TMA) and Spatial Monge Alignment (SMA). Non-asymptotic concentration bounds are derived for the mappings estimation, which reveals a bias-plus-variance error structure with a variance decay rate of $\mathcal{O}(n_\ell^{-1/2})$ with $n_\ell$ the signal length. This theoretical guarantee demonstrates the efficiency of the proposed computational schema. Numerical experiments on multivariate biosignals and image data show that STMA leads to significant and consistent performance gains between datasets acquired with very different settings. Notably, STMA is a pre-processing step complementary to state-of-the-art deep learning methods.</p></details> |  |

Recent studies have shown the potential of contrastive learning in unsupervised representation learning using unlabelled data. However, learning the representation of each frame by unsupervised contrastive learning for action segmentation remains an open and challenging problem. In this paper, we propose a novel Semantic-guided Multi-level Contrast scheme with a Neighbourhood-Consistency-Aware unit (SMC-NCA) to extract strong frame-wise representations for SS-TAS. Specifically, for representation learning, SMC is first used to explore intra- and inter-information variations in a unified and contrastive way, based on action-specific semantic information and temporal information highlighting relations between actions. Then, the NCA module, which is responsible for enforcing spatial consistency between neighbourhoods centered at different frames to alleviate over-segmentation issues, works alongside SMC for semi-supervised learning (SSL). Our SMC outperforms the other state-of-the-art methods on three benchmarks, offering improvements of up to 17.8% and 12.6% in terms of Edit distance and accuracy, respectively. Additionally, the NCA unit results in significantly better segmentation performance in the presence of only 5% labelled videos. We also demonstrate the generalizability and effectiveness of the proposed method on our Parkinson Disease's Mouse Behaviour (PDMB) dataset.

However, solving the competition between the detector and the feature extractor has always been a challenge. Also, the issue of directly embedding the ReID task into MOT has remained unresolved. The lack of high discriminability in appearance features results in their limited utility. In this paper, we propose a new learning approach using cross-correlation to capture temporal information of objects. The feature extraction network is no longer trained solely on appearance features from each frame but learns richer motion features by utilizing feature heatmaps from consecutive frames, addressing the challenge of inter-class feature similarity. Furthermore, we apply our learning approach to a more lightweight feature extraction network, and treat the feature matching scores as strong cues rather than auxiliary cues, employing a appropriate weight calculation to reflect the compatibility between our obtained features and the MOT task. Our tracker, named TCBTrack, achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple public benchmarks, i.e., MOT17, MOT20, and DanceTrack datasets. Specifically, on the DanceTrack test set, we achieve 56.8 HOTA, 58.1 IDF1 and 92.5 MOTA, making it the best online tracker that can achieve real-time performance. Comparative evaluations with other trackers prove that our tracker achieves the best balance between speed, robustness and accuracy.</p></details> | A submission to IJCV |

However, the concept of the temporal receptive field, which refers to the temporal context that models use for making predictions, has been largely overlooked and insufficiently analyzed in existing research. In this study, we present a comprehensive analysis of the temporal receptive field in dynamic graph learning. By examining multiple datasets and models, we formalize the role of temporal receptive field and highlight their crucial influence on predictive accuracy. Our results demonstrate that appropriately chosen temporal receptive field can significantly enhance model performance, while for some models, overly large windows may introduce noise and reduce accuracy. We conduct extensive benchmarking to validate our findings, ensuring that all experiments are fully reproducible. Code is available at https://github.com/ykrmm/BenchmarkTW .</p></details> |  |
| **[LoAS: Fully Temporal-Parallel Datatflow for Dual-Sparse Spiking Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14073v1)** | 2024-07-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have gained significant research attention in the last decade due to their potential to drive resource-constrained edge devices. Though existing SNN accelerators offer high efficiency in processing sparse spikes with dense weights, opportunities are less explored in SNNs with sparse weights, i.e., dual-sparsity. In this work, we study the acceleration of dual-sparse SNNs, focusing on their core operation, sparse-matrix-sparse-matrix multiplication (spMspM). We observe that naively running a dual-sparse SNN on existing spMspM accelerators designed for dual-sparse Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) exhibits sub-optimal efficiency. The main challenge is that processing timesteps, a natural property of SNNs, introduces an extra loop to ANN spMspM, leading to longer latency and more memory traffic. To address the problem, we propose a fully temporal-parallel (FTP) dataflow, which minimizes both data movement across timesteps and the end-to-end latency of dual-sparse SNNs. To maximize the efficiency of FTP dataflow, we propose an FTP-friendly spike compression mechanism that efficiently compresses single-bit spikes and ensures contiguous memory access. We further propose an FTP-friendly inner-join circuit that can lower the cost of the expensive prefix-sum circuits with almost no throughput penalty. All the above techniques for FTP dataflow are encapsulated in LoAS, a Low-latency inference Accelerator for dual-sparse SNNs. With FTP dataflow, compression, and inner-join, running dual-sparse SNN workloads on LoAS demonstrates significant speedup (up to $8.51\times$) and energy reduction (up to $3.68\times$) compared to running it on prior dual-sparse accelerators.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to MICRO 2024.

To achieve this, we exploit a simple proxy task of ordering a shuffled image sequence, with `time' serving as a supervisory signal, since only changes that are monotonic with time can give rise to the correct ordering. We also introduce a transformer-based model for ordering of image sequences of arbitrary length with built-in attribution maps. After training, the model successfully discovers and localizes monotonic changes while ignoring cyclic and stochastic ones. We demonstrate applications of the model in multiple domains covering different scene and object types, discovering both object-level and environmental changes in unseen sequences. We also demonstrate that the attention-based attribution maps function as effective prompts for segmenting the changing regions, and that the learned representations can be used for downstream applications. Finally, we show that the model achieves the state-of-the-art on standard benchmarks for image ordering.</p></details> | <details><summary>ECCV ...</summary><p>ECCV 2024.

To address these challenges, we examine SimStock, a novel temporal self-supervised learning framework that combines techniques from self-supervised learning (SSL) and temporal domain generalization to learn robust and informative representations of financial time series data. The primary focus of our study is to understand the similarities between stocks from a broader perspective, considering the complex dynamics of the global financial landscape. We conduct extensive experiments on four real-world datasets with thousands of stocks and demonstrate the effectiveness of SimStock in finding similar stocks, outperforming existing methods. The practical utility of SimStock is showcased through its application to various investment strategies, such as pairs trading, index tracking, and portfolio optimization, where it leads to superior performance compared to conventional methods. Our findings empirically examine the potential of data-driven approach to enhance investment decision-making and risk management practices by leveraging the power of temporal self-supervised learning in the face of the ever-changing global financial landscape.</p></details> |  |
| **[Higher-order Spatio-temporal Physics-incorporated Graph Neural Network for Multivariate Time Series Imputation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10995v2)** | 2024-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Exploring the missing values is an essential but challenging issue due to the complex latent spatio-temporal correlation and dynamic nature of time series. Owing to the outstanding performance in dealing with structure learning potentials, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are often used to capture such complex spatio-temporal features in multivariate time series. However, these data-driven models often fail to capture the essential spatio-temporal relationships when significant signal corruption occurs. Additionally, calculating the high-order neighbor nodes in these models is of high computational complexity. To address these problems, we propose a novel higher-order spatio-temporal physics-incorporated GNN (HSPGNN). Firstly, the dynamic Laplacian matrix can be obtained by the spatial attention mechanism. Then, the generic inhomogeneous partial differential equation (PDE) of physical dynamic systems is used to construct the dynamic higher-order spatio-temporal GNN to obtain the missing time series values. Moreover, we estimate the missing impact by Normalizing Flows (NF) to evaluate the importance of each node in the graph for better explainability. Experimental results on four benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HSPGNN and the superior performance when combining various order neighbor nodes. Also, graph-like optical flow, dynamic graphs, and missing impact can be obtained naturally by HSPGNN, which provides better dynamic analysis and explanation than traditional data-driven models.

Recently, DETR-like approaches achieved notable progress by predicting the center and length of a target moment. However, they suffer from the issue of center misalignment raised by the inherent ambiguity of moment centers, leading to inaccurate predictions. To remedy this problem, we propose a novel boundary-oriented moment formulation. In our paradigm, the model no longer needs to find the precise center but instead suffices to predict any anchor point within the interval, from which the boundaries are directly estimated. Based on this idea, we design a boundary-aligned moment detection transformer, equipped with a dual-pathway decoding process. Specifically, it refines the anchor and boundaries within parallel pathways using global and boundary-focused attention, respectively. This separate design allows the model to focus on desirable regions, enabling precise refinement of moment predictions. Further, we propose a quality-based ranking method, ensuring that proposals with high localization qualities are prioritized over incomplete ones. Experiments on three benchmarks validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.

| **[MSPipe: Efficient Temporal GNN Training via Staleness-Aware Pipeline](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15113v2)** | 2024-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Memory-based Temporal Graph Neural Networks (MTGNNs) are a class of temporal graph neural networks that utilize a node memory module to capture and retain long-term temporal dependencies, leading to superior performance compared to memory-less counterparts. However, the iterative reading and updating process of the memory module in MTGNNs to obtain up-to-date information needs to follow the temporal dependencies. This introduces significant overhead and limits training throughput. Existing optimizations for static GNNs are not directly applicable to MTGNNs due to differences in training paradigm, model architecture, and the absence of a memory module. Moreover, they do not effectively address the challenges posed by temporal dependencies, making them ineffective for MTGNN training. In this paper, we propose MSPipe, a general and efficient framework for MTGNNs that maximizes training throughput while maintaining model accuracy. Our design addresses the unique challenges associated with fetching and updating node memory states in MTGNNs by integrating staleness into the memory module. However, simply introducing a predefined staleness bound in the memory module to break temporal dependencies may lead to suboptimal performance and lack of generalizability across different models and datasets. To solve this, we introduce an online pipeline scheduling algorithm in MSPipe that strategically breaks temporal dependencies with minimal staleness and delays memory fetching to obtain fresher memory states. Moreover, we design a staleness mitigation mechanism to enhance training convergence and model accuracy. We provide convergence analysis and prove that MSPipe maintains the same convergence rate as vanilla sample-based GNN training. Experimental results show that MSPipe achieves up to 2.45x speed-up without sacrificing accuracy, making it a promising solution for efficient MTGNN training.</p></details> |  |

The exposure change and absence make existing methods generate flickering HDR results. In this paper, we propose a novel paradigm to render HDR frames via completing the absent exposure information, hence the exposure information is complete and consistent. Our approach involves interpolating neighbor LDR frames in the time dimension to reconstruct LDR frames for the absent exposures. Combining the interpolated and given LDR frames, the complete set of exposure information is available at each time stamp. This benefits the fusing process for HDR results, reducing noise and ghosting artifacts therefore improving temporal consistency. Extensive experimental evaluations on standard benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, highlighting the importance of absent exposure completing in HDR video rendering.

| **[Exploiting Automorphisms of Temporal Graphs for Fast Exploration and Rendezvous](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07140v2)** | 2024-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal graphs are graphs where the edge set can change in each time step, and the vertex set stays the same. Exploration of temporal graphs whose snapshot in each time step is a connected graph, called connected temporal graphs, has been widely studied. We extend the concept of graph automorphisms from static graphs to temporal graphs and show that symmetries enable faster exploration: We prove that a connected temporal graph with $n$ vertices and orbit number $r$ (i.e., $r$ is the number of automorphism orbits) can be explored in $O(r n^{1+\epsilon})$ time steps, for any fixed $\epsilon>0$. For $r=O(n^c)$ for constant $c<1$, this is a significant improvement over the known tight worst-case bound of $\Theta(n^2)$ time steps for arbitrary connected temporal graphs. We also give two lower bounds for exploration, showing that $\Omega(n \log n)$ time steps are required for some inputs with $r=O(1)$ and that $\Omega(rn)$ time steps are required for some inputs for any $r$ with $1\le r\le n$. The techniques we develop for fast exploration are used to derive the following result for rendezvous in connected temporal graphs: Two agents are placed by an adversary at arbitrary vertices and given full information about the temporal graph, except that they do not have consistent vertex labels. The agents can meet at a common vertex after $O(n^{1+\epsilon})$ time steps, for any $\epsilon>0$. For some connected temporal graphs with constant orbit number we present a complementary lower bound of $\Omega(n\log n)$ time steps. Finally, we give a randomized algorithm to construct a temporal walk $W$ that visits all vertices of a given orbit with probability at least $1-\epsilon$ for any $0<\epsilon<1$ such that $W$ spans $O((n^{5/3}+rn)\log n)$ time steps. The runtime of this algorithm consists of $O(n^{1/3} \log (n/\epsilon))$ linear-time scans of the snapshots that exist in this time span.</p></details> |  |

Recent research advances in audio captioning have introduced additional guidance to improve the accuracy of audio events in generated sentences. However, temporal relations between audio events have received little attention while revealing complex relations is a key component in summarizing audio content. Therefore, this paper aims to better capture temporal relationships in caption generation with sound event detection (SED), a task that locates events' timestamps. We investigate the best approach to integrate temporal information in a captioning model and propose a temporal tag system to transform the timestamps into comprehensible relations. Results evaluated by the proposed temporal metrics suggest that great improvement is achieved in terms of temporal relation generation.</p></details> | Interspeech 2023 |

Analyzing fine-grained and comprehensive relations among stations effectively is imperative for metro OD prediction. However, existing metro OD models either mix information from multiple OD pairs from the station's perspective or exclusively focus on a subset of OD pairs. These approaches may overlook fine-grained relations among OD pairs, leading to difficulties in predicting potential anomalous conditions. To address these challenges, we analyze traffic variations from the perspective of all OD pairs and propose a fine-grained spatial-temporal MLP architecture for metro OD prediction, namely ODMixer. Specifically, our ODMixer has double-branch structure and involves the Channel Mixer, the Multi-view Mixer, and the Bidirectional Trend Learner. The Channel Mixer aims to capture short-term temporal relations among OD pairs, the Multi-view Mixer concentrates on capturing relations from both origin and destination perspectives. To model long-term temporal relations, we introduce the Bidirectional Trend Learner.

Empirical observations suggest that cross-attention outputs converge to a fixed point after several inference steps. The convergence time naturally divides the entire inference process into two phases: an initial phase for planning text-oriented visual semantics, which are then translated into images in a subsequent fidelity-improving phase. Cross-attention is essential in the initial phase but almost irrelevant thereafter. However, self-attention initially plays a minor role but becomes crucial in the second phase. These findings yield a simple and training-free method known as temporally gating the attention (TGATE), which efficiently generates images by caching and reusing attention outputs at scheduled time steps. Experimental results show when widely applied to various existing text-conditional diffusion models, TGATE accelerates these models by 10%-50%.

Bad actors looking to create successful backdoors must design them to avoid activation during training and evaluation. Since data used in these stages often only contains information about events that have already occurred, a component of a simple backdoor trigger could be a model recognizing data that is in the future relative to when it was trained. Through prompting experiments and by probing internal activations, we show that current large language models (LLMs) can distinguish past from future events, with probes on model activations achieving 90% accuracy. We train models with backdoors triggered by a temporal distributional shift; they activate when the model is exposed to news headlines beyond their training cut-off dates. Fine-tuning on helpful, harmless and honest (HHH) data does not work well for removing simpler backdoor triggers but is effective on our backdoored models, although this distinction is smaller for the larger-scale model we tested. We also find that an activation-steering vector representing a model's internal representation of the date influences the rate of backdoor activation. We take these results as initial evidence that, at least for models at the modest scale we test, standard safety measures are enough to remove these backdoors.</p></details> |  |
| **[n-Step Temporal Difference Learning with Optimal n](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07068v5)** | 2024-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the problem of finding the optimal value of n in the n-step temporal difference (TD) learning algorithm. Our objective function for the optimization problem is the average root mean squared error (RMSE). We find the optimal n by resorting to a model-free optimization technique involving a one-simulation simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation (SPSA) based procedure. Whereas SPSA is a zeroth-order continuous optimization procedure, we adapt it to the discrete optimization setting by using a random projection operator. We prove the asymptotic convergence of the recursion by showing that the sequence of n-updates obtained using zeroth-order stochastic gradient search converges almost surely to an internally chain transitive invariant set of an associated differential inclusion. This results in convergence of the discrete parameter sequence to the optimal n in n-step TD. Through experiments, we show that the optimal value of n is achieved with our SDPSA algorithm for arbitrary initial values. We further show using numerical evaluations that SDPSA outperforms the state-of-the-art discrete parameter stochastic optimization algorithm Optimal Computing Budget Allocation (OCBA) on benchmark RL tasks.</p></details> |  |

Traditional methods rely on hand-crafted features and machine learning techniques, which often struggle to model the complex dynamics of human motion. Recent deep learning-based methods have achieved success by learning spatio-temporal representations of motion, but these models often overlook the reliability of motion data. Additionally, the temporal and spatial dependencies of skeleton nodes are distinct. The temporal relationship captures motion information over time, while the spatial relationship describes body structure and the relationships between different nodes. In this paper, we propose a novel spatio-temporal branching network using incremental information for HMP, which decouples the learning of temporal-domain and spatial-domain features, extracts more motion information, and achieves complementary cross-domain knowledge learning through knowledge distillation. Our approach effectively reduces noise interference and provides more expressive information for characterizing motion by separately extracting temporal and spatial features. We evaluate our approach on standard HMP benchmarks and outperform state-of-the-art methods in terms of prediction accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>The i...</summary><p>The incremental information of our paper includes the displacement information from the last frame of the historical sequence, derived from the motion information of the first frame in the future sequence and the motion information of the last frame of the historical sequence.

While Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have been proposed for skeleton data represented as graphs, they suffer from limited receptive fields constrained by joint connectivity. To address this limitation, recent advancements have introduced transformer-based methods. However, capturing correlations between all joints in all frames requires substantial memory resources. To alleviate this, we propose a novel approach called Skeletal-Temporal Transformer (SkateFormer) that partitions joints and frames based on different types of skeletal-temporal relation (Skate-Type) and performs skeletal-temporal self-attention (Skate-MSA) within each partition. We categorize the key skeletal-temporal relations for action recognition into a total of four distinct types. These types combine (i) two skeletal relation types based on physically neighboring and distant joints, and (ii) two temporal relation types based on neighboring and distant frames. Through this partition-specific attention strategy, our SkateFormer can selectively focus on key joints and frames crucial for action recognition in an action-adaptive manner with efficient computation. Extensive experiments on various benchmark datasets validate that our SkateFormer outperforms recent state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>ECCV ...</summary><p>ECCV 2024 (camera-ready version).

| **[UTG: Towards a Unified View of Snapshot and Event Based Models for Temporal Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12269v1)** | 2024-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal graphs have gained increasing importance due to their ability to model dynamically evolving relationships. These graphs can be represented through either a stream of edge events or a sequence of graph snapshots. Until now, the development of machine learning methods for both types has occurred largely in isolation, resulting in limited experimental comparison and theoretical crosspollination between the two. In this paper, we introduce Unified Temporal Graph (UTG), a framework that unifies snapshot-based and event-based machine learning models under a single umbrella, enabling models developed for one representation to be applied effectively to datasets of the other. We also propose a novel UTG training procedure to boost the performance of snapshot-based models in the streaming setting. We comprehensively evaluate both snapshot and event-based models across both types of temporal graphs on the temporal link prediction task. Our main findings are threefold: first, when combined with UTG training, snapshotbased models can perform competitively with event-based models such as TGN and GraphMixer even on event datasets. Second, snapshot-based models are at least an order of magnitude faster than most event-based models during inference. Third, while event-based methods such as NAT and DyGFormer outperforms snapshotbased methods on both types of temporal graphs, this is because they leverage joint neighborhood structural features thus emphasizing the potential to incorporate these features into snapshot-based models as well. These findings highlight the importance of comparing model architectures independent of the data format and suggest the potential of combining the efficiency of snapshot-based models with the performance of event-based models in the future.</p></details> |  |

We present StableVSR, a VSR method based on DMs that can significantly enhance the perceptual quality of upscaled videos by synthesizing realistic and temporally-consistent details. We introduce the Temporal Conditioning Module (TCM) into a pre-trained DM for single image super-resolution to turn it into a VSR method. TCM uses the novel Temporal Texture Guidance, which provides it with spatially-aligned and detail-rich texture information synthesized in adjacent frames. This guides the generative process of the current frame toward high-quality and temporally-consistent results. In addition, we introduce the novel Frame-wise Bidirectional Sampling strategy to encourage the use of information from past to future and vice-versa. This strategy improves the perceptual quality of the results and the temporal consistency across frames. We demonstrate the effectiveness of StableVSR in enhancing the perceptual quality of upscaled videos while achieving better temporal consistency compared to existing state-of-the-art methods for VSR.

This paper presents a contrasting viewpoint, perceiving data points as interconnected and employing a Markov reward process (MRP) for data modeling. We reformulate the typical supervised learning as an on-policy policy evaluation problem within reinforcement learning (RL), introducing a generalized temporal difference (TD) learning algorithm as a resolution. Theoretically, our analysis draws connections between the solutions of linear TD learning and ordinary least squares (OLS). We also show that under specific conditions, particularly when noises are correlated, the TD's solution proves to be a more effective estimator than OLS. Furthermore, we establish the convergence of our generalized TD algorithms under linear function approximation. Empirical studies verify our theoretical results, examine the vital design of our TD algorithm and show practical utility across various datasets, encompassing tasks such as regression and image classification with deep learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Gated Temporal Diffusion for Stochastic Long-Term Dense Anticipation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11954v1)** | 2024-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long-term action anticipation has become an important task for many applications such as autonomous driving and human-robot interaction. Unlike short-term anticipation, predicting more actions into the future imposes a real challenge with the increasing uncertainty in longer horizons. While there has been a significant progress in predicting more actions into the future, most of the proposed methods address the task in a deterministic setup and ignore the underlying uncertainty. In this paper, we propose a novel Gated Temporal Diffusion (GTD) network that models the uncertainty of both the observation and the future predictions. As generator, we introduce a Gated Anticipation Network (GTAN) to model both observed and unobserved frames of a video in a mutual representation. On the one hand, using a mutual representation for past and future allows us to jointly model ambiguities in the observation and future, while on the other hand GTAN can by design treat the observed and unobserved parts differently and steer the information flow between them. Our model achieves state-of-the-art results on the Breakfast, Assembly101 and 50Salads datasets in both stochastic and deterministic settings.

| **[Temporally Consistent Stereo Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11950v1)** | 2024-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Stereo matching provides depth estimation from binocular images for downstream applications. These applications mostly take video streams as input and require temporally consistent depth maps. However, existing methods mainly focus on the estimation at the single-frame level. This commonly leads to temporally inconsistent results, especially in ill-posed regions. In this paper, we aim to leverage temporal information to improve the temporal consistency, accuracy, and efficiency of stereo matching. To achieve this, we formulate video stereo matching as a process of temporal disparity completion followed by continuous iterative refinements. Specifically, we first project the disparity of the previous timestamp to the current viewpoint, obtaining a semi-dense disparity map. Then, we complete this map through a disparity completion module to obtain a well-initialized disparity map. The state features from the current completion module and from the past refinement are fused together, providing a temporally coherent state for subsequent refinement. Based on this coherent state, we introduce a dual-space refinement module to iteratively refine the initialized result in both disparity and disparity gradient spaces, improving estimations in ill-posed regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method effectively alleviates temporal inconsistency while enhancing both accuracy and efficiency.</p></details> | ECCV 2024 |

Existing methods either utilize multi-modal information in video-text pairs or apply global and local alignment techniques to promote alignment precision. However, these methods often fail to fully explore the spatio-temporal relationships among vision tokens within video and across different video-text pairs. In this paper, we propose a novel Spatio-Temporal Graph Transformer module to uniformly learn spatial and temporal contexts for video-language alignment pre-training (dubbed STGT). Specifically, our STGT combines spatio-temporal graph structure information with attention in transformer block, effectively utilizing the spatio-temporal contexts. In this way, we can model the relationships between vision tokens, promoting video-text alignment precision for benefiting downstream tasks. In addition, we propose a self-similarity alignment loss to explore the inherent self-similarity in the video and text. With the initial optimization achieved by contrastive learning, it can further promote the alignment accuracy between video and text. Experimental results on challenging downstream tasks, including video-text retrieval and video question answering, verify the superior performance of our method.</p></details> | under review |
| **[A Comprehensive Evaluation of Large Language Models on Temporal Event Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11638v1)** | 2024-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated great potential in various data mining tasks, such as knowledge question answering, mathematical reasoning, and commonsense reasoning. However, the reasoning capability of LLMs on temporal event forecasting has been under-explored. To systematically investigate their abilities in temporal event forecasting, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of LLM-based methods for temporal event forecasting. Due to the lack of a high-quality dataset that involves both graph and textual data, we first construct a benchmark dataset, named MidEast-TE-mini. Based on this dataset, we design a series of baseline methods, characterized by various input formats and retrieval augmented generation(RAG) modules. From extensive experiments, we find that directly integrating raw texts into the input of LLMs does not enhance zero-shot extrapolation performance. In contrast, incorporating raw texts in specific complex events and fine-tuning LLMs significantly improves performance. Moreover, enhanced with retrieval modules, LLM can effectively capture temporal relational patterns hidden in historical events. Meanwhile, issues such as popularity bias and the long-tail problem still persist in LLMs, particularly in the RAG-based method. These findings not only deepen our understanding of LLM-based event forecasting methods but also highlight several promising research directions.We consider that this comprehensive evaluation, along with the identified research opportunities, will significantly contribute to future research on temporal event forecasting through LLMs.</p></details> |  |

The conventional supervised approach requires the collection and labeling of a new set of egocentric videos to adapt the model, which is costly and time-consuming. Instead, we propose a novel methodology which performs the adaptation leveraging existing labeled exocentric videos and a new set of unlabeled, synchronized exocentric-egocentric video pairs, for which temporal action segmentation annotations do not need to be collected. We implement the proposed methodology with an approach based on knowledge distillation, which we investigate both at the feature and Temporal Action Segmentation model level. Experiments on Assembly101 and EgoExo4D demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method against classic unsupervised domain adaptation and temporal alignment approaches. Without bells and whistles, our best model performs on par with supervised approaches trained on labeled egocentric data, without ever seeing a single egocentric label, achieving a +15.99 improvement in the edit score (28.59 vs 12.60) on the Assembly101 dataset compared to a baseline model trained solely on exocentric data. In similar settings, our method also improves edit score by +3.32 on the challenging EgoExo4D benchmark.

However, due to data collection difficulty and privacy concerns, available data for building industrial intelligence and industrial large models is far from sufficient. Therefore, industrial time series data generation is of great importance. Existing research usually applies Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to generate MTS. However, GANs suffer from unstable training process due to the joint training of the generator and discriminator. This paper proposes a temporal-augmented conditional adaptive diffusion model, termed Diff-MTS, for MTS generation. It aims to better handle the complex temporal dependencies and dynamics of MTS data. Specifically, a conditional Adaptive Maximum-Mean Discrepancy (Ada-MMD) method has been proposed for the controlled generation of MTS, which does not require a classifier to control the generation. It improves the condition consistency of the diffusion model. Moreover, a Temporal Decomposition Reconstruction UNet (TDR-UNet) is established to capture complex temporal patterns and further improve the quality of the synthetic time series. Comprehensive experiments on the C-MAPSS and FEMTO datasets demonstrate that the proposed Diff-MTS performs substantially better in terms of diversity, fidelity, and utility compared with GAN-based methods. These results show that Diff-MTS facilitates the generation of industrial data, contributing to intelligent maintenance and the construction of industrial large models.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages,4 figures.

In this respect, we discovered experimental evidence suggesting that interrelations of these events are higher for closer time stamps. However, to be able for attention-based models to learn these regularities in short-term dependencies, it requires large amounts of data, which are often infeasible. This is because, while they are good at learning piece-wise temporal dependencies, attention-based models lack structures that encode biases in time series. As a resolution, we propose a simple and efficient method that enables attention layers to better encode the short-term temporal bias of these data sets by applying learnable, adaptive kernels directly to the attention matrices. We chose various prediction tasks for the experiments using Electronic Health Records (EHR) data sets since they are great examples with underlying long- and short-term temporal dependencies. Our experiments show exceptional classification results compared to best-performing models on most tasks and data sets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hierarchical Temporal Context Learning for Camera-based Semantic Scene Completion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02077v3)** | 2024-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Camera-based 3D semantic scene completion (SSC) is pivotal for predicting complicated 3D layouts with limited 2D image observations. The existing mainstream solutions generally leverage temporal information by roughly stacking history frames to supplement the current frame, such straightforward temporal modeling inevitably diminishes valid clues and increases learning difficulty. To address this problem, we present HTCL, a novel Hierarchical Temporal Context Learning paradigm for improving camera-based semantic scene completion. The primary innovation of this work involves decomposing temporal context learning into two hierarchical steps: (a) cross-frame affinity measurement and (b) affinity-based dynamic refinement. Firstly, to separate critical relevant context from redundant information, we introduce the pattern affinity with scale-aware isolation and multiple independent learners for fine-grained contextual correspondence modeling. Subsequently, to dynamically compensate for incomplete observations, we adaptively refine the feature sampling locations based on initially identified locations with high affinity and their neighboring relevant regions. Our method ranks $1^{st}$ on the SemanticKITTI benchmark and even surpasses LiDAR-based methods in terms of mIoU on the OpenOccupancy benchmark.

This requires understanding not only the individual queries but also their interrelationships. However, most existing methods focus on grounding one query at a time, ignoring the inherent structures among queries such as the general mutual exclusiveness and the temporal order. Consequently, the predicted timespans of different step diagrams may overlap considerably or violate the temporal order, thus harming the accuracy. In this paper, we tackle this issue by simultaneously grounding a sequence of step diagrams. Specifically, we propose composite queries, constructed by exhaustively pairing up the visual content features of the step diagrams and a fixed number of learnable positional embeddings. Our insight is that self-attention among composite queries carrying different content features suppress each other to reduce timespan overlaps in predictions, while the cross-attention corrects the temporal misalignment via content and position joint guidance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on the IAW dataset for grounding step diagrams and the YouCook2 benchmark for grounding natural language queries, significantly outperforming existing methods while simultaneously grounding multiple queries.</p></details> |  |
| **[TLRN: Temporal Latent Residual Networks For Large Deformation Image Registration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11219v1)** | 2024-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a novel approach, termed {\em Temporal Latent Residual Network (TLRN)}, to predict a sequence of deformation fields in time-series image registration. The challenge of registering time-series images often lies in the occurrence of large motions, especially when images differ significantly from a reference (e.g., the start of a cardiac cycle compared to the peak stretching phase). To achieve accurate and robust registration results, we leverage the nature of motion continuity and exploit the temporal smoothness in consecutive image frames. Our proposed TLRN highlights a temporal residual network with residual blocks carefully designed in latent deformation spaces, which are parameterized by time-sequential initial velocity fields. We treat a sequence of residual blocks over time as a dynamic training system, where each block is designed to learn the residual function between desired deformation features and current input accumulated from previous time frames. We validate the effectivenss of TLRN on both synthetic data and real-world cine cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) image videos. Our experimental results shows that TLRN is able to achieve substantially improved registration accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art.

Despite advancements in deep learning (DL) for automatic cine CMR segmentation, generalizability on unseen data remains a significant challenge. Recently, the segment-anything-model (SAM) has been invented as a segmentation foundation model, known for its accurate segmentation and more importantly, zero-shot generalization. SAM was trained on two-dimensional (2D) natural images; to adapt it for comprehensive cine CMR segmentation, we propose cineCMR-SAM which incorporates both temporal and spatial information through a modified model architecture. Compared to other state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, our model achieved superior data-specific model segmentation accuracy on the STACOM2011 when fine-tuned on this dataset and demonstrated superior zero-shot generalization on two other large public datasets (ACDC and M&Ms) unseen during fine-tuning. Additionally, we introduced a text prompt feature in cineCMR-SAM to specify the view type of input slices (short-axis or long-axis), enhancing performance across all view types.</p></details> | 10 pages, 3 figures |

The compositional nature of natural language enables the localization beyond predefined events, posing a certain challenge to the compositional generalizability of existing methods. Recent studies establish the correspondence between videos and queries through a decompose-reconstruct manner to achieve compositional generalization. However, they only consider dominant primitives and build negative queries through random sampling and recombination, resulting in semantically implausible negatives that hinder the models from learning rational compositions. In addition, recent DETR-based methods still underperform in compositional temporal grounding, showing irrational saliency responses when given negative queries that have subtle differences from positive queries. To address these limitations, we first propose a large language model-driven method for negative query construction, utilizing GPT-3.5-Turbo to generate semantically plausible hard negative queries. Subsequently, we introduce a coarse-to-fine saliency ranking strategy, which encourages the model to learn the multi-granularity semantic relationships between videos and hierarchical negative queries to boost compositional generalization. Extensive experiments on two challenging benchmarks validate the effectiveness and generalizability of our proposed method.

| **[Temporal Event Stereo via Joint Learning with Stereoscopic Flow](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10831v1)** | 2024-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Event cameras are dynamic vision sensors inspired by the biological retina, characterized by their high dynamic range, high temporal resolution, and low power consumption. These features make them capable of perceiving 3D environments even in extreme conditions. Event data is continuous across the time dimension, which allows a detailed description of each pixel's movements. To fully utilize the temporally dense and continuous nature of event cameras, we propose a novel temporal event stereo, a framework that continuously uses information from previous time steps. This is accomplished through the simultaneous training of an event stereo matching network alongside stereoscopic flow, a new concept that captures all pixel movements from stereo cameras. Since obtaining ground truth for optical flow during training is challenging, we propose a method that uses only disparity maps to train the stereoscopic flow. The performance of event-based stereo matching is enhanced by temporally aggregating information using the flows. We have achieved state-of-the-art performance on the MVSEC and the DSEC datasets. The method is computationally efficient, as it stacks previous information in a cascading manner.

Changes in the size, shape and movement of the chambers can be important markers for cardiac disease and modeling this in relation to clinical demography or disease is therefore of interest. Existing methods for spatio-temporal modeling of the human heart require shape correspondence over time or suffer from large memory requirements, making it difficult to use for complex anatomies. We introduce a novel conditional generative model, where the shape and movement is modeled implicitly in the form of a spatio-temporal neural distance field and conditioned on clinical demography. The model is based on an auto-decoder architecture and aims to disentangle the individual variations from that related to the clinical demography. It is tested on the left atrium (including the left atrial appendage), where it outperforms current state-of-the-art methods for anatomical sequence completion and generates synthetic sequences that realistically mimics the shape and motion of the real left atrium. In practice, this means we can infer functional measurements from a static image, generate synthetic populations with specified demography or disease and investigate how non-imaging clinical data effect the shape and motion of cardiac anatomies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for MICCAI2024</p></details> |
| **[Temporal Residual Guided Diffusion Framework for Event-Driven Video Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10636v1)** | 2024-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Event-based video reconstruction has garnered increasing attention due to its advantages, such as high dynamic range and rapid motion capture capabilities. However, current methods often prioritize the extraction of temporal information from continuous event flow, leading to an overemphasis on low-frequency texture features in the scene, resulting in over-smoothing and blurry artifacts. Addressing this challenge necessitates the integration of conditional information, encompassing temporal features, low-frequency texture, and high-frequency events, to guide the Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) in producing accurate and natural outputs. To tackle this issue, we introduce a novel approach, the Temporal Residual Guided Diffusion Framework, which effectively leverages both temporal and frequency-based event priors. Our framework incorporates three key conditioning modules: a pre-trained low-frequency intensity estimation module, a temporal recurrent encoder module, and an attention-based high-frequency prior enhancement module. In order to capture temporal scene variations from the events at the current moment, we employ a temporal-domain residual image as the target for the diffusion model. Through the combination of these three conditioning paths and the temporal residual framework, our framework excels in reconstructing high-quality videos from event flow, mitigating issues such as artifacts and over-smoothing commonly observed in previous approaches. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple benchmark datasets validate the superior performance of our framework compared to prior event-based reconstruction methods.</p></details> | Accepted by ECCV2024 |

However, estimating incidence or mortality rates associated with rare cancers presents important difficulties and poses new statistical methodological challenges. In this paper, we expand the collection of multivariate spatio-temporal models by introducing adaptable shared spatio-temporal components to enable a comprehensive analysis of both incidence and cancer mortality in rare cancer cases. These models allow the modulation of spatio-temporal effects between incidence and mortality, allowing for changes in their relationship over time. The new models have been implemented in INLA using r-generic constructions. We conduct a simulation study to evaluate the performance of the new spatio-temporal models. Our results show that multivariate spatio-temporal models incorporating a flexible shared spatio-temporal term outperform conventional multivariate spatio-temporal models that include specific spatio-temporal effects for each health outcome. We use these models to analyze incidence and mortality data for pancreatic cancer and leukaemia among males across 142 administrative health care districts of Great Britain over a span of nine biennial periods (2002-2019).</p></details> | 40 pages, 12 figures |

Cryptocurrencies are characterised by high market volatility and susceptibility to substantial crashes, issues that require temporal analysis methodologies able to tackle the high temporal resolution, heterogeneity and scale of blockchain data. While existing research attempts to analyse crash events, fundamental questions persist regarding the optimal time scale for analysis, differentiation between long-term and short-term trends, and the identification and characterisation of shock events within these decentralised systems. This paper addresses these issues by examining cryptocurrencies traded on the Ethereum blockchain, with a spotlight on the crash of the stablecoin TerraUSD and the currency LUNA designed to stabilise it. Utilising complex network analysis and a multi-layer temporal graph allows the study of the correlations between the layers representing the currencies and system evolution across diverse time scales. The investigation sheds light on the strong interconnections among stablecoins pre-crash and the significant post-crash transformations. We identify anomalous signals before, during, and after the collapse, emphasising their impact on graph structure metrics and user movement across layers. This paper pioneers temporal, cross-chain graph analysis to explore a cryptocurrency collapse. It emphasises the importance of temporal analysis for studies on web-derived data and how graph-based analysis can enhance traditional econometric results. Overall, this research carries implications beyond its field, for example for regulatory agencies aiming to safeguard users from shocks and monitor investment risks for citizens and clients.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Unifying Approach to Product Constructions for Quantitative Temporal Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10465v1)** | 2024-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Probabilistic programs are a powerful and convenient approach to formalise distributions over system executions. A classical verification problem for probabilistic programs is temporal inference: to compute the likelihood that the execution traces satisfy a given temporal property. This paper presents a general framework for temporal inference, which applies to a rich variety of quantitative models including those that arise in the operational semantics of probabilistic and weighted programs. The key idea underlying our framework is that in a variety of existing approaches, the main construction that enables temporal inference is that of a product between the system of interest and the temporal property. We provide a unifying mathematical definition of product constructions, enabled by the realisation that 1) both systems and temporal properties can be modelled as coalgebras and 2) product constructions are distributive laws in this context. Our categorical framework leads us to our main contribution: a sufficient condition for correctness, which is precisely what enables to use the product construction for temporal inference. We show that our framework can be instantiated to naturally recover a number of disparate approaches from the literature including, e.g., partial expected rewards in Markov reward models, resource-sensitive reachability analysis, and weighted optimization problems. Further, we demonstrate a product of weighted programs and weighted temporal properties as a new instance to show the scalability of our approach.</p></details> | Preprint |

Clinically, both individual static static and multivariate temporal data collected from ICU monitors play critical roles in short-term readmission prediction. Informative static and multivariate temporal feature representation capturing and fusion present challenges for accurate readmission prediction. Methods:We propose a novel static and multivariate-temporal attentive fusion transformer (SMTAFormer) to predict short-term readmission of ICU patients by fully leveraging the potential of demographic and dynamic temporal data. In SMTAFormer, we first apply an MLP network and a temporal transformer network to learn useful static and temporal feature representations, respectively. Then, the well-designed static and multivariate temporal feature fusion module is applied to fuse static and temporal feature representations by modeling intra-correlation among multivariate temporal features and constructing inter-correlation between static and multivariate temporal features. Results: We construct a readmission risk assessment (RRA) dataset based on the MIMIC-III dataset. The extensive experiments show that SMTAFormer outperforms advanced methods, in which the accuracy of our proposed method is up to 86.6%, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) is up to 0.717. Conclusion: Our proposed SMTAFormer can efficiently capture and fuse static and multivariate temporal feature representations. The results show that SMTAFormer significantly improves the short-term readmission prediction performance of ICU patients through comparisons to strong baselines.</p></details> |  |

By utilizing only a portion of IoV data instead of the entire dataset, the significant overheads associated with collecting and processing large amounts of data can be avoided. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework that utilizes sparse IoV data to achieve cost-effective TSE. Particularly, we propose a novel spatial-temporal attention model called the convolutional retentive network (CRNet) to improve the TSE accuracy by mining spatial-temporal traffic state correlations. The model employs the convolutional neural network (CNN) for spatial correlation aggregation and the retentive network (RetNet) based on the attention mechanism to extract temporal correlations. Extensive simulations on a real-world IoV dataset validate the advantage of the proposed TSE approach in achieving accurate TSE using sparse IoV data, demonstrating its cost effectiveness and practicality for real-world applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>need ...</summary><p>need further improvement</p></details> |

Accurate prediction of future network connectivity is essential for effective resource allocation in such environments. In this paper, we introduce the Spatial-Temporal Graph Encoder-Decoder (STGED) framework for Tactical Communication Networks that leverages both spatial and temporal features of network states to learn latent tactical behaviors effectively. STGED hierarchically utilizes graph-based attention mechanism to spatially encode a series of communication network states, leverages a recurrent neural network to temporally encode the evolution of states, and a fully-connected feed-forward network to decode the connectivity in the future state. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that STGED consistently outperforms baseline models by large margins across different time-steps input, achieving an accuracy of up to 99.2\% for the future state prediction task of tactical communication networks.</p></details> |  |

To address this limitation, this paper presents the spatio-temporal GraphFormer framework for 3D human pose estimation in video, which integrates body structure graph-based representations with spatio-temporal information. Specifically, we develop a spatio-temporal criss-cross graph (STG) attention mechanism. This approach is designed to learn the long-range dependencies in data across both time and space, integrating graph information directly into the respective attention layers. Furthermore, we introduce the dual-path modulated hop-wise regular GCN (MHR-GCN) module, which utilizes modulation to optimize parameter usage and employs spatio-temporal hop-wise skip connections to acquire higher-order information. Additionally, this module processes temporal and spatial dimensions independently to learn their respective features while avoiding mutual influence. Finally, we demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in 3D human pose estimation on the Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP datasets.</p></details> |  |

POPK: Mitigating Popularity Bias via a Temporal-Counterfactual](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09939v1)** | 2024-07-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In news recommendation systems, reducing popularity bias is essential for delivering accurate and diverse recommendations. This paper presents POPK, a new method that uses temporal-counterfactual analysis to mitigate the influence of popular news articles. By asking, "What if, at a given time $t$, a set of popular news articles were competing for the user's attention to be clicked?", POPK aims to improve recommendation accuracy and diversity. We tested POPK on three different language datasets (Japanese, English, and Norwegian) and found that it successfully enhances traditional methods. POPK offers flexibility for customization to enhance either accuracy or diversity, alongside providing distinct ways of measuring popularity. We argue that popular news articles always compete for attention, even if they are not explicitly present in the user's impression list. POPK systematically eliminates the implicit influence of popular news articles during each training step. We combine counterfactual reasoning with a temporal approach to adjust the negative sample space, refining understanding of user interests. Our findings underscore how POPK effectively enhances the accuracy and diversity of recommended articles while also tailoring the approach to specific needs.</p></details> |  |

These programs are being increasingly asked to provide forest parameter estimates for spatial and temporal extents smaller than their current design and accompanying design-based methods can deliver with desired levels of uncertainty. Many NFI designs and estimation methods focus on status and are not well equipped to provide acceptable estimates for trend and change parameters, especially over small spatial domains and/or short time periods. Fine-scale space-time indexed estimates are critical to a variety of environmental, ecological, and economic monitoring efforts. Estimates for forest carbon status, trend, and change are of particular importance to international initiatives to track carbon dynamics. Model-based small area estimation (SAE) methods for NFI and similar ecological monitoring data typically pursue inference on status within small spatial domains, with few demonstrated methods that account for spatio-temporal dependence needed for trend and change estimation. We propose a spatio-temporal Bayesian model framework that delivers statistically valid estimates with full uncertainty quantification for status, trend, and change. The framework accommodates a variety of space and time dependency structures, and we detail model configurations for different settings. Through analysis of simulated datasets, we compare the relative performance of candidate models and a traditional direct estimator. We then apply candidate models to a large-scale NFI dataset to demonstrate the utility of the proposed framework for providing unique quantification of forest carbon dynamics in the contiguous United States. We also provide computationally efficient algorithms, software, and data to reproduce our results and for benchmarking.</p></details> |  |
| **[TemporalStory: Enhancing Consistency in Story Visualization using Spatial-Temporal Attention](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09774v1)** | 2024-07-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Story visualization presents a challenging task in text-to-image generation, requiring not only the rendering of visual details from text prompt but also ensuring consistency across images. Recently, most approaches address inconsistency problem using an auto-regressive manner conditioned on previous image-sentence pairs. However, they overlook the fact that story context is dispersed across all sentences. The auto-regressive approach fails to encode information from susequent image-sentence pairs, thus unable to capture the entirety of the story context. To address this, we introduce TemporalStory, leveraging Spatial-Temporal attention to model complex spatial and temporal dependencies in images, enabling the generation of coherent images based on a given storyline. In order to better understand the storyline context, we introduce a text adapter capable of integrating information from other sentences into the embedding of the current sentence. Additionally, to utilize scene changes between story images as guidance for the model, we propose the StoryFlow Adapter to measure the degree of change between images. Through extensive experiments on two popular benchmarks, PororoSV and FlintstonesSV, our TemporalStory outperforms the previous state-of-the-art in both story visualization and story continuation tasks.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, to address the issue of low accuracy in long-term forecasting of spatial-temporal big data on traffic flow, we propose an innovative model called Spatial-Temporal Retentive Network (ST-RetNet). We extend the Retentive Network to address the task of traffic flow forecasting. At the spatial scale, we integrate a topological graph structure into Spatial Retentive Network(S-RetNet), utilizing an adaptive adjacency matrix to extract dynamic spatial features of the road network. We also employ Graph Convolutional Networks to extract static spatial features of the road network. These two components are then fused to capture dynamic and static spatial correlations. At the temporal scale, we propose the Temporal Retentive Network(T-RetNet), which has been demonstrated to excel in capturing long-term dependencies in traffic flow patterns compared to other time series models, including Recurrent Neural Networks based and transformer models. We achieve the spatial-temporal traffic flow forecasting task by integrating S-RetNet and T-RetNet to form ST-RetNet. Through experimental comparisons conducted on four real-world datasets, we demonstrate that ST-RetNet outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches in traffic flow forecasting.</p></details> |  |
| **[TASeg: Temporal Aggregation Network for LiDAR Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09751v1)** | 2024-07-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training deep models for LiDAR semantic segmentation is challenging due to the inherent sparsity of point clouds. Utilizing temporal data is a natural remedy against the sparsity problem as it makes the input signal denser. However, previous multi-frame fusion algorithms fall short in utilizing sufficient temporal information due to the memory constraint, and they also ignore the informative temporal images. To fully exploit rich information hidden in long-term temporal point clouds and images, we present the Temporal Aggregation Network, termed TASeg. Specifically, we propose a Temporal LiDAR Aggregation and Distillation (TLAD) algorithm, which leverages historical priors to assign different aggregation steps for different classes. It can largely reduce memory and time overhead while achieving higher accuracy. Besides, TLAD trains a teacher injected with gt priors to distill the model, further boosting the performance. To make full use of temporal images, we design a Temporal Image Aggregation and Fusion (TIAF) module, which can greatly expand the camera FOV and enhance the present features. Temporal LiDAR points in the camera FOV are used as mediums to transform temporal image features to the present coordinate for temporal multi-modal fusion. Moreover, we develop a Static-Moving Switch Augmentation (SMSA) algorithm, which utilizes sufficient temporal information to enable objects to switch their motion states freely, thus greatly increasing static and moving training samples. Our TASeg ranks 1st on three challenging tracks, i.e., SemanticKITTI single-scan track, multi-scan track and nuScenes LiDAR segmentation track, strongly demonstrating the superiority of our method.

| **[Rethinking temporal self-similarity for repetitive action counting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09431v1)** | 2024-07-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Counting repetitive actions in long untrimmed videos is a challenging task that has many applications such as rehabilitation. State-of-the-art methods predict action counts by first generating a temporal self-similarity matrix (TSM) from the sampled frames and then feeding the matrix to a predictor network. The self-similarity matrix, however, is not an optimal input to a network since it discards too much information from the frame-wise embeddings. We thus rethink how a TSM can be utilized for counting repetitive actions and propose a framework that learns embeddings and predicts action start probabilities at full temporal resolution. The number of repeated actions is then inferred from the action start probabilities. In contrast to current approaches that have the TSM as an intermediate representation, we propose a novel loss based on a generated reference TSM, which enforces that the self-similarity of the learned frame-wise embeddings is consistent with the self-similarity of repeated actions. The proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art results on three datasets, i.e., RepCount, UCFRep, and Countix.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICIP 2024</p></details> |

In this paper, we propose a complex temporal question-answering dataset Complex-TR that focuses on multi-answer and multi-hop temporal reasoning. Besides, we also propose a novel data augmentation strategy to improve the complex temporal reasoning capability and robustness of LLMs. We conducted experiments on multiple temporal QA datasets. Experimental results show that our method is able to improve LLMs' performance on temporal QA benchmarks by significant margins.

This work presents two contributions related to action segmentation on kinematic data. Firstly, we introduce two versions of Multi-Stage Temporal Convolutional Recurrent Networks (MS-TCRNet), specifically designed for kinematic data. The architectures consist of a prediction generator with intra-stage regularization and Bidirectional LSTM or GRU-based refinement stages. Secondly, we propose two new data augmentation techniques, World Frame Rotation and Hand Inversion, which utilize the strong geometric structure of kinematic data to improve algorithm performance and robustness. We evaluate our models on three datasets of surgical suturing tasks: the Variable Tissue Simulation (VTS) Dataset and the newly introduced Bowel Repair Simulation (BRS) Dataset, both of which are open surgery simulation datasets collected by us, as well as the JHU-ISI Gesture and Skill Assessment Working Set (JIGSAWS), a well-known benchmark in robotic surgery.

Recently, the diffusion models have shown compelling performance in generating realistic details for image restoration tasks. However, the diffusion process has randomness, making it hard to control the contents of restored images. This issue becomes more serious when applying diffusion models to VSR tasks because temporal consistency is crucial to the perceptual quality of videos. In this paper, we propose an effective real-world VSR algorithm by leveraging the strength of pre-trained latent diffusion models. To ensure the content consistency among adjacent frames, we exploit the temporal dynamics in LR videos to guide the diffusion process by optimizing the latent sampling path with a motion-guided loss, ensuring that the generated HR video maintains a coherent and continuous visual flow. To further mitigate the discontinuity of generated details, we insert temporal module to the decoder and fine-tune it with an innovative sequence-oriented loss. The proposed motion-guided latent diffusion (MGLD) based VSR algorithm achieves significantly better perceptual quality than state-of-the-arts on real-world VSR benchmark datasets, validating the effectiveness of the proposed model design and training strategies.</p></details> |  |

The restoration and enhancement have proven to be highly beneficial. However, there are only a limited number of enhancement methods explicitly designed for videos acquired in low-light conditions. We propose a Spatio-Temporal Aligned SUNet (STA-SUNet) model using a Swin Transformer as a backbone to capture low light video features and exploit their spatio-temporal correlations. The STA-SUNet model is trained on a novel, fully registered dataset (BVI), which comprises dynamic scenes captured under varying light conditions. It is further analysed comparatively against various other models over three test datasets. The model demonstrates superior adaptivity across all datasets, obtaining the highest PSNR and SSIM values. It is particularly effective in extreme low-light conditions, yielding fairly good visualisation results.</p></details> |  |

Most existing methods are tailored for individual forecasting or imputation tasks but are not designed for both. Additionally, they are less effective for zero-shot and few-shot learning. While large language models (LLMs) have exhibited strong pattern recognition and reasoning abilities across various tasks, including few-shot and zero-shot learning, their development in understanding spatial-temporal data has been constrained by insufficient modeling of complex correlations such as the temporal correlations, spatial connectivity, non-pairwise and high-order spatial-temporal correlations within data. In this paper, we propose STD-LLM for understanding both spatial and temporal properties of \underline{S}patial-\underline{T}emporal \underline{D}ata with \underline{LLM}s, which is capable of implementing both spatial-temporal forecasting and imputation tasks. STD-LLM understands spatial-temporal correlations via explicitly designed spatial and temporal tokenizers as well as virtual nodes. Topology-aware node embeddings are designed for LLMs to comprehend and exploit the topology structure of data. Additionally, to capture the non-pairwise and higher-order correlations, we design a hypergraph learning module for LLMs, which can enhance the overall performance and improve efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that STD-LLM exhibits strong performance and generalization capabilities across the forecasting and imputation tasks on various datasets. Moreover, STD-LLM achieves promising results on both few-shot and zero-shot learning tasks.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods often filter pseudo labels based on strict conditions, but they typically assess classification and localization quality separately, leading to suboptimal pseudo-label ranking and selection. In particular, there might be inaccurate pseudo labels within selected positives, alongside reliable counterparts erroneously assigned to negatives. To tackle these problems, we propose a novel Adaptive Pseudo-label Learning (APL) framework to facilitate better pseudo-label selection. Specifically, to improve the ranking quality, Adaptive Label Quality Assessment (ALQA) is proposed to jointly learn classification confidence and localization reliability, followed by dynamically selecting pseudo labels based on the joint score. Additionally, we propose an Instance-level Consistency Discriminator (ICD) for eliminating ambiguous positives and mining potential positives simultaneously based on inter-instance intrinsic consistency, thereby leading to a more precise selection. We further introduce a general unsupervised Action-aware Contrastive Pre-training (ACP) to enhance the discrimination both within actions and between actions and backgrounds, which benefits SS-TAL. Extensive experiments on THUMOS14 and ActivityNet v1.3 demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance under various semi-supervised settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ECCV 2024</p></details> |

Despite the promising results achieved by previous approaches, challenges persist in achieving temporally consistent animation and ensuring robustness with off-the-shelf pose detectors. In this paper, we present TCAN, a pose-driven human image animation method that is robust to erroneous poses and consistent over time. In contrast to previous methods, we utilize the pre-trained ControlNet without fine-tuning to leverage its extensive pre-acquired knowledge from numerous pose-image-caption pairs. To keep the ControlNet frozen, we adapt LoRA to the UNet layers, enabling the network to align the latent space between the pose and appearance features. Additionally, by introducing an additional temporal layer to the ControlNet, we enhance robustness against outliers of the pose detector. Through the analysis of attention maps over the temporal axis, we also designed a novel temperature map leveraging pose information, allowing for a more static background. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve promising results in video synthesis tasks encompassing various poses, like chibi.

Our approach is inspired by the recently proposed temporal computing, or race logic, which encodes data values as single delays, leading to significantly lower energy consumption due to minimized signal switching. However, race logic is limited in its applications due to inherent restrictions. The new HTC framework overcomes these limitations by encoding signals in both temporal and pulse rate formats for multiplication and in temporal format for propagation. This approach maintains reduced switch energy while being general enough to implement a wide range of arithmetic operations. We demonstrate how HTC multiplication is performed for both unipolar and bipolar data encoding and present the basic designs for multipliers, adders, and MAC units. Additionally, we implement two hardware accelerators: a Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filter and a Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT)/iDCT engine for image compression and DSP applications. Experimental results show that the HTC MAC has a significantly smaller power and area footprint compared to the Unary MAC design and is orders of magnitude faster. Compared to the CBSC MAC, the HTC MAC reduces power consumption by $45.2\%$ and area footprint by $50.13\%$. For the FIR design, the HTC design significantly outperforms the Unary design on all metrics. Compared to the CBSC design, the HTC-based FIR filter reduces power consumption by $36.61\%$ and area cost by $45.85\%$. The HTC-based DCT filter retains the quality of the original image with a decent PSNR, while consuming $23.34\%$ less power and occupying $18.20\%$ less area than the CBSC MAC-based DCT filter.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 8 figures and 3 tables</p></details> |

Latest WSTAL methods introduce pseudo label learning framework to bridge the gap between classification-based training and inferencing targets at localization, and achieve cutting-edge results. In these frameworks, a classification-based model is used to generate pseudo labels for a regression-based student model to learn from. However, the quality of pseudo labels in the framework, which is a key factor to the final result, is not carefully studied. In this paper, we propose a set of simple yet efficient pseudo label quality enhancement mechanisms to build our FuSTAL framework. FuSTAL enhances pseudo label quality at three stages: cross-video contrastive learning at proposal Generation-Stage, prior-based filtering at proposal Selection-Stage and EMA-based distillation at Training-Stage. These designs enhance pseudo label quality at different stages in the framework, and help produce more informative, less false and smoother action proposals. With the help of these comprehensive designs at all stages, FuSTAL achieves an average mAP of 50.8% on THUMOS'14, outperforming the previous best method by 1.2%, and becomes the first method to reach the milestone of 50%.</p></details> |  |

We frame constrained trajectory optimization as a novel form of constrained functional minimization over trajectory distributions, which avoids treating the constraints as a penalty in the objective and allows us to generate diverse sets of constraint-satisfying trajectories. Our method uses Stein Variational Gradient Descent (SVGD) to find a set of particles that approximates a distribution over low-cost trajectories while obeying constraints. CSVTO is applicable to problems with differentiable equality and inequality constraints and includes a novel particle re-sampling step to escape local minima. By explicitly generating diverse sets of trajectories, CSVTO is better able to avoid poor local minima and is more robust to initialization. We demonstrate that CSVTO outperforms baselines in challenging highly-constrained tasks, such as a 7DoF wrench manipulation task, where CSVTO outperforms all baselines both in success and constraint satisfaction.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 10 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

Biological knowledge suggests that it may be best to describe complex diseases at the level of underlying pathways, which may interact with one another. We propose a Bayesian approach that allows for characterising such correlation among different pathways through Dependent Gaussian Processes (DGP) and mapping the observed high-dimensional gene expression trajectories into unobserved low-dimensional pathway expression trajectories via Bayesian Sparse Factor Analysis. Our proposal is the first attempt to relax the classical assumption of independent factors for longitudinal data and has demonstrated a superior performance in recovering the shape of pathway expression trajectories, revealing the relationships between genes and pathways, and predicting gene expressions (closer point estimates and narrower predictive intervals), as demonstrated through simulations and real data analysis. To fit the model, we propose a Monte Carlo Expectation Maximization (MCEM) scheme that can be implemented conveniently by combining a standard Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampler and an R package GPFDA (Konzen and others, 2021), which returns the maximum likelihood estimates of DGP hyperparameters. The modular structure of MCEM makes it generalizable to other complex models involving the DGP model component. Our R package DGP4LCF that implements the proposed approach is available on CRAN.</p></details> |  |

However, configuring the skills' parameters for a specific task remains a manual and time-consuming endeavor. Existing approaches for learning or optimizing these parameters often require numerous real-world executions or do not work in dynamic environments. To address these challenges, we propose MuTT, a novel encoder-decoder transformer architecture designed to predict environment-aware executions of robot skills by integrating vision, trajectory, and robot skill parameters. Notably, we pioneer the fusion of vision and trajectory, introducing a novel trajectory projection. Furthermore, we illustrate MuTT's efficacy as a predictor when combined with a model-based robot skill optimizer. This approach facilitates the optimization of robot skill parameters for the current environment, without the need for real-world executions during optimization. Designed for compatibility with any representation of robot skills, MuTT demonstrates its versatility across three comprehensive experiments, showcasing superior performance across two different skill representations.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose a holistic framework that jointly optimizes the total latency and energy consumption for UAV-assisted fog computing in a three-dimensional spatial domain with varying terrain elevations and dynamic task generations. Our proposed framework considers three important and interdependent modules: attitude control, trajectory planning, and task assignment. We first establish a fuzzy proportional-integral-derivative control model to determine the UAV's attitude. Then, we propose an enhanced Ant Colony System (ACS) based algorithm, that includes a safety value and a decoupling mechanism to overcome the convergence issue in classical ACS, to compute the optimal UAV trajectory. Finally, we design an algorithm based on the Particle Swarm Optimization technique, to determine where each offloaded task should be executed. Under our proposed framework, the outcome of one module would affect the decision-making in one other, providing a holistic perspective of the system and thus leading to improved solutions. We demonstrate by extensive simulation results that our proposed framework can significantly improve the overall performance, measured by latency and energy consumption, compared to existing baseline approaches.</p></details> | 14 pages, 10 figures |

Some leading methods in this domain prioritize long-range matching, involving the unrolling of training trajectories with a fixed number of steps (NS) on the synthetic dataset to align with various expert training trajectories. However, traditional long-range matching methods possess an overfitting-like problem, the fixed step size NS forces synthetic dataset to distortedly conform seen expert training trajectories, resulting in a loss of generality-especially to those from unencountered architecture. We refer to this as the Accumulated Mismatching Problem (AMP), and propose a new approach, Automatic Training Trajectories (ATT), which dynamically and adaptively adjusts trajectory length NS to address the AMP. Our method outperforms existing methods particularly in tests involving cross-architectures. Moreover, owing to its adaptive nature, it exhibits enhanced stability in the face of parameter variations.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper is accepted at ECCV 2024</p></details> |

The survey progresses to detail the leading algorithms for measuring vessel trajectory similarity and the main clustering techniques used in the field today. Furthermore, the various applications of trajectory clustering within the maritime context are explored. Finally, the paper evaluates the effectiveness of different algorithm combinations and pre-processing methods through experimental analysis, focusing on their impact on the performance of distance-based trajectory clustering algorithms. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of various trajectory clustering algorithms and notably highlight the significant improvements that trajectory compression techniques contribute to the efficiency and accuracy of trajectory clustering.

| **[Risk-Aware Vehicle Trajectory Prediction Under Safety-Critical Scenarios](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13480v1)** | 2024-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction is significant for intelligent vehicles to achieve high-level autonomous driving, and a lot of relevant research achievements have been made recently. Despite the rapid development, most existing studies solely focused on normal safe scenarios while largely neglecting safety-critical scenarios, particularly those involving imminent collisions. This oversight may result in autonomous vehicles lacking the essential predictive ability in such situations, posing a significant threat to safety. To tackle these, this paper proposes a risk-aware trajectory prediction framework tailored to safety-critical scenarios. Leveraging distinctive hazardous features, we develop three core risk-aware components. First, we introduce a risk-incorporated scene encoder, which augments conventional encoders with quantitative risk information to achieve risk-aware encoding of hazardous scene contexts. Next, we incorporate endpoint-risk-combined intention queries as prediction priors in the decoder to ensure that the predicted multimodal trajectories cover both various spatial intentions and risk levels. Lastly, an auxiliary risk prediction task is implemented for the ultimate risk-aware prediction. Furthermore, to support model training and performance evaluation, we introduce a safety-critical trajectory prediction dataset and tailored evaluation metrics. We conduct comprehensive evaluations and compare our model with several SOTA models. Results demonstrate the superior performance of our model, with a significant improvement in most metrics. This prediction advancement enables autonomous vehicles to execute correct collision avoidance maneuvers under safety-critical scenarios, eventually enhancing road traffic safety.</p></details> |  |

However, the development and ranking of state-of-the-art (SotA) models are driven by their In-Distribution (ID) performance on individual competition datasets. We present an OoD testing protocol that homogenizes datasets and prediction tasks across two large-scale motion datasets. We introduce a novel prediction algorithm based on polynomial representations for agent trajectory and road geometry on both the input and output sides of the model. With a much smaller model size, training effort, and inference time, we reach near SotA performance for ID testing and significantly improve robustness in OoD testing. Within our OoD testing protocol, we further study two augmentation strategies of SotA models and their effects on model generalization. Highlighting the contrast between ID and OoD performance, we suggest adding OoD testing to the evaluation criteria of trajectory prediction models.</p></details> |  |

It's a way of generating a smooth and feasible path for the robot to follow over time. The process primarily takes several factors to generate the path, such as velocity, acceleration and jerk. The process deals with how the robot can follow a desired motion path in a suitable environment. This trajectory planning is extensively used in Automobile Industrial Robot, Manipulators, and Mobile Robots. Trajectory planning is a fundamental component of motion control systems. To perform tasks like pick and place operations, assembly, welding, painting, path following, and obstacle avoidance. This paper introduces a comparative analysis of trajectory planning algorithms and their key software elements working strategy in complex and dynamic environments. Adaptability and real-time analysis are the most common problems in trajectory planning. The paper primarily focuses on getting a better understanding of these unpredictable environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deterministic Trajectory Optimization through Probabilistic Optimal Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13316v1)** | 2024-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This article proposes two new algorithms tailored to discrete-time deterministic finite-horizon nonlinear optimal control problems or so-called trajectory optimization problems. Both algorithms are inspired by a novel theoretical paradigm known as probabilistic optimal control, that reformulates optimal control as an equivalent probabilistic inference problem. This perspective allows to address the problem using the Expectation-Maximization algorithm. We show that the application of this algorithm results in a fixed point iteration of probabilistic policies that converge to the deterministic optimal policy. Two strategies for policy evaluation are discussed, using state-of-the-art uncertainty quantification methods resulting into two distinct algorithms. The algorithms are structurally closest related to the differential dynamic programming algorithm and related methods that use sigma-point methods to avoid direct gradient evaluations. The main advantage of our work is an improved balance between exploration and exploitation over the iterations, leading to improved numerical stability and accelerated convergence. These properties are demonstrated on different nonlinear systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory Planning Using Tire Thermodynamics for Automated Drifting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12989v1)** | 2024-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated vehicles need to estimate tire-road friction information, as it plays a key role in safe trajectory planning and vehicle dynamics control. Notably, friction is not solely dependent on road surface conditions, but also varies significantly depending on the tire temperature. However, tire parameters such as the friction coefficient have been conventionally treated as constant values in automated vehicle motion planning. This paper develops a simple thermodynamic model that captures tire friction temperature variation. To verify the model, it is implemented into trajectory planning for automated drifting - a challenging application that requires leveraging an unstable, drifting equilibrium at the friction limits. The proposed method which captures the hidden tire dynamics provides a dynamically feasible trajectory, leading to more precise tracking during experiments with an LQR (Linear Quadratic Regulator) controller.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This manuscript was accepted from IEEE Intelligent Vehicle Symposium (IV 2024) and will be published late August</p></details> |
| **[Forward Invariance in Trajectory Spaces for Safety-critical Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12624v1)** | 2024-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Useful robot control algorithms should not only achieve performance objectives but also adhere to hard safety constraints. Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) have been developed to provably ensure system safety through forward invariance. However, they often unnecessarily sacrifice performance for safety since they are purely reactive. Receding horizon control (RHC), on the other hand, consider planned trajectories to account for the future evolution of a system. This work provides a new perspective on safety-critical control by introducing Forward Invariance in Trajectory Spaces (FITS). We lift the problem of safe RHC into the trajectory space and describe the evolution of planned trajectories as a controlled dynamical system. Safety constraints defined over states can be converted into sets in the trajectory space which we render forward invariant via a CBF framework. We derive an efficient quadratic program (QP) to synthesize trajectories that provably satisfy safety constraints. Our experiments support that FITS improves the adherence to safety specifications without sacrificing performance over alternative CBF and NMPC methods.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 figures |

It is common to map trajectories to vectors, called embeddings, before subsequent analyses. Thus, the qualities of embeddings are very important. Methods for pre-training embeddings, which leverage unlabeled trajectories for training universal embeddings, have shown promising applicability across different tasks, thus attracting considerable interest. However, research progress on this topic faces two key challenges: a lack of a comprehensive overview of existing methods, resulting in several related methods not being well-recognized, and the absence of a unified pipeline, complicating the development new methods and the analysis of methods. To overcome these obstacles and advance the field of pre-training of trajectory embeddings, we present UniTE, a survey and a unified pipeline for this domain. In doing so, we present a comprehensive list of existing methods for pre-training trajectory embeddings, which includes methods that either explicitly or implicitly employ pre-training techniques. Further, we present a unified and modular pipeline with publicly available underlying code, simplifying the process of constructing and evaluating methods for pre-training trajectory embeddings. Additionally, we contribute a selection of experimental results using the proposed pipeline on real-world datasets.</p></details> |  |

Established trajectory prediction methods primarily use agent tracks generated by a detection and tracking system and HD map as inputs. In this work, we propose a novel method that also incorporates visual input from surround-view cameras, allowing the model to utilize visual cues such as human gazes and gestures, road conditions, vehicle turn signals, etc, which are typically hidden from the model in prior methods. Furthermore, we use textual descriptions generated by a Vision-Language Model (VLM) and refined by a Large Language Model (LLM) as supervision during training to guide the model on what to learn from the input data. Despite using these extra inputs, our method achieves a latency of 53 ms, making it feasible for real-time processing, which is significantly faster than that of previous single-agent prediction methods with similar performance. Our experiments show that both the visual inputs and the textual descriptions contribute to improvements in trajectory prediction performance, and our qualitative analysis highlights how the model is able to exploit these additional inputs. Lastly, in this work we create and release the nuScenes-Text dataset, which augments the established nuScenes dataset with rich textual annotations for every scene, demonstrating the positive impact of utilizing VLM on trajectory prediction.

| **[Multi-Agent Probabilistic Ensembles with Trajectory Sampling for Connected Autonomous Vehicles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13910v3)** | 2024-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) have attracted significant attention in recent years and Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown remarkable performance in improving the autonomy of vehicles. In that regard, the widely adopted Model-Free RL (MFRL) promises to solve decision-making tasks in connected AVs (CAVs), contingent on the readiness of a significant amount of data samples for training. Nevertheless, it might be infeasible in practice and possibly lead to learning instability. In contrast, Model-Based RL (MBRL) manifests itself in sample-efficient learning, but the asymptotic performance of MBRL might lag behind the state-of-the-art MFRL algorithms. Furthermore, most studies for CAVs are limited to the decision-making of a single AV only, thus underscoring the performance due to the absence of communications. In this study, we try to address the decision-making problem of multiple CAVs with limited communications and propose a decentralized Multi-Agent Probabilistic Ensembles with Trajectory Sampling algorithm MA-PETS. In particular, in order to better capture the uncertainty of the unknown environment, MA-PETS leverages Probabilistic Ensemble (PE) neural networks to learn from communicated samples among neighboring CAVs. Afterwards, MA-PETS capably develops Trajectory Sampling (TS)-based model-predictive control for decision-making. On this basis, we derive the multi-agent group regret bound affected by the number of agents within the communication range and mathematically validate that incorporating effective information exchange among agents into the multi-agent learning scheme contributes to reducing the group regret bound in the worst case. Finally, we empirically demonstrate the superiority of MA-PETS in terms of the sample efficiency comparable to MFBL.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory and Power Optimization for Multi-UAV Enabled Emergency Wireless Communications Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11896v1)** | 2024-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) has attracted much attention due to its flexible deployment and controllable mobility. As the general communication network cannot meet the emergency requirements, in this paper we study the multi-UAV enabled wireless emergency communication system. Our goal is to maximize the capacity with jointly optimizing trajectory and allocating power. To tackle this non-convex optimization problem, we first decompose it into two sub-problems to optimize the trajectory and power allocation, respectively. Then, we propose the successive convex approximation technique and the block coordinate update algorithm to solve the two subproblems. The approximate optimal solution can be obtained after continuous iterations. Simulation results show that the capacity can be greatly increased using our proposed joint trajectory optimization and power allocation.</p></details> | 6 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Progressive Pretext Task Learning for Human Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11588v1)** | 2024-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human trajectory prediction is a practical task of predicting the future positions of pedestrians on the road, which typically covers all temporal ranges from short-term to long-term within a trajectory. However, existing works attempt to address the entire trajectory prediction with a singular, uniform training paradigm, neglecting the distinction between short-term and long-term dynamics in human trajectories. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a novel Progressive Pretext Task learning (PPT) framework, which progressively enhances the model's capacity of capturing short-term dynamics and long-term dependencies for the final entire trajectory prediction. Specifically, we elaborately design three stages of training tasks in the PPT framework. In the first stage, the model learns to comprehend the short-term dynamics through a stepwise next-position prediction task. In the second stage, the model is further enhanced to understand long-term dependencies through a destination prediction task. In the final stage, the model aims to address the entire future trajectory task by taking full advantage of the knowledge from previous stages. To alleviate the knowledge forgetting, we further apply a cross-task knowledge distillation. Additionally, we design a Transformer-based trajectory predictor, which is able to achieve highly efficient two-step reasoning by integrating a destination-driven prediction strategy and a group of learnable prompt embeddings. Extensive experiments on popular benchmarks have demonstrated that our proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance with high efficiency.

By leveraging natural language processing techniques, this study introduces the Scientific Concept Navigator (SciConNav), an embedding-based navigation model to infer the "knowledge pathway" from the research trajectories of millions of scholars. We validate that the learned representations effectively delineate disciplinary boundaries and capture the intricate relationships between diverse concepts. The utility of the inferred navigation space is showcased through multiple applications. Firstly, we demonstrated the multi-step analogy inferences within the knowledge space and the interconnectivity between concepts in different disciplines. Secondly, we formulated the attribute dimensions of knowledge across domains, observing the distributional shifts in the arrangement of 19 disciplines along these conceptual dimensions, including "Theoretical" to "Applied", and "Chemical" to "Biomedical', highlighting the evolution of functional attributes within knowledge domains. Lastly, by analyzing the high-dimensional knowledge network structure, we found that knowledge connects with shorter global pathways, and interdisciplinary knowledge plays a critical role in the accessibility of the global knowledge network. Our framework offers a novel approach to mining knowledge inheritance pathways in extensive scientific literature, which is of great significance for understanding scientific progression patterns, tailoring scientific learning trajectories, and accelerating scientific progress.</p></details> | <details><summary>21pag...</summary><p>21pages, 13 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |

Recent methods predict sub-goals on constructed topology map at each step to enable long-term action planning. However, they suffer from high computational cost when attempting to support such high-level predictions with GCN-like models. In this work, we propose an alternative method that facilitates navigation planning by considering the alignment between instructions and directed fidelity trajectories, which refers to a path from the initial node to the candidate locations on a directed graph without detours. This planning strategy leads to an efficient model while achieving strong performance. Specifically, we introduce a directed graph to illustrate the explored area of the environment, emphasizing directionality. Then, we firstly define the trajectory representation as a sequence of directed edge features, which are extracted from the panorama based on the corresponding orientation. Ultimately, we assess and compare the alignment between instruction and different trajectories during navigation to determine the next navigation target. Our method outperforms previous SOTA method BEVBert on RxR dataset and is comparable on R2R dataset while largely reducing the computational cost.

Specifically, RetailOpt first uses inertial navigation to recover relative trajectories from smartphone motion data. The store map and purchase records are cross-referenced to identify a list of visited shelves, providing anchors to localize the relative trajectories in a store through continuous and discrete optimization. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our system in five diverse environments. The system, if successful, would produce accurate customer movement data, essential for a broad range of retail applications including customer behavior analysis and in-store navigation.</p></details> |  |

As opposed to many existing control strategies, which do not consider spatial constraints, the proposed strategy considers spatial constraints on each degree of freedom movement of the UAV. Such consideration makes the design appealing for many practical applications, such as pipeline inspection, boundary tracking, etc. The proposed design accounts for the limited information about the inertia matrix, thereby affirming its inherent robustness against unmodeled dynamics and other imperfections. We rigorously show that the UAV will converge to its desired path by maintaining bounded position, orientation, and linear and angular speeds. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy through various numerical simulations.</p></details> |  |

Motivated by the pivotal role trajectory length plays in the training process, we introduce Ada-NAV, a novel adaptive trajectory length scheme designed to enhance the training sample efficiency of RL algorithms in robotic navigation tasks. Unlike traditional approaches that treat trajectory length as a fixed hyperparameter, we propose to dynamically adjust it based on the entropy of the underlying navigation policy. Interestingly, Ada-NAV can be applied to both existing on-policy and off-policy RL methods, which we demonstrate by empirically validating its efficacy on three popular RL methods: REINFORCE, Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), and Soft Actor-Critic (SAC). We demonstrate through simulated and real-world robotic experiments that Ada-NAV outperforms conventional methods that employ constant or randomly sampled trajectory lengths. Specifically, for a fixed sample budget, Ada-NAV achieves an 18\% increase in navigation success rate, a 20-38\% reduction in navigation path length, and a 9.32\% decrease in elevation costs. Furthermore, we showcase the versatility of Ada-NAV by integrating it with the Clearpath Husky robot, illustrating its applicability in complex outdoor environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 9 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

Strengthening attacks and uncovering vulnerabilities, especially common issues in VLP models (e.g., high transferable AEs), can advance reliable and practical VLP models. A recent work (i.e., Set-level guidance attack) indicates that augmenting image-text pairs to increase AE diversity along the optimization path enhances the transferability of adversarial examples significantly. However, this approach predominantly emphasizes diversity around the online adversarial examples (i.e., AEs in the optimization period), leading to the risk of overfitting the victim model and affecting the transferability. In this study, we posit that the diversity of adversarial examples towards the clean input and online AEs are both pivotal for enhancing transferability across VLP models. Consequently, we propose using diversification along the intersection region of adversarial trajectory to expand the diversity of AEs. To fully leverage the interaction between modalities, we introduce text-guided adversarial example selection during optimization. Furthermore, to further mitigate the potential overfitting, we direct the adversarial text deviating from the last intersection region along the optimization path, rather than adversarial images as in existing methods. Extensive experiments affirm the effectiveness of our method in improving transferability across various VLP models and downstream vision-and-language tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>ECCV2...</summary><p>ECCV2024.

This paper aims to achieve safe flight of OMAVs in cluttered environments. Considering existing static obstacles, an efficient optimization-based framework is proposed to generate 6-D $SE(3)$ trajectories for OMAVs. Given the kinodynamic constraints and the 3D collision-free region represented by a series of intersecting convex polyhedra, the proposed method finally generates a safe and dynamically feasible 6-D trajectory. First, we parameterize the vehicle's attitude into a free 3D vector using stereographic projection to eliminate the constraints inherent in the $SO(3)$ manifold, while the complete $SE(3)$ trajectory is represented as a 6-D polynomial in time without inherent constraints. The vehicle's shape is modeled as a cuboid attached to the body frame to achieve whole-body collision evaluation. Then, we formulate the origin trajectory generation problem as a constrained optimization problem. The original constrained problem is finally transformed into an unconstrained one that can be solved efficiently. To verify the proposed framework's performance, simulations and real-world experiments based on a tilt-rotor hexarotor aerial vehicle are carried out.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication.

| **[Towards Personalised Patient Risk Prediction Using Temporal Hospital Data Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09373v1)** | 2024-07-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantifying a patient's health status provides clinicians with insight into patient risk, and the ability to better triage and manage resources. Early Warning Scores (EWS) are widely deployed to measure overall health status, and risk of adverse outcomes, in hospital patients. However, current EWS are limited both by their lack of personalisation and use of static observations. We propose a pipeline that groups intensive care unit patients by the trajectories of observations data throughout their stay as a basis for the development of personalised risk predictions. Feature importance is considered to provide model explainability. Using the MIMIC-IV dataset, six clusters were identified, capturing differences in disease codes, observations, lengths of admissions and outcomes. Applying the pipeline to data from just the first four hours of each ICU stay assigns the majority of patients to the same cluster as when the entire stay duration is considered. In-hospital mortality prediction models trained on individual clusters had higher F1 score performance in five of the six clusters when compared against the unclustered patient cohort. The pipeline could form the basis of a clinical decision support tool, working to improve the clinical characterisation of risk groups and the early detection of patient deterioration.</p></details> |  |

Location-Based Services (LBS) capitalize on this trajectory data to offer users personalized services tailored to their location information. However, this trajectory data contains sensitive information about users' movement patterns and habits, necessitating confidentiality and protection from unknown collectors. To address this challenge, privacy-preserving methods like K-anonymity and Differential Privacy have been proposed to safeguard private information in the dataset. Despite their effectiveness, these methods can impact the original features by introducing perturbations or generating unrealistic trajectory data, leading to suboptimal performance in downstream tasks. To overcome these limitations, we propose a Federated Variational AutoEncoder (FedVAE) approach, which effectively generates a new trajectory dataset while preserving the confidentiality of private information and retaining the structure of the original features. In addition, FedVAE leverages Variational AutoEncoder (VAE) to maintain the original feature space and generate new trajectory data, and incorporates Federated Learning (FL) during the training stage, ensuring that users' data remains locally stored to protect their personal information. The results demonstrate its superior performance compared to other existing methods, affirming FedVAE as a promising solution for enhancing data privacy and utility in location-based applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>2023 ...</summary><p>2023 IEEE 98th Vehicular Technology Conference</p></details> |
| **[Any-point Trajectory Modeling for Policy Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00025v3)** | 2024-07-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning from demonstration is a powerful method for teaching robots new skills, and having more demonstration data often improves policy learning. However, the high cost of collecting demonstration data is a significant bottleneck. Videos, as a rich data source, contain knowledge of behaviors, physics, and semantics, but extracting control-specific information from them is challenging due to the lack of action labels. In this work, we introduce a novel framework, Any-point Trajectory Modeling (ATM), that utilizes video demonstrations by pre-training a trajectory model to predict future trajectories of arbitrary points within a video frame. Once trained, these trajectories provide detailed control guidance, enabling the learning of robust visuomotor policies with minimal action-labeled data. Across over 130 language-conditioned tasks we evaluated in both simulation and the real world, ATM outperforms strong video pre-training baselines by 80% on average. Furthermore, we show effective transfer learning of manipulation skills from human videos and videos from a different robot morphology.

A novel energy function optimization-based framework is proposed to generate prediction trajectories. Firstly, a new energy function is designed for easier optimization. Secondly, an online optimization pipeline for calculating parameters and agents' velocities is developed. In this pipeline, we first design an efficient group division method based on Frechet distance to classify agents online. Then the strategy on decoupling the optimization of velocities and critical parameters in the energy function is developed, where the the slap swarm algorithm and gradient descent algorithms are integrated to solve the optimization problems more efficiently. Thirdly, we propose a similarity-based resample evaluation algorithm to predict agents' optimal goals, defined as the target-moving headings of agents, which effectively extracts hidden information in observed states and avoids learning agents' destinations via the training dataset in advance. Experiments and comparison studies verify the advantages of the proposed method in terms of prediction accuracy and speed.</p></details> |  |
| **[ImageFlowNet: Forecasting Multiscale Trajectories of Disease Progression with Irregularly-Sampled Longitudinal Medical Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14794v3)** | 2024-07-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The forecasting of disease progression from images is a holy grail for clinical decision making. However, this task is complicated by the inherent high dimensionality, temporal sparsity and sampling irregularity in longitudinal image acquisitions. Existing methods often rely on extracting hand-crafted features and performing time-series analysis in this vector space, leading to a loss of rich spatial information within the images. To overcome these challenges, we introduce ImageFlowNet, a novel framework that learns latent-space flow fields that evolve multiscale representations in joint embedding spaces using neural ODEs and SDEs to model disease progression in the image domain. Notably, ImageFlowNet learns multiscale joint representation spaces by combining cohorts of patients together so that information can be transferred between the patient samples. The dynamics then provide plausible trajectories of progression, with the SDE providing alternative trajectories from the same starting point. We provide theoretical insights that support our formulation of ODEs, and motivate our regularizations involving high-level visual features, latent space organization, and trajectory smoothness. We then demonstrate ImageFlowNet's effectiveness through empirical evaluations on three longitudinal medical image datasets depicting progression in retinal geographic atrophy, multiple sclerosis, and glioblastoma.</p></details> | <details><summary>Fixed...</summary><p>Fixed some typos.

| **[Adaptive Human Trajectory Prediction via Latent Corridors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06653v2)** | 2024-07-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human trajectory prediction is typically posed as a zero-shot generalization problem: a predictor is learnt on a dataset of human motion in training scenes, and then deployed on unseen test scenes. While this paradigm has yielded tremendous progress, it fundamentally assumes that trends in human behavior within the deployment scene are constant over time. As such, current prediction models are unable to adapt to scene-specific transient human behaviors, such as crowds temporarily gathering to see buskers, pedestrians hurrying through the rain and avoiding puddles, or a protest breaking out. We formalize the problem of scene-specific adaptive trajectory prediction and propose a new adaptation approach inspired by prompt tuning called latent corridors. By augmenting the input of any pre-trained human trajectory predictor with learnable image prompts, the predictor can improve in the deployment scene by inferring trends from extremely small amounts of new data (e.g., 2 humans observed for 30 seconds). With less than 0.1% additional model parameters, we see up to 23.9% ADE improvement in MOTSynth simulated data and 16.4% ADE in MOT and Wildtrack real pedestrian data. Qualitatively, we observe that latent corridors imbue predictors with an awareness of scene geometry and scene-specific human behaviors that non-adaptive predictors struggle to capture.

| **[Using iterated local alignment to aggregate trajectory data into a traffic flow map](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17500v2)** | 2024-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Desire line maps are widely deployed for traffic flow analysis by virtue of their ease of interpretation and computation. They can be considered to be simplified traffic flow maps, whereas the computational challenges in aggregating small scale traffic flows prevent the wider dissemination of high resolution flow maps. Vehicle trajectories are a promising data source to solve this challenging problem. The solution begins with the alignment (or map matching) of the trajectories to the road network. However even the state-of-the-art map matching implementations produce sub-optimal results with small misalignments. While these misalignments are negligible for large scale flow aggregation in desire line maps, they pose substantial obstacles for small scale flow aggregation in high resolution maps. To remove these remaining misalignments, we introduce innovative local alignment algorithms, where we infer road segments to serve as local reference segments, and proceed to align nearby road segments to them. With each local alignment iteration, the misalignments of the trajectories with each other and with the road network are reduced, and so converge closer to a minimal flow map. By analysing a set of empirical trajectories collected in Hannover, Germany, we confirm that our minimal flow map has high levels of spatial resolution, accuracy and coverage.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Path Long-Term Vessel Trajectories Forecasting with Probabilistic Feature Fusion for Problem Shifting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18948v6)** | 2024-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper addresses the challenge of boosting the precision of multi-path long-term vessel trajectory forecasting on engineered sequences of Automatic Identification System (AIS) data using feature fusion for problem shifting. We have developed a deep auto-encoder model and a phased framework approach to predict the next 12 hours of vessel trajectories using 1 to 3 hours of AIS data as input. To this end, we fuse the spatiotemporal features from the AIS messages with probabilistic features engineered from historical AIS data referring to potential routes and destinations. As a result, we reduce the forecasting uncertainty by shifting the problem into a trajectory reconstruction problem. The probabilistic features have an F1-Score of approximately 85% and 75% for the vessel route and destination prediction, respectively. Under such circumstances, we achieved an R2 Score of over 98% with different layer structures and varying feature combinations; the high R2 Score is a natural outcome of the well-defined shipping lanes in the study region. However, our proposal stands out among competing approaches as it demonstrates the capability of complex decision-making during turnings and route selection. Furthermore, we have shown that our model achieves more accurate forecasting with average and median errors of 11km and 6km, respectively, a 25% improvement from the current state-of-the-art approaches. The resulting model from this proposal is deployed as part of a broader Decision Support System to safeguard whales by preventing the risk of vessel-whale collisions under the smartWhales initiative and acting on the Gulf of St. Lawrence in Atlantic Canada.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trial and Error: Exploration-Based Trajectory Optimization for LLM Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02502v2)** | 2024-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have become integral components in various autonomous agent systems. In this study, we present an exploration-based trajectory optimization approach, referred to as ETO. This learning method is designed to enhance the performance of open LLM agents. Contrary to previous studies that exclusively train on successful expert trajectories, our method allows agents to learn from their exploration failures. This leads to improved performance through an iterative optimization framework. During the exploration phase, the agent interacts with the environment while completing given tasks, gathering failure trajectories to create contrastive trajectory pairs. In the subsequent training phase, the agent utilizes these trajectory preference pairs to update its policy using contrastive learning methods like DPO. This iterative cycle of exploration and training fosters continued improvement in the agents. Our experiments on three complex tasks demonstrate that ETO consistently surpasses baseline performance by a large margin. Furthermore, an examination of task-solving efficiency and potential in scenarios lacking expert trajectory underscores the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACL 2024 Main Conference; Camera Ready</p></details> |

The modeling of the behavior of the vehicle in these events is crucial to proper planning and controlling; the used model should present accurate and computationally efficient properties to ensure consistency with the dynamics of the vehicle and to be employed in real-time systems. In this article, we propose an LSTM-based hybrid extended bicycle model able to present an accurate description of the state of the vehicle for both normal and aggressive situations. The introduced model is used in a Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) plan and control framework for performing trajectories in high-dynamic scenarios. The proposed model and framework prove their ability to plan feasible trajectories ensuring an accurate vehicle behavior even at the limits of handling.</p></details> |  |
| **[CATP: Context-Aware Trajectory Prediction with Competition Symbiosis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07328v1)** | 2024-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contextual information is vital for accurate trajectory prediction. For instance, the intricate flying behavior of migratory birds hinges on their analysis of environmental cues such as wind direction and air pressure. However, the diverse and dynamic nature of contextual information renders it an arduous task for AI models to comprehend its impact on trajectories and consequently predict them accurately. To address this issue, we propose a ``manager-worker'' framework to unleash the full potential of contextual information and construct CATP model, an implementation of the framework for Context-Aware Trajectory Prediction. The framework comprises a manager model, several worker models, and a tailored training mechanism inspired by competition symbiosis in nature. Taking CATP as an example, each worker needs to compete against others for training data and develop an advantage in predicting specific moving patterns. The manager learns the workers' performance in different contexts and selects the best one in the given context to predict trajectories, enabling CATP as a whole to operate in a symbiotic manner. We conducted two comparative experiments and an ablation study to quantitatively evaluate the proposed framework and CATP model. The results showed that CATP could outperform SOTA models, and the framework could be generalized to different context-aware tasks.</p></details> |  |

| **[What's Wrong with the Absolute Trajectory Error?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.05376v4)** | 2024-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One of the limitations of the commonly used Absolute Trajectory Error (ATE) is that it is highly sensitive to outliers. As a result, in the presence of just a few outliers, it often fails to reflect the varying accuracy as the inlier trajectory error or the number of outliers varies. In this work, we propose an alternative error metric for evaluating the accuracy of the reconstructed camera trajectory. Our metric, named Discernible Trajectory Error (DTE), is computed in five steps: (1) Shift the ground-truth and estimated trajectories such that both of their geometric medians are located at the origin. (2) Rotate the estimated trajectory such that it minimizes the sum of geodesic distances between the corresponding camera orientations. (3) Scale the estimated trajectory such that the median distance of the cameras to their geometric median is the same as that of the ground truth. (4) Compute, winsorize and normalize the distances between the corresponding cameras. (5) Obtain the DTE by taking the average of the mean and the root-mean-square (RMS) of the resulting distances. This metric is an attractive alternative to the ATE, in that it is capable of discerning the varying trajectory accuracy as the inlier trajectory error or the number of outliers varies. Using the similar idea, we also propose a novel rotation error metric, named Discernible Rotation Error (DRE), which has similar advantages to the DTE. Furthermore, we propose a simple yet effective method for calibrating the camera-to-marker rotation, which is needed for the computation of our metrics. Our methods are verified through extensive simulations.</p></details> |  |

This paper presents the Human-Like Trajectory Prediction model (HLTP++), which emulates human cognitive processes to improve trajectory prediction in AD. HLTP++ incorporates a novel teacher-student knowledge distillation framework. The "teacher" model equipped with an adaptive visual sector, mimics the dynamic allocation of attention human drivers exhibit based on factors like spatial orientation, proximity, and driving speed. On the other hand, the "student" model focuses on real-time interaction and human decision-making, drawing parallels to the human memory storage mechanism. Furthermore, we improve the model's efficiency by introducing a new Fourier Adaptive Spike Neural Network (FA-SNN), allowing for faster and more precise predictions with fewer parameters. Evaluated using the NGSIM, HighD, and MoCAD benchmarks, HLTP++ demonstrates superior performance compared to existing models, which reduces the predicted trajectory error with over 11% on the NGSIM dataset and 25% on the HighD datasets. Moreover, HLTP++ demonstrates strong adaptability in challenging environments with incomplete input data. This marks a significant stride in the journey towards fully AD systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2402.19251</p></details> |

Learning-based methods are currently showing impressive results in simulation-based challenges, with transformer-based architectures technologically leading the way. Ultimately, however, predictions are needed in the real world. In addition to the shifts from simulation to the real world, many vehicle- and country-specific shifts, i.e. differences in sensor systems, fusion and perception algorithms as well as traffic rules and laws, are on the agenda. Since models that can cover all system setups and design domains at once are not yet foreseeable, model adaptation plays a central role. Therefore, a simulation-based study on transfer learning techniques is conducted on basis of a transformer-based model. Furthermore, the study aims to provide insights into possible trade-offs between computational time and performance to support effective transfers into the real world.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to be published as part of the 2024 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV), Jeju Shinhwa World, Jeju Island, Korea, June 2-5, 2024</p></details> |

We frame this problem as an instance of abduction guided by a novel parsimony function represented as an aggregate truth value over an annotated logic program. This approach has the added benefit of affording explainability to an analyst user. By showing that any subset of such a program can provide a lower bound on this parsimony requirement, we are able to abduce movement trajectories efficiently through an informed (i.e., A*) search. We describe how our implementation was enhanced with the application of multiple techniques in order to be scaled and integrated with a cloud-based software stack that included bottom-up rule learning, geolocated knowledge graph retrieval/management, and interfaces with government systems for independently conducted government-run tests for which we provide results. We also report on our own experiments showing that we not only provide exact results but also scale to very large scenarios and provide realistic agent trajectories that can go undetected by machine learning anomaly detectors.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICLP 2024</p></details> |

However, prevalent methods often assume complete observed trajectories, neglecting the potential impact of missing values induced by object occlusion, scope limitation, and sensor failures. Such oversights inevitably compromise the accuracy of trajectory predictions. To tackle this challenge, we propose an end-to-end framework, termed Multiscale Transformer (MSTF), meticulously crafted for incomplete trajectory prediction. MSTF integrates a Multiscale Attention Head (MAH) and an Information Increment-based Pattern Adaptive (IIPA) module. Specifically, the MAH component concurrently captures multiscale motion representation of trajectory sequence from various temporal granularities, utilizing a multi-head attention mechanism. This approach facilitates the modeling of global dependencies in motion across different scales, thereby mitigating the adverse effects of missing values. Additionally, the IIPA module adaptively extracts continuity representation of motion across time steps by analyzing missing patterns in the data. The continuity representation delineates motion trend at a higher level, guiding MSTF to generate predictions consistent with motion continuity. We evaluate our proposed MSTF model using two large-scale real-world datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that MSTF surpasses state-of-the-art (SOTA) models in the task of incomplete trajectory prediction, showcasing its efficacy in addressing the challenges posed by missing values in motion forecasting for autonomous driving systems.</p></details> |  |

A data-driven approach consists on to deduce behaviors that may exist in real situation to obtain different types of trajectories from a large set of observations. The data, and its classification, could then be used to train models capable to extrapolate such behavior. Cars and two different types of Vulnerable Road Users (VRU) will be considered by the trajectory clustering methods proposed: pedestrians and cyclists. The results reported here evaluate methods to extract well-defined trajectory classes from raw data without the use of map information while also separating ''eccentric'' or incomplete trajectories from the ones that are complete and representative in any scenario. Two environments will serve as test for the methods develop, three different intersections and one roundabout. The resulting clusters of trajectories can then be used for prediction or learning tasks or discarded if it is composed by outliers.</p></details> |  |
| **[PWTO: A Heuristic Approach for Trajectory Optimization in Complex Terrains](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02745v1)** | 2024-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper considers a trajectory planning problem for a robot navigating complex terrains, which arises in applications ranging from autonomous mining vehicles to planetary rovers. The problem seeks to find a low-cost dynamically feasible trajectory for the robot. The problem is challenging as it requires solving a non-linear optimization problem that often has many local minima due to the complex terrain. To address the challenge, we propose a method called Pareto-optimal Warm-started Trajectory Optimization (PWTO) that attempts to combine the benefits of graph search and trajectory optimization, two very different approaches to planning. PWTO first creates a state lattice using simplified dynamics of the robot and leverages a multi-objective graph search method to obtain a set of paths. Each of the paths is then used to warm-start a local trajectory optimization process, so that different local minima are explored to find a globally low-cost solution. In our tests, the solution cost computed by PWTO is often less than half of the costs computed by the baselines. In addition, we verify the trajectories generated by PWTO in Gazebo simulation in complex terrains with both wheeled and quadruped robots. The code of this paper is open sourced and can be found at https://github.com/rap-lab-org/public_pwto.</p></details> |  |

To tackle this challenge, we propose a progressive 3D editing strategy that ensures multi-view consistency via a Trajectory-Anchored Scheme (TAS) with a dual-branch editing mechanism. Specifically, TAS facilitates a tightly coupled iterative process between 2D view editing and 3D updating, preventing error accumulation yielded from text-to-image process. Additionally, we explore the relationship between optimization-based methods and reconstruction-based methods, offering a unified perspective for selecting superior design choice, supporting the rationale behind the designed TAS. We further present a tuning-free View-Consistent Attention Control (VCAC) module that leverages cross-view semantic and geometric reference from the source branch to yield aligned views from the target branch during the editing of 2D views. To validate the effectiveness of our method, we analyze 2D examples to demonstrate the improved consistency with the VCAC module. Further extensive quantitative and qualitative results in text-guided 3D scene editing indicate that our method achieves superior editing quality compared to state-of-the-art methods. We will make the complete codebase publicly available following the conclusion of the double-blind review process.</p></details> |  |

AdaFold extracts a particle-based representation of cloth from RGB-D images and feeds back the representation to a model predictive control to re-plan folding trajectory at every time-step.

| **[Small Aerial Target Detection for Airborne Infrared Detection Systems using LightGBM and Trajectory Constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01278v1)** | 2024-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Factors, such as rapid relative motion, clutter background, etc., make robust small aerial target detection for airborne infrared detection systems a challenge. Existing methods are facing difficulties when dealing with such cases. We consider that a continuous and smooth trajectory is critical in boosting small infrared aerial target detection performance. A simple and effective small aerial target detection method for airborne infrared detection system using light gradient boosting model (LightGBM) and trajectory constraints is proposed in this article. First, we simply formulate target candidate detection as a binary classification problem. Target candidates in every individual frame are detected via interesting pixel detection and a trained LightGBM model. Then, the local smoothness and global continuous characteristic of the target trajectory are modeled as short-strict and long-loose constraints. The trajectory constraints are used efficiently for detecting the true small infrared aerial targets from numerous target candidates. Experiments on public datasets demonstrate that the proposed method performs better than other existing methods. Furthermore, a public dataset for small aerial target detection in airborne infrared detection systems is constructed. To the best of our knowledge, this dataset has the largest data scale and richest scene types within this field.</p></details> | 15 pages,10 figures |

Despite increased attention to this issue, most approaches in trajectory prediction do not consider all of these factors sufficiently. We present SemanticFormer, an approach for predicting multimodal trajectories by reasoning over a semantic traffic scene graph using a hybrid approach. It utilizes high-level information in the form of meta-paths, i.e. trajectories on which an agent is allowed to drive from a knowledge graph which is then processed by a novel pipeline based on multiple attention mechanisms to predict accurate trajectories. SemanticFormer comprises a hierarchical heterogeneous graph encoder to capture spatio-temporal and relational information across agents as well as between agents and road elements. Further, it includes a predictor to fuse different encodings and decode trajectories with probabilities. Finally, a refinement module assesses permitted meta-paths of trajectories and speed profiles to obtain final predicted trajectories. Evaluation of the nuScenes benchmark demonstrates improved performance compared to several SOTA methods. In addition, we demonstrate that our knowledge graph can be easily added to two graph-based existing SOTA methods, namely VectorNet and Laformer, replacing their original homogeneous graphs. The evaluation results suggest that by adding our knowledge graph the performance of the original methods is enhanced by 5% and 4%, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 7 figures, has been accepted for publication in the IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L)</p></details> |

This inherent difficulty curtails the broader application of RL within game environments characterized by diverse constraints. Preference-based reinforcement learning (PbRL) presents a pioneering framework that capitalizes on human preferences as pivotal reward signals, thereby circumventing the need for meticulous reward engineering. However, obtaining preference data from human experts is costly and inefficient, especially under conditions marked by complex constraints. To tackle this challenge, we propose a LLM-enabled automatic preference generation framework named LLM4PG , which harnesses the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to abstract trajectories, rank preferences, and reconstruct reward functions to optimize conditioned policies. Experiments on tasks with complex language constraints demonstrated the effectiveness of our LLM-enabled reward functions, accelerating RL convergence and overcoming stagnation caused by slow or absent progress under original reward structures. This approach mitigates the reliance on specialized human knowledge and demonstrates the potential of LLMs to enhance RL's effectiveness in complex environments in the wild.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by IJCAI 2024 GAAMAL</p></details> |

To further improve these experiences, agents need to be personalized and proactive. By effectively comprehending user intentions through their actions and interactions with GUIs, agents will be better positioned to achieve these goals. This paper introduces the task of goal identification from observed UI trajectories, aiming to infer the user's intended task based on their GUI interactions. We propose a novel evaluation metric to assess whether two task descriptions are paraphrases within a specific UI environment. By Leveraging the inverse relation with the UI automation task, we utilized the Android-In-The-Wild and Mind2Web datasets for our experiments. Using our metric and these datasets, we conducted several experiments comparing the performance of humans and state-of-the-art models, specifically GPT-4 and Gemini-1.5 Pro. Our results show that Gemini performs better than GPT but still underperforms compared to humans, indicating significant room for improvement.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces a new framework to enable fast, omnidirectional jumping capabilities for quadruped robots. Utilizing minimum jerk technology, the proposed framework efficiently generates jump trajectories that exploit its analytical solutions, ensuring numerical stability and dynamic compatibility with minimal computational resources. The virtual model control is employed to formulate a Quadratic Programming (QP) optimization problem to accurately track the Center of Mass (CoM) trajectories during the jump phase. The whole-body control strategies facilitate precise and compliant landing motion. Moreover, the different jumping phase is triggered by time-schedule. The framework's efficacy is demonstrated through its implementation on an enhanced version of the open-source Mini Cheetah robot. Omnidirectional jumps-including forward, backward, and other directional-were successfully executed, showcasing the robot's capability to perform rapid and consecutive jumps with an average trajectory generation and tracking solution time of merely 50 microseconds.</p></details> | <details><summary>IROS2...</summary><p>IROS2024 paper,7 pages,8 figures</p></details> |

Unfortunately, the online evaluation of these functions is restricted due to time and safety constraints in most cases. In offline model-based optimization (MBO), we aim to find a design that maximizes the target function using only a pre-existing offline dataset. While prior methods consider forward or inverse approaches to address the problem, these approaches are limited by conservatism and the difficulty of learning highly multi-modal mappings. Recently, there has been an emerging paradigm of learning to improve solutions with synthetic trajectories constructed from the offline dataset. In this paper, we introduce a novel conditional generative modeling approach to produce trajectories toward high-scoring regions. First, we construct synthetic trajectories toward high-scoring regions using the dataset while injecting locality bias for consistent improvement directions. Then, we train a conditional diffusion model to generate trajectories conditioned on their scores. Lastly, we sample multiple trajectories from the trained model with guidance to explore high-scoring regions beyond the dataset and select high-fidelity designs among generated trajectories with the proxy function. Extensive experiment results demonstrate that our method outperforms competitive baselines on Design-Bench and its practical variants.

Generally, the two tasks are handled separately in traditional paradigms and a few methods have started to explore modeling these two tasks in a joint manner recently. However, these approaches suffer from the limitations of single-frame training and inconsistent coordinate representations between tracking and prediction tasks. In this paper, we propose a streaming and unified framework for joint 3D Multi-Object Tracking and trajectory Prediction (StreamMOTP) to address the above challenges. Firstly, we construct the model in a streaming manner and exploit a memory bank to preserve and leverage the long-term latent features for tracked objects more effectively. Secondly, a relative spatio-temporal positional encoding strategy is introduced to bridge the gap of coordinate representations between the two tasks and maintain the pose-invariance for trajectory prediction. Thirdly, we further improve the quality and consistency of predicted trajectories with a dual-stream predictor. We conduct extensive experiments on popular nuSences dataset and the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of StreamMOTP, which outperforms previous methods significantly on both tasks. Furthermore, we also prove that the proposed framework has great potential and advantages in actual applications of autonomous driving.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Stable and Storage-efficient Dataset Distillation: Matching Convexified Trajectory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19827v1)** | 2024-06-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid evolution of deep learning and large language models has led to an exponential growth in the demand for training data, prompting the development of Dataset Distillation methods to address the challenges of managing large datasets. Among these, Matching Training Trajectories (MTT) has been a prominent approach, which replicates the training trajectory of an expert network on real data with a synthetic dataset. However, our investigation found that this method suffers from three significant limitations: 1. Instability of expert trajectory generated by Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD); 2. Low convergence speed of the distillation process; 3. High storage consumption of the expert trajectory. To address these issues, we offer a new perspective on understanding the essence of Dataset Distillation and MTT through a simple transformation of the objective function, and introduce a novel method called Matching Convexified Trajectory (MCT), which aims to provide better guidance for the student trajectory. MCT leverages insights from the linearized dynamics of Neural Tangent Kernel methods to create a convex combination of expert trajectories, guiding the student network to converge rapidly and stably. This trajectory is not only easier to store, but also enables a continuous sampling strategy during distillation, ensuring thorough learning and fitting of the entire expert trajectory. Comprehensive experiments across three public datasets validate the superiority of MCT over traditional MTT methods.</p></details> | 11 pages |

Our approach consists of a 2-fork neural network fed with sensing and localization data, able to communicate intermediate learned features among the agents. One network branch crafts an initial collision-free trajectory estimate, while the other devises a neural collision constraint for subsequent optimization, ensuring trajectory continuity and adherence to physicalactuation limits. Extensive simulations in challenging cluttered environments, involving up to 25 robots and 25% obstacle density, show a collision avoidance success rate in the range of 100 -- 85%. Finally, we introduce a saliency map computation method acting on the point cloud data, offering qualitative insights into our methodology.</p></details> |  |

It is expected to be the next-gen video technology and a prevalent use case for 5G and beyond wireless communication. Considering that each user typically only watches a section of the volumetric video, known as the viewport, it is essential to have precise viewport prediction for optimal performance. However, research on this topic is still in its infancy. In the end, this paper presents and proposes a novel approach, named Saliency and Trajectory Viewport Prediction (STVP), which aims to improve the precision of viewport prediction in volumetric video streaming. The STVP extensively utilizes video saliency information and viewport trajectory. To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive study of viewport prediction in volumetric video streaming. In particular, we introduce a novel sampling method, Uniform Random Sampling (URS), to reduce computational complexity while still preserving video features in an efficient manner. Then we present a saliency detection technique that incorporates both spatial and temporal information for detecting static, dynamic geometric, and color salient regions. Finally, we intelligently fuse saliency and trajectory information to achieve more accurate viewport prediction. We conduct extensive simulations to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed viewport prediction methods using state-of-the-art volumetric video sequences. The experimental results show the superiority of the proposed method over existing schemes. The dataset and source code will be publicly accessible after acceptance.</p></details> |  |

This framework leverages recent advancements in discrete-time dynamic graph (DTDG) models to adeptly handle the temporal dynamics inherent in dynamic graphs. DyGETViz effectively captures both micro- and macro-level structural shifts within these graphs, offering a robust method for representing complex and massive dynamic graphs. The application of DyGETViz extends to a diverse array of domains, including ethology, epidemiology, finance, genetics, linguistics, communication studies, social studies, and international relations.

Differentially private publication mechanisms have been proposed to allow for analyses under rigorous privacy guarantees. However, the traditional protection schemes suffer from a limiting privacy-utility trade-off and are vulnerable to correlation and reconstruction attacks. Synthetic trajectory data generation and release represent a promising alternative to protection algorithms. While initial proposals achieve remarkable utility, they fail to provide rigorous privacy guarantees. This paper proposes a framework for designing a privacy-preserving trajectory publication approach by defining five design goals, particularly stressing the importance of choosing an appropriate Unit of Privacy. Based on this framework, we briefly discuss the existing trajectory protection approaches, emphasising their shortcomings. This work focuses on the systematisation of the state-of-the-art generative models for trajectories in the context of the proposed framework. We find that no existing solution satisfies all requirements. Thus, we perform an experimental study evaluating the applicability of six sequential generative models to the trajectory domain. Finally, we conclude that a generative trajectory model providing semantic guarantees remains an open research question and propose concrete next steps for future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Added...</summary><p>Added DOI: 10.56553/popets-2024-0068</p></details> |

LiDAR point clouds can be used directly to assemble 3D models if their positions are accurately determined. AeroTraj uses SLAM for this, but must ensure complete and accurate reconstruction while minimizing drone battery usage. Doing this requires balancing competing constraints: drone speed, height, and orientation. AeroTraj exploits building geometry in designing an optimal trajectory that incorporates these constraints. Even with an optimal trajectory, SLAM's position error can drift over time, so AeroTraj tracks drift in-flight by offloading computations to the cloud and invokes a re-calibration procedure to minimize error. AeroTraj can reconstruct large structures with centimeter-level accuracy and with an average end-to-end latency below 250 ms, significantly outperforming the state of the art.</p></details> |  |

The validity of the method in computing both feasible and optimal trajectories for the robots is demonstrated both in simulation and experimentally. Results show that the constraint on the Fiedler value ensures that the robot network fulfils its objective while maintaining communication connectivity at all times. Further, the paper shows that the introduction of approximations for the constraints enables a significant improvement in the computational time of the solution, which remain very close to the optimal solution.</p></details> |  |

This paper proposes a novel method for pedestrian trajectory prediction, called multi-stage goal-driven network (MGNet). Diverging from prior approaches relying on stepwise recursive prediction and the singular forecasting of a long-term goal, MGNet directs trajectory generation by forecasting intermediate stage goals, thereby reducing prediction errors. The network comprises three main components: a conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE), an attention module, and a multi-stage goal evaluator. Trajectories are encoded using conditional variational autoencoders to acquire knowledge about the approximate distribution of pedestrians' future trajectories, and combined with an attention mechanism to capture the temporal dependency between trajectory sequences. The pivotal module is the multi-stage goal evaluator, which utilizes the encoded feature vectors to predict intermediate goals, effectively minimizing cumulative errors in the recursive inference process. The effectiveness of MGNet is demonstrated through comprehensive experiments on the JAAD and PIE datasets. Comparative evaluations against state-of-the-art algorithms reveal significant performance improvements achieved by our proposed method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper accepted by 5th International Conference on Computer Vision, Image and Deep Learning (CVIDL 2024)</p></details> |

This paper introduces a method that leverages anticipatory road data, such as speed limits, road slopes, and traffic lights, beyond the local perception range to optimize energy-efficient braking trajectories. For that, coasting, which reduces energy consumption, and active braking are combined to transition from the current vehicle velocity to a lower target velocity at a given distance ahead. Finding the switching instants between the coasting phases and the continuous control for the braking phase is addressed as an optimal trade-off between maximizing coasting periods and minimizing braking effort. The resulting switched optimal control problem is solved by deriving necessary optimality conditions. To facilitate the incorporation of additional feasibility constraints for multi-phase trajectories, a sub-optimal alternative solution based on parametric optimization is proposed. Both methods are compared in simulation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint to appear at the European Control Conference 2024 (ECC'24)</p></details> |

However, the potential of adopting real-world datasets, which can produce significantly more realistic 3D scenes, remains largely unexplored. In this work, we delve into the key challenge of the complex and scene-specific camera trajectories found in real-world captures. We introduce Director3D, a robust open-world text-to-3D generation framework, designed to generate both real-world 3D scenes and adaptive camera trajectories. To achieve this, (1) we first utilize a Trajectory Diffusion Transformer, acting as the Cinematographer, to model the distribution of camera trajectories based on textual descriptions.

First, the detection network estimates the objects position and orientation in the image space. Furthermore, these are normalized and filtered. The direction and orientation is then the input to the trajectory planner, which considers the kinematic constrains of the used robotic system. This allows safe and stable control, since the kinematic boundary values are taken into account in planning. Also, by having direction estimation and velocity planner separated, the learning part of the method does not directly influence the control value. This also enables the transfer of the method to different robotic systems without retraining, therefore being robot agnostic. We evaluate our method on different visual servoing tasks with and without clutter on two different robotic systems. Our method achieved mean absolute position errors of <0.5 mm and orientation errors of <1{\deg}. Additionally, we transferred the method to a new system which differs in robot and camera, emphasizing robot agnostic capability of our method.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication.

We frame constrained trajectory optimization as a novel form of constrained functional minimization over trajectory distributions, which avoids treating the constraints as a penalty in the objective and allows us to generate diverse sets of constraint-satisfying trajectories. Our method uses Stein Variational Gradient Descent (SVGD) to find a set of particles that approximates a distribution over low-cost trajectories while obeying constraints. CSVTO is applicable to problems with differentiable equality and inequality constraints and includes a novel particle re-sampling step to escape local minima. By explicitly generating diverse sets of trajectories, CSVTO is better able to avoid poor local minima and is more robust to initialization. We demonstrate that CSVTO outperforms baselines in challenging highly-constrained tasks, such as a 7DoF wrench manipulation task, where CSVTO outperforms all baselines both in success and constraint satisfaction.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 10 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

Biological knowledge suggests that it may be best to describe complex diseases at the level of underlying pathways, which may interact with one another. We propose a Bayesian approach that allows for characterising such correlation among different pathways through Dependent Gaussian Processes (DGP) and mapping the observed high-dimensional gene expression trajectories into unobserved low-dimensional pathway expression trajectories via Bayesian Sparse Factor Analysis. Our proposal is the first attempt to relax the classical assumption of independent factors for longitudinal data and has demonstrated a superior performance in recovering the shape of pathway expression trajectories, revealing the relationships between genes and pathways, and predicting gene expressions (closer point estimates and narrower predictive intervals), as demonstrated through simulations and real data analysis. To fit the model, we propose a Monte Carlo Expectation Maximization (MCEM) scheme that can be implemented conveniently by combining a standard Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampler and an R package GPFDA (Konzen and others, 2021), which returns the maximum likelihood estimates of DGP hyperparameters. The modular structure of MCEM makes it generalizable to other complex models involving the DGP model component. Our R package DGP4LCF that implements the proposed approach is available on CRAN.</p></details> |  |

However, configuring the skills' parameters for a specific task remains a manual and time-consuming endeavor. Existing approaches for learning or optimizing these parameters often require numerous real-world executions or do not work in dynamic environments. To address these challenges, we propose MuTT, a novel encoder-decoder transformer architecture designed to predict environment-aware executions of robot skills by integrating vision, trajectory, and robot skill parameters. Notably, we pioneer the fusion of vision and trajectory, introducing a novel trajectory projection. Furthermore, we illustrate MuTT's efficacy as a predictor when combined with a model-based robot skill optimizer. This approach facilitates the optimization of robot skill parameters for the current environment, without the need for real-world executions during optimization. Designed for compatibility with any representation of robot skills, MuTT demonstrates its versatility across three comprehensive experiments, showcasing superior performance across two different skill representations.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose a holistic framework that jointly optimizes the total latency and energy consumption for UAV-assisted fog computing in a three-dimensional spatial domain with varying terrain elevations and dynamic task generations. Our proposed framework considers three important and interdependent modules: attitude control, trajectory planning, and task assignment. We first establish a fuzzy proportional-integral-derivative control model to determine the UAV's attitude. Then, we propose an enhanced Ant Colony System (ACS) based algorithm, that includes a safety value and a decoupling mechanism to overcome the convergence issue in classical ACS, to compute the optimal UAV trajectory. Finally, we design an algorithm based on the Particle Swarm Optimization technique, to determine where each offloaded task should be executed. Under our proposed framework, the outcome of one module would affect the decision-making in one other, providing a holistic perspective of the system and thus leading to improved solutions. We demonstrate by extensive simulation results that our proposed framework can significantly improve the overall performance, measured by latency and energy consumption, compared to existing baseline approaches.</p></details> | 14 pages, 10 figures |

Some leading methods in this domain prioritize long-range matching, involving the unrolling of training trajectories with a fixed number of steps (NS) on the synthetic dataset to align with various expert training trajectories. However, traditional long-range matching methods possess an overfitting-like problem, the fixed step size NS forces synthetic dataset to distortedly conform seen expert training trajectories, resulting in a loss of generality-especially to those from unencountered architecture. We refer to this as the Accumulated Mismatching Problem (AMP), and propose a new approach, Automatic Training Trajectories (ATT), which dynamically and adaptively adjusts trajectory length NS to address the AMP. Our method outperforms existing methods particularly in tests involving cross-architectures. Moreover, owing to its adaptive nature, it exhibits enhanced stability in the face of parameter variations.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper is accepted at ECCV 2024</p></details> |

This paper presents a comprehensive survey of the most prevalent distance-based vessel trajectory clustering methods, which encompass two main steps: trajectory similarity measurement and clustering. Initially, we conducted a thorough literature review using relevant keywords to gather and summarize pertinent research papers and datasets. Then, this paper discussed the principal methods of data pre-processing that prepare data for further analysis. The survey progresses to detail the leading algorithms for measuring vessel trajectory similarity and the main clustering techniques used in the field today. Furthermore, the various applications of trajectory clustering within the maritime context are explored. Finally, the paper evaluates the effectiveness of different algorithm combinations and pre-processing methods through experimental analysis, focusing on their impact on the performance of distance-based trajectory clustering algorithms. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of various trajectory clustering algorithms and notably highlight the significant improvements that trajectory compression techniques contribute to the efficiency and accuracy of trajectory clustering.

| **[Risk-Aware Vehicle Trajectory Prediction Under Safety-Critical Scenarios](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13480v1)** | 2024-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction is significant for intelligent vehicles to achieve high-level autonomous driving, and a lot of relevant research achievements have been made recently. Despite the rapid development, most existing studies solely focused on normal safe scenarios while largely neglecting safety-critical scenarios, particularly those involving imminent collisions. This oversight may result in autonomous vehicles lacking the essential predictive ability in such situations, posing a significant threat to safety. To tackle these, this paper proposes a risk-aware trajectory prediction framework tailored to safety-critical scenarios. Leveraging distinctive hazardous features, we develop three core risk-aware components. First, we introduce a risk-incorporated scene encoder, which augments conventional encoders with quantitative risk information to achieve risk-aware encoding of hazardous scene contexts. Next, we incorporate endpoint-risk-combined intention queries as prediction priors in the decoder to ensure that the predicted multimodal trajectories cover both various spatial intentions and risk levels. Lastly, an auxiliary risk prediction task is implemented for the ultimate risk-aware prediction. Furthermore, to support model training and performance evaluation, we introduce a safety-critical trajectory prediction dataset and tailored evaluation metrics. We conduct comprehensive evaluations and compare our model with several SOTA models. Results demonstrate the superior performance of our model, with a significant improvement in most metrics. This prediction advancement enables autonomous vehicles to execute correct collision avoidance maneuvers under safety-critical scenarios, eventually enhancing road traffic safety.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving Out-of-Distribution Generalization of Trajectory Prediction for Autonomous Driving via Polynomial Representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13431v1)** | 2024-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robustness against Out-of-Distribution (OoD) samples is a key performance indicator of a trajectory prediction model. However, the development and ranking of state-of-the-art (SotA) models are driven by their In-Distribution (ID) performance on individual competition datasets. We present an OoD testing protocol that homogenizes datasets and prediction tasks across two large-scale motion datasets. We introduce a novel prediction algorithm based on polynomial representations for agent trajectory and road geometry on both the input and output sides of the model. With a much smaller model size, training effort, and inference time, we reach near SotA performance for ID testing and significantly improve robustness in OoD testing. Within our OoD testing protocol, we further study two augmentation strategies of SotA models and their effects on model generalization. Highlighting the contrast between ID and OoD performance, we suggest adding OoD testing to the evaluation criteria of trajectory prediction models.</p></details> |  |

It's a way of generating a smooth and feasible path for the robot to follow over time. The process primarily takes several factors to generate the path, such as velocity, acceleration and jerk. The process deals with how the robot can follow a desired motion path in a suitable environment. This trajectory planning is extensively used in Automobile Industrial Robot, Manipulators, and Mobile Robots. Trajectory planning is a fundamental component of motion control systems. To perform tasks like pick and place operations, assembly, welding, painting, path following, and obstacle avoidance. This paper introduces a comparative analysis of trajectory planning algorithms and their key software elements working strategy in complex and dynamic environments. Adaptability and real-time analysis are the most common problems in trajectory planning. The paper primarily focuses on getting a better understanding of these unpredictable environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deterministic Trajectory Optimization through Probabilistic Optimal Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13316v1)** | 2024-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This article proposes two new algorithms tailored to discrete-time deterministic finite-horizon nonlinear optimal control problems or so-called trajectory optimization problems. Both algorithms are inspired by a novel theoretical paradigm known as probabilistic optimal control, that reformulates optimal control as an equivalent probabilistic inference problem. This perspective allows to address the problem using the Expectation-Maximization algorithm. We show that the application of this algorithm results in a fixed point iteration of probabilistic policies that converge to the deterministic optimal policy. Two strategies for policy evaluation are discussed, using state-of-the-art uncertainty quantification methods resulting into two distinct algorithms. The algorithms are structurally closest related to the differential dynamic programming algorithm and related methods that use sigma-point methods to avoid direct gradient evaluations. The main advantage of our work is an improved balance between exploration and exploitation over the iterations, leading to improved numerical stability and accelerated convergence. These properties are demonstrated on different nonlinear systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory Planning Using Tire Thermodynamics for Automated Drifting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12989v1)** | 2024-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated vehicles need to estimate tire-road friction information, as it plays a key role in safe trajectory planning and vehicle dynamics control. Notably, friction is not solely dependent on road surface conditions, but also varies significantly depending on the tire temperature. However, tire parameters such as the friction coefficient have been conventionally treated as constant values in automated vehicle motion planning. This paper develops a simple thermodynamic model that captures tire friction temperature variation. To verify the model, it is implemented into trajectory planning for automated drifting - a challenging application that requires leveraging an unstable, drifting equilibrium at the friction limits. The proposed method which captures the hidden tire dynamics provides a dynamically feasible trajectory, leading to more precise tracking during experiments with an LQR (Linear Quadratic Regulator) controller.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This manuscript was accepted from IEEE Intelligent Vehicle Symposium (IV 2024) and will be published late August</p></details> |
| **[Forward Invariance in Trajectory Spaces for Safety-critical Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12624v1)** | 2024-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Useful robot control algorithms should not only achieve performance objectives but also adhere to hard safety constraints. Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) have been developed to provably ensure system safety through forward invariance. However, they often unnecessarily sacrifice performance for safety since they are purely reactive. Receding horizon control (RHC), on the other hand, consider planned trajectories to account for the future evolution of a system. This work provides a new perspective on safety-critical control by introducing Forward Invariance in Trajectory Spaces (FITS). We lift the problem of safe RHC into the trajectory space and describe the evolution of planned trajectories as a controlled dynamical system. Safety constraints defined over states can be converted into sets in the trajectory space which we render forward invariant via a CBF framework. We derive an efficient quadratic program (QP) to synthesize trajectories that provably satisfy safety constraints. Our experiments support that FITS improves the adherence to safety specifications without sacrificing performance over alternative CBF and NMPC methods.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 figures |
| **[UniTE: A Survey and Unified Pipeline for Pre-training ST Trajectory Embeddings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12550v1)** | 2024-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal (ST) trajectories are sequences of timestamped locations, which enable a variety of analyses that in turn enable important real-world applications. It is common to map trajectories to vectors, called embeddings, before subsequent analyses. Thus, the qualities of embeddings are very important. Methods for pre-training embeddings, which leverage unlabeled trajectories for training universal embeddings, have shown promising applicability across different tasks, thus attracting considerable interest. However, research progress on this topic faces two key challenges: a lack of a comprehensive overview of existing methods, resulting in several related methods not being well-recognized, and the absence of a unified pipeline, complicating the development new methods and the analysis of methods. To overcome these obstacles and advance the field of pre-training of trajectory embeddings, we present UniTE, a survey and a unified pipeline for this domain. In doing so, we present a comprehensive list of existing methods for pre-training trajectory embeddings, which includes methods that either explicitly or implicitly employ pre-training techniques. Further, we present a unified and modular pipeline with publicly available underlying code, simplifying the process of constructing and evaluating methods for pre-training trajectory embeddings. Additionally, we contribute a selection of experimental results using the proposed pipeline on real-world datasets.</p></details> |  |

Established trajectory prediction methods primarily use agent tracks generated by a detection and tracking system and HD map as inputs. In this work, we propose a novel method that also incorporates visual input from surround-view cameras, allowing the model to utilize visual cues such as human gazes and gestures, road conditions, vehicle turn signals, etc, which are typically hidden from the model in prior methods. Furthermore, we use textual descriptions generated by a Vision-Language Model (VLM) and refined by a Large Language Model (LLM) as supervision during training to guide the model on what to learn from the input data. Despite using these extra inputs, our method achieves a latency of 53 ms, making it feasible for real-time processing, which is significantly faster than that of previous single-agent prediction methods with similar performance. Our experiments show that both the visual inputs and the textual descriptions contribute to improvements in trajectory prediction performance, and our qualitative analysis highlights how the model is able to exploit these additional inputs. Lastly, in this work we create and release the nuScenes-Text dataset, which augments the established nuScenes dataset with rich textual annotations for every scene, demonstrating the positive impact of utilizing VLM on trajectory prediction.

| **[Multi-Agent Probabilistic Ensembles with Trajectory Sampling for Connected Autonomous Vehicles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13910v3)** | 2024-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) have attracted significant attention in recent years and Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown remarkable performance in improving the autonomy of vehicles. In that regard, the widely adopted Model-Free RL (MFRL) promises to solve decision-making tasks in connected AVs (CAVs), contingent on the readiness of a significant amount of data samples for training. Nevertheless, it might be infeasible in practice and possibly lead to learning instability. In contrast, Model-Based RL (MBRL) manifests itself in sample-efficient learning, but the asymptotic performance of MBRL might lag behind the state-of-the-art MFRL algorithms. Furthermore, most studies for CAVs are limited to the decision-making of a single AV only, thus underscoring the performance due to the absence of communications. In this study, we try to address the decision-making problem of multiple CAVs with limited communications and propose a decentralized Multi-Agent Probabilistic Ensembles with Trajectory Sampling algorithm MA-PETS. In particular, in order to better capture the uncertainty of the unknown environment, MA-PETS leverages Probabilistic Ensemble (PE) neural networks to learn from communicated samples among neighboring CAVs. Afterwards, MA-PETS capably develops Trajectory Sampling (TS)-based model-predictive control for decision-making. On this basis, we derive the multi-agent group regret bound affected by the number of agents within the communication range and mathematically validate that incorporating effective information exchange among agents into the multi-agent learning scheme contributes to reducing the group regret bound in the worst case. Finally, we empirically demonstrate the superiority of MA-PETS in terms of the sample efficiency comparable to MFBL.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory and Power Optimization for Multi-UAV Enabled Emergency Wireless Communications Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11896v1)** | 2024-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) has attracted much attention due to its flexible deployment and controllable mobility. As the general communication network cannot meet the emergency requirements, in this paper we study the multi-UAV enabled wireless emergency communication system. Our goal is to maximize the capacity with jointly optimizing trajectory and allocating power. To tackle this non-convex optimization problem, we first decompose it into two sub-problems to optimize the trajectory and power allocation, respectively. Then, we propose the successive convex approximation technique and the block coordinate update algorithm to solve the two subproblems. The approximate optimal solution can be obtained after continuous iterations. Simulation results show that the capacity can be greatly increased using our proposed joint trajectory optimization and power allocation.</p></details> | 6 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Progressive Pretext Task Learning for Human Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11588v1)** | 2024-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human trajectory prediction is a practical task of predicting the future positions of pedestrians on the road, which typically covers all temporal ranges from short-term to long-term within a trajectory. However, existing works attempt to address the entire trajectory prediction with a singular, uniform training paradigm, neglecting the distinction between short-term and long-term dynamics in human trajectories. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a novel Progressive Pretext Task learning (PPT) framework, which progressively enhances the model's capacity of capturing short-term dynamics and long-term dependencies for the final entire trajectory prediction. Specifically, we elaborately design three stages of training tasks in the PPT framework. In the first stage, the model learns to comprehend the short-term dynamics through a stepwise next-position prediction task. In the second stage, the model is further enhanced to understand long-term dependencies through a destination prediction task. In the final stage, the model aims to address the entire future trajectory task by taking full advantage of the knowledge from previous stages. To alleviate the knowledge forgetting, we further apply a cross-task knowledge distillation. Additionally, we design a Transformer-based trajectory predictor, which is able to achieve highly efficient two-step reasoning by integrating a destination-driven prediction strategy and a group of learnable prompt embeddings. Extensive experiments on popular benchmarks have demonstrated that our proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance with high efficiency.

By leveraging natural language processing techniques, this study introduces the Scientific Concept Navigator (SciConNav), an embedding-based navigation model to infer the "knowledge pathway" from the research trajectories of millions of scholars. We validate that the learned representations effectively delineate disciplinary boundaries and capture the intricate relationships between diverse concepts. The utility of the inferred navigation space is showcased through multiple applications. Firstly, we demonstrated the multi-step analogy inferences within the knowledge space and the interconnectivity between concepts in different disciplines. Secondly, we formulated the attribute dimensions of knowledge across domains, observing the distributional shifts in the arrangement of 19 disciplines along these conceptual dimensions, including "Theoretical" to "Applied", and "Chemical" to "Biomedical', highlighting the evolution of functional attributes within knowledge domains. Lastly, by analyzing the high-dimensional knowledge network structure, we found that knowledge connects with shorter global pathways, and interdisciplinary knowledge plays a critical role in the accessibility of the global knowledge network. Our framework offers a novel approach to mining knowledge inheritance pathways in extensive scientific literature, which is of great significance for understanding scientific progression patterns, tailoring scientific learning trajectories, and accelerating scientific progress.</p></details> | <details><summary>21pag...</summary><p>21pages, 13 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |

Recent methods predict sub-goals on constructed topology map at each step to enable long-term action planning. However, they suffer from high computational cost when attempting to support such high-level predictions with GCN-like models. In this work, we propose an alternative method that facilitates navigation planning by considering the alignment between instructions and directed fidelity trajectories, which refers to a path from the initial node to the candidate locations on a directed graph without detours. This planning strategy leads to an efficient model while achieving strong performance. Specifically, we introduce a directed graph to illustrate the explored area of the environment, emphasizing directionality. Then, we firstly define the trajectory representation as a sequence of directed edge features, which are extracted from the panorama based on the corresponding orientation. Ultimately, we assess and compare the alignment between instruction and different trajectories during navigation to determine the next navigation target. Our method outperforms previous SOTA method BEVBert on RxR dataset and is comparable on R2R dataset while largely reducing the computational cost.

Specifically, RetailOpt first uses inertial navigation to recover relative trajectories from smartphone motion data. The store map and purchase records are cross-referenced to identify a list of visited shelves, providing anchors to localize the relative trajectories in a store through continuous and discrete optimization. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our system in five diverse environments. The system, if successful, would produce accurate customer movement data, essential for a broad range of retail applications including customer behavior analysis and in-store navigation.</p></details> |  |

As opposed to many existing control strategies, which do not consider spatial constraints, the proposed strategy considers spatial constraints on each degree of freedom movement of the UAV. Such consideration makes the design appealing for many practical applications, such as pipeline inspection, boundary tracking, etc. The proposed design accounts for the limited information about the inertia matrix, thereby affirming its inherent robustness against unmodeled dynamics and other imperfections. We rigorously show that the UAV will converge to its desired path by maintaining bounded position, orientation, and linear and angular speeds. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy through various numerical simulations.</p></details> |  |

Motivated by the pivotal role trajectory length plays in the training process, we introduce Ada-NAV, a novel adaptive trajectory length scheme designed to enhance the training sample efficiency of RL algorithms in robotic navigation tasks. Unlike traditional approaches that treat trajectory length as a fixed hyperparameter, we propose to dynamically adjust it based on the entropy of the underlying navigation policy. Interestingly, Ada-NAV can be applied to both existing on-policy and off-policy RL methods, which we demonstrate by empirically validating its efficacy on three popular RL methods: REINFORCE, Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), and Soft Actor-Critic (SAC). We demonstrate through simulated and real-world robotic experiments that Ada-NAV outperforms conventional methods that employ constant or randomly sampled trajectory lengths. Specifically, for a fixed sample budget, Ada-NAV achieves an 18\% increase in navigation success rate, a 20-38\% reduction in navigation path length, and a 9.32\% decrease in elevation costs. Furthermore, we showcase the versatility of Ada-NAV by integrating it with the Clearpath Husky robot, illustrating its applicability in complex outdoor environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 9 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

Strengthening attacks and uncovering vulnerabilities, especially common issues in VLP models (e.g., high transferable AEs), can advance reliable and practical VLP models. A recent work (i.e., Set-level guidance attack) indicates that augmenting image-text pairs to increase AE diversity along the optimization path enhances the transferability of adversarial examples significantly. However, this approach predominantly emphasizes diversity around the online adversarial examples (i.e., AEs in the optimization period), leading to the risk of overfitting the victim model and affecting the transferability. In this study, we posit that the diversity of adversarial examples towards the clean input and online AEs are both pivotal for enhancing transferability across VLP models. Consequently, we propose using diversification along the intersection region of adversarial trajectory to expand the diversity of AEs. To fully leverage the interaction between modalities, we introduce text-guided adversarial example selection during optimization. Furthermore, to further mitigate the potential overfitting, we direct the adversarial text deviating from the last intersection region along the optimization path, rather than adversarial images as in existing methods. Extensive experiments affirm the effectiveness of our method in improving transferability across various VLP models and downstream vision-and-language tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>ECCV2...</summary><p>ECCV2024.

This paper aims to achieve safe flight of OMAVs in cluttered environments. Considering existing static obstacles, an efficient optimization-based framework is proposed to generate 6-D $SE(3)$ trajectories for OMAVs. Given the kinodynamic constraints and the 3D collision-free region represented by a series of intersecting convex polyhedra, the proposed method finally generates a safe and dynamically feasible 6-D trajectory. First, we parameterize the vehicle's attitude into a free 3D vector using stereographic projection to eliminate the constraints inherent in the $SO(3)$ manifold, while the complete $SE(3)$ trajectory is represented as a 6-D polynomial in time without inherent constraints. The vehicle's shape is modeled as a cuboid attached to the body frame to achieve whole-body collision evaluation. Then, we formulate the origin trajectory generation problem as a constrained optimization problem. The original constrained problem is finally transformed into an unconstrained one that can be solved efficiently. To verify the proposed framework's performance, simulations and real-world experiments based on a tilt-rotor hexarotor aerial vehicle are carried out.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication.

| **[Towards Personalised Patient Risk Prediction Using Temporal Hospital Data Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09373v1)** | 2024-07-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantifying a patient's health status provides clinicians with insight into patient risk, and the ability to better triage and manage resources. Early Warning Scores (EWS) are widely deployed to measure overall health status, and risk of adverse outcomes, in hospital patients. However, current EWS are limited both by their lack of personalisation and use of static observations. We propose a pipeline that groups intensive care unit patients by the trajectories of observations data throughout their stay as a basis for the development of personalised risk predictions. Feature importance is considered to provide model explainability. Using the MIMIC-IV dataset, six clusters were identified, capturing differences in disease codes, observations, lengths of admissions and outcomes. Applying the pipeline to data from just the first four hours of each ICU stay assigns the majority of patients to the same cluster as when the entire stay duration is considered. In-hospital mortality prediction models trained on individual clusters had higher F1 score performance in five of the six clusters when compared against the unclustered patient cohort. The pipeline could form the basis of a clinical decision support tool, working to improve the clinical characterisation of risk groups and the early detection of patient deterioration.</p></details> |  |

Location-Based Services (LBS) capitalize on this trajectory data to offer users personalized services tailored to their location information. However, this trajectory data contains sensitive information about users' movement patterns and habits, necessitating confidentiality and protection from unknown collectors. To address this challenge, privacy-preserving methods like K-anonymity and Differential Privacy have been proposed to safeguard private information in the dataset. Despite their effectiveness, these methods can impact the original features by introducing perturbations or generating unrealistic trajectory data, leading to suboptimal performance in downstream tasks. To overcome these limitations, we propose a Federated Variational AutoEncoder (FedVAE) approach, which effectively generates a new trajectory dataset while preserving the confidentiality of private information and retaining the structure of the original features. In addition, FedVAE leverages Variational AutoEncoder (VAE) to maintain the original feature space and generate new trajectory data, and incorporates Federated Learning (FL) during the training stage, ensuring that users' data remains locally stored to protect their personal information. The results demonstrate its superior performance compared to other existing methods, affirming FedVAE as a promising solution for enhancing data privacy and utility in location-based applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>2023 ...</summary><p>2023 IEEE 98th Vehicular Technology Conference</p></details> |
| **[Any-point Trajectory Modeling for Policy Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00025v3)** | 2024-07-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning from demonstration is a powerful method for teaching robots new skills, and having more demonstration data often improves policy learning. However, the high cost of collecting demonstration data is a significant bottleneck. Videos, as a rich data source, contain knowledge of behaviors, physics, and semantics, but extracting control-specific information from them is challenging due to the lack of action labels. In this work, we introduce a novel framework, Any-point Trajectory Modeling (ATM), that utilizes video demonstrations by pre-training a trajectory model to predict future trajectories of arbitrary points within a video frame. Once trained, these trajectories provide detailed control guidance, enabling the learning of robust visuomotor policies with minimal action-labeled data. Across over 130 language-conditioned tasks we evaluated in both simulation and the real world, ATM outperforms strong video pre-training baselines by 80% on average. Furthermore, we show effective transfer learning of manipulation skills from human videos and videos from a different robot morphology. Visualizations and code are available at: \url{https://xingyu-lin.github.io/atm}.</p></details> | 18 pages, 15 figures |

A novel energy function optimization-based framework is proposed to generate prediction trajectories. Firstly, a new energy function is designed for easier optimization. Secondly, an online optimization pipeline for calculating parameters and agents' velocities is developed. In this pipeline, we first design an efficient group division method based on Frechet distance to classify agents online. Then the strategy on decoupling the optimization of velocities and critical parameters in the energy function is developed, where the the slap swarm algorithm and gradient descent algorithms are integrated to solve the optimization problems more efficiently. Thirdly, we propose a similarity-based resample evaluation algorithm to predict agents' optimal goals, defined as the target-moving headings of agents, which effectively extracts hidden information in observed states and avoids learning agents' destinations via the training dataset in advance. Experiments and comparison studies verify the advantages of the proposed method in terms of prediction accuracy and speed.</p></details> |  |
| **[ImageFlowNet: Forecasting Multiscale Trajectories of Disease Progression with Irregularly-Sampled Longitudinal Medical Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14794v3)** | 2024-07-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The forecasting of disease progression from images is a holy grail for clinical decision making. However, this task is complicated by the inherent high dimensionality, temporal sparsity and sampling irregularity in longitudinal image acquisitions. Existing methods often rely on extracting hand-crafted features and performing time-series analysis in this vector space, leading to a loss of rich spatial information within the images. To overcome these challenges, we introduce ImageFlowNet, a novel framework that learns latent-space flow fields that evolve multiscale representations in joint embedding spaces using neural ODEs and SDEs to model disease progression in the image domain. Notably, ImageFlowNet learns multiscale joint representation spaces by combining cohorts of patients together so that information can be transferred between the patient samples. The dynamics then provide plausible trajectories of progression, with the SDE providing alternative trajectories from the same starting point. We provide theoretical insights that support our formulation of ODEs, and motivate our regularizations involving high-level visual features, latent space organization, and trajectory smoothness. We then demonstrate ImageFlowNet's effectiveness through empirical evaluations on three longitudinal medical image datasets depicting progression in retinal geographic atrophy, multiple sclerosis, and glioblastoma.</p></details> | <details><summary>Fixed...</summary><p>Fixed some typos.

| **[Adaptive Human Trajectory Prediction via Latent Corridors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06653v2)** | 2024-07-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human trajectory prediction is typically posed as a zero-shot generalization problem: a predictor is learnt on a dataset of human motion in training scenes, and then deployed on unseen test scenes. While this paradigm has yielded tremendous progress, it fundamentally assumes that trends in human behavior within the deployment scene are constant over time. As such, current prediction models are unable to adapt to scene-specific transient human behaviors, such as crowds temporarily gathering to see buskers, pedestrians hurrying through the rain and avoiding puddles, or a protest breaking out. We formalize the problem of scene-specific adaptive trajectory prediction and propose a new adaptation approach inspired by prompt tuning called latent corridors. By augmenting the input of any pre-trained human trajectory predictor with learnable image prompts, the predictor can improve in the deployment scene by inferring trends from extremely small amounts of new data (e.g., 2 humans observed for 30 seconds). With less than 0.1% additional model parameters, we see up to 23.9% ADE improvement in MOTSynth simulated data and 16.4% ADE in MOT and Wildtrack real pedestrian data. Qualitatively, we observe that latent corridors imbue predictors with an awareness of scene geometry and scene-specific human behaviors that non-adaptive predictors struggle to capture.

| **[Using iterated local alignment to aggregate trajectory data into a traffic flow map](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17500v2)** | 2024-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Desire line maps are widely deployed for traffic flow analysis by virtue of their ease of interpretation and computation. They can be considered to be simplified traffic flow maps, whereas the computational challenges in aggregating small scale traffic flows prevent the wider dissemination of high resolution flow maps. Vehicle trajectories are a promising data source to solve this challenging problem. The solution begins with the alignment (or map matching) of the trajectories to the road network. However even the state-of-the-art map matching implementations produce sub-optimal results with small misalignments. While these misalignments are negligible for large scale flow aggregation in desire line maps, they pose substantial obstacles for small scale flow aggregation in high resolution maps. To remove these remaining misalignments, we introduce innovative local alignment algorithms, where we infer road segments to serve as local reference segments, and proceed to align nearby road segments to them. With each local alignment iteration, the misalignments of the trajectories with each other and with the road network are reduced, and so converge closer to a minimal flow map. By analysing a set of empirical trajectories collected in Hannover, Germany, we confirm that our minimal flow map has high levels of spatial resolution, accuracy and coverage.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Path Long-Term Vessel Trajectories Forecasting with Probabilistic Feature Fusion for Problem Shifting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18948v6)** | 2024-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper addresses the challenge of boosting the precision of multi-path long-term vessel trajectory forecasting on engineered sequences of Automatic Identification System (AIS) data using feature fusion for problem shifting. We have developed a deep auto-encoder model and a phased framework approach to predict the next 12 hours of vessel trajectories using 1 to 3 hours of AIS data as input. To this end, we fuse the spatiotemporal features from the AIS messages with probabilistic features engineered from historical AIS data referring to potential routes and destinations. As a result, we reduce the forecasting uncertainty by shifting the problem into a trajectory reconstruction problem. The probabilistic features have an F1-Score of approximately 85% and 75% for the vessel route and destination prediction, respectively. Under such circumstances, we achieved an R2 Score of over 98% with different layer structures and varying feature combinations; the high R2 Score is a natural outcome of the well-defined shipping lanes in the study region. However, our proposal stands out among competing approaches as it demonstrates the capability of complex decision-making during turnings and route selection. Furthermore, we have shown that our model achieves more accurate forecasting with average and median errors of 11km and 6km, respectively, a 25% improvement from the current state-of-the-art approaches. The resulting model from this proposal is deployed as part of a broader Decision Support System to safeguard whales by preventing the risk of vessel-whale collisions under the smartWhales initiative and acting on the Gulf of St. Lawrence in Atlantic Canada.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trial and Error: Exploration-Based Trajectory Optimization for LLM Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02502v2)** | 2024-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have become integral components in various autonomous agent systems. In this study, we present an exploration-based trajectory optimization approach, referred to as ETO. This learning method is designed to enhance the performance of open LLM agents. Contrary to previous studies that exclusively train on successful expert trajectories, our method allows agents to learn from their exploration failures. This leads to improved performance through an iterative optimization framework. During the exploration phase, the agent interacts with the environment while completing given tasks, gathering failure trajectories to create contrastive trajectory pairs. In the subsequent training phase, the agent utilizes these trajectory preference pairs to update its policy using contrastive learning methods like DPO. This iterative cycle of exploration and training fosters continued improvement in the agents. Our experiments on three complex tasks demonstrate that ETO consistently surpasses baseline performance by a large margin. Furthermore, an examination of task-solving efficiency and potential in scenarios lacking expert trajectory underscores the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACL 2024 Main Conference; Camera Ready</p></details> |
| **[The Hybrid Extended Bicycle: A Simple Model for High Dynamic Vehicle Trajectory Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04857v2)** | 2024-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While highly automated driving relies most of the time on a smooth driving assumption, the possibility of a vehicle performing harsh maneuvers with high dynamic driving to face unexpected events is very likely. The modeling of the behavior of the vehicle in these events is crucial to proper planning and controlling; the used model should present accurate and computationally efficient properties to ensure consistency with the dynamics of the vehicle and to be employed in real-time systems. In this article, we propose an LSTM-based hybrid extended bicycle model able to present an accurate description of the state of the vehicle for both normal and aggressive situations. The introduced model is used in a Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) plan and control framework for performing trajectories in high-dynamic scenarios. The proposed model and framework prove their ability to plan feasible trajectories ensuring an accurate vehicle behavior even at the limits of handling.</p></details> |  |
| **[CATP: Context-Aware Trajectory Prediction with Competition Symbiosis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07328v1)** | 2024-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contextual information is vital for accurate trajectory prediction. For instance, the intricate flying behavior of migratory birds hinges on their analysis of environmental cues such as wind direction and air pressure. However, the diverse and dynamic nature of contextual information renders it an arduous task for AI models to comprehend its impact on trajectories and consequently predict them accurately. To address this issue, we propose a ``manager-worker'' framework to unleash the full potential of contextual information and construct CATP model, an implementation of the framework for Context-Aware Trajectory Prediction. The framework comprises a manager model, several worker models, and a tailored training mechanism inspired by competition symbiosis in nature. Taking CATP as an example, each worker needs to compete against others for training data and develop an advantage in predicting specific moving patterns. The manager learns the workers' performance in different contexts and selects the best one in the given context to predict trajectories, enabling CATP as a whole to operate in a symbiotic manner. We conducted two comparative experiments and an ablation study to quantitatively evaluate the proposed framework and CATP model. The results showed that CATP could outperform SOTA models, and the framework could be generalized to different context-aware tasks.</p></details> |  |

Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm significantly enhances the ER through trajectory and jamming power optimization.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 8 figures, submitted to IEEE Journal for review</p></details> |
| **[What's Wrong with the Absolute Trajectory Error?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.05376v4)** | 2024-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One of the limitations of the commonly used Absolute Trajectory Error (ATE) is that it is highly sensitive to outliers. As a result, in the presence of just a few outliers, it often fails to reflect the varying accuracy as the inlier trajectory error or the number of outliers varies. In this work, we propose an alternative error metric for evaluating the accuracy of the reconstructed camera trajectory. Our metric, named Discernible Trajectory Error (DTE), is computed in five steps: (1) Shift the ground-truth and estimated trajectories such that both of their geometric medians are located at the origin. (2) Rotate the estimated trajectory such that it minimizes the sum of geodesic distances between the corresponding camera orientations. (3) Scale the estimated trajectory such that the median distance of the cameras to their geometric median is the same as that of the ground truth. (4) Compute, winsorize and normalize the distances between the corresponding cameras. (5) Obtain the DTE by taking the average of the mean and the root-mean-square (RMS) of the resulting distances. This metric is an attractive alternative to the ATE, in that it is capable of discerning the varying trajectory accuracy as the inlier trajectory error or the number of outliers varies. Using the similar idea, we also propose a novel rotation error metric, named Discernible Rotation Error (DRE), which has similar advantages to the DTE. Furthermore, we propose a simple yet effective method for calibrating the camera-to-marker rotation, which is needed for the computation of our metrics. Our methods are verified through extensive simulations.</p></details> |  |

This paper presents the Human-Like Trajectory Prediction model (HLTP++), which emulates human cognitive processes to improve trajectory prediction in AD. HLTP++ incorporates a novel teacher-student knowledge distillation framework. The "teacher" model equipped with an adaptive visual sector, mimics the dynamic allocation of attention human drivers exhibit based on factors like spatial orientation, proximity, and driving speed. On the other hand, the "student" model focuses on real-time interaction and human decision-making, drawing parallels to the human memory storage mechanism. Furthermore, we improve the model's efficiency by introducing a new Fourier Adaptive Spike Neural Network (FA-SNN), allowing for faster and more precise predictions with fewer parameters. Evaluated using the NGSIM, HighD, and MoCAD benchmarks, HLTP++ demonstrates superior performance compared to existing models, which reduces the predicted trajectory error with over 11% on the NGSIM dataset and 25% on the HighD datasets. Moreover, HLTP++ demonstrates strong adaptability in challenging environments with incomplete input data. This marks a significant stride in the journey towards fully AD systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2402.19251</p></details> |

Learning-based methods are currently showing impressive results in simulation-based challenges, with transformer-based architectures technologically leading the way. Ultimately, however, predictions are needed in the real world. In addition to the shifts from simulation to the real world, many vehicle- and country-specific shifts, i.e. differences in sensor systems, fusion and perception algorithms as well as traffic rules and laws, are on the agenda. Since models that can cover all system setups and design domains at once are not yet foreseeable, model adaptation plays a central role. Therefore, a simulation-based study on transfer learning techniques is conducted on basis of a transformer-based model. Furthermore, the study aims to provide insights into possible trade-offs between computational time and performance to support effective transfers into the real world.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to be published as part of the 2024 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV), Jeju Shinhwa World, Jeju Island, Korea, June 2-5, 2024</p></details> |

We frame this problem as an instance of abduction guided by a novel parsimony function represented as an aggregate truth value over an annotated logic program. This approach has the added benefit of affording explainability to an analyst user. By showing that any subset of such a program can provide a lower bound on this parsimony requirement, we are able to abduce movement trajectories efficiently through an informed (i.e., A*) search. We describe how our implementation was enhanced with the application of multiple techniques in order to be scaled and integrated with a cloud-based software stack that included bottom-up rule learning, geolocated knowledge graph retrieval/management, and interfaces with government systems for independently conducted government-run tests for which we provide results. We also report on our own experiments showing that we not only provide exact results but also scale to very large scenarios and provide realistic agent trajectories that can go undetected by machine learning anomaly detectors.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICLP 2024</p></details> |

However, prevalent methods often assume complete observed trajectories, neglecting the potential impact of missing values induced by object occlusion, scope limitation, and sensor failures. Such oversights inevitably compromise the accuracy of trajectory predictions. To tackle this challenge, we propose an end-to-end framework, termed Multiscale Transformer (MSTF), meticulously crafted for incomplete trajectory prediction. MSTF integrates a Multiscale Attention Head (MAH) and an Information Increment-based Pattern Adaptive (IIPA) module. Specifically, the MAH component concurrently captures multiscale motion representation of trajectory sequence from various temporal granularities, utilizing a multi-head attention mechanism. This approach facilitates the modeling of global dependencies in motion across different scales, thereby mitigating the adverse effects of missing values. Additionally, the IIPA module adaptively extracts continuity representation of motion across time steps by analyzing missing patterns in the data. The continuity representation delineates motion trend at a higher level, guiding MSTF to generate predictions consistent with motion continuity. We evaluate our proposed MSTF model using two large-scale real-world datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that MSTF surpasses state-of-the-art (SOTA) models in the task of incomplete trajectory prediction, showcasing its efficacy in addressing the challenges posed by missing values in motion forecasting for autonomous driving systems.</p></details> |  |

A data-driven approach consists on to deduce behaviors that may exist in real situation to obtain different types of trajectories from a large set of observations. The data, and its classification, could then be used to train models capable to extrapolate such behavior. Cars and two different types of Vulnerable Road Users (VRU) will be considered by the trajectory clustering methods proposed: pedestrians and cyclists. The results reported here evaluate methods to extract well-defined trajectory classes from raw data without the use of map information while also separating ''eccentric'' or incomplete trajectories from the ones that are complete and representative in any scenario. Two environments will serve as test for the methods develop, three different intersections and one roundabout. The resulting clusters of trajectories can then be used for prediction or learning tasks or discarded if it is composed by outliers.</p></details> |  |
| **[PWTO: A Heuristic Approach for Trajectory Optimization in Complex Terrains](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02745v1)** | 2024-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper considers a trajectory planning problem for a robot navigating complex terrains, which arises in applications ranging from autonomous mining vehicles to planetary rovers. The problem seeks to find a low-cost dynamically feasible trajectory for the robot. The problem is challenging as it requires solving a non-linear optimization problem that often has many local minima due to the complex terrain. To address the challenge, we propose a method called Pareto-optimal Warm-started Trajectory Optimization (PWTO) that attempts to combine the benefits of graph search and trajectory optimization, two very different approaches to planning. PWTO first creates a state lattice using simplified dynamics of the robot and leverages a multi-objective graph search method to obtain a set of paths. Each of the paths is then used to warm-start a local trajectory optimization process, so that different local minima are explored to find a globally low-cost solution. In our tests, the solution cost computed by PWTO is often less than half of the costs computed by the baselines. In addition, we verify the trajectories generated by PWTO in Gazebo simulation in complex terrains with both wheeled and quadruped robots. The code of this paper is open sourced and can be found at https://github.com/rap-lab-org/public_pwto.</p></details> |  |

To tackle this challenge, we propose a progressive 3D editing strategy that ensures multi-view consistency via a Trajectory-Anchored Scheme (TAS) with a dual-branch editing mechanism. Specifically, TAS facilitates a tightly coupled iterative process between 2D view editing and 3D updating, preventing error accumulation yielded from text-to-image process. Additionally, we explore the relationship between optimization-based methods and reconstruction-based methods, offering a unified perspective for selecting superior design choice, supporting the rationale behind the designed TAS. We further present a tuning-free View-Consistent Attention Control (VCAC) module that leverages cross-view semantic and geometric reference from the source branch to yield aligned views from the target branch during the editing of 2D views. To validate the effectiveness of our method, we analyze 2D examples to demonstrate the improved consistency with the VCAC module. Further extensive quantitative and qualitative results in text-guided 3D scene editing indicate that our method achieves superior editing quality compared to state-of-the-art methods. We will make the complete codebase publicly available following the conclusion of the double-blind review process.</p></details> |  |

Crafting compelling camera trajectories remains a complex iterative process, even for skilful artists. To tackle this, in this paper, we propose a dataset called the Exceptional Trajectories (E.T.) with camera trajectories along with character information and textual captions encompassing descriptions of both camera and character. To our knowledge, this is the first dataset of its kind. To show the potential applications of the E.T. dataset, we propose a diffusion-based approach, named DIRECTOR, which generates complex camera trajectories from textual captions that describe the relation and synchronisation between the camera and characters. To ensure robust and accurate evaluations, we train on the E.T. dataset CLaTr, a Contrastive Language-Trajectory embedding for evaluation metrics. We posit that our proposed dataset and method significantly advance the democratization of cinematography, making it more accessible to common users.</p></details> | <details><summary>ECCV ...</summary><p>ECCV 2024.

Existing methods are facing difficulties when dealing with such cases. We consider that a continuous and smooth trajectory is critical in boosting small infrared aerial target detection performance. A simple and effective small aerial target detection method for airborne infrared detection system using light gradient boosting model (LightGBM) and trajectory constraints is proposed in this article. First, we simply formulate target candidate detection as a binary classification problem. Target candidates in every individual frame are detected via interesting pixel detection and a trained LightGBM model. Then, the local smoothness and global continuous characteristic of the target trajectory are modeled as short-strict and long-loose constraints. The trajectory constraints are used efficiently for detecting the true small infrared aerial targets from numerous target candidates. Experiments on public datasets demonstrate that the proposed method performs better than other existing methods. Furthermore, a public dataset for small aerial target detection in airborne infrared detection systems is constructed. To the best of our knowledge, this dataset has the largest data scale and richest scene types within this field.</p></details> | 15 pages,10 figures |

Despite increased attention to this issue, most approaches in trajectory prediction do not consider all of these factors sufficiently. We present SemanticFormer, an approach for predicting multimodal trajectories by reasoning over a semantic traffic scene graph using a hybrid approach. It utilizes high-level information in the form of meta-paths, i.e. trajectories on which an agent is allowed to drive from a knowledge graph which is then processed by a novel pipeline based on multiple attention mechanisms to predict accurate trajectories. SemanticFormer comprises a hierarchical heterogeneous graph encoder to capture spatio-temporal and relational information across agents as well as between agents and road elements. Further, it includes a predictor to fuse different encodings and decode trajectories with probabilities. Finally, a refinement module assesses permitted meta-paths of trajectories and speed profiles to obtain final predicted trajectories. Evaluation of the nuScenes benchmark demonstrates improved performance compared to several SOTA methods. In addition, we demonstrate that our knowledge graph can be easily added to two graph-based existing SOTA methods, namely VectorNet and Laformer, replacing their original homogeneous graphs. The evaluation results suggest that by adding our knowledge graph the performance of the original methods is enhanced by 5% and 4%, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 7 figures, has been accepted for publication in the IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L)</p></details> |

This inherent difficulty curtails the broader application of RL within game environments characterized by diverse constraints. Preference-based reinforcement learning (PbRL) presents a pioneering framework that capitalizes on human preferences as pivotal reward signals, thereby circumventing the need for meticulous reward engineering. However, obtaining preference data from human experts is costly and inefficient, especially under conditions marked by complex constraints. To tackle this challenge, we propose a LLM-enabled automatic preference generation framework named LLM4PG , which harnesses the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to abstract trajectories, rank preferences, and reconstruct reward functions to optimize conditioned policies. Experiments on tasks with complex language constraints demonstrated the effectiveness of our LLM-enabled reward functions, accelerating RL convergence and overcoming stagnation caused by slow or absent progress under original reward structures. This approach mitigates the reliance on specialized human knowledge and demonstrates the potential of LLMs to enhance RL's effectiveness in complex environments in the wild.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by IJCAI 2024 GAAMAL</p></details> |

To further improve these experiences, agents need to be personalized and proactive. By effectively comprehending user intentions through their actions and interactions with GUIs, agents will be better positioned to achieve these goals. This paper introduces the task of goal identification from observed UI trajectories, aiming to infer the user's intended task based on their GUI interactions. We propose a novel evaluation metric to assess whether two task descriptions are paraphrases within a specific UI environment. By Leveraging the inverse relation with the UI automation task, we utilized the Android-In-The-Wild and Mind2Web datasets for our experiments. Using our metric and these datasets, we conducted several experiments comparing the performance of humans and state-of-the-art models, specifically GPT-4 and Gemini-1.5 Pro. Our results show that Gemini performs better than GPT but still underperforms compared to humans, indicating significant room for improvement.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces a new framework to enable fast, omnidirectional jumping capabilities for quadruped robots. Utilizing minimum jerk technology, the proposed framework efficiently generates jump trajectories that exploit its analytical solutions, ensuring numerical stability and dynamic compatibility with minimal computational resources. The virtual model control is employed to formulate a Quadratic Programming (QP) optimization problem to accurately track the Center of Mass (CoM) trajectories during the jump phase. The whole-body control strategies facilitate precise and compliant landing motion. Moreover, the different jumping phase is triggered by time-schedule. The framework's efficacy is demonstrated through its implementation on an enhanced version of the open-source Mini Cheetah robot. Omnidirectional jumps-including forward, backward, and other directional-were successfully executed, showcasing the robot's capability to perform rapid and consecutive jumps with an average trajectory generation and tracking solution time of merely 50 microseconds.</p></details> | <details><summary>IROS2...</summary><p>IROS2024 paper,7 pages,8 figures</p></details> |

Unfortunately, the online evaluation of these functions is restricted due to time and safety constraints in most cases. In offline model-based optimization (MBO), we aim to find a design that maximizes the target function using only a pre-existing offline dataset. While prior methods consider forward or inverse approaches to address the problem, these approaches are limited by conservatism and the difficulty of learning highly multi-modal mappings. Recently, there has been an emerging paradigm of learning to improve solutions with synthetic trajectories constructed from the offline dataset. In this paper, we introduce a novel conditional generative modeling approach to produce trajectories toward high-scoring regions. First, we construct synthetic trajectories toward high-scoring regions using the dataset while injecting locality bias for consistent improvement directions. Then, we train a conditional diffusion model to generate trajectories conditioned on their scores. Lastly, we sample multiple trajectories from the trained model with guidance to explore high-scoring regions beyond the dataset and select high-fidelity designs among generated trajectories with the proxy function. Extensive experiment results demonstrate that our method outperforms competitive baselines on Design-Bench and its practical variants.

| **[StreamMOTP: Streaming and Unified Framework for Joint 3D Multi-Object Tracking and Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19844v1)** | 2024-06-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D multi-object tracking and trajectory prediction are two crucial modules in autonomous driving systems. Generally, the two tasks are handled separately in traditional paradigms and a few methods have started to explore modeling these two tasks in a joint manner recently. However, these approaches suffer from the limitations of single-frame training and inconsistent coordinate representations between tracking and prediction tasks. In this paper, we propose a streaming and unified framework for joint 3D Multi-Object Tracking and trajectory Prediction (StreamMOTP) to address the above challenges. Firstly, we construct the model in a streaming manner and exploit a memory bank to preserve and leverage the long-term latent features for tracked objects more effectively. Secondly, a relative spatio-temporal positional encoding strategy is introduced to bridge the gap of coordinate representations between the two tasks and maintain the pose-invariance for trajectory prediction. Thirdly, we further improve the quality and consistency of predicted trajectories with a dual-stream predictor. We conduct extensive experiments on popular nuSences dataset and the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of StreamMOTP, which outperforms previous methods significantly on both tasks. Furthermore, we also prove that the proposed framework has great potential and advantages in actual applications of autonomous driving.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Stable and Storage-efficient Dataset Distillation: Matching Convexified Trajectory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19827v1)** | 2024-06-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid evolution of deep learning and large language models has led to an exponential growth in the demand for training data, prompting the development of Dataset Distillation methods to address the challenges of managing large datasets. Among these, Matching Training Trajectories (MTT) has been a prominent approach, which replicates the training trajectory of an expert network on real data with a synthetic dataset. However, our investigation found that this method suffers from three significant limitations: 1. Instability of expert trajectory generated by Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD); 2. Low convergence speed of the distillation process; 3. High storage consumption of the expert trajectory. To address these issues, we offer a new perspective on understanding the essence of Dataset Distillation and MTT through a simple transformation of the objective function, and introduce a novel method called Matching Convexified Trajectory (MCT), which aims to provide better guidance for the student trajectory. MCT leverages insights from the linearized dynamics of Neural Tangent Kernel methods to create a convex combination of expert trajectories, guiding the student network to converge rapidly and stably. This trajectory is not only easier to store, but also enables a continuous sampling strategy during distillation, ensuring thorough learning and fitting of the entire expert trajectory. Comprehensive experiments across three public datasets validate the superiority of MCT over traditional MTT methods.</p></details> | 11 pages |

Our approach consists of a 2-fork neural network fed with sensing and localization data, able to communicate intermediate learned features among the agents. One network branch crafts an initial collision-free trajectory estimate, while the other devises a neural collision constraint for subsequent optimization, ensuring trajectory continuity and adherence to physicalactuation limits. Extensive simulations in challenging cluttered environments, involving up to 25 robots and 25% obstacle density, show a collision avoidance success rate in the range of 100 -- 85%. Finally, we introduce a saliency map computation method acting on the point cloud data, offering qualitative insights into our methodology.</p></details> |  |
| **[Viewport Prediction for Volumetric Video Streaming by Exploring Video Saliency and Trajectory Information](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16462v2)** | 2024-06-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Volumetric video, also known as hologram video, is a novel medium that portrays natural content in Virtual Reality (VR), Augmented Reality (AR), and Mixed Reality (MR). It is expected to be the next-gen video technology and a prevalent use case for 5G and beyond wireless communication. Considering that each user typically only watches a section of the volumetric video, known as the viewport, it is essential to have precise viewport prediction for optimal performance. However, research on this topic is still in its infancy. In the end, this paper presents and proposes a novel approach, named Saliency and Trajectory Viewport Prediction (STVP), which aims to improve the precision of viewport prediction in volumetric video streaming. The STVP extensively utilizes video saliency information and viewport trajectory. To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive study of viewport prediction in volumetric video streaming. In particular, we introduce a novel sampling method, Uniform Random Sampling (URS), to reduce computational complexity while still preserving video features in an efficient manner. Then we present a saliency detection technique that incorporates both spatial and temporal information for detecting static, dynamic geometric, and color salient regions. Finally, we intelligently fuse saliency and trajectory information to achieve more accurate viewport prediction. We conduct extensive simulations to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed viewport prediction methods using state-of-the-art volumetric video sequences. The experimental results show the superiority of the proposed method over existing schemes. The dataset and source code will be publicly accessible after acceptance.</p></details> |  |

This framework leverages recent advancements in discrete-time dynamic graph (DTDG) models to adeptly handle the temporal dynamics inherent in dynamic graphs. DyGETViz effectively captures both micro- and macro-level structural shifts within these graphs, offering a robust method for representing complex and massive dynamic graphs. The application of DyGETViz extends to a diverse array of domains, including ethology, epidemiology, finance, genetics, linguistics, communication studies, social studies, and international relations. Through its implementation, DyGETViz has revealed or confirmed various critical insights. These include the diversity of content sharing patterns and the degree of specialization within online communities, the chronological evolution of lexicons across decades, and the distinct trajectories exhibited by aging-related and non-related genes. Importantly, DyGETViz enhances the accessibility of scientific findings to non-domain experts by simplifying the complexities of dynamic graphs. Our framework is released as an open-source Python package for use across diverse disciplines.

Differentially private publication mechanisms have been proposed to allow for analyses under rigorous privacy guarantees. However, the traditional protection schemes suffer from a limiting privacy-utility trade-off and are vulnerable to correlation and reconstruction attacks. Synthetic trajectory data generation and release represent a promising alternative to protection algorithms. While initial proposals achieve remarkable utility, they fail to provide rigorous privacy guarantees. This paper proposes a framework for designing a privacy-preserving trajectory publication approach by defining five design goals, particularly stressing the importance of choosing an appropriate Unit of Privacy. Based on this framework, we briefly discuss the existing trajectory protection approaches, emphasising their shortcomings. This work focuses on the systematisation of the state-of-the-art generative models for trajectories in the context of the proposed framework. We find that no existing solution satisfies all requirements. Thus, we perform an experimental study evaluating the applicability of six sequential generative models to the trajectory domain. Finally, we conclude that a generative trajectory model providing semantic guarantees remains an open research question and propose concrete next steps for future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Added...</summary><p>Added DOI: 10.56553/popets-2024-0068</p></details> |

LiDAR point clouds can be used directly to assemble 3D models if their positions are accurately determined. AeroTraj uses SLAM for this, but must ensure complete and accurate reconstruction while minimizing drone battery usage. Doing this requires balancing competing constraints: drone speed, height, and orientation. AeroTraj exploits building geometry in designing an optimal trajectory that incorporates these constraints. Even with an optimal trajectory, SLAM's position error can drift over time, so AeroTraj tracks drift in-flight by offloading computations to the cloud and invokes a re-calibration procedure to minimize error. AeroTraj can reconstruct large structures with centimeter-level accuracy and with an average end-to-end latency below 250 ms, significantly outperforming the state of the art.</p></details> |  |

The validity of the method in computing both feasible and optimal trajectories for the robots is demonstrated both in simulation and experimentally. Results show that the constraint on the Fiedler value ensures that the robot network fulfils its objective while maintaining communication connectivity at all times.

This paper proposes a novel method for pedestrian trajectory prediction, called multi-stage goal-driven network (MGNet). Diverging from prior approaches relying on stepwise recursive prediction and the singular forecasting of a long-term goal, MGNet directs trajectory generation by forecasting intermediate stage goals, thereby reducing prediction errors. The network comprises three main components: a conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE), an attention module, and a multi-stage goal evaluator. Trajectories are encoded using conditional variational autoencoders to acquire knowledge about the approximate distribution of pedestrians' future trajectories, and combined with an attention mechanism to capture the temporal dependency between trajectory sequences. The pivotal module is the multi-stage goal evaluator, which utilizes the encoded feature vectors to predict intermediate goals, effectively minimizing cumulative errors in the recursive inference process. The effectiveness of MGNet is demonstrated through comprehensive experiments on the JAAD and PIE datasets. Comparative evaluations against state-of-the-art algorithms reveal significant performance improvements achieved by our proposed method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper accepted by 5th International Conference on Computer Vision, Image and Deep Learning (CVIDL 2024)</p></details> |

This paper introduces a method that leverages anticipatory road data, such as speed limits, road slopes, and traffic lights, beyond the local perception range to optimize energy-efficient braking trajectories. For that, coasting, which reduces energy consumption, and active braking are combined to transition from the current vehicle velocity to a lower target velocity at a given distance ahead. Finding the switching instants between the coasting phases and the continuous control for the braking phase is addressed as an optimal trade-off between maximizing coasting periods and minimizing braking effort. The resulting switched optimal control problem is solved by deriving necessary optimality conditions. To facilitate the incorporation of additional feasibility constraints for multi-phase trajectories, a sub-optimal alternative solution based on parametric optimization is proposed. Both methods are compared in simulation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint to appear at the European Control Conference 2024 (ECC'24)</p></details> |

However, the potential of adopting real-world datasets, which can produce significantly more realistic 3D scenes, remains largely unexplored. In this work, we delve into the key challenge of the complex and scene-specific camera trajectories found in real-world captures. We introduce Director3D, a robust open-world text-to-3D generation framework, designed to generate both real-world 3D scenes and adaptive camera trajectories. To achieve this, (1) we first utilize a Trajectory Diffusion Transformer, acting as the Cinematographer, to model the distribution of camera trajectories based on textual descriptions.

First, the detection network estimates the objects position and orientation in the image space. Furthermore, these are normalized and filtered. The direction and orientation is then the input to the trajectory planner, which considers the kinematic constrains of the used robotic system. This allows safe and stable control, since the kinematic boundary values are taken into account in planning. Also, by having direction estimation and velocity planner separated, the learning part of the method does not directly influence the control value. This also enables the transfer of the method to different robotic systems without retraining, therefore being robot agnostic. We evaluate our method on different visual servoing tasks with and without clutter on two different robotic systems. Our method achieved mean absolute position errors of <0.5 mm and orientation errors of <1{\deg}. Additionally, we transferred the method to a new system which differs in robot and camera, emphasizing robot agnostic capability of our method.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication.

AbdomenAtlas provides 673K high-quality masks of anatomical structures in the abdominal region annotated by a team of 10 radiologists with the help of AI algorithms. We start by having expert radiologists manually annotate 22 anatomical structures in 5,246 CT volumes. Following this, a semi-automatic annotation procedure is performed for the remaining CT volumes, where radiologists revise the annotations predicted by AI, and in turn, AI improves its predictions by learning from revised annotations. Such a large-scale, detailed-annotated, and multi-center dataset is needed for two reasons. Firstly, AbdomenAtlas provides important resources for AI development at scale, branded as large pre-trained models, which can alleviate the annotation workload of expert radiologists to transfer to broader clinical applications. Secondly, AbdomenAtlas establishes a large-scale benchmark for evaluating AI algorithms -- the more data we use to test the algorithms, the better we can guarantee reliable performance in complex clinical scenarios. An ISBI & MICCAI challenge named BodyMaps: Towards 3D Atlas of Human Body was launched using a subset of our AbdomenAtlas, aiming to stimulate AI innovation and to benchmark segmentation accuracy, inference efficiency, and domain generalizability. We hope our AbdomenAtlas can set the stage for larger-scale clinical trials and offer exceptional opportunities to practitioners in the medical imaging community.

At the same time, its ability of face recognition raises new safety concerns of privacy leakage. Despite researchers' efforts in safety alignment through RLHF or preprocessing filters, vulnerabilities might still be exploited. In our study, we introduce AutoJailbreak, an innovative automatic jailbreak technique inspired by prompt optimization. We leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) for red-teaming to refine the jailbreak prompt and employ weak-to-strong in-context learning prompts to boost efficiency. Furthermore, we present an effective search method that incorporates early stopping to minimize optimization time and token expenditure. Our experiments demonstrate that AutoJailbreak significantly surpasses conventional methods, achieving an Attack Success Rate (ASR) exceeding 95.3\%. This research sheds light on strengthening GPT-4V security, underscoring the potential for LLMs to be exploited in compromising GPT-4V integrity.</p></details> | <details><summary>Trust...</summary><p>TrustNLP@NAACL2024 (Fourth Workshop on Trustworthy Natural Language Processing)</p></details> |
| **[RedAgent: Red Teaming Large Language Models with Context-aware Autonomous Language Agent](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16667v1)** | 2024-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, advanced Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 have been integrated into many real-world applications like Code Copilot. These applications have significantly expanded the attack surface of LLMs, exposing them to a variety of threats. Among them, jailbreak attacks that induce toxic responses through jailbreak prompts have raised critical safety concerns. To identify these threats, a growing number of red teaming approaches simulate potential adversarial scenarios by crafting jailbreak prompts to test the target LLM. However, existing red teaming methods do not consider the unique vulnerabilities of LLM in different scenarios, making it difficult to adjust the jailbreak prompts to find context-specific vulnerabilities. Meanwhile, these methods are limited to refining jailbreak templates using a few mutation operations, lacking the automation and scalability to adapt to different scenarios. To enable context-aware and efficient red teaming, we abstract and model existing attacks into a coherent concept called "jailbreak strategy" and propose a multi-agent LLM system named RedAgent that leverages these strategies to generate context-aware jailbreak prompts. By self-reflecting on contextual feedback in an additional memory buffer, RedAgent continuously learns how to leverage these strategies to achieve effective jailbreaks in specific contexts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our system can jailbreak most black-box LLMs in just five queries, improving the efficiency of existing red teaming methods by two times. Additionally, RedAgent can jailbreak customized LLM applications more efficiently.

Despite its importance, obtaining and updating the matrix is challenging due to high costs and privacy concerns. This has spurred research into generating commuting OD matrices for areas lacking historical data, utilizing readily available information via computational models. In this regard, existing research is primarily restricted to only a single or few large cities, preventing these models from being applied effectively in other areas with distinct characteristics, particularly in towns and rural areas where such data is urgently needed. To address this, we propose a large-scale dataset comprising commuting OD matrices for 3,233 diverse areas around the U.S. For each area, we provide the commuting OD matrix, combined with regional attributes including demographics and point-of-interests of each region in that area. We believe this comprehensive dataset will facilitate the development of more generalizable commuting OD matrix generation models, which can capture various patterns of distinct areas. Additionally, we use this dataset to benchmark a set of commuting OD generation models, including physical models, element-wise predictive models, and matrix-wise generative models. Surprisingly, we find a new paradigm, which considers the whole area combined with its commuting OD matrix as an attributed directed weighted graph and generates the weighted edges based on the node attributes, can achieve the optimal. This may inspire a new research direction from graph learning in this field.</p></details> | 16 pages, 9 figures |

We study matrix majorization in large samples and in the catalytic regime in the case where the columns of the matrices need not have equal support, as has been assumed in earlier works. We focus on two cases: either there are no support restrictions (except for requiring a non-empty intersection for the supports) or the final column dominates the others. Using real-algebraic methods, we identify sufficient and almost necessary conditions for majorization in large samples or when using catalytic states under these support conditions. These conditions are given in terms of multi-partite divergences that generalize the R\'enyi divergences. We notice that varying support conditions dramatically affect the relevant set of divergences. Our results find an application in the theory of catalytic state transformation in quantum thermodynamics.</p></details> | 44 pages, 4 figures |

However, these approaches face the challenge of dynamically capturing the initial state of the task planning problem. To alleviate this issue, we propose AutoGPT+P, a system that combines an affordance-based scene representation with a planning system. Affordances encompass the action possibilities of an agent on the environment and objects present in it. Thus, deriving the planning domain from an affordance-based scene representation allows symbolic planning with arbitrary objects. AutoGPT+P leverages this representation to derive and execute a plan for a task specified by the user in natural language. In addition to solving planning tasks under a closed-world assumption, AutoGPT+P can also handle planning with incomplete information, e. g., tasks with missing objects by exploring the scene, suggesting alternatives, or providing a partial plan. The affordance-based scene representation combines object detection with an automatically generated object-affordance-mapping using ChatGPT. The core planning tool extends existing work by automatically correcting semantic and syntactic errors. Our approach achieves a success rate of 98%, surpassing the current 81% success rate of the current state-of-the-art LLM-based planning method SayCan on the SayCan instruction set. Furthermore, we evaluated our approach on our newly created dataset with 150 scenarios covering a wide range of complex tasks with missing objects, achieving a success rate of 79% on our dataset. The dataset and the code are publicly available at https://git.h2t.iar.kit.edu/birr/autogpt-p-standalone.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 18 pages including references and appendix, 5 figures</p></details> |

This paper focuses on creating proxies of human behavior in simulated environments, with \textit{Among Us} utilized as a tool for studying simulated human behavior. The study introduces a text-based game environment, named AmongAgent, that mirrors the dynamics of \textit{Among Us}. Players act as crew members aboard a spaceship, tasked with identifying impostors who are sabotaging the ship and eliminating the crew. Within this environment, the behavior of simulated language agents is analyzed. The experiments involve diverse game sequences featuring different configurations of Crewmates and Impostor personality archetypes. Our work demonstrates that state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) can effectively grasp the game rules and make decisions based on the current context. This work aims to promote further exploration of LLMs in goal-oriented games with incomplete information and complex action spaces, as these settings offer valuable opportunities to assess language model performance in socially driven scenarios.</p></details> | Wordplay @ ACL 2024 |

However, due to the inherent flaws of current retrieval systems, there might exist irrelevant information within those retrieving top-ranked passages. In this work, we present a comprehensive investigation into the robustness of LLMs to different types of irrelevant information under various conditions. We initially introduce a framework to construct high-quality irrelevant information that ranges from semantically unrelated, partially related, and related to questions. Furthermore, our analysis demonstrates that the constructed irrelevant information not only scores highly on similarity metrics, being highly retrieved by existing systems, but also bears semantic connections to the context. Our investigation reveals that current LLMs still face challenges in discriminating highly semantically related information and can be easily distracted by these irrelevant yet misleading content. Besides, we also find that current solutions for handling irrelevant information have limitations in improving the robustness of LLMs to such distractions. All the resources are available on GitHub at https://github.com/Di-viner/LLM-Robustness-to-Irrelevant-Information.</p></details> | COLM 2024 |

The application of LLMs extends beyond conventional linguistic boundaries, encompassing specialized linguistic systems developed within various scientific disciplines. This growing interest has led to the advent of scientific LLMs, a novel subclass specifically engineered for facilitating scientific discovery. As a burgeoning area in the community of AI for Science, scientific LLMs warrant comprehensive exploration. However, a systematic and up-to-date survey introducing them is currently lacking. In this paper, we endeavor to methodically delineate the concept of "scientific language", whilst providing a thorough review of the latest advancements in scientific LLMs. Given the expansive realm of scientific disciplines, our analysis adopts a focused lens, concentrating on the biological and chemical domains. This includes an in-depth examination of LLMs for textual knowledge, small molecules, macromolecular proteins, genomic sequences, and their combinations, analyzing them in terms of model architectures, capabilities, datasets, and evaluation. Finally, we critically examine the prevailing challenges and point out promising research directions along with the advances of LLMs. By offering a comprehensive overview of technical developments in this field, this survey aspires to be an invaluable resource for researchers navigating the intricate landscape of scientific LLMs.</p></details> |  |

Detecting hallucinations in Machine Translation (MT) remains a critical challenge, particularly since existing methods excel with High-Resource Languages (HRLs) but exhibit substantial limitations when applied to Low-Resource Languages (LRLs). This paper evaluates hallucination detection approaches using Large Language Models (LLMs) and semantic similarity within massively multilingual embeddings. Our study spans 16 language directions, covering HRLs, LRLs, with diverse scripts. We find that the choice of model is essential for performance. On average, for HRLs, Llama3-70B outperforms the previous state of the art by as much as 0.16 MCC (Matthews Correlation Coefficient). However, for LRLs we observe that Claude Sonnet outperforms other LLMs on average by 0.03 MCC. The key takeaway from our study is that LLMs can achieve performance comparable or even better than previously proposed models, despite not being explicitly trained for any machine translation task. However, their advantage is less significant for LRLs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Autho...</summary><p>Authors Kenza Benkirane and Laura Gongas contributed equally to this work</p></details> |

Rethinking How Large Language Models Respond and Solve Tasks via In-Context Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07546v2)** | 2024-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In-context Learning (ICL) has emerged as a powerful capability alongside the development of scaled-up large language models (LLMs). By instructing LLMs using few-shot demonstrative examples, ICL enables them to perform a wide range of tasks without updating millions of parameters. However, the precise contributions of demonstrations towards improving end-task performance have not been thoroughly investigated in recent analytical studies. In this paper, we empirically decompose the overall performance of ICL into three dimensions, label space, format, and discrimination, and we evaluate four general-purpose LLMs across a diverse range of tasks. Counter-intuitively, we find that the demonstrations have a marginal impact on provoking discriminative knowledge of language models. However, ICL exhibits significant efficacy in regulating the label space and format, which helps LLMs respond to desired label words. We then demonstrate that this ability functions similar to detailed instructions for LLMs to follow. We additionally provide an in-depth analysis of the mechanism of retrieval helping with ICL. Our findings demonstrate that retrieving the semantically similar examples notably boosts the model's discriminative capability. However, we also observe a trade-off in selecting good in-context examples regarding label diversity.</p></details> | <details><summary>39 pa...</summary><p>39 pages, 8 figures.

In educational KT scenarios, transductive ID-based methods often face severe data sparsity and cold start problems, where interactions between individual students and questions are sparse, and new questions and concepts consistently arrive in the database. In addition, existing KT models only implicitly consider the correlation between concepts and questions, lacking direct modeling of the more complex relationships in the heterogeneous graph of concepts and questions. In this paper, we propose a Structure-aware Inductive Knowledge Tracing model with large language model (dubbed SINKT), which, for the first time, introduces large language models (LLMs) and realizes inductive knowledge tracing. Firstly, SINKT utilizes LLMs to introduce structural relationships between concepts and constructs a heterogeneous graph for concepts and questions. Secondly, by encoding concepts and questions with LLMs, SINKT incorporates semantic information to aid prediction. Finally, SINKT predicts the student's response to the target question by interacting with the student's knowledge state and the question representation. Experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate that SINKT achieves state-of-the-art performance among 12 existing transductive KT models. Additionally, we explore the performance of SINKT on the inductive KT task and provide insights into various modules.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we introduce the novel task of Open-domain Urban Itinerary Planning (OUIP), which generates personalized urban itineraries from user requests in natural language. We then present ITINERA, an OUIP system that integrates spatial optimization with large language models to provide customized urban itineraries based on user needs. This involves decomposing user requests, selecting candidate points of interest (POIs), ordering the POIs based on cluster-aware spatial optimization, and generating the itinerary. Experiments on real-world datasets and the performance of the deployed system demonstrate our system's capacity to deliver personalized and spatially coherent itineraries compared to current solutions.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Multitask Deep Learning Model for Classification and Regression of Hyperspectral Images: Application to the large-scale dataset](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16384v1)** | 2024-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multitask learning is a widely recognized technique in the field of computer vision and deep learning domain. However, it is still a research question in remote sensing, particularly for hyperspectral imaging. Moreover, most of the research in the remote sensing domain focuses on small and single-task-based annotated datasets, which limits the generalizability and scalability of the developed models to more diverse and complex real-world scenarios. Thus, in this study, we propose a multitask deep learning model designed to perform multiple classification and regression tasks simultaneously on hyperspectral images. We validated our approach on a large hyperspectral dataset called TAIGA, which contains 13 forest variables, including three categorical variables and ten continuous variables with different biophysical parameters. We design a sharing encoder and task-specific decoder network to streamline feature learning while allowing each task-specific decoder to focus on the unique aspects of its respective task. Additionally, a dense atrous pyramid pooling layer and attention network were integrated to extract multi-scale contextual information and enable selective information processing by prioritizing task-specific features. Further, we computed multitask loss and optimized its parameters for the proposed framework to improve the model performance and efficiency across diverse tasks. A comprehensive qualitative and quantitative analysis of the results shows that the proposed method significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art methods. We trained our model across 10 seeds/trials to ensure robustness. Our proposed model demonstrates higher mean performance while maintaining lower or equivalent variability. To make the work reproducible, the codes will be available at https://github.com/Koushikey4596/Multitask-Deep-Learning-Model-for-Taiga-datatset.</p></details> |  |

Obtaining three-dimensional structural information on these PPIs serves as a foundation to interfere with those or to guide drug design. Various strategies can be followed to model those complexes, all typically resulting in a large number of models. A challenging step in this process is the identification of good models (near-native PPI conformations) from the large pool of generated models.

Despite the recent success of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) in image-language understanding and reasoning, they deal with VideoQA insufficiently, by simply taking uniformly sampled frames as visual inputs, which ignores question-relevant visual clues. Moreover, there are no human annotations for question-critical timestamps in existing VideoQA datasets. In light of this, we propose a novel weakly supervised framework to enforce the LMMs to reason out the answers with question-critical moments as visual inputs. Specifically, we first fuse the question and answer pairs as event descriptions to find multiple keyframes as target moments and pseudo-labels, with the visual-language alignment capability of the CLIP models. With these pseudo-labeled keyframes as additionally weak supervision, we devise a lightweight Gaussian-based Contrastive Grounding (GCG) module. GCG learns multiple Gaussian functions to characterize the temporal structure of the video, and sample question-critical frames as positive moments to be the visual inputs of LMMs. Extensive experiments on several benchmarks verify the effectiveness of our framework, and we achieve substantial improvements compared to previous state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by ACM Multimedia 2024</p></details> |

However, the intricate and irregular nature of clinical data associated with acute stroke, particularly blood pressure (BP) measurements, presents substantial obstacles to effective visual analytics and decision-making. Through a year-long collaboration with experienced neurologists, we developed PhenoFlow, a visual analytics system that leverages the collaboration between human and Large Language Models (LLMs) to analyze the extensive and complex data of acute ischemic stroke patients. PhenoFlow pioneers an innovative workflow, where the LLM serves as a data wrangler while neurologists explore and supervise the output using visualizations and natural language interactions. This approach enables neurologists to focus more on decision-making with reduced cognitive load. To protect sensitive patient information, PhenoFlow only utilizes metadata to make inferences and synthesize executable codes, without accessing raw patient data. This ensures that the results are both reproducible and interpretable while maintaining patient privacy. The system incorporates a slice-and-wrap design that employs temporal folding to create an overlaid circular visualization. Combined with a linear bar graph, this design aids in exploring meaningful patterns within irregularly measured BP data. Through case studies, PhenoFlow has demonstrated its capability to support iterative analysis of extensive clinical datasets, reducing cognitive load and enabling neurologists to make well-informed decisions. Grounded in long-term collaboration with domain experts, our research demonstrates the potential of utilizing LLMs to tackle current challenges in data-driven clinical decision-making for acute ischemic stroke patients.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 5 figures, paper to appear in IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics (TVCG) (Proc.

An Novel Benchmark for Accident Anticipation and Localization with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16277v1)** | 2024-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As autonomous driving systems increasingly become part of daily transportation, the ability to accurately anticipate and mitigate potential traffic accidents is paramount. Traditional accident anticipation models primarily utilizing dashcam videos are adept at predicting when an accident may occur but fall short in localizing the incident and identifying involved entities. Addressing this gap, this study introduces a novel framework that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance predictive capabilities across multiple dimensions--what, when, and where accidents might occur. We develop an innovative chain-based attention mechanism that dynamically adjusts to prioritize high-risk elements within complex driving scenes. This mechanism is complemented by a three-stage model that processes outputs from smaller models into detailed multimodal inputs for LLMs, thus enabling a more nuanced understanding of traffic dynamics. Empirical validation on the DAD, CCD, and A3D datasets demonstrates superior performance in Average Precision (AP) and Mean Time-To-Accident (mTTA), establishing new benchmarks for accident prediction technology. Our approach not only advances the technological framework for autonomous driving safety but also enhances human-AI interaction, making predictive insights generated by autonomous systems more intuitive and actionable.</p></details> |  |

There are two popular lines of work to address automated vulnerability detection. On one hand, Static Application Security Testing (SAST) is usually utilized to scan source code for security vulnerabilities, especially in industries. On the other hand, deep learning (DL)-based methods, especially since the introduction of large language models (LLMs), have demonstrated their potential in software vulnerability detection. However, there is no comparative study between SAST tools and LLMs, aiming to determine their effectiveness in vulnerability detection, understand the pros and cons of both SAST and LLMs, and explore the potential combination of these two families of approaches. In this paper, we compared 15 diverse SAST tools with 12 popular or state-of-the-art open-source LLMs in detecting software vulnerabilities from repositories of three popular programming languages: Java, C, and Python. The experimental results showed that SAST tools obtain low vulnerability detection rates with relatively low false positives, while LLMs can detect up 90\% to 100\% of vulnerabilities but suffer from high false positives. By further ensembling the SAST tools and LLMs, the drawbacks of both SAST tools and LLMs can be mitigated to some extent. Our analysis sheds light on both the current progress and future directions for software vulnerability detection.</p></details> |  |

Investigating Abstention Abilities of Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16221v1)** | 2024-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve remarkable performance across various NLP tasks, their reliability becomes essential for widespread adoption. This paper focuses on Abstention Ability (AA), a critical yet under explored aspect of reliability - the ability of LLMs to refrain from answering questions when they are uncertain or when definitive answer is not possible, while maintaining question-answering (QA) task performance. While previous works have focused on understanding the recollection abilities of LLMs or their ability to identify imponderable/unanswerable questions, we believe there is a need for an effective AA evaluation method. Therefore, we propose a black-box evaluation methodology to examine and understand the AA of LLMs across a variety of multiple-choice QA tasks. We measure AA by rewarding models for abstaining from answering when their predictions are incorrect or when the questions are inherently unanswerable. We investigate three strategies, Strict Prompting, Verbal Confidence Thresholding, and Chain-of-Thought (CoT), to understand their impact on abstention across different LLMs. Our findings reveal that while even state-of-the-art LLMs like GPT-4 struggle with abstention, strategic prompting such as CoT, can significantly enhance this ability. Furthermore, we demonstrate that improving AA also leads to better overall QA task performance, underscoring the importance of evaluating AA in LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages (5th page contains References) and 2 figures</p></details> |

Large Language Models such as GPTs fail to provide answers to questions that were derived from sensitive confidential information. This information which is specific to some organisations is not available to LLMs due to privacy constraints. This is where knowledge-augmented retrieval techniques become particularly useful. The proposed platform is designed to cater to the needs of learners from divergent fields. Today, the most common format of learning is video and books, which our proposed platform allows learners to interact and ask questions. This increases learners' focus time exponentially by restricting access to pertinent content and, at the same time allowing personalized access and freedom to gain in-depth knowledge. Instructor's roles and responsibilities are significantly simplified allowing them to train a larger audience. To preserve privacy, instructors can grant course access to specific individuals, enabling personalized conversation on the provided content. This work includes an extensive spectrum of software development and product management skills, which also circumscribe knowledge of cloud computing for running Large Language Models and maintaining the application. For Frontend development, which is responsible for user interaction and user experience, Streamlit and React framework have been utilized. To improve security and privacy, the server is routed to a domain with an SSL certificate, and all the API key/s are stored securely on an AWS EC2 instance, to enhance user experience, web connectivity to an Android Studio-based mobile app has been established, and in-process to publish the app on play store, thus addressing all major software engineering disciplines</p></details> |  |

However, despite the impressive achievements, these models still have numerous security vulnerabilities, particularly when faced with jailbreak attacks. Therefore, by investigating jailbreak attacks, we can uncover hidden weaknesses in LLMs and guide us in developing more robust defense mechanisms to fortify their security. In this paper, we further explore the boundary of jailbreak attacks on LLMs and propose Analyzing-based Jailbreak (ABJ). This effective jailbreak attack method takes advantage of LLMs' growing analyzing and reasoning capability and reveals their underlying vulnerabilities when facing analysis-based tasks. We conduct a detailed evaluation of ABJ across various open-source and closed-source LLMs, which achieves 94.8% Attack Success Rate (ASR) and 1.06 Attack Efficiency (AE) on GPT-4-turbo-0409, demonstrating state-of-the-art attack effectiveness and efficiency.

However, the quadratic complexity of the vision encoder in MLLMs constrains the resolution of input images. Most current approaches mitigate this issue by cropping high-resolution images into smaller sub-images, which are then processed independently by the vision encoder. Despite capturing sufficient local details, these sub-images lack global context and fail to interact with one another. To address this limitation, we propose a novel MLLM, INF-LLaVA, designed for effective high-resolution image perception. INF-LLaVA incorporates two innovative components. First, we introduce a Dual-perspective Cropping Module (DCM), which ensures that each sub-image contains continuous details from a local perspective and comprehensive information from a global perspective. Second, we introduce Dual-perspective Enhancement Module (DEM) to enable the mutual enhancement of global and local features, allowing INF-LLaVA to effectively process high-resolution images by simultaneously capturing detailed local information and comprehensive global context. Extensive ablation studies validate the effectiveness of these components, and experiments on a diverse set of benchmarks demonstrate that INF-LLaVA outperforms existing MLLMs. Code and pretrained model are available at https://github.com/WeihuangLin/INF-LLaVA.</p></details> |  |

Despite advancements in low-code tools for UI automation, their complexity remains a significant barrier to adoption among non-technical business users. However, recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have created new opportunities to overcome this barrier by offering more powerful, yet simpler and more human-centric programming environments. This paper presents IDA (Intelligent Digital Apprentice), a novel no-code Web UI automation tool designed specifically to empower business users with no technical background. IDA incorporates human-centric design principles, including guided programming by demonstration, semantic programming model, and teacher-student learning metaphor which is tailored to the skill set of business users. By leveraging LLMs, IDA overcomes some of the key technical barriers that have traditionally limited the possibility of no-code solutions. We have developed a prototype of IDA and conducted a user study involving real world business users and enterprise applications. The promising results indicate that users could effectively utilize IDA to create automation. The qualitative feedback indicates that IDA is perceived as user-friendly and trustworthy. This study contributes to unlocking the potential of AI assistants to enhance the productivity of business users through no-code user interface automation.</p></details> |  |

In this work we contribute to the debate by presenting a theoretical model that can be used as a threshold conception for artificial agents. The model defines agents as systems whose actions and goals are always influenced by a dynamic framework of factors that consists of the agent's accessible history, its adaptive repertoire and its external environment. This framework, in turn, is influenced by the actions that the agent takes and the goals that it forms. We show with the help of the model that state-of-the-art LLMs are not agents yet, but that there are elements to them that suggest a way forward. The paper argues that a combination of the agent architecture presented in Park et al. (2023) together with the use of modules like the Coscientist in Boiko et al.

It focuses on using advanced models to create secure, HIPAA-compliant synthetic patient notes for biomedical research. The study used de-identified and re-identified MIMIC III datasets with GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and Mistral 7B to generate synthetic notes. Text generation employed templates and keyword extraction for contextually relevant notes, with one-shot generation for comparison. Privacy assessment checked PHI occurrence, while text utility was tested using an ICD-9 coding task. Text quality was evaluated with ROUGE and cosine similarity metrics to measure semantic similarity with source notes. Analysis of PHI occurrence and text utility via the ICD-9 coding task showed that the keyword-based method had low risk and good performance. One-shot generation showed the highest PHI exposure and PHI co-occurrence, especially in geographic location and date categories. The Normalized One-shot method achieved the highest classification accuracy. Privacy analysis revealed a critical balance between data utility and privacy protection, influencing future data use and sharing. Re-identified data consistently outperformed de-identified data. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of keyword-based methods in generating privacy-protecting synthetic clinical notes that retain data usability, potentially transforming clinical data-sharing practices. The superior performance of re-identified over de-identified data suggests a shift towards methods that enhance utility and privacy by using dummy PHIs to perplex privacy attacks.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 4 figures, 1 table, 1 supplementary, under review</p></details> |

Due to the scarcity of datasets, current methods easily suffer from learning bias. To solve this problem, we embed a Large Language Model (LLM) as knowledge into the GNN explanation network to avoid the learning bias problem. We inject LLM as a Bayesian Inference (BI) module to mitigate learning bias. The efficacy of the BI module has been proven both theoretically and experimentally. We conduct experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets. The innovation of our work lies in two parts: 1. We provide a novel view of the possibility of an LLM functioning as a Bayesian inference to improve the performance of existing algorithms; 2. We are the first to discuss the learning bias issues in the GNN explanation problem.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint Paper with 13 pages</p></details> |

Existing methods focus heavily on using complex mechanisms and extensive model tuning methods to model the multimodal interaction on specific datasets. However, these methods overcomplicate the MEL task and overlook the visual semantic information, which makes them costly and hard to scale. Moreover, these methods can not solve the issues like textual ambiguity, redundancy, and noisy images, which severely degrade their performance. Fortunately, the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) with robust capabilities in text understanding and reasoning, particularly Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) that can process multimodal inputs, provides new insights into addressing this challenge. However, how to design a universally applicable LLMs-based MEL approach remains a pressing challenge. To this end, we propose UniMEL, a unified framework which establishes a new paradigm to process multimodal entity linking tasks using LLMs. In this framework, we employ LLMs to augment the representation of mentions and entities individually by integrating textual and visual information and refining textual information. Subsequently, we employ the embedding-based method for retrieving and re-ranking candidate entities. Then, with only ~0.26% of the model parameters fine-tuned, LLMs can make the final selection from the candidate entities. Extensive experiments on three public benchmark datasets demonstrate that our solution achieves state-of-the-art performance, and ablation studies verify the effectiveness of all modules. Our code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/UniMEL/.</p></details> | <details><summary>CIKM ...</summary><p>CIKM 2024.

Knowledge Distillation (KD) has emerged as an effective strategy to improve the performance of a smaller LLM (i.e., the student model) by transferring knowledge from a high-performing LLM (i.e., the teacher model). Prevailing techniques in LLM distillation typically use a black-box model API to generate high-quality pretrained and aligned datasets, or utilize white-box distillation by altering the loss function to better transfer knowledge from the teacher LLM. However, these methods ignore the knowledge differences between the student and teacher LLMs across domains. This results in excessive focus on domains with minimal performance gaps and insufficient attention to domains with large gaps, reducing overall performance. In this paper, we introduce a new LLM distillation framework called DDK, which dynamically adjusts the composition of the distillation dataset in a smooth manner according to the domain performance differences between the teacher and student models, making the distillation process more stable and effective. Extensive evaluations show that DDK significantly improves the performance of student models, outperforming both continuously pretrained baselines and existing knowledge distillation methods by a large margin.</p></details> |  |

Examining the Representativeness Heuristic in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01461v4)** | 2024-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in modeling text and generating human-like text, they may exhibit biases acquired from training data in doing so. Specifically, LLMs may be susceptible to a common cognitive trap in human decision-making called the representativeness heuristic. This is a concept in psychology that refers to judging the likelihood of an event based on how closely it resembles a well-known prototype or typical example, versus considering broader facts or statistical evidence. This research investigates the impact of the representativeness heuristic on LLM reasoning. We created ReHeAT (Representativeness Heuristic AI Testing), a dataset containing a series of problems spanning six common types of representativeness heuristics. Experiments reveal that four LLMs applied to ReHeAT all exhibited representativeness heuristic biases. We further identify that the model's reasoning steps are often incorrectly based on a stereotype rather than on the problem's description. Interestingly, the performance improves when adding a hint in the prompt to remind the model to use its knowledge. This suggests the uniqueness of the representativeness heuristic compared to traditional biases. It can occur even when LLMs possess the correct knowledge while falling into a cognitive trap. This highlights the importance of future research focusing on the representativeness heuristic in model reasoning and decision-making and on developing solutions to address it.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a conference paper at COLM 2024</p></details> |

Recent works attempt to complete KGs in a text-generation manner with large language models (LLMs). However, they need to ground the output of LLMs to KG entities, which inevitably brings errors. In this paper, we present a finetuning framework, DIFT, aiming to unleash the KG completion ability of LLMs and avoid grounding errors. Given an incomplete fact, DIFT employs a lightweight model to obtain candidate entities and finetunes an LLM with discrimination instructions to select the correct one from the given candidates. To improve performance while reducing instruction data, DIFT uses a truncated sampling method to select useful facts for finetuning and injects KG embeddings into the LLM. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in the 23rd International Semantic Web Conference (ISWC 2024)</p></details> |

In this project, we address the GeoLingIt challenge of geolocalizing tweets written in Italian by leveraging large language models (LLMs). GeoLingIt requires the prediction of both the region and the precise coordinates of the tweet. Our approach involves fine-tuning pre-trained LLMs to simultaneously predict these geolocalization aspects. By integrating innovative methodologies, we enhance the models' ability to understand the nuances of Italian social media text to improve the state-of-the-art in this domain.

The more practically useful exploration of more complex alignments remains a hard problem to automate, and as such is largely underexplored, i.e. in application practice it is usually done manually by ontology and domain experts. Recently, the surge in Natural Language Processing (NLP) capabilities, driven by advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs), presents new opportunities for enhancing ontology engineering practices, including ontology alignment tasks. This paper investigates the application of LLM technologies to tackle the complex ontology alignment challenge. Leveraging a prompt-based approach and integrating rich ontology content so-called modules our work constitutes a significant advance towards automating the complex alignment task.</p></details> |  |

In handball, few nations will fight hard to win the precious metal with speculations predicting the victory for France or Denmark for men and France or Norway for women. However, there is so far no scientific method proposed to predict the final results of the competition. In this work, we leverage a deep learning model to predict the results of the handball tournament of the 2024 Olympic Games. This model, coupled with explainable AI (xAI) techniques, allows us to extract insightful information about the main factors influencing the outcome of each match. Notably, xAI helps sports experts understand how factors like match information or individual athlete performance contribute to the predictions. Furthermore, we integrate Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate human-friendly explanations that highlight the most important factors impacting the match results. By providing human-centric explanations, our approach offers a deeper understanding of the AI predictions, making them more actionable for coaches and analysts.</p></details> |  |

Generalizable and MVS-based NeRFs, although capable of mitigating training time, often incur tradeoffs in quality. This paper presents a novel approach called BoostMVSNeRFs to enhance the rendering quality of MVS-based NeRFs in large-scale scenes. We first identify limitations in MVS-based NeRF methods, such as restricted viewport coverage and artifacts due to limited input views. Then, we address these limitations by proposing a new method that selects and combines multiple cost volumes during volume rendering. Our method does not require training and can adapt to any MVS-based NeRF methods in a feed-forward fashion to improve rendering quality. Furthermore, our approach is also end-to-end trainable, allowing fine-tuning on specific scenes. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through experiments on large-scale datasets, showing significant rendering quality improvements in large-scale scenes and unbounded outdoor scenarios.

Specifically, the Slow pathway extracts features at a low frame rate while keeping as many spatial details as possible (e.g., with 24x24 tokens), and the Fast pathway operates on a high frame rate but uses a larger spatial pooling stride (e.g., downsampling 6x) to focus on the motion cues. As a result, this design allows us to adequately capture both spatial and temporal features that are beneficial for understanding details along the video. Experimental results show that SF-LLaVA outperforms existing training-free methods on a wide range of video tasks. On some benchmarks, it achieves comparable or even better performance compared to state-of-the-art Video LLMs that are fine-tuned on video datasets.</p></details> | Technical report |

To develop versatile SLMs, large-scale and diverse speech datasets are essential. Additionally, to ensure hiqh-quality speech generation, the data must be spontaneous like in-wild data and must be acoustically clean with noise removed. Despite the critical need, no open-source corpus meeting all these criteria has been available. This study addresses this gap by constructing and releasing a large-scale spoken dialogue corpus, named Japanese Corpus for Human-AI Talks (J-CHAT), which is publicly accessible. Furthermore, this paper presents a language-independent method for corpus construction and describes experiments on dialogue generation using SLMs trained on J-CHAT. Experimental results indicate that the collected data from multiple domains by our method improve the naturalness and meaningfulness of dialogue generation.</p></details> | 8 pages, 6 figures |

An Investigation into Limitations and Scalability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15720v1)** | 2024-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for many AI problems and exhibit remarkable in-context learning (ICL) capabilities. Compositional ability, solving unseen complex tasks that combine two or more simple tasks, is an essential reasoning ability for Artificial General Intelligence. Despite LLM's tremendous success, how they approach composite tasks, especially those not encountered during the pretraining phase, remains an open question and largely ununderstood. In this study, we delve into the ICL capabilities of LLMs on composite tasks, with only simple tasks as in-context examples. We develop a test suite of composite tasks that include linguistic and logical challenges and perform empirical studies across different LLM families. We observe that models exhibit divergent behaviors: (1) For simpler composite tasks that apply distinct mapping mechanisms to different input segments, the models demonstrate decent compositional ability, while scaling up the model enhances this ability; (2) for more complex composite tasks that involving reasoning multiple steps, where each step represent one task, models typically underperform, and scaling up generally provide no improvements. We offer theoretical analysis in a simplified setting, explaining that models exhibit compositional capability when the task handles different input parts separately. We believe our work sheds new light on the capabilities of LLMs in solving composite tasks regarding the nature of the tasks and model scale.

System logs generated by these devices serve as valuable repositories of historical trends and past failures. The use of machine learning techniques for failure prediction has become commonplace, enabling the extraction of insights from past data to anticipate future behavior patterns. Recently, large language models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in tasks including summarization, reasoning, and event prediction. Therefore, in this paper, we endeavor to investigate the potential of large language models in predicting system failures, leveraging insights learned from past failure behavior to inform reasoning and decision-making processes effectively. Our approach involves leveraging data from the Intel Computing Improvement Program (ICIP) system crash logs to identify significant events and develop CrashEventLLM. This model, built upon a large language model framework, serves as our foundation for crash event prediction. Specifically, our model utilizes historical data to forecast future crash events, informed by expert annotations. Additionally, it goes beyond mere prediction, offering insights into potential causes for each crash event.

The primary difficulty is fine-tuning the model after pruning, which is needed to recover the lost performance caused by dropping weights. Recent approaches have either ignored fine-tuning entirely, focusing on efficient pruning criteria, or attempted layer-wise weight updates, preserving the behavior of each layer. However, even layer-wise weight updates can be costly for LLMs, and previous works have resorted to various approximations. In our paper, we propose a fast and effective weight update algorithm for pruned layers based on the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM). We further extend it with a simple gradual pruning mask selection and achieve state-of-the-art pruning performance across a wide range of LLMs. Code is available at https://github.com/fmfi-compbio/admm-pruning.</p></details> |  |

Although Bayesian methods are common in spatio-temporal modeling, standard Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques are usually slow for large datasets such as house price data. To tackle this problem, we propose a divide-and-conquer spatio-temporal modeling approach. This method involves partitioning the data into multiple subsets and applying an appropriate Gaussian process model to each subset in parallel. The results from each subset are then combined using the Wasserstein barycenter technique to obtain the global parameters for the original problem. The proposed methodology allows for multiple observations per spatial and time unit, thereby offering added benefits for practitioners. As a real-life application, we analyze house price data of more than 0.6 million transactions from 983 middle layer super output areas in London over a period of eight years. The methodology provides insightful findings about the effects of various amenities, trend patterns, and the relationship between prices and carbon emissions. Furthermore, as demonstrated through a cross-validation study, it shows good predictive accuracy while balancing computational efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Suppl...</summary><p>Supplementary material is available from the authors upon request</p></details> |

The evolution of these models has also led to an increase in the model size and energy requirement, making it difficult to deploy in production on low compute devices. An increase in the number of connected devices around the world warrants compressed models that can be easily deployed at the local devices with low compute capacity and power accessibility. A wide range of solutions have been proposed by different researchers to reduce the size and complexity of such models, prominent among them are, Weight Quantization, Parameter Pruning, Network Pruning, low-rank representation, weights sharing, neural architecture search, knowledge distillation etc. In this research work, we investigate the performance impacts on various trained deep learning models, compressed using quantization and pruning techniques. We implemented both, quantization and pruning, compression techniques on popular deep learning models used in the image classification, object detection, language models and generative models-based problem statements. We also explored performance of various large language models (LLMs) after quantization and low rank adaptation. We used the standard evaluation metrics (model's size, accuracy, and inference time) for all the related problem statements and concluded this paper by discussing the challenges and future work.</p></details> |  |

However LLMs often generate outdated or inaccurate information based on static training datasets. Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) mitigates this by integrating outside data sources. While previous RAG systems used pre-assembled, fixed databases with limited flexibility, we have developed Radiology RAG (RadioRAG) as an end-to-end framework that retrieves data from authoritative radiologic online sources in real-time. RadioRAG is evaluated using a dedicated radiologic question-and-answer dataset (RadioQA). We evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of various LLMs when answering radiology-specific questions with and without access to additional online information via RAG. Using 80 questions from RSNA Case Collection across radiologic subspecialties and 24 additional expert-curated questions, for which the correct gold-standard answers were available, LLMs (GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4, Mistral-7B, Mixtral-8x7B, and Llama3 [8B and 70B]) were prompted with and without RadioRAG. RadioRAG retrieved context-specific information from www.radiopaedia.org in real-time and incorporated them into its reply. RadioRAG consistently improved diagnostic accuracy across all LLMs, with relative improvements ranging from 2% to 54%. It matched or exceeded question answering without RAG across radiologic subspecialties, particularly in breast imaging and emergency radiology. However, degree of improvement varied among models; GPT-3.5-turbo and Mixtral-8x7B-instruct-v0.1 saw notable gains, while Mistral-7B-instruct-v0.2 showed no improvement, highlighting variability in its effectiveness. LLMs benefit when provided access to domain-specific data beyond their training data. For radiology, RadioRAG establishes a robust framework that substantially improves diagnostic accuracy and factuality in radiological question answering.</p></details> |  |

Existing datasets, however, often cover limited areas and are typically captured using a single platform. To address this gap, we present a diverse large-scale dataset specifically designed for 4D radar-based localization and mapping. This dataset was gathered using three different platforms: a handheld device, an e-bike, and an SUV, under a variety of environmental conditions, including clear days, nighttime, and heavy rain. The data collection occurred from September 2023 to February 2024, encompassing diverse settings such as roads in a vegetated campus and tunnels on highways. Each route was traversed multiple times to facilitate place recognition evaluations. The sensor suite included a 3D lidar, 4D radars, stereo cameras, consumer-grade IMUs, and a GNSS/INS system. Sensor data packets were synchronized to GNSS time using a two-step process: a convex hull algorithm was applied to smooth host time jitter, and then odometry and correlation algorithms were used to correct constant time offsets. Extrinsic calibration between sensors was achieved through manual measurements and subsequent nonlinear optimization. The reference motion for the platforms was generated by registering lidar scans to a terrestrial laser scanner (TLS) point cloud map using a lidar inertial odometry (LIO) method in localization mode. Additionally, a data reversion technique was introduced to enable backward LIO processing. We believe this dataset will boost research in radar-based point cloud registration, odometry, mapping, and place recognition.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 4 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

This hallucination phenomenon has led to users' distrust in information retrieval systems based on LLMs. To tackle this challenge, this paper proposes Dynamic Retrieval Augmentation based on hallucination Detection (DRAD) as a novel method to detect and mitigate hallucinations in LLMs. DRAD improves upon traditional retrieval augmentation by dynamically adapting the retrieval process based on real-time hallucination detection. It features two main components: Real-time Hallucination Detection (RHD) for identifying potential hallucinations without external models, and Self-correction based on External Knowledge (SEK) for correcting these errors using external knowledge. Experiment results show that DRAD demonstrates superior performance in both detecting and mitigating hallucinations in LLMs. All of our code and data are open-sourced at https://github.com/oneal2000/EntityHallucination.</p></details> |  |

While there has been a burgeoning trend in research focusing on the employment of LLMs in supporting different medical tasks (e.g., enhancing clinical diagnostics and providing medical education), a review of these efforts, particularly their development, practical applications, and outcomes in medicine, remains scarce. Therefore, this review aims to provide a detailed overview of the development and deployment of LLMs in medicine, including the challenges and opportunities they face. In terms of development, we provide a detailed introduction to the principles of existing medical LLMs, including their basic model structures, number of parameters, and sources and scales of data used for model development.

| **[Decomposition of Neural Discrete Representations for Large-Scale 3D Mapping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15554v1)** | 2024-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning efficient representations of local features is a key challenge in feature volume-based 3D neural mapping, especially in large-scale environments. In this paper, we introduce Decomposition-based Neural Mapping (DNMap), a storage-efficient large-scale 3D mapping method that employs a discrete representation based on a decomposition strategy. This decomposition strategy aims to efficiently capture repetitive and representative patterns of shapes by decomposing each discrete embedding into component vectors that are shared across the embedding space. Our DNMap optimizes a set of component vectors, rather than entire discrete embeddings, and learns composition rather than indexing the discrete embeddings. Furthermore, to complement the mapping quality, we additionally learn low-resolution continuous embeddings that require tiny storage space. By combining these representations with a shallow neural network and an efficient octree-based feature volume, our DNMap successfully approximates signed distance functions and compresses the feature volume while preserving mapping quality. Our source code is available at https://github.com/minseong-p/dnmap.</p></details> | ECCV 2024 |

| **[MAPLE: Multilingual Evaluation of Parameter Efficient Finetuning of Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07598v3)** | 2024-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Parameter Efficient Finetuning (PEFT) has emerged as a viable solution for improving the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) without requiring massive resources and compute. Prior work on multilingual evaluation has shown that there is a large gap between the performance of LLMs on English and other languages. Further, there is also a large gap between the performance of smaller open-source models and larger LLMs. Finetuning can be an effective way to bridge this gap and make language models more equitable. In this work, we finetune the LLama-2-7B and Mistral-7B models on two synthetic multilingual instruction tuning datasets to determine its effect on model performance on six downstream tasks covering forty languages in all. Additionally, we experiment with various parameters, such as rank for low-rank adaptation and values of quantisation to determine their effects on downstream performance and find that higher rank and higher quantisation values benefit low-resource languages. We find that PEFT of smaller open-source models sometimes bridges the gap between the performance of these models and the larger ones, however, English performance can take a hit. We also find that finetuning sometimes improves performance on low-resource languages, while degrading performance on high-resource languages.</p></details> | <details><summary>46 pa...</summary><p>46 pages, 23 figures, 45 tables.

| **[Mélange: Cost Efficient Large Language Model Serving by Exploiting GPU Heterogeneity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14527v4)** | 2024-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into many online services, yet they remain cost-prohibitive to deploy due to the requirement of expensive GPU instances. Prior work has addressed the high cost of LLM serving by improving the inference engine, but less attention has been given to selecting the most cost-efficient GPU type(s) for a specific LLM service. There is a large and growing landscape of GPU types and, within these options, higher cost does not always lead to increased performance. Instead, through a comprehensive investigation, we find that three key LLM service characteristics (request size, request rate, SLO) strongly influence GPU cost efficiency, and differing GPU types are most cost efficient for differing LLM service settings. As a result, the most cost-efficient allocation for a given service is typically a mix of heterogeneous GPU types. Based on this analysis, we introduce M\'elange, a GPU allocation framework that navigates these diverse LLM service characteristics and heterogeneous GPU option space to automatically and efficiently derive the minimal-cost GPU allocation for a given LLM service. We formulate the GPU allocation task as a cost-aware bin packing problem where GPUs are bins and items are slices of the service workload. Our formulation's constraints account for a service's unique characteristics, allowing M\'elange to be flexible to support diverse service settings and heterogeneity-aware to adapt the GPU allocation to a specific service. Compared to using only a single GPU type, M\'elange reduces deployment costs by up to 77% in conversational settings, 33% in document-based settings, and 51% in a mixed setting.</p></details> |  |

Whereas traditional Markowitz-based mean-variance portfolios are widespread, network-based optimisation techniques have built upon these developments. However, most studies do not contain firms at risk of default and remove any firms that drop off indices over a certain time. This is the first study to incorporate risky firms and use all the firms in portfolio optimisation. We propose and empirically test a novel method that leverages Graph Attention networks (GATs), a subclass of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). GNNs, as deep learning-based models, can exploit network data to uncover nonlinear relationships. Their ability to handle high-dimensional features and accommodate customised layers for specific purposes makes them particularly appealing for large-scale problems such as mid- and small-cap portfolio optimization. This study utilises 30 years of data on mid-cap firms, creating graphs of firms using distance correlation and the Triangulated Maximally Filtered Graph approach. These graphs are the inputs to a GAT model that we train using custom layers which impose weight and allocation constraints and a loss function derived from the Sharpe ratio, thus directly maximising portfolio risk-adjusted returns. This new model is benchmarked against a network characteristic-based portfolio, a mean variance-based portfolio, and an equal-weighted portfolio. The results show that the portfolio produced by the GAT-based model outperforms all benchmarks and is consistently superior to other strategies over a long period while also being informative of market dynamics.</p></details> | <details><summary>37 pa...</summary><p>37 pages, 7 figures, v1</p></details> |
| **[Key-Point-Driven Mathematical Reasoning Distillation of Large Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10167v2)** | 2024-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional proficiency in mathematical reasoning tasks due to their extensive parameter counts and training on vast datasets. Despite these capabilities, deploying LLMs is hindered by their computational demands. Distilling LLM mathematical reasoning into Smaller Language Models (SLMs) has emerged as a solution to this challenge, although these smaller models often suffer from errors in calculation and semantic understanding. Prior work has proposed Program-of-Thought Distillation (PoTD) to avoid calculation error. To further address semantic understanding errors, we propose Key-Point-Driven Mathematical Reasoning Distillation (KPDD). KPDD enhances the reasoning performance of SLMs by breaking down the problem-solving process into three stages: Core Question Extraction, Problem-Solving Information Extraction, and Step-by-Step Solution. This method is further divided into KPDD-CoT, which generates Chain-of-Thought rationales, and KPDD-PoT, which creates Program-of-Thought rationales. The experiment results show that KPDD-CoT significantly improves reasoning abilities, while KPDD-PoT achieves state-of-the-art performance in mathematical reasoning tasks. Our approach effectively mitigates misunderstanding errors, advancing the deployment of efficient and capable SLMs.</p></details> |  |

While targeting to reduce the computational costs by diffusion in latent space, latent diffusion models also offer the possibility to integrate physical knowledge into the generation process. We tailor latent diffusion models to sea-ice physics with a censored Gaussian distribution in data space to generate data that follows the physical bounds of the modelled variables. Our latent diffusion models reach similar scores as the diffusion model trained in data space, but they smooth the generated fields as caused by the latent mapping. While enforcing physical bounds cannot reduce the smoothing, it improves the representation of the marginal ice zone. Therefore, for large-scale Earth system modelling, latent diffusion models can have many advantages compared to diffusion in data space if the significant barrier of smoothing can be resolved.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 5 Figures, Camera-ready version for the ICML 2024 Machine Learning for Earth System Modeling workshop</p></details> |

Leveraging meta-task prompting, MetaEOL guides LLMs to produce embeddings through a series of carefully designed prompts that address multiple representational aspects. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that embeddings averaged from various meta-tasks are versatile embeddings that yield competitive performance on Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) benchmarks and excel in downstream tasks, surpassing contrastive-trained models. Our findings suggest a new scaling law, offering a versatile and resource-efficient approach for embedding generation across diverse scenarios.</p></details> | ACL 2024 |

However, no text-to-MIDI models currently exist due to the lack of a captioned MIDI dataset. This work aims to enable research that combines LLMs with symbolic music by presenting, the first openly available large-scale MIDI dataset with text captions. MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) files are widely used for encoding musical information and can capture the nuances of musical composition. They are widely used by music producers, composers, musicologists, and performers alike. Inspired by recent advancements in captioning techniques, we present a curated dataset of over 168k MIDI files with textual descriptions. Each MIDI caption describes the musical content, including tempo, chord progression, time signature, instruments, genre, and mood, thus facilitating multi-modal exploration and analysis. The dataset encompasses various genres, styles, and complexities, offering a rich data source for training and evaluating models for tasks such as music information retrieval, music understanding, and cross-modal translation. We provide detailed statistics about the dataset and have assessed the quality of the captions in an extensive listening study. We anticipate that this resource will stimulate further research at the intersection of music and natural language processing, fostering advancements in both fields.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in ISMIR2024</p></details> |

We introduce TokenSHAP, a novel method for interpreting LLMs by attributing importance to individual tokens or substrings within input prompts. This approach adapts Shapley values from cooperative game theory to natural language processing, offering a rigorous framework for understanding how different parts of an input contribute to a model's response. TokenSHAP leverages Monte Carlo sampling for computational efficiency, providing interpretable, quantitative measures of token importance. We demonstrate its efficacy across diverse prompts and LLM architectures, showing consistent improvements over existing baselines in alignment with human judgments, faithfulness to model behavior, and consistency. Our method's ability to capture nuanced interactions between tokens provides valuable insights into LLM behavior, enhancing model transparency, improving prompt engineering, and aiding in the development of more reliable AI systems. TokenSHAP represents a significant step towards the necessary interpretability for responsible AI deployment, contributing to the broader goal of creating more transparent, accountable, and trustworthy AI systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[ShortcutsBench: A Large-Scale Real-world Benchmark for API-based Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00132v2)** | 2024-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in integrating large language models (LLMs) with application programming interfaces (APIs) have gained significant interest in both academia and industry. These API-based agents, leveraging the strong autonomy and planning capabilities of LLMs, can efficiently solve problems requiring multi-step actions. However, their ability to handle multi-dimensional difficulty levels, diverse task types, and real-world demands through APIs remains unknown. In this paper, we introduce \textsc{ShortcutsBench}, a large-scale benchmark for the comprehensive evaluation of API-based agents in solving tasks with varying levels of difficulty, diverse task types, and real-world demands. \textsc{ShortcutsBench} includes a wealth of real APIs from Apple Inc.'s operating systems, refined user queries from shortcuts, human-annotated high-quality action sequences from shortcut developers, and accurate parameter filling values about primitive parameter types, enum parameter types, outputs from previous actions, and parameters that need to request necessary information from the system or user. Our extensive evaluation of agents built with $5$ leading open-source (size >= 57B) and $4$ closed-source LLMs (e.g. Gemini-1.5-Pro and GPT-3.5) reveals significant limitations in handling complex queries related to API selection, parameter filling, and requesting necessary information from systems and users. These findings highlight the challenges that API-based agents face in effectively fulfilling real and complex user queries.

Conventional monitoring tools and techniques often struggle to provide a clear understanding of the nature and intent of ICS-specific communications. To enhance comprehension, we propose a software solution powered by a Large Language Model (LLM). This solution currently focused on BACnet protocol, processes a packet file data and extracts context by using a mapping database, and contemporary context retrieval methods for Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). The processed packet information, combined with the extracted context, serves as input to the LLM, which generates a concise packet file summary for the user. The software delivers a clear, coherent, and easily understandable summary of network activities, enabling SOC analysts to better assess the current state of the control system.</p></details> | 12 pages |
| **[LLM4ED: Large Language Models for Automatic Equation Discovery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07761v2)** | 2024-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Equation discovery is aimed at directly extracting physical laws from data and has emerged as a pivotal research domain. Previous methods based on symbolic mathematics have achieved substantial advancements, but often require the design of implementation of complex algorithms. In this paper, we introduce a new framework that utilizes natural language-based prompts to guide large language models (LLMs) in automatically mining governing equations from data. Specifically, we first utilize the generation capability of LLMs to generate diverse equations in string form, and then evaluate the generated equations based on observations. In the optimization phase, we propose two alternately iterated strategies to optimize generated equations collaboratively. The first strategy is to take LLMs as a black-box optimizer and achieve equation self-improvement based on historical samples and their performance. The second strategy is to instruct LLMs to perform evolutionary operators for global search. Experiments are extensively conducted on both partial differential equations and ordinary differential equations. Results demonstrate that our framework can discover effective equations to reveal the underlying physical laws under various nonlinear dynamic systems. Further comparisons are made with state-of-the-art models, demonstrating good stability and usability. Our framework substantially lowers the barriers to learning and applying equation discovery techniques, demonstrating the application potential of LLMs in the field of knowledge discovery.</p></details> |  |

Given the remarkable capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in language and multimodal tasks, this survey provides a detailed overview of recent advancements in video understanding that harness the power of LLMs (Vid-LLMs). The emergent capabilities of Vid-LLMs are surprisingly advanced, particularly their ability for open-ended multi-granularity (general, temporal, and spatiotemporal) reasoning combined with commonsense knowledge, suggesting a promising path for future video understanding. We examine the unique characteristics and capabilities of Vid-LLMs, categorizing the approaches into three main types: Video Analyzer x LLM, Video Embedder x LLM, and (Analyzer + Embedder) x LLM. Furthermore, we identify five sub-types based on the functions of LLMs in Vid-LLMs: LLM as Summarizer, LLM as Manager, LLM as Text Decoder, LLM as Regressor, and LLM as Hidden Layer. Furthermore, this survey presents a comprehensive study of the tasks, datasets, benchmarks, and evaluation methodologies for Vid-LLMs. Additionally, it explores the expansive applications of Vid-LLMs across various domains, highlighting their remarkable scalability and versatility in real-world video understanding challenges. Finally, it summarizes the limitations of existing Vid-LLMs and outlines directions for future research.

While developers have integrated multiple safety mechanisms to mitigate their misuse, a risk remains, particularly when models encounter adversarial inputs. This study unveils an attack mechanism that capitalizes on human conversation strategies to extract harmful information from LLMs. We delineate three pivotal strategies: (i) decomposing malicious questions into seemingly innocent sub-questions; (ii) rewriting overtly malicious questions into more covert, benign-sounding ones; (iii) enhancing the harmfulness of responses by prompting models for illustrative examples. Unlike conventional methods that target explicit malicious responses, our approach delves deeper into the nature of the information provided in responses. Through our experiments conducted on GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4, and Llama2, our method has demonstrated a marked efficacy compared to conventional attack methods. In summary, this work introduces a novel attack method that outperforms previous approaches, raising an important question: How to discern whether the ultimate intent in a dialogue is malicious?</p></details> |  |

ALLaM is carefully trained considering the values of language alignment and knowledge transfer at scale. Our autoregressive decoder-only architecture models demonstrate how second-language acquisition via vocabulary expansion and pretraining on a mixture of Arabic and English text can steer a model towards a new language (Arabic) without any catastrophic forgetting in the original language (English). Furthermore, we highlight the effectiveness of using parallel/translated data to aid the process of knowledge alignment between languages. Finally, we show that extensive alignment with human preferences can significantly enhance the performance of a language model compared to models of a larger scale with lower quality alignment. ALLaM achieves state-of-the-art performance in various Arabic benchmarks, including MMLU Arabic, ACVA, and Arabic Exams. Our aligned models improve both in Arabic and English from their base aligned models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Walking in Others' Shoes: How Perspective-Taking Guides Large Language Models in Reducing Toxicity and Bias](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15366v1)** | 2024-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The common toxicity and societal bias in contents generated by large language models (LLMs) necessitate strategies to reduce harm. Present solutions often demand white-box access to the model or substantial training, which is impractical for cutting-edge commercial LLMs. Moreover, prevailing prompting methods depend on external tool feedback and fail to simultaneously lessen toxicity and bias. Motivated by social psychology principles, we propose a novel strategy named \textbf{perspective-taking prompting (\textsc{PeT})} that inspires LLMs to integrate diverse human perspectives and self-regulate their responses. This self-correction mechanism can significantly diminish toxicity (up to $89\%$) and bias (up to $73\%$) in LLMs' responses. Rigorous evaluations and ablation studies are conducted on two commercial LLMs (ChatGPT and GLM) and three open-source LLMs, revealing \textsc{PeT}'s superiority in producing less harmful responses, outperforming five strong baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Query-OPT: Optimizing Inference of Large Language Models via Multi-Query Instructions in Meeting Summarization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00067v3)** | 2024-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work focuses on the task of query-based meeting summarization in which the summary of a context (meeting transcript) is generated in response to a specific query. When using Large Language Models (LLMs) for this task, usually a new call to the LLM inference endpoint/API is triggered for each new query, even if the context stays the same. However, repeated calls to the LLM inference endpoints would significantly increase the costs of using them in production, making LLMs impractical for many real-world use cases. To address this problem, in this paper, we investigate whether combining the queries for the same input context in a single prompt to minimize repeated calls can be successfully used in meeting summarization. In this regard, we conduct extensive experiments by comparing the performance of various popular LLMs: GPT-4, Gemini, Claude-3, LLaMA-2, Mistral, Phi-3, and Qwen-2 in single-query and multi-query settings. We observe that 100% reliability in generating the response in the expected format is usually limited to certain closed-source LLMs, with most open-source LLMs lagging behind (except a few 7B parameters LLMs like Mistral and Phi-3). We conclude that multi-query prompting could be useful to significantly optimize the inference costs in meeting summarization.</p></details> |  |

However, due to the lack of high-quality large-scale data, event factuality detection is under-explored in event understanding research, which limits the development of EFD community. To address these issues and provide faithful event understanding, we introduce MAVEN-Fact, a large-scale and high-quality EFD dataset based on the MAVEN dataset. MAVEN-Fact includes factuality annotations of 112,276 events, making it the largest EFD dataset. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MAVEN-Fact is challenging for both conventional fine-tuned models and large language models (LLMs). Thanks to the comprehensive annotations of event arguments and relations in MAVEN, MAVEN-Fact also supports some further analyses and we find that adopting event arguments and relations helps in event factuality detection for fine-tuned models but does not benefit LLMs. Furthermore, we preliminarily study an application case of event factuality detection and find it helps in mitigating event-related hallucination in LLMs. Our dataset and codes can be obtained from \url{https://github.com/lcy2723/MAVEN-FACT}</p></details> | Under review |

Current methods first retrieve knowledge from the image and external knowledge base with the original complex question, then generate answers with Large Language Models (LLMs). However, since the original question contains complex elements that require knowledge from different sources, acquiring different kinds of knowledge in a coupled manner may confuse models and hinder them from retrieving precise knowledge. Furthermore, the ``forward-only'' answering process fails to explicitly capture the knowledge needs of LLMs, which can further hurt answering quality. To cope with the above limitations, we propose DKA: Disentangled Knowledge Acquisition from LLM feedback, a training-free framework that disentangles knowledge acquisition to avoid confusion and uses LLM's feedback to specify the required knowledge. Specifically, DKA requires LLMs to specify what knowledge they need to answer the question and decompose the original complex question into two simple sub-questions: Image-based sub-question and Knowledge-based sub-question. Then we use the two sub-questions to retrieve knowledge from the image and knowledge base, respectively. In this way, two knowledge acquisition models can focus on the content that corresponds to them and avoid disturbance of irrelevant elements in the original complex question, which can help to provide more precise knowledge and better align the knowledge needs of LLMs to yield correct answers. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that DKA significantly outperforms SOTA models. To facilitate future research, our data and code are available at \url{https://github.com/Lackel/DKA}.</p></details> | Pre-print |

The interpretation of TTPs in the MITRE ATT&CK framework can be challenging for cybersecurity practitioners due to presumed expertise and complex dependencies. Meanwhile, advancements with Large Language Models (LLMs) have led to recent surge in studies exploring its uses in cybersecurity operations. It is, however, unclear how LLMs can be used in an efficient and proper way to provide accurate responses for critical domains such as cybersecurity. This leads us to investigate how to better use two types of LLMs: small-scale encoder-only (e.g., RoBERTa) and larger decoder-only (e.g., GPT-3.5) LLMs to comprehend and summarize TTPs with the intended purposes (i.e., tactics) of a cyberattack procedure. This work studies and compares the uses of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of encoder-only LLMs vs. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) for decoder-only LLMs (without fine-tuning). Both SFT and RAG techniques presumably enhance the LLMs with relevant contexts for each cyberattack procedure. Our studies show decoder-only LLMs with RAG achieves better performance than encoder-only models with SFT, particularly when directly relevant context is extracted by RAG. The decoder-only results could suffer low `Precision' while achieving high `Recall'. Our findings further highlight a counter-intuitive observation that more generic prompts tend to yield better predictions of cyberattack tactics than those that are more specifically tailored.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large Language Models Powered Context-aware Motion Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11057v2)** | 2024-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motion prediction is among the most fundamental tasks in autonomous driving. Traditional methods of motion forecasting primarily encode vector information of maps and historical trajectory data of traffic participants, lacking a comprehensive understanding of overall traffic semantics, which in turn affects the performance of prediction tasks. In this paper, we utilized Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance the global traffic context understanding for motion prediction tasks. We first conducted systematic prompt engineering, visualizing complex traffic environments and historical trajectory information of traffic participants into image prompts -- Transportation Context Map (TC-Map), accompanied by corresponding text prompts. Through this approach, we obtained rich traffic context information from the LLM. By integrating this information into the motion prediction model, we demonstrate that such context can enhance the accuracy of motion predictions. Furthermore, considering the cost associated with LLMs, we propose a cost-effective deployment strategy: enhancing the accuracy of motion prediction tasks at scale with 0.7\% LLM-augmented datasets. Our research offers valuable insights into enhancing the understanding of traffic scenes of LLMs and the motion prediction performance of autonomous driving.

| **[DiarizationLM: Speaker Diarization Post-Processing with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03506v8)** | 2024-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we introduce DiarizationLM, a framework to leverage large language models (LLM) to post-process the outputs from a speaker diarization system. Various goals can be achieved with the proposed framework, such as improving the readability of the diarized transcript, or reducing the word diarization error rate (WDER). In this framework, the outputs of the automatic speech recognition (ASR) and speaker diarization systems are represented as a compact textual format, which is included in the prompt to an optionally finetuned LLM. The outputs of the LLM can be used as the refined diarization results with the desired enhancement. As a post-processing step, this framework can be easily applied to any off-the-shelf ASR and speaker diarization systems without retraining existing components. Our experiments show that a finetuned PaLM 2-S model can reduce the WDER by rel. 55.5% on the Fisher telephone conversation dataset, and rel. 44.9% on the Callhome English dataset.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can Large Language Models Write Good Property-Based Tests?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04346v2)** | 2024-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Property-based testing (PBT), while an established technique in the software testing research community, is still relatively underused in real-world software. Pain points in writing property-based tests include implementing diverse random input generators and thinking of meaningful properties to test. Developers, however, are more amenable to writing documentation; plenty of library API documentation is available and can be used as natural language specifications for PBTs. As large language models (LLMs) have recently shown promise in a variety of coding tasks, we investigate using modern LLMs to automatically synthesize PBTs using two prompting techniques. A key challenge is to rigorously evaluate the LLM-synthesized PBTs. We propose a methodology to do so considering several properties of the generated tests: (1) validity, (2) soundness, and (3) property coverage, a novel metric that measures the ability of the PBT to detect property violations through generation of property mutants. In our evaluation on 40 Python library API methods across three models (GPT-4, Gemini-1.5-Pro, Claude-3-Opus), we find that with the best model and prompting approach, a valid and sound PBT can be synthesized in 2.4 samples on average. We additionally find that our metric for determining soundness of a PBT is aligned with human judgment of property assertions, achieving a precision of 100% and recall of 97%. Finally, we evaluate the property coverage of LLMs across all API methods and find that the best model (GPT-4) is able to automatically synthesize correct PBTs for 21% of properties extractable from API documentation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sketch-Guided Constrained Decoding for Boosting Blackbox Large Language Models without Logit Access](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09967v4)** | 2024-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Constrained decoding, a technique for enforcing constraints on language model outputs, offers a way to control text generation without retraining or architectural modifications. Its application is, however, typically restricted to models that give users access to next-token distributions (usually via softmax logits), which poses a limitation with blackbox large language models (LLMs). This paper introduces sketch-guided constrained decoding (SGCD), a novel approach to constrained decoding for blackbox LLMs, which operates without access to the logits of the blackbox LLM. SGCD utilizes a locally hosted auxiliary model to refine the output of an unconstrained blackbox LLM, effectively treating this initial output as a "sketch" for further elaboration. This approach is complementary to traditional logit-based techniques and enables the application of constrained decoding in settings where full model transparency is unavailable. We demonstrate the efficacy of SGCD through experiments in closed information extraction and constituency parsing, showing how it enhances the utility and flexibility of blackbox LLMs for complex NLP tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACL 2024 Oral</p></details> |

This paper addresses these problems by tying the SLAM system with a global loop closure detection approach, which intrinsically handles these situations. However, online processing for global loop closure detection approaches is generally influenced by the size of the environment. The proposed graph-based SLAM system uses a memory management approach that only consider portions of the map to satisfy online processing requirements. The approach is tested and demonstrated using five indoor mapping sessions of a building using a robot equipped with a laser rangefinder and a Kinect.</p></details> | 6 pages, 12 figures |
| **[Appearance-Based Loop Closure Detection for Online Large-Scale and Long-Term Operation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15304v1)** | 2024-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In appearance-based localization and mapping, loop closure detection is the process used to determinate if the current observation comes from a previously visited location or a new one. As the size of the internal map increases, so does the time required to compare new observations with all stored locations, eventually limiting online processing. This paper presents an online loop closure detection approach for large-scale and long-term operation. The approach is based on a memory management method, which limits the number of locations used for loop closure detection so that the computation time remains under real-time constraints. The idea consists of keeping the most recent and frequently observed locations in a Working Memory (WM) used for loop closure detection, and transferring the others into a Long-Term Memory (LTM). When a match is found between the current location and one stored in WM, associated locations stored in LTM can be updated and remembered for additional loop closure detections. Results demonstrate the approach's adaptability and scalability using ten standard data sets from other appearance-based loop closure approaches, one custom data set using real images taken over a 2 km loop of our university campus, and one custom data set (7 hours) using virtual images from the racing video game ``Need for Speed: Most Wanted''.</p></details> | 12 pages, 11 figures |
| **[MIBench: Evaluating Multimodal Large Language Models over Multiple Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15272v1)** | 2024-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Built on the power of LLMs, numerous multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have recently achieved remarkable performance on various vision-language tasks across multiple benchmarks. However, most existing MLLMs and benchmarks primarily focus on single-image input scenarios, leaving the performance of MLLMs when handling realistic multiple images remain underexplored. Although a few benchmarks consider multiple images, their evaluation dimensions and samples are very limited. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a new benchmark MIBench, to comprehensively evaluate fine-grained abilities of MLLMs in multi-image scenarios. Specifically, MIBench categorizes the multi-image abilities into three scenarios: multi-image instruction (MII), multimodal knowledge-seeking (MKS) and multimodal in-context learning (MIC), and constructs 13 tasks with a total of 13K annotated samples. During data construction, for MII and MKS, we extract correct options from manual annotations and create challenging distractors to obtain multiple-choice questions. For MIC, to enable an in-depth evaluation, we set four sub-tasks and transform the original datasets into in-context learning formats. We evaluate several open-source MLLMs and close-source MLLMs on the proposed MIBench. The results reveal that although current models excel in single-image tasks, they exhibit significant shortcomings when faced with multi-image inputs, such as confused fine-grained perception, limited multi-image reasoning, and unstable in-context learning. The annotated data in MIBench is available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/StarBottle/MIBench.</p></details> | 10 pages, 4 figures |

In contrast, such privilege has not yet fully benefited 3D deep learning, mainly due to the limited availability of large-scale 3D datasets. Merging multiple available data sources and letting them collaboratively train a single model is a potential solution. However, due to the large domain gap between 3D point cloud datasets, such mixed supervision could adversely affect the model's performance and lead to degenerated performance (i.e., negative transfer) compared to single-dataset training. In view of this challenge, we introduce Point Prompt Training (PPT), a novel framework for multi-dataset synergistic learning in the context of 3D representation learning that supports multiple pre-training paradigms. Based on this framework, we propose Prompt-driven Normalization, which adapts the model to different datasets with domain-specific prompts and Language-guided Categorical Alignment that decently unifies the multiple-dataset label spaces by leveraging the relationship between label text. Extensive experiments verify that PPT can overcome the negative transfer associated with synergistic learning and produce generalizable representations. Notably, it achieves state-of-the-art performance on each dataset using a single weight-shared model with supervised multi-dataset training. Moreover, when served as a pre-training framework, it outperforms other pre-training approaches regarding representation quality and attains remarkable state-of-the-art performance across over ten diverse downstream tasks spanning both indoor and outdoor 3D scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2024, code available at Pointcept (https://github.com/Pointcept/Pointcept)</p></details> |

Real world GNNs continue to scale in size and require a large memory footprint for storing graphs and embeddings that often exceed the memory capacities of the target GPUs used for training. To address limited memory capacities, traditional GNN training approaches use graph partitioning and sharding techniques to scale up across multiple GPUs within a node and/or scale out across multiple nodes. However, this approach suffers from the high computational costs of graph partitioning algorithms and inefficient communication across GPUs. To address these overheads, we propose Large-scale Storage-based Multi-GPU GNN framework (LSM-GNN), a storagebased approach to train GNN models that utilizes a novel communication layer enabling GPU software caches to function as a system-wide shared cache with low overheads.LSM-GNN incorporates a hybrid eviction policy that intelligently manages cache space by using both static and dynamic node information to significantly enhance cache performance. Furthermore, we introduce the Preemptive Victim-buffer Prefetcher (PVP), a mechanism for prefetching node feature data from a Victim Buffer located in CPU pinned-memory to further reduce the pressure on the storage devices. Experimental results show that despite the lower compute capabilities and memory capacities, LSM-GNN in a single node with two GPUs offers superior performance over two-node-four-GPU Dist-DGL baseline and provides up to 3.75x speed up on end-to-end epoch time while running large-scale GNN training</p></details> |  |

However, writing SQL queries requires specialized knowledge, which poses a challenge for non-professional users trying to access and query databases. Text-to-SQL parsing solves this issue by converting natural language queries into SQL queries, thus making database access more accessible for non-expert users. To take advantage of the recent developments in Large Language Models (LLMs), a range of new methods have emerged, with a primary focus on prompt engineering and fine-tuning. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of LLMs in text-to-SQL tasks, discussing benchmark datasets, prompt engineering, fine-tuning methods, and future research directions. We hope this review will enable readers to gain a broader understanding of the recent advances in this field and offer some insights into its future trajectory.</p></details> |  |

However, owing to the inherent subjectivity involved in analyzing emotions, current non-artificial methodologies face challenges in effectively appraising the emotional support capability. These metrics exhibit a low correlation with human judgments. Concurrently, manual evaluation methods extremely will cause high costs. To solve these problems, we propose a novel model FEEL (Framework for Evaluating Emotional Support Capability with Large Lan-guage Models), employing Large Language Models (LLMs) as evaluators to assess emotional support capabilities. The model meticulously considers various evaluative aspects of ESC to apply a more comprehensive and accurate evaluation method for ESC. Additionally, it employs a probability distribution approach for a more stable result and integrates an ensemble learning strategy, leveraging multiple LLMs with assigned weights to enhance evaluation accuracy. To appraise the performance of FEEL, we conduct extensive experiments on existing ESC model dialogues. Experimental results demonstrate our model exhibits a substantial enhancement in alignment with human evaluations compared to the baselines.

For the first time, we hybridize non-autoregressive neural heuristics for coarse-grained problem partitions and autoregressive neural heuristics for fine-grained route constructions, leveraging the scalability of the former and the meticulousness of the latter.

In order to account for the performance loss caused by the spherical wavefront of ELAA in the mobility scenario, we propose a wavefront transformation-based matrix pencil (WTMP) channel prediction method. In particular, we design a matrix to transform the spherical wavefront into a new wavefront, which is closer to the plane wave. We also design a time-frequency projection matrix to capture the time-varying path delay. Furthermore, we adopt the matrix pencil (MP) method to estimate channel parameters. Our proposed WTMP method can mitigate the effect of near-field radiation when predicting future channels. Theoretical analysis shows that the designed matrix is asymptotically determined by the angles and distance between the base station (BS) antenna array and the scatterers or the user when the number of BS antennas is large enough. For an ELAA communication system in the mobility scenario, we prove that the prediction error converges to zero with the increasing number of BS antennas. Simulation results demonstrate that our designed transform matrix efficiently mitigates the near-field effect, and that our proposed WTMP method can overcome the ELAA mobility challenge and approach the performance in stationary setting.</p></details> |  |

Existing studies directly map the sequence of 2D perspective observations to route descriptions. Though straightforward, they overlook the geometric information and object semantics of the 3D environment. To address these challenges, we propose BEVInstructor, which incorporates Bird's Eye View (BEV) features into Multi-Modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for instruction generation. Specifically, BEVInstructor constructs a PerspectiveBEVVisual Encoder for the comprehension of 3D environments through fusing BEV and perspective features. To leverage the powerful language capabilities of MLLMs, the fused representations are used as visual prompts for MLLMs, and perspective-BEV prompt tuning is proposed for parameter-efficient updating. Based on the perspective-BEV prompts, BEVInstructor further adopts an instance-guided iterative refinement pipeline, which improves the instructions in a progressive manner. BEVInstructor achieves impressive performance across diverse datasets (i.e., R2R, REVERIE, and UrbanWalk).</p></details> | <details><summary>ECCV ...</summary><p>ECCV 2024; Project Page: https://github.com/FanScy/BEVInstructor</p></details> |
| **[Active Prompting with Chain-of-Thought for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.12246v5)** | 2024-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increasing scale of large language models (LLMs) brings emergent abilities to various complex tasks requiring reasoning, such as arithmetic and commonsense reasoning. It is known that the effective design of task-specific prompts is critical for LLMs' ability to produce high-quality answers. In particular, an effective approach for complex question-and-answer tasks is example-based prompting with chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, which significantly improves the performance of LLMs. However, current CoT methods rely on a fixed set of human-annotated exemplars, which are not necessarily the most effective examples for different tasks. This paper proposes a new method, Active-Prompt, to adapt LLMs to different tasks with task-specific example prompts (annotated with human-designed CoT reasoning). For this purpose, we propose a solution to the key problem of determining which questions are the most important and helpful ones to annotate from a pool of task-specific queries. By borrowing ideas from the related problem of uncertainty-based active learning, we introduce several metrics to characterize the uncertainty so as to select the most uncertain questions for annotation. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method, achieving state-of-the-art on eight complex reasoning tasks. Further analyses of different uncertainty metrics, pool sizes, zero-shot learning, and accuracy-uncertainty relationship demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

However, the multi-agent capabilities of LLMs in causal discovery remain underexplored. This paper introduces a general framework to investigate this potential. The first is the Meta Agents Model, which relies exclusively on reasoning and discussions among LLM agents to conduct causal discovery. The second is the Coding Agents Model, which leverages the agents' ability to plan, write, and execute code, utilizing advanced statistical libraries for causal discovery. The third is the Hybrid Model, which integrates both the Meta Agents Model and CodingAgents Model approaches, combining the statistical analysis and reasoning skills of multiple agents. Our proposed framework shows promising results by effectively utilizing LLMs expert knowledge, reasoning capabilities, multi-agent cooperation, and statistical causal methods. By exploring the multi-agent potential of LLMs, we aim to establish a foundation for further research in utilizing LLMs multi-agent for solving causal-related problems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Relational Database Augmented Large Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15071v1)** | 2024-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) excel in many natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, since LLMs can only incorporate new knowledge through training or supervised fine-tuning processes, they are unsuitable for applications that demand precise, up-to-date, and private information not available in the training corpora. This precise, up-to-date, and private information is typically stored in relational databases. Thus, a promising solution is to augment LLMs with the inclusion of relational databases as external memory. This can ensure the timeliness, correctness, and consistency of data, and assist LLMs in performing complex arithmetic operations beyond their inherent capabilities. However, bridging the gap between LLMs and relational databases is challenging. It requires the awareness of databases and data values stored in databases to select correct databases and issue correct SQL queries. Besides, it is necessary for the external memory to be independent of the LLM to meet the needs of real-world applications. We introduce a novel LLM-agnostic memory architecture comprising a database selection memory, a data value memory, and relational databases. And we design an elegant pipeline to retrieve information from it. Besides, we carefully design the prompts to instruct the LLM to maximize the framework's potential. To evaluate our method, we compose a new dataset with various types of questions. Experimental results show that our framework enables LLMs to effectively answer database-related questions, which is beyond their direct ability.</p></details> |  |

Despite these improvements, controllable image generation remains a challenge. Current methods, such as training, forward guidance, and backward guidance, have notable limitations. The first two approaches either demand substantial computational resources or produce subpar results. The third approach depends on phenomena specific to certain model architectures, complicating its application to large-scale image generation.To address these issues, we propose a novel controllable generation framework that offers a generalized interpretation of backward guidance without relying on specific assumptions. Leveraging this framework, we introduce LSReGen, a large-scale layout-to-image method designed to generate high-quality, layout-compliant images. Experimental results show that LSReGen outperforms existing methods in the large-scale layout-to-image task, underscoring the effectiveness of our proposed framework.

Traditionally analyzed with signal processing-based features, recent approaches have utilized self-supervised models pre-trained on human speech for feature extraction, capitalizing on their ability to learn a signal's intrinsic structure independently of its acoustic domain. However, the utility of such foundation models remains unclear for marmoset call analysis in terms of multi-class classification, bandwidth, and pre-training domain. This study assesses feature representations derived from speech and general audio domains, across pre-training bandwidths of 4, 8, and 16 kHz for marmoset call-type and caller classification tasks. Results show that models with higher bandwidth improve performance, and pre-training on speech or general audio yields comparable results, improving over a spectral baseline.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Interspeech 2024 Satellite event (VIHAR 2024)</p></details> |

However, the high degree of unpredictable events in these settings has resulted in far less adoption compared to more structured settings, such as manufacturing, where robots can be hard-coded or trained on narrowly defined datasets. Recently, pretrained foundation models, such as Large Language Models (LLMs), have demonstrated superior generalization capabilities by providing zero-shot solutions for problems do not present in the training data, proposing them as a potential solution for introducing robots to unstructured environments. To this end, this study investigates potential opportunities and challenges of pretrained foundation models from a multi-dimensional perspective. The study systematically reviews application of foundation models in two field of robotic and unstructured environment and then synthesized them with deliberative acting theory. Findings showed that linguistic capabilities of LLMs have been utilized more than other features for improving perception in human-robot interactions. On the other hand, findings showed that the use of LLMs demonstrated more applications in project management and safety in construction, and natural hazard detection in disaster management. Synthesizing these findings, we located the current state-of-the-art in this field on a five-level scale of automation, placing them at conditional automation. This assessment was then used to envision future scenarios, challenges, and solutions toward autonomous safe unstructured environments. Our study can be seen as a benchmark to track our progress toward that future.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2312.07843, arXiv:2402.05741 by other authors</p></details> |

They feature several advantages over traditional pipelines: among others, the ability to consolidate multiple tasks in a single model, the option to leverage knowledge from other modalities, and the readily-available interaction with human users. Naturally, these promises have created substantial excitement in the audio community, and have led to a wave of early attempts to build new, general-purpose foundation models for audio. In the present contribution, we give an overview of computational audio analysis as it transitions from traditional pipelines towards auditory foundation models. Our work highlights the key operating principles that underpin those models, and showcases how they can accommodate multiple tasks that the audio community previously tackled separately.</p></details> |  |
| **[Probing Fine-Grained Action Understanding and Cross-View Generalization of Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15605v1)** | 2024-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models (FMs) are large neural networks trained on broad datasets, excelling in downstream tasks with minimal fine-tuning. Human activity recognition in video has advanced with FMs, driven by competition among different architectures. However, high accuracies on standard benchmarks can draw an artificially rosy picture, as they often overlook real-world factors like changing camera perspectives. Popular benchmarks, mostly from YouTube or movies, offer diverse views but only coarse actions, which are insufficient for use-cases needing fine-grained, domain-specific actions. Domain-specific datasets (e.g., for industrial assembly) typically use data from limited static perspectives. This paper empirically evaluates how perspective changes affect different FMs in fine-grained human activity recognition. We compare multiple backbone architectures and design choices, including image- and video- based models, and various strategies for temporal information fusion, including commonly used score averaging and more novel attention-based temporal aggregation mechanisms. This is the first systematic study of different foundation models and specific design choices for human activity recognition from unknown views, conducted with the goal to provide guidance for backbone- and temporal- fusion scheme selection. Code and models will be made publicly available to the community.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we conduct an extensive empirical study on representation learning for downstream Visual Question Answering (VQA), which requires an accurate compositional understanding of the scene. We thoroughly investigate the benefits and trade-offs of OC models and alternative approaches including large pre-trained foundation models on both synthetic and real-world data, and demonstrate a viable way to achieve the best of both worlds. The extensiveness of our study, encompassing over 800 downstream VQA models and 15 different types of upstream representations, also provides several additional insights that we believe will be of interest to the community at large.</p></details> |  |
| **[Empowering Embodied Visual Tracking with Visual Foundation Models and Offline RL](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09857v2)** | 2024-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied visual tracking is to follow a target object in dynamic 3D environments using an agent's egocentric vision. This is a vital and challenging skill for embodied agents. However, existing methods suffer from inefficient training and poor generalization. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that combines visual foundation models(VFM) and offline reinforcement learning(offline RL) to empower embodied visual tracking. We use a pre-trained VFM, such as "Tracking Anything", to extract semantic segmentation masks with text prompts. We then train a recurrent policy network with offline RL, e.g., Conservative Q-Learning, to learn from the collected demonstrations without online interactions. To further improve the robustness and generalization of the policy network, we also introduce a mask re-targeting mechanism and a multi-level data collection strategy. In this way, we can train a robust policy within an hour on a consumer-level GPU, e.g., Nvidia RTX 3090. We evaluate our agent on several high-fidelity environments with challenging situations, such as distraction and occlusion. The results show that our agent outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of sample efficiency, robustness to distractors, and generalization to unseen scenarios and targets. We also demonstrate the transferability of the learned agent from virtual environments to a real-world robot.</p></details> | ECCV 2024 |
| **[A Multimodal Knowledge-enhanced Whole-slide Pathology Foundation Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15362v1)** | 2024-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Remarkable strides in computational pathology have been made in the task-agnostic foundation model that advances the performance of a wide array of downstream clinical tasks. Despite the promising performance, there are still several challenges. First, prior works have resorted to either vision-only or vision-captions data, disregarding invaluable pathology reports and gene expression profiles which respectively offer distinct knowledge for versatile clinical applications. Second, the current progress in pathology FMs predominantly concentrates on the patch level, where the restricted context of patch-level pretraining fails to capture whole-slide patterns. Here we curated the largest multimodal dataset consisting of H\&E diagnostic whole slide images and their associated pathology reports and RNA-Seq data, resulting in 26,169 slide-level modality pairs from 10,275 patients across 32 cancer types. To leverage these data for CPath, we propose a novel whole-slide pretraining paradigm which injects multimodal knowledge at the whole-slide context into the pathology FM, called Multimodal Self-TAught PRetraining (mSTAR). The proposed paradigm revolutionizes the workflow of pretraining for CPath, which enables the pathology FM to acquire the whole-slide context. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to incorporate multimodal knowledge at the slide level for enhancing pathology FMs, expanding the modelling context from unimodal to multimodal knowledge and from patch-level to slide-level. To systematically evaluate the capabilities of mSTAR, extensive experiments including slide-level unimodal and multimodal applications, are conducted across 7 diverse types of tasks on 43 subtasks, resulting in the largest spectrum of downstream tasks. The average performance in various slide-level applications consistently demonstrates significant performance enhancements for mSTAR compared to SOTA FMs.</p></details> | 44 pages, 9 figures |

We introduce GPT-HyperAgent, an augmentation of GPT with HyperAgent for uncertainty-aware, scalable exploration in contextual bandits, a fundamental online decision problem involving natural language input. We prove that HyperAgent achieves fast incremental uncertainty estimation with $\tilde{O}(\log T)$ per-step computational complexity over $T$ periods under the linear realizable assumption. Our analysis demonstrates that HyperAgent's regret order matches that of exact Thompson sampling in linear contextual bandits, closing a significant theoretical gap in scalable exploration. Empirical results in real-world contextual bandit tasks, such as automated content moderation with human feedback, validate the practical effectiveness of GPT-HyperAgent for safety-critical decisions.

However, prior arts are seldom discussed under distribution shifts, which may be vulnerable in real-world applications. Recent Vision-Language Foundation Models, e.g., CLIP, have demonstrated remarkable performance in zero-shot out-of-distribution generalization, yet consuming heavy computation resources. In this paper, we discuss the extension of DFKD to Vision-Language Foundation Models without access to the billion-level image-text datasets. The objective is to customize a student model for distribution-agnostic downstream tasks with given category concepts, inheriting the out-of-distribution generalization capability from the pre-trained foundation models. In order to avoid generalization degradation, the primary challenge of this task lies in synthesizing diverse surrogate images driven by text prompts. Since not only category concepts but also style information are encoded in text prompts, we propose three novel Prompt Diversification methods to encourage image synthesis with diverse styles, namely Mix-Prompt, Random-Prompt, and Contrastive-Prompt. Experiments on out-of-distribution generalization datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods, with Contrastive-Prompt performing the best.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACMMM 2023</p></details> |

Conventional panoptic mapping methods, however, are limited by predefined semantic classes, thus making them ineffective for handling novel or unforeseen objects. In response to this limitation, we introduce the Unified Promptable Panoptic Mapping (UPPM) method. UPPM utilizes recent advances in foundation models to enable real-time, on-demand label generation using natural language prompts. By incorporating a dynamic labeling strategy into traditional panoptic mapping techniques, UPPM provides significant improvements in adaptability and versatility while maintaining high performance levels in map reconstruction. We demonstrate our approach on real-world and simulated datasets. Results show that UPPM can accurately reconstruct scenes and segment objects while generating rich semantic labels through natural language interactions. A series of ablation experiments validated the advantages of foundation model-based labeling over fixed label sets.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is under consideration at Pattern Recognition Letters</p></details> |
| **[Improving Representation of High-frequency Components for Medical Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14651v1)** | 2024-07-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models have recently attracted significant attention for their impressive generalizability across diverse downstream tasks. However, these models are demonstrated to exhibit great limitations in representing high-frequency components and fine-grained details. In many medical imaging tasks, the precise representation of such information is crucial due to the inherently intricate anatomical structures, sub-visual features, and complex boundaries involved. Consequently, the limited representation of prevalent foundation models can result in significant performance degradation or even failure in these tasks. To address these challenges, we propose a novel pretraining strategy, named Frequency-advanced Representation Autoencoder (Frepa). Through high-frequency masking and low-frequency perturbation combined with adversarial learning, Frepa encourages the encoder to effectively represent and preserve high-frequency components in the image embeddings. Additionally, we introduce an innovative histogram-equalized image masking strategy, extending the Masked Autoencoder approach beyond ViT to other architectures such as Swin Transformer and convolutional networks. We develop Frepa across nine medical modalities and validate it on 32 downstream tasks for both 2D images and 3D volume data. Without fine-tuning, Frepa can outperform other self-supervised pretraining methods and, in some cases, even surpasses task-specific trained models. This improvement is particularly significant for tasks involving fine-grained details, such as achieving up to a +15% increase in DSC for retina vessel segmentation and a +7% increase in IoU for lung nodule detection. Further experiments quantitatively reveal that Frepa enables superior high-frequency representations and preservation in the embeddings, underscoring its potential for developing more generalized and universal medical image foundation models.</p></details> |  |

However, there has been limited work on integrating an additional, typically low-resource, language, while maintaining performance on the original language set. Fine-tuning, while simple, may degrade the accuracy of the original set. We compare three approaches that exploit adaptation parameters: soft language code tuning, train only the language code; soft prompt tuning, train prepended tokens; and LoRA where a small set of additional parameters are optimised. Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) offers an alternative compromise with the potential to maintain performance in specific target languages. Results show that direct fine-tuning yields the best performance for the new language but degrades existing language capabilities. EWC can address this issue for specific languages. If only adaptation parameters are used, the language capabilities are maintained but at the cost of performance in the new language.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods require pre-constructed 3D scenes and face scalability issues due to per-point feature vector learning, limiting their efficacy with complex queries. Our method overcomes these limitations by incrementally building instance-level 3D scene representations using 2D foundation models, efficiently aggregating instance-level details such as masks, feature vectors, names, and captions. We introduce fusion schemes for feature vectors to enhance their contextual knowledge and performance on complex queries. Additionally, we explore large language models for robust automatic annotation and spatial reasoning tasks. We evaluate our proposed approach on multiple scenes from ScanNet and Replica datasets demonstrating zero-shot generalization capabilities, exceeding current state-of-the-art methods in open world 3D scene understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://opensu3d.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[FoundPose: Unseen Object Pose Estimation with Foundation Features](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18809v2)** | 2024-07-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose FoundPose, a model-based method for 6D pose estimation of unseen objects from a single RGB image. The method can quickly onboard new objects using their 3D models without requiring any object- or task-specific training. In contrast, existing methods typically pre-train on large-scale, task-specific datasets in order to generalize to new objects and to bridge the image-to-model domain gap. We demonstrate that such generalization capabilities can be observed in a recent vision foundation model trained in a self-supervised manner. Specifically, our method estimates the object pose from image-to-model 2D-3D correspondences, which are established by matching patch descriptors from the recent DINOv2 model between the image and pre-rendered object templates. We find that reliable correspondences can be established by kNN matching of patch descriptors from an intermediate DINOv2 layer. Such descriptors carry stronger positional information than descriptors from the last layer, and we show their importance when semantic information is ambiguous due to object symmetries or a lack of texture. To avoid establishing correspondences against all object templates, we develop an efficient template retrieval approach that integrates the patch descriptors into the bag-of-words representation and can promptly propose a handful of similarly looking templates. Additionally, we apply featuremetric alignment to compensate for discrepancies in the 2D-3D correspondences caused by coarse patch sampling. The resulting method noticeably outperforms existing RGB methods for refinement-free pose estimation on the standard BOP benchmark with seven diverse datasets and can be seamlessly combined with an existing render-and-compare refinement method to achieve RGB-only state-of-the-art results.

| **[Semantic-CC: Boosting Remote Sensing Image Change Captioning via Foundational Knowledge and Semantic Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14032v1)** | 2024-07-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Remote sensing image change captioning (RSICC) aims to articulate the changes in objects of interest within bi-temporal remote sensing images using natural language. Given the limitations of current RSICC methods in expressing general features across multi-temporal and spatial scenarios, and their deficiency in providing granular, robust, and precise change descriptions, we introduce a novel change captioning (CC) method based on the foundational knowledge and semantic guidance, which we term Semantic-CC. Semantic-CC alleviates the dependency of high-generalization algorithms on extensive annotations by harnessing the latent knowledge of foundation models, and it generates more comprehensive and accurate change descriptions guided by pixel-level semantics from change detection (CD). Specifically, we propose a bi-temporal SAM-based encoder for dual-image feature extraction; a multi-task semantic aggregation neck for facilitating information interaction between heterogeneous tasks; a straightforward multi-scale change detection decoder to provide pixel-level semantic guidance; and a change caption decoder based on the large language model (LLM) to generate change description sentences. Moreover, to ensure the stability of the joint training of CD and CC, we propose a three-stage training strategy that supervises different tasks at various stages. We validate the proposed method on the LEVIR-CC and LEVIR-CD datasets. The experimental results corroborate the complementarity of CD and CC, demonstrating that Semantic-CC can generate more accurate change descriptions and achieve optimal performance across both tasks.</p></details> |  |

For this reason, they are susceptible to the memorization and subsequent reproduction of training samples. In this paper, we introduce a training-as-compressing perspective, wherein the model's weights embody a compressed representation of the training data. From a copyright standpoint, this point of view implies that the weights could be considered a reproduction or a derivative work of a potentially protected set of works. We investigate the technical and legal challenges that emerge from this framing of the copyright of outputs generated by foundation models, including their implications for practitioners and researchers. We demonstrate that adopting an information-centric approach to the problem presents a promising pathway for tackling these emerging complex legal issues.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for spotlight presentation at GenLaw'24, see https://www.genlaw.org/2024-icml-papers#training-foundation-models-as-data-compression-on-information-model-weights-and-copyright-law</p></details> |

That we work predicatively means that we do not assume Voevodsky's propositional resizing axioms. Our work is constructive in the sense that we do not rely on excluded middle or the axiom of (countable) choice. Domain theory studies so-called directed complete posets (dcpos) and Scott continuous maps between them and has applications in a variety of fields, such as programming language semantics, higher-type computability and topology. A common approach to deal with size issues in a predicative foundation is to work with information systems, abstract bases or formal topologies rather than dcpos, and approximable relations rather than Scott continuous functions. In our type-theoretic approach, we instead accept that dcpos may be large and work with type universes to account for this. A priori one might expect that iterative constructions of dcpos may result in a need for ever-increasing universes and are predicatively impossible. We show, through a careful tracking of type universe parameters, that such constructions can be carried out in a predicative setting. In particular, we give a predicative reconstruction of Scott's $D_\infty$ model of the untyped $\lambda$-calculus. Our work is formalised in the Agda proof assistant and its ability to infer universe levels has been invaluable for our purposes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Based...</summary><p>Based on Ch. 3 and Sec. 5.1 of the author's PhD thesis (arXiv:2301.12405). v3: Updated Acknowledgements</p></details> |

That we work predicatively means that we do not assume Voevodsky's propositional resizing axioms. Our work is constructive in the sense that we do not rely on excluded middle or the axiom of (countable) choice. To deal with size issues and give a predicatively suitable definition of continuity of a dcpo, we follow Johnstone and Joyal's work on continuous categories. Adhering to the univalent perspective, we explicitly distinguish between data and property. To ensure that being continuous is a property of a dcpo, we turn to the propositional truncation, although we explain that some care is needed to avoid needing the axiom of choice. We also adapt the notion of a domain-theoretic basis to the predicative setting by imposing suitable smallness conditions, analogous to the categorical concept of an accessible category. All our running examples of continuous dcpos are then actually examples of dcpos with small bases which we show to be well behaved predicatively. In particular, such dcpos are exactly those presented by small ideals. As an application of the theory, we show that Scott's $D_\infty$ model of the untyped $\lambda$-calculus is an example of an algebraic dcpo with a small basis. Our work is formalised in the Agda proof assistant and its ability to infer universe levels has been invaluable for our purposes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Based...</summary><p>Based on Ch. 4 of the author's PhD thesis (arXiv:2301.12405). v3: Updated Acknowledgements</p></details> |

However, these models are susceptible to adversarial attacks, posing significant risks to the reliability and safety of autonomous vehicles. Adversaries can exploit these vulnerabilities to manipulate the vehicle's perception of its surroundings, leading to erroneous decisions and potentially catastrophic consequences. To address this challenge, we propose a novel Precision-Guided Adversarial Attack (PG-Attack) framework that combines two techniques: Precision Mask Perturbation Attack (PMP-Attack) and Deceptive Text Patch Attack (DTP-Attack). PMP-Attack precisely targets the attack region to minimize the overall perturbation while maximizing its impact on the target object's representation in the model's feature space. DTP-Attack introduces deceptive text patches that disrupt the model's understanding of the scene, further enhancing the attack's effectiveness. Our experiments demonstrate that PG-Attack successfully deceives a variety of advanced multi-modal large models, including GPT-4V, Qwen-VL, and imp-V1.

However, it is difficult to train a 3D foundation network directly due to the limited dataset and it remains under explored whether existing foundation models can be lifted to 3D space seamlessly. In this paper, we present PointSeg, a novel training-free paradigm that leverages off-the-shelf vision foundation models to address 3D scene perception tasks. PointSeg can segment anything in 3D scene by acquiring accurate 3D prompts to align their corresponding pixels across frames. Concretely, we design a two-branch prompts learning structure to construct the 3D point-box prompts pairs, combining with the bidirectional matching strategy for accurate point and proposal prompts generation. Then, we perform the iterative post-refinement adaptively when cooperated with different vision foundation models. Moreover, we design a affinity-aware merging algorithm to improve the final ensemble masks. PointSeg demonstrates impressive segmentation performance across various datasets, all without training. Specifically, our approach significantly surpasses the state-of-the-art specialist training-free model by 14.1$\%$, 12.3$\%$, and 12.6$\%$ mAP on ScanNet, ScanNet++, and KITTI-360 datasets, respectively. On top of that, PointSeg can incorporate with various foundation models and even surpasses the specialist training-based methods by 3.4$\%$-5.4$\%$ mAP across various datasets, serving as an effective generalist model.</p></details> |  |

Typically, speech is produced when air is forced from the lungs and is modulated by the vocal tract, where such actions are interspersed by moments of breathing in air (inhalation) to refill the lungs again. Respiratory rate (RR) is a vital metric that is used to assess the overall health, fitness, and general well-being of an individual. Existing approaches to measure RR (number of breaths one takes in a minute) are performed using specialized equipment or training. Studies have demonstrated that machine learning algorithms can be used to estimate RR using bio-sensor signals as input. Speech-based estimation of RR can offer an effective approach to measure the vital metric without requiring any specialized equipment or sensors. This work investigates a machine learning based approach to estimate RR from speech segments obtained from subjects speaking to a close-talking microphone device. Data were collected from N=26 individuals, where the groundtruth RR was obtained through commercial grade chest-belts and then manually corrected for any errors. A convolutional long-short term memory network (Conv-LSTM) is proposed to estimate respiration time-series data from the speech signal. We demonstrate that the use of pre-trained representations obtained from a foundation model, such as Wav2Vec2, can be used to estimate respiration-time-series with low root-mean-squared error and high correlation coefficient, when compared with the baseline. The model-driven time series can be used to estimate $RR$ with a low mean absolute error (MAE) ~ 1.6 breaths/min.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures, BioKDD workshop paper</p></details> |
| **[The Foundation Model Transparency Index v1.1: May 2024](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12929v1)** | 2024-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models are increasingly consequential yet extremely opaque. To characterize the status quo, the Foundation Model Transparency Index was launched in October 2023 to measure the transparency of leading foundation model developers. The October 2023 Index (v1.0) assessed 10 major foundation model developers (e.g. OpenAI, Google) on 100 transparency indicators (e.g. does the developer disclose the wages it pays for data labor?). At the time, developers publicly disclosed very limited information with the average score being 37 out of 100. To understand how the status quo has changed, we conduct a follow-up study (v1.1) after 6 months: we score 14 developers against the same 100 indicators. While in v1.0 we searched for publicly available information, in v1.1 developers submit reports on the 100 transparency indicators, potentially including information that was not previously public. We find that developers now score 58 out of 100 on average, a 21 point improvement over v1.0. Much of this increase is driven by developers disclosing information during the v1.1 process: on average, developers disclosed information related to 16.6 indicators that was not previously public. We observe regions of sustained (i.e. across v1.0 and v1.1) and systemic (i.e. across most or all developers) opacity such as on copyright status, data access, data labor, and downstream impact. We publish transparency reports for each developer that consolidate information disclosures: these reports are based on the information disclosed to us via developers. Our findings demonstrate that transparency can be improved in this nascent ecosystem, the Foundation Model Transparency Index likely contributes to these improvements, and policymakers should consider interventions in areas where transparency has not improved.</p></details> | <details><summary>Autho...</summary><p>Authored by the Center for Research on Foundation Models (CRFM) at the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence (HAI).

We build a rigorous foundational framework for pMCMC algorithms that situates these methods within a unified 'extended phase space' measure-theoretic formalism. Drawing on our recent work that provides a comprehensive theory for reversible single proposal methods, we herein derive general criteria for multiproposal acceptance mechanisms which yield ergodic chains on general state spaces. Our formulation encompasses a variety of methodologies, including proposal cloud resampling and Hamiltonian methods, while providing a basis for the derivation of novel algorithms. In particular, we obtain a top-down picture for a class of methods arising from 'conditionally independent' proposal structures. As an immediate application, we identify several new algorithms including a multiproposal version of the popular preconditioned Crank-Nicolson (pCN) sampler suitable for high- and infinite-dimensional target measures which are absolutely continuous with respect to a Gaussian base measure. To supplement our theoretical results, we carry out a selection of numerical case studies that evaluate the efficacy of these novel algorithms. First, noting that the true potential of pMCMC algorithms arises from their natural parallelizability, we provide a limited parallelization study using TensorFlow and a graphics processing unit to scale pMCMC algorithms that leverage as many as 100k proposals at each step. Second, we use our multiproposal pCN algorithm (mpCN) to resolve a selection of problems in Bayesian statistical inversion for partial differential equations motivated by fluid measurement. These examples provide preliminary evidence of the efficacy of mpCN for high-dimensional target distributions featuring complex geometries and multimodal structures.</p></details> | <details><summary>Minor...</summary><p>Minor revisions from previous version</p></details> |
| **[Muting Whisper: A Universal Acoustic Adversarial Attack on Speech Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06134v2)** | 2024-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent developments in large speech foundation models like Whisper have led to their widespread use in many automatic speech recognition (ASR) applications. These systems incorporate `special tokens' in their vocabulary, such as $\texttt{<|endoftext|>}$, to guide their language generation process. However, we demonstrate that these tokens can be exploited by adversarial attacks to manipulate the model's behavior. We propose a simple yet effective method to learn a universal acoustic realization of Whisper's $\texttt{<|endoftext|>}$ token, which, when prepended to any speech signal, encourages the model to ignore the speech and only transcribe the special token, effectively `muting' the model. Our experiments demonstrate that the same, universal 0.64-second adversarial audio segment can successfully mute a target Whisper ASR model for over 97\% of speech samples. Moreover, we find that this universal adversarial audio segment often transfers to new datasets and tasks. Overall this work demonstrates the vulnerability of Whisper models to `muting' adversarial attacks, where such attacks can pose both risks and potential benefits in real-world settings: for example the attack can be used to bypass speech moderation systems, or conversely the attack can also be used to protect private speech data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Recipe Retrieval with Foundation Models: A Data Augmentation Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04763v2)** | 2024-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning recipe and food image representation in common embedding space is non-trivial but crucial for cross-modal recipe retrieval. In this paper, we propose a new perspective for this problem by utilizing foundation models for data augmentation. Leveraging on the remarkable capabilities of foundation models (i.e., Llama2 and SAM), we propose to augment recipe and food image by extracting alignable information related to the counterpart. Specifically, Llama2 is employed to generate a textual description from the recipe, aiming to capture the visual cues of a food image, and SAM is used to produce image segments that correspond to key ingredients in the recipe. To make full use of the augmented data, we introduce Data Augmented Retrieval framework (DAR) to enhance recipe and image representation learning for cross-modal retrieval. We first inject adapter layers to pre-trained CLIP model to reduce computation cost rather than fully fine-tuning all the parameters. In addition, multi-level circle loss is proposed to align the original and augmented data pairs, which assigns different penalties for positive and negative pairs. On the Recipe1M dataset, our DAR outperforms all existing methods by a large margin. Extensive ablation studies validate the effectiveness of each component of DAR.</p></details> | ECCV2024 |

Accurate modeling of these interactions is important to optimize driving performance, but the relevant physical phenomena are too complex to model from first principles. Therefore, we present an offline meta-learning algorithm to construct a rapidly-tunable model of residual dynamics and disturbances. Our model processes terrain images into features using a visual foundation model (VFM), then maps these features and the vehicle state to an estimate of the current actuation matrix using a deep neural network (DNN). We then combine this model with composite adaptive control to modify the last layer of the DNN in real time, accounting for the remaining terrain interactions not captured during offline training. We provide mathematical guarantees of stability and robustness for our controller and demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through simulations and hardware experiments with a tracked vehicle and a car-like robot. We evaluate our method outdoors on different slopes with varying slippage and actuator degradation disturbances, and compare against an adaptive controller that does not use the VFM terrain features. We show significant improvement over the baseline in both hardware experimentation and simulation.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Foundations of Tokenization: Statistical and Computational Concerns](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11606v1)** | 2024-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tokenization - the practice of converting strings of characters over an alphabet into sequences of tokens over a vocabulary - is a critical yet under-theorized step in the NLP pipeline. Notably, it remains the only major step not fully integrated into widely used end-to-end neural models. This paper aims to address this theoretical gap by laying the foundations of tokenization from a formal perspective. By articulating and extending basic properties about the category of stochastic maps, we propose a unified framework for representing and analyzing tokenizer models. This framework allows us to establish general conditions for the use of tokenizers. In particular, we formally establish the necessary and sufficient conditions for a tokenizer model to preserve the consistency of statistical estimators. Additionally, we discuss statistical and computational concerns crucial for the design and implementation of tokenizer models. The framework and results advanced in this paper represent a step toward a robust theoretical foundation for neural language modeling.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Reference Architecture for Designing Foundation Model based Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.11090v5)** | 2024-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The release of ChatGPT, Gemini, and other large language model has drawn huge interests on foundations models. There is a broad consensus that foundations models will be the fundamental building blocks for future AI systems. However, there is a lack of systematic guidance on the architecture design. Particularly, the the rapidly growing capabilities of foundations models can eventually absorb other components of AI systems, posing challenges of moving boundary and interface evolution in architecture design. Furthermore, incorporating foundations models into AI systems raises significant concerns about responsible and safe AI due to their opaque nature and rapidly advancing intelligence. To address these challenges, the paper first presents an architecture evolution of AI systems in the era of foundation models, transitioning from "foundation-model-as-a-connector" to "foundation-model-as-a-monolithic architecture". The paper then identifies key design decisions and proposes a pattern-oriented reference architecture for designing responsible foundation-model-based systems. The patterns can enable the potential of foundation models while ensuring associated risks.</p></details> |  |
| **[An efficient framework based on large foundation model for cervical cytopathology whole slide image screening](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11486v1)** | 2024-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current cervical cytopathology whole slide image (WSI) screening primarily relies on detection-based approaches, which are limited in performance due to the expense and time-consuming annotation process. Multiple Instance Learning (MIL), a weakly supervised approach that relies solely on bag-level labels, can effectively alleviate these challenges. Nonetheless, MIL commonly employs frozen pretrained models or self-supervised learning for feature extraction, which suffers from low efficacy or inefficiency. In this paper, we propose an efficient framework for cervical cytopathology WSI classification using only WSI-level labels through unsupervised and weakly supervised learning. Given the sparse and dispersed nature of abnormal cells within cytopathological WSIs, we propose a strategy that leverages the pretrained foundation model to filter the top$k$ high-risk patches. Subsequently, we suggest parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) of a large foundation model using contrastive learning on the filtered patches to enhance its representation ability for task-specific signals. By training only the added linear adapters, we enhance the learning of patch-level features with substantially reduced time and memory consumption. Experiments conducted on the CSD and FNAC 2019 datasets demonstrate that the proposed method enhances the performance of various MIL methods and achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. The code and trained models are publicly available at https://github.com/CVIU-CSU/TCT-InfoNCE.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Foundation Model for Brain Lesion Segmentation with Mixture of Modality Experts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10246v2)** | 2024-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Brain lesion segmentation plays an essential role in neurological research and diagnosis. As brain lesions can be caused by various pathological alterations, different types of brain lesions tend to manifest with different characteristics on different imaging modalities. Due to this complexity, brain lesion segmentation methods are often developed in a task-specific manner. A specific segmentation model is developed for a particular lesion type and imaging modality. However, the use of task-specific models requires predetermination of the lesion type and imaging modality, which complicates their deployment in real-world scenarios. In this work, we propose a universal foundation model for 3D brain lesion segmentation, which can automatically segment different types of brain lesions for input data of various imaging modalities. We formulate a novel Mixture of Modality Experts (MoME) framework with multiple expert networks attending to different imaging modalities. A hierarchical gating network combines the expert predictions and fosters expertise collaboration. Furthermore, we introduce a curriculum learning strategy during training to avoid the degeneration of each expert network and preserve their specialization. We evaluated the proposed method on nine brain lesion datasets, encompassing five imaging modalities and eight lesion types. The results show that our model outperforms state-of-the-art universal models and provides promising generalization to unseen datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>The w...</summary><p>The work has been early accepted by MICCAI 2024</p></details> |

In this study, we utilize 283,582 unique, unlabeled TikTok video clips, categorized into 386 hashtags, to train a domain-specific foundation model for action recognition. We employ VideoMAE V2, an advanced model integrating Masked Autoencoders (MAE) with Vision Transformers (ViT), pre-trained on this diverse collection of unstructured videos. Our model, fine-tuned on established action recognition benchmarks such as UCF101 and HMDB51, achieves state-of-the-art results: 99.05% on UCF101, 86.08% on HMDB51, 85.51% on Kinetics-400, and 74.27% on Something-Something V2 using the ViT-giant backbone. These results highlight the potential of using unstructured and unlabeled videos as a valuable source of diverse and dynamic content for training foundation models. Our investigation confirms that while initial increases in pre-training data volume significantly enhance model performance, the gains diminish as the dataset size continues to expand. Our findings emphasize two critical axioms in self-supervised learning for computer vision: (1) additional pre-training data can yield diminishing benefits for some datasets and (2) quality is more important than quantity in self-supervised learning, especially when building foundation models.</p></details> | 10 pages |

In this study, we introduce OmniGenome, a foundation model that addresses this critical challenge of sequence-structure alignment in RNA FMs. OmniGenome bridges the sequences with secondary structures using structure-contextualized modeling, enabling hard in-silico genomic tasks that existing FMs cannot handle, e.g., RNA design tasks. The results on two comprehensive genomic benchmarks show that OmniGenome achieves state-of-the-art performance on complex RNA subtasks. For example, OmniGenome solved 74% of complex puzzles, compared to SpliceBERT which solved only 3% of the puzzles. Besides, OmniGenome solves most of the puzzles within $1$ hour, while the existing methods usually allocate $24$ hours for each puzzle. Overall, OmniGenome establishes wide genomic application cases and offers profound insights into biological mechanisms from the perspective of sequence-structure alignment.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted to NeurIPS 2024, 19 pages</p></details> |

To make progress towards better LLM autoraters, we introduce FLAMe, a family of Foundational Large Autorater Models. FLAMe is trained on our large and diverse collection of 100+ quality assessment tasks comprising 5M+ human judgments, curated and standardized using publicly released human evaluations from previous research. FLAMe significantly improves generalization to a wide variety of held-out tasks, outperforming LLMs trained on proprietary data like GPT-4 and Claude-3 on many tasks. We show that FLAMe can also serve as a powerful starting point for further downstream fine-tuning, using reward modeling evaluation as a case study (FLAMe-RM). Notably, on RewardBench, our FLAMe-RM-24B model (with an accuracy of 87.8%) is the top-performing generative model trained exclusively on permissively licensed data, outperforming both GPT-4-0125 (85.9%) and GPT-4o (84.7%). Additionally, we explore a more computationally efficient approach using a novel tail-patch fine-tuning strategy to optimize our FLAMe multitask mixture for reward modeling evaluation (FLAMe-Opt-RM), offering competitive RewardBench performance while requiring approximately 25x less training datapoints. Overall, our FLAMe variants outperform all popular proprietary LLM-as-a-Judge models we consider across 8 out of 12 autorater evaluation benchmarks, encompassing 53 quality assessment tasks, including RewardBench and LLM-AggreFact. Finally, our analysis reveals that FLAMe is significantly less biased than these LLM-as-a-Judge models on the CoBBLEr autorater bias benchmark, while effectively identifying high-quality responses for code generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages, 5 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |

For the first time, we provide a preliminary investigation with similar interpretability methods for medical imaging. Specifically, we analyze the features from a ViT-Small encoder obtained from a pathology Foundation Model via application to two datasets: one dataset of pathology images, and one dataset of pathology images paired with spatial transcriptomics. We discover an interpretable representation of cell and tissue morphology, along with gene expression within the model embedding space. Our work paves the way for further exploration around interpretable feature dimensions and their utility for medical and clinical applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Aligning Neuronal Coding of Dynamic Visual Scenes with Foundation Vision Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10737v1)** | 2024-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Our brains represent the ever-changing environment with neurons in a highly dynamic fashion. The temporal features of visual pixels in dynamic natural scenes are entrapped in the neuronal responses of the retina. It is crucial to establish the intrinsic temporal relationship between visual pixels and neuronal responses. Recent foundation vision models have paved an advanced way of understanding image pixels. Yet, neuronal coding in the brain largely lacks a deep understanding of its alignment with pixels. Most previous studies employ static images or artificial videos derived from static images for emulating more real and complicated stimuli. Despite these simple scenarios effectively help to separate key factors influencing visual coding, complex temporal relationships receive no consideration. To decompose the temporal features of visual coding in natural scenes, here we propose Vi-ST, a spatiotemporal convolutional neural network fed with a self-supervised Vision Transformer (ViT) prior, aimed at unraveling the temporal-based encoding patterns of retinal neuronal populations. The model demonstrates robust predictive performance in generalization tests. Furthermore, through detailed ablation experiments, we demonstrate the significance of each temporal module. Furthermore, we introduce a visual coding evaluation metric designed to integrate temporal considerations and compare the impact of different numbers of neuronal populations on complementary coding. In conclusion, our proposed Vi-ST demonstrates a novel modeling framework for neuronal coding of dynamic visual scenes in the brain, effectively aligning our brain representation of video with neuronal activity.

| **[PathoTune: Adapting Visual Foundation Model to Pathological Specialists](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16497v2)** | 2024-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As natural image understanding moves towards the pretrain-finetune era, research in pathology imaging is concurrently evolving. Despite the predominant focus on pretraining pathological foundation models, how to adapt foundation models to downstream tasks is little explored. For downstream adaptation, we propose the existence of two domain gaps, i.e., the Foundation-Task Gap and the Task-Instance Gap. To mitigate these gaps, we introduce PathoTune, a framework designed to efficiently adapt pathological or even visual foundation models to pathology-specific tasks via multi-modal prompt tuning. The proposed framework leverages Task-specific Visual Prompts and Task-specific Textual Prompts to identify task-relevant features, along with Instance-specific Visual Prompts for encoding single pathological image features. Results across multiple datasets at both patch-level and WSI-level demonstrate its superior performance over single-modality prompt tuning approaches. Significantly, PathoTune facilitates the direct adaptation of natural visual foundation models to pathological tasks, drastically outperforming pathological foundation models with simple linear probing. The code is available at https://github.com/openmedlab/PathoDuet.</p></details> | MICCAI 2024 |

To further unleash the power of foundation models, we present FIND, a generalized interface for aligning foundation models' embeddings with unified image and dataset-level understanding spanning modality and granularity. As shown in the teaser figure, a lightweight transformer interface without tuning any foundation model weights is enough for segmentation, grounding, and retrieval in an interleaved manner. The proposed interface has the following favorable attributes: (1) Generalizable. It applies to various tasks spanning retrieval, segmentation, etc., under the same architecture and weights. (2) Interleavable. With the benefit of multi-task multi-modal training, the proposed interface creates an interleaved shared embedding space. (3) Extendable. The proposed interface is adaptive to new tasks, and new models. In light of the interleaved embedding space, we introduce FIND-Bench, which introduces new training and evaluation annotations to the COCO dataset for interleaved segmentation and retrieval. We are the first work aligning foundations models' embeddings for interleave understanding. Meanwhile, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on FIND-Bench and competitive performance on standard retrieval and segmentation settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>CODE:...</summary><p>CODE: https://github.com/UX-Decoder/FIND</p></details> |
| **[Accessing Vision Foundation Models at ImageNet-level Costs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10366v1)** | 2024-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision foundation models are renowned for their generalization ability due to massive training data. Nevertheless, they demand tremendous training resources, and the training data is often inaccessible, e.g., CLIP, DINOv2, posing great challenges to developing derivatives that could advance research in this field. In this work, we offer a very simple and general solution, named Proteus, to distill foundation models into smaller equivalents on ImageNet-1K without access to the original training data. Specifically, we remove the designs from conventional knowledge distillation settings that result in dataset bias and present three levels of training objectives, i.e., token, patch, and feature, to maximize the efficacy of knowledge transfer. In this manner, Proteus is trained at ImageNet-level costs with surprising ability, facilitating the accessibility of training foundation models for the broader research community. Leveraging DINOv2-g/14 as the teacher, Proteus-L/14 matches the performance of the Oracle method DINOv2-L/14 (142M training data) across 15 benchmarks and outperforms other vision foundation models including CLIP-L/14 (400M), OpenCLIP-L/14 (400M/2B) and SynCLR-L/14 (600M).</p></details> |  |

For this to occur, humans internally estimate how hand movements affect the object's movement. We wish to endow robots with this capability. We contribute methodology to jointly estimate the geometry and pose of objects grasped by a robot, from RGB images captured by an external camera. Notably, our method transforms the estimated geometry into the robot's coordinate frame, while not requiring the extrinsic parameters of the external camera to be calibrated. Our approach leverages 3D foundation models, large models pre-trained on huge datasets for 3D vision tasks, to produce initial estimates of the in-hand object. These initial estimations do not have physically correct scales and are in the camera's frame. Then, we formulate, and efficiently solve, a coordinate-alignment problem to recover accurate scales, along with a transformation of the objects to the coordinate frame of the robot. Forward kinematics mappings can subsequently be defined from the manipulator's joint angles to specified points on the object. These mappings enable the estimation of points on the held object at arbitrary configurations, enabling robot motion to be designed with respect to coordinates on the grasped objects. We empirically evaluate our approach on a robot manipulator holding a diverse set of real-world objects.</p></details> |  |

Despite significant progress in object segmentation, part-level segmentation remains underexplored due to complex boundaries and scarce annotated data. To address this, we propose a novel Weakly-supervised Part Segmentation (WPS) setting and an approach called WPS-SAM, built on the large-scale pre-trained vision foundation model, Segment Anything Model (SAM). WPS-SAM is an end-to-end framework designed to extract prompt tokens directly from images and perform pixel-level segmentation of part regions. During its training phase, it only uses weakly supervised labels in the form of bounding boxes or points. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, through exploiting the rich knowledge embedded in pre-trained foundation models, WPS-SAM outperforms other segmentation models trained with pixel-level strong annotations. Specifically, WPS-SAM achieves 68.93% mIOU and 79.53% mACC on the PartImageNet dataset, surpassing state-of-the-art fully supervised methods by approximately 4% in terms of mIOU.</p></details> |  |
| **[Resource Management for Low-latency Cooperative Fine-tuning of Foundation Models at the Network Edge](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09873v1)** | 2024-07-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The emergence of large-scale foundation models (FoMo's) that can perform human-like intelligence motivates their deployment at the network edge for devices to access state-of-the-art artificial intelligence. For better user experiences, the pre-trained FoMo's need to be adapted to specialized downstream tasks through fine-tuning techniques. To transcend a single device's memory and computation limitations, we advocate multi-device cooperation within the device-edge cooperative fine-tuning (DEFT) paradigm, where edge devices cooperate to simultaneously optimize different parts of fine-tuning parameters within a FoMo. However, the parameter blocks reside at different depths within a FoMo architecture, leading to varied computation latency-and-memory cost due to gradient backpropagation-based calculations. The heterogeneous on-device computation and memory capacities and channel conditions necessitate an integrated communication-and-computation allocation of local computation loads and communication resources to achieve low-latency (LoLa) DEFT. To this end, we consider the depth-ware DEFT block allocation problem. The involved optimal block-device matching is tackled by the proposed low-complexity Cutting-RecoUNting-CHecking (CRUNCH) algorithm, which is designed by exploiting the monotone-increasing property between block depth and computation latency-and-memory cost. Next, the joint bandwidth-and-block allocation makes the problem more sophisticated. We observe a splittable Lagrangian expression through the transformation and analysis of the original problem, where the variables indicating device involvement are introduced. Then, the dual ascent method is employed to tackle this problem iteratively. Through extensive experiments conducted on the GLUE benchmark, our results demonstrate significant latency reduction achievable by LoLa DEFT for fine-tuning a RoBERTa model.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

As a result, FM leaderboards, especially those hosted on cloud platforms, have become essential tools for SE teams to compare and select the best third-party FMs for their specific products and purposes. However, the lack of standardized guidelines for FM evaluation and comparison threatens the transparency of FM leaderboards and limits stakeholders' ability to perform effective FM selection. As a first step towards addressing this challenge, our research focuses on understanding how these FM leaderboards operate in real-world scenarios ("leaderboard operations") and identifying potential leaderboard pitfalls and areas for improvement ("leaderboard smells"). In this regard, we perform a multivocal literature review to collect up to 721 FM leaderboards, after which we examine their documentation and engage in direct communication with leaderboard operators to understand their workflow patterns. Using card sorting and negotiated agreement, we identify 5 unique workflow patterns and develop a domain model that outlines the essential components and their interaction within FM leaderboards. We then identify 8 unique types of leaderboard smells in LBOps. By mitigating these smells, SE teams can improve transparency, accountability, and collaboration in current LBOps practices, fostering a more robust and responsible ecosystem for FM comparison and selection.</p></details> | <details><summary>aweso...</summary><p>awesome foundation model leaderboard list: https://github.com/SAILResearch/awesome-foundation-model-leaderboards</p></details> |

Traditional methods for bias mitigation face limitations due to the restricted access to web-hosted FMs and difficulties in addressing the underlying bias encoded within the FM API. We propose a D(ebiased) N(oise) E(diting) strategy, termed DNE, which generates DNE noise to mask such spurious correlation. DNE is capable of mitigating bias both within the FM API embedding and the images themselves. Furthermore, DNE is suitable for both white-box and black-box FM APIs, where we introduced G(reedy) (Z)eroth-O(rder) (GeZO) optimization for it when the gradient is inaccessible in black-box APIs. Our whole pipeline enables fairness-aware image editing that can be applied across various medical contexts without requiring direct model manipulation or significant computational resources. Our empirical results demonstrate the method's effectiveness in maintaining fairness and utility across different patient groups and diseases. In the era of AI-driven medicine, this work contributes to making healthcare diagnostics more equitable, showcasing a practical solution for bias mitigation in pre-trained image FMs. Our code is provided at https://github.com/ubc-tea/DNE-foundation-model-fairness.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 3 figures.

In this paper, we call for the development of, and state why we believe in, the potential of FMs for electric grids. We highlight their strengths and weaknesses amidst the challenges of a changing grid. We argue that an FM learning from diverse grid data and topologies could unlock transformative capabilities, pioneering a new approach in leveraging AI to redefine how we manage complexity and uncertainty in the electric grid.

Industry and research community have witnessed a large number of new applications, based on those foundation models. Such applications include question and answer, customer services, image and video generation, and code completions, among others. However, as the number of model parameters reaches to hundreds of billions, their deployment incurs prohibitive inference costs and high latency in real-world scenarios. As a result, the demand for cost-effective and fast inference using AI accelerators is ever more higher.

However, due to the high cost of obtaining pre-training datasets, pairs with weak image-text correlation in the data exist in large numbers. We call them weak-paired samples. Due to the limitations of these weak-paired samples, the pre-training model are unable to mine all the knowledge from pre-training data. The existing adaptation methods do not consider the missing knowledge, which may lead to crucial task-related knowledge for the downstream tasks being ignored. To address this issue, we propose a new adaptation framework called Data Adaptive Traceback (DAT). Specifically, we utilize a zero-shot-based method to extract the most downstream task-related subset of the pre-training data to enable the downstream tasks. Furthermore, we adopt a pseudo-label-based semi-supervised technique to reuse the pre-training images and a vision-language contrastive learning method to address the confirmation bias issue in semi-supervised learning. We conduct extensive experiments that show our proposed DAT approach meaningfully improves various benchmark datasets performance over traditional adaptation methods by simply.</p></details> | 9 pages,4 figures |

Notably, several models trained on large quantities of clinical data have been made publicly available in recent months. This will significantly enhance scientific research in computational pathology and help bridge the gap between research and clinical deployment. With the increase in availability of public foundation models of different sizes, trained using different algorithms on different datasets, it becomes important to establish a benchmark to compare the performance of such models on a variety of clinically relevant tasks spanning multiple organs and diseases. In this work, we present a collection of pathology datasets comprising clinical slides associated with clinically relevant endpoints including cancer diagnoses and a variety of biomarkers generated during standard hospital operation from two medical centers. We leverage these datasets to systematically assess the performance of public pathology foundation models and provide insights into best practices for training new foundation models and selecting appropriate pretrained models.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2310.07033</p></details> |
| **[Paving the way toward foundation models for irregular and unaligned Satellite Image Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08448v1)** | 2024-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although recently several foundation models for satellite remote sensing imagery have been proposed, they fail to address major challenges of real/operational applications. Indeed, embeddings that don't take into account the spectral, spatial and temporal dimensions of the data as well as the irregular or unaligned temporal sampling are of little use for most real world uses.As a consequence, we propose an ALIgned Sits Encoder (ALISE), a novel approach that leverages the spatial, spectral, and temporal dimensions of irregular and unaligned SITS while producing aligned latent representations. Unlike SSL models currently available for SITS, ALISE incorporates a flexible query mechanism to project the SITS into a common and learned temporal projection space. Additionally, thanks to a multi-view framework, we explore integration of instance discrimination along a masked autoencoding task to SITS. The quality of the produced representation is assessed through three downstream tasks: crop segmentation (PASTIS), land cover segmentation (MultiSenGE), and a novel crop change detection dataset. Furthermore, the change detection task is performed without supervision. The results suggest that the use of aligned representations is more effective than previous SSL methods for linear probing segmentation tasks.</p></details> |  |

This work provides a novel scheme to perform masked modeling based pre-training to learn permutation invariant functions on sets. More generally, this work provides a step towards building large foundation models for HEP that can be generically pre-trained with self-supervised learning and later fine-tuned for a variety of down-stream tasks. In MPM, particles in a set are masked and the training objective is to recover their identity, as defined by a discretized token representation of a pre-trained vector quantized variational autoencoder. We study the efficacy of the method in samples of high energy jets at collider physics experiments, including studies on the impact of discretization, permutation invariance, and ordering. We also study the fine-tuning capability of the model, showing that it can be adapted to tasks such as supervised and weakly supervised jet classification, and that the model can transfer efficiently with small fine-tuning data sets to new classes and new data domains.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we outline our vision of introducing Foundation Model (FM) engineering, a strategic response to the anticipated FM crisis with principled engineering methodologies. FM engineering aims to mitigate potential issues in FM development and application through the introduction of declarative, automated, and unified programming interfaces for both data and model management, reducing the complexities involved in working with FMs by providing a more structured and intuitive process for developers.

In addition to characterizing how these models understand and reason with natural language, we also investigate how well they comprehend cultural practices, nuances, and values. Alongside standard accuracy metrics, we investigate the brittleness of foundation models in the dimensions of semantics and multilinguality. Our analyses span both open-sourced and closed models, leading to empirical results across classic NLP tasks, reasoning, and cultural comprehension. Key findings indicate (1) Most models exhibit varied behavior when given paraphrased instructions. (2) Many models still suffer from exposure bias (e.g., positional bias, majority label bias). (3) For questions rooted in factual, scientific, and commonsense knowledge, consistent responses are expected across multilingual queries that are semantically equivalent. Yet, most models surprisingly demonstrate inconsistent performance on these queries. (4) Multilingually-trained models have not attained "balanced multilingual" capabilities. Our endeavors underscore the need for more generalizable semantic representations and enhanced multilingual contextualization. SeaEval can serve as a launchpad for more thorough investigations and evaluations for multilingual and multicultural scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at NAACL 2024.

| **[Towards Interpretable Foundation Models of Robot Behavior: A Task Specific Policy Generation Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08065v1)** | 2024-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models are a promising path toward general-purpose and user-friendly robots. The prevalent approach involves training a generalist policy that, like a reinforcement learning policy, uses observations to output actions. Although this approach has seen much success, several concerns arise when considering deployment and end-user interaction with these systems. In particular, the lack of modularity between tasks means that when model weights are updated (e.g., when a user provides feedback), the behavior in other, unrelated tasks may be affected. This can negatively impact the system's interpretability and usability. We present an alternative approach to the design of robot foundation models, Diffusion for Policy Parameters (DPP), which generates stand-alone, task-specific policies. Since these policies are detached from the foundation model, they are updated only when a user wants, either through feedback or personalization, allowing them to gain a high degree of familiarity with that policy. We demonstrate a proof-of-concept of DPP in simulation then discuss its limitations and the future of interpretable foundation models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Short...</summary><p>Short Paper accepted to RLC 2024 Workshop on Training Agents with Foundation Models</p></details> |

However, their performance under domain shift is yet underexplored. This paper investigates the zero-shot domain adaptation potential of FMs by comparing different backbone architectures and introducing novel domain-aware components that leverage domain related textual embeddings. We propose domain adaptive normalization, termed as Domino, which explicitly leverages domain embeddings during fine-tuning, thus making the model domain aware. Ultimately, Domino enables more robust computer vision models that can adapt effectively to various unseen domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICML 2024 Workshop on Foundation Models in the Wild</p></details> |
| **[Federated Foundation Model for Cardiac CT Imaging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07557v1)** | 2024-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated learning (FL) is a renowned technique for utilizing decentralized data while preserving privacy. However, real-world applications often involve inherent challenges such as partially labeled datasets, where not all clients possess expert annotations of all labels of interest, leaving large portions of unlabeled data unused. In this study, we conduct the largest federated cardiac CT imaging analysis to date, focusing on partially labeled datasets ($n=8,124$) of Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation (TAVI) patients over eight hospital clients. Transformer architectures, which are the major building blocks of current foundation models, have shown superior performance when trained on larger cohorts than traditional CNNs. However, when trained on small task-specific labeled sample sizes, it is currently not feasible to exploit their underlying attention mechanism for improved performance. Therefore, we developed a two-stage semi-supervised learning strategy that distills knowledge from several task-specific CNNs (landmark detection and segmentation of calcification) into a single transformer model by utilizing large amounts of unlabeled data typically residing unused in hospitals to mitigate these issues. This method not only improves the predictive accuracy and generalizability of transformer-based architectures but also facilitates the simultaneous learning of all partial labels within a single transformer model across the federation. Additionally, we show that our transformer-based model extracts more meaningful features for further downstream tasks than the UNet-based one by only training the last layer to also solve segmentation of coronary arteries. We make the code and weights of the final model openly available, which can serve as a foundation model for further research in cardiac CT imaging.</p></details> |  |

Traditional TSF foundation models rely heavily on numerical data fitting. In contrast, the human brain is inherently skilled at processing visual information, prefer predicting future trends by observing visualized sequences. From a biomimetic perspective, utilizing models to directly process numerical sequences might not be the most effective route to achieving Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). This paper proposes ViTime, a novel Visual Intelligence-based foundation model for TSF. ViTime overcomes the limitations of numerical time series data fitting by utilizing visual data processing paradigms and employs a innovative data synthesis method during training, called Real Time Series (RealTS). Experiments on a diverse set of previously unseen forecasting datasets demonstrate that ViTime achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance, even surpassing the best individually trained supervised models in some situations. These findings suggest that visual intelligence can significantly enhance time series analysis and forecasting, paving the way for more advanced and versatile models in the field.

However, foundation models that can freely sense, interact, and actuate the physical world like in the digital domain is far from being realized. This is due to a number of challenges including: 1) being constrained to the types of static devices and sensors deployed, 2) events often being localized to one part of a large space, and 3) requiring dense and deployments of devices to achieve full coverage. As a critical step towards enabling foundation models to successfully and freely interact with the physical environment, we propose RASP, a modular and reconfigurable sensing and actuation platform that allows drones to autonomously swap onboard sensors and actuators in only $25$ seconds, allowing a single drone to quickly adapt to a diverse range of tasks. We demonstrate through real smart home deployments that RASP enables FMs and LLMs to complete diverse tasks up to $85\%$ more successfully by allowing them to target specific areas with specific sensors and actuators on-the-fly.</p></details> |  |

However, due to the gap between pre-training tasks (or modalities) and downstream tasks (or modalities), the real-world computation and speed constraints, it might not be straightforward to apply medical foundation models in the downstream scenarios. Previous methods, such as parameter efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods and knowledge distillation (KD) methods, are unable to simultaneously address the task (or modality) inconsistency and achieve personalized lightweight deployment under diverse real-world demands. To address the above issues, we propose a novel framework called Reprogramming Distillation (RD). On one hand, RD reprograms the original feature space of the foundation model so that it is more relevant to downstream scenarios, aligning tasks and modalities. On the other hand, through a co-training mechanism and a shared classifier, connections are established between the reprogrammed knowledge and the knowledge of student models, ensuring that the reprogrammed feature space can be smoothly mimic by the student model of different structures. Further, to reduce the randomness under different training conditions, we design a Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) distillation to promote robust knowledge transfer. Empirically, we show that on extensive datasets, RD consistently achieve superior performance compared with previous PEFT and KD methods.</p></details> | MICCAI 2024 |

However, the existing benchmarks (e.g. Kinetics) and their evaluation protocols are often limited by relatively poor diversity, high evaluation costs, and saturated performance metrics. In this paper, we build a comprehensive benchmark suite to address these issues, namely VideoEval. Specifically, we establish the Video Task Adaption Benchmark (VidTAB) and the Video Embedding Benchmark (VidEB) from two perspectives: evaluating the task adaptability of VFMs under few-shot conditions and assessing their representation power by directly applying to downstream tasks. With VideoEval, we conduct a large-scale study on 20 popular open-source vision foundation models. Our study reveals some insightful findings on VFMs: 1) overall, current VFMs exhibit weak generalization across diverse tasks, 2) increasing video data, whether labeled or weakly-labeled video-text pairs, does not necessarily improve task performance, 3) the effectiveness of some pre-training paradigms may not be fully validated in previous benchmarks, and 4) combining different pre-training paradigms can help improve the generalization capabilities. We believe this study serves as an important complement to the current evaluation for VFMs and offers valuable insights for the future research.</p></details> |  |

However, these zero-shot methods focus only on solving high-level task planning by selecting nodes in predefined navigation graphs for movements, overlooking low-level control in realistic navigation scenarios. To bridge this gap, we propose AO-Planner, a novel affordances-oriented planning framework for continuous VLN task. Our AO-Planner integrates various foundation models to achieve affordances-oriented motion planning and action decision-making, both performed in a zero-shot manner. Specifically, we employ a visual affordances prompting (VAP) approach, where visible ground is segmented utilizing SAM to provide navigational affordances, based on which the LLM selects potential next waypoints and generates low-level path planning towards selected waypoints. We further introduce a high-level agent, PathAgent, to identify the most probable pixel-based path and convert it into 3D coordinates to fulfill low-level motion. Experimental results on the challenging R2R-CE benchmark demonstrate that AO-Planner achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance (5.5% improvement in SPL). Our method establishes an effective connection between LLM and 3D world to circumvent the difficulty of directly predicting world coordinates, presenting novel prospects for employing foundation models in low-level motion control.</p></details> |  |

Our approach first calibrates the image with the help of the color checker target, and then trains a supervised-learning model to predict the skin color. In the calibration stage, We propose to use three different transformation matrices to map the device dependent RGB response to the reference CIE XYZ space. In so doing, color correction error can be minimized. We then compute the average value of the region of interest in the calibrated images, and feed them to the prediction model. We explored both the linear regression and support vector regression models. Cross-validation results show that both models can accurately make the prediction.</p></details> | <details><summary>Color...</summary><p>Color Imaging: Displaying, Processing, Hardcopy, and Applications, 373:1-373:6</p></details> |

However, the success of current methods heavily relies on the employment of extensive unlabeled data to pre-train an effective feature extractor, which limits their applicability in scenarios where a substantial amount of unlabeled data is unavailable. In this paper, we propose the first foundation model-enabled one-shot landmark detection (FM-OSD) framework for accurate landmark detection in medical images by utilizing solely a single template image without any additional unlabeled data. Specifically, we use the frozen image encoder of visual foundation models as the feature extractor, and introduce dual-branch global and local feature decoders to increase the resolution of extracted features in a coarse to fine manner. The introduced feature decoders are efficiently trained with a distance-aware similarity learning loss to incorporate domain knowledge from the single template image. Moreover, a novel bidirectional matching strategy is developed to improve both robustness and accuracy of landmark detection in the case of scattered similarity map obtained by foundation models. We validate our method on two public anatomical landmark detection datasets. By using solely a single template image, our method demonstrates significant superiority over strong state-of-the-art one-shot landmark detection methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at MICCAI 2024</p></details> |

This leads the performance of FL to be significantly degraded, as the global model tends to struggle to converge. To solve this problem, we propose Differentially Private Synthetic Data Aided Federated Learning Using Foundation Models (DPSDA-FL), a novel data augmentation strategy that aids in homogenizing the local data present on the clients' side. DPSDA-FL improves the training of the local models by leveraging differentially private synthetic data generated from foundation models. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by evaluating it on the benchmark image dataset: CIFAR-10. Our experimental results have shown that DPSDA-FL can improve class recall and classification accuracy of the global model by up to 26% and 9%, respectively, in FL with Non-IID issues.</p></details> |  |

The integration of the two has garnered significant attention from the AI research community. In this work, we attempt to provide an in-depth and comprehensive evaluation of the performance of MFM s on embodied task planning, aiming to shed light on their capabilities and limitations in this domain. To this end, based on the characteristics of embodied task planning, we first develop a systematic evaluation framework, which encapsulates four crucial capabilities of MFMs: object understanding, spatio-temporal perception, task understanding, and embodied reasoning. Following this, we propose a new benchmark, named MFE-ETP, characterized its complex and variable task scenarios, typical yet diverse task types, task instances of varying difficulties, and rich test case types ranging from multiple embodied question answering to embodied task reasoning. Finally, we offer a simple and easy-to-use automatic evaluation platform that enables the automated testing of multiple MFMs on the proposed benchmark. Using the benchmark and evaluation platform, we evaluated several state-of-the-art MFMs and found that they significantly lag behind human-level performance. The MFE-ETP is a high-quality, large-scale, and challenging benchmark relevant to real-world tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Path-based Algebraic Foundations of Graph Query Languages](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04823v1)** | 2024-07-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph databases are gaining momentum thanks to the flexibility and expressiveness of their data model and query languages. A standardization activity driven by the ISO/IEC standardization body is also ongoing and has already conducted to the specification of the first versions of two standard graph query languages, namely SQL/PGQ and GQL, respectively in 2023 and 2024. Apart from the standards, there exists a panoply of concrete graph query languages in commercial and open-source graph databases, each of which exhibits different features and modes. In this paper, we tackle the heterogeneity problem of graph query languages by laying the foundations of a unifying path-oriented algebraic framework. Such a theoretical framework is currently missing in the graph databases landscape, thus impeding a lingua franca in which different graph query language implementations can be expressed and cross-compared. Our framework gives a blueprint for correct implementation of graph queries of different expressiveness. It allows to overcome the boundaries of current versions of standard query languages, thus paving the way to future extensions including query composability. It also allows, when the path-based semantics is stripped off, to express classical Codd's relational algebra enhanced with a recursive operator, thus proving its utility for a wide range of queries in database management systems.</p></details> | Under review |

One of the interesting aspects of these models is their ability to perform tasks other than automatic speech recognition (ASR) using an appropriate prompt. For example, the OpenAI Whisper model can perform both speech transcription and speech translation. With the development of audio-prompted LLMs there is the potential for even greater control options. In this work we demonstrate that with this greater flexibility the systems can be susceptible to model-control adversarial attacks. Without any access to the model prompt it is possible to modify the behaviour of the system by appropriately changing the audio input. To illustrate this risk, we demonstrate that it is possible to prepend a short universal adversarial acoustic segment to any input speech signal to override the prompt setting of an ASR foundation model. Specifically, we successfully use a universal adversarial acoustic segment to control Whisper to always perform speech translation, despite being set to perform speech transcription. Overall, this work demonstrates a new form of adversarial attack on multi-tasking speech enabled foundation models that needs to be considered prior to the deployment of this form of model.</p></details> |  |
| **[Lift, Splat, Map: Lifting Foundation Masks for Label-Free Semantic Scene Completion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03425v1)** | 2024-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous mobile robots deployed in urban environments must be context-aware, i.e., able to distinguish between different semantic entities, and robust to occlusions. Current approaches like semantic scene completion (SSC) require pre-enumerating the set of classes and costly human annotations, while representation learning methods relax these assumptions but are not robust to occlusions and learn representations tailored towards auxiliary tasks. To address these limitations, we propose LSMap, a method that lifts masks from visual foundation models to predict a continuous, open-set semantic and elevation-aware representation in bird's eye view (BEV) for the entire scene, including regions underneath dynamic entities and in occluded areas. Our model only requires a single RGBD image, does not require human labels, and operates in real time. We quantitatively demonstrate our approach outperforms existing models trained from scratch on semantic and elevation scene completion tasks with finetuning. Furthermore, we show that our pre-trained representation outperforms existing visual foundation models at unsupervised semantic scene completion. We evaluate our approach using CODa, a large-scale, real-world urban robot dataset. Supplementary visualizations, code, data, and pre-trained models, will be publicly available soon.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 6 figures, 2 Tables</p></details> |

However, the deployment of foundation models in healthcare necessitates a rigorous examination of their trustworthiness, encompassing privacy, robustness, reliability, explainability, and fairness. The current body of survey literature on foundation models in medical imaging reveals considerable gaps, particularly in the area of trustworthiness. Additionally, extant surveys on the trustworthiness of foundation models fail to address their specific variations and applications within the medical imaging domain. This survey paper reviews the current research on foundation models in the major medical imaging applications, with a focus on segmentation, medical report generation, medical question and answering (Q&A), and disease diagnosis, which includes trustworthiness discussion in their manuscripts. We explore the complex challenges of making foundation models for medical image analysis trustworthy, associated with each application, and summarize the current concerns and strategies to enhance trustworthiness. Furthermore, we explore the future promises of these models in revolutionizing patient care. Our analysis underscores the imperative for advancing towards trustworthy AI in medical image analysis, advocating for a balanced approach that fosters innovation while ensuring ethical and equitable healthcare delivery.</p></details> |  |

However, it is challenging to characterize and study progress in multimodal foundation models, given the range of possible modeling decisions, tasks, and domains. In this paper, we introduce Holistic Evaluation of Multimodal Models (HEMM) to systematically evaluate the capabilities of multimodal foundation models across a set of 3 dimensions: basic skills, information flow, and real-world use cases. Basic multimodal skills are internal abilities required to solve problems, such as learning interactions across modalities, fine-grained alignment, multi-step reasoning, and the ability to handle external knowledge. Information flow studies how multimodal content changes during a task through querying, translation, editing, and fusion. Use cases span domain-specific challenges introduced in real-world multimedia, affective computing, natural sciences, healthcare, and human-computer interaction applications. Through comprehensive experiments across the 30 tasks in HEMM, we (1) identify key dataset dimensions (e.g., basic skills, information flows, and use cases) that pose challenges to today's models, and (2) distill performance trends regarding how different modeling dimensions (e.g., scale, pre-training data, multimodal alignment, pre-training, and instruction tuning objectives) influence performance. Our conclusions regarding challenging multimodal interactions, use cases, and tasks requiring reasoning and external knowledge, the benefits of data and model scale, and the impacts of instruction tuning yield actionable insights for future work in multimodal foundation models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code available at https://github.com/pliang279/HEMM</p></details> |

However, these models also raise significant concerns about their fairness, especially when applied to diverse and underrepresented populations in healthcare applications. Currently, there is a lack of comprehensive benchmarks, standardized pipelines, and easily adaptable libraries to evaluate and understand the fairness performance of FMs in medical imaging, leading to considerable challenges in formulating and implementing solutions that ensure equitable outcomes across diverse patient populations. To fill this gap, we introduce FairMedFM, a fairness benchmark for FM research in medical imaging.FairMedFM integrates with 17 popular medical imaging datasets, encompassing different modalities, dimensionalities, and sensitive attributes. It explores 20 widely used FMs, with various usages such as zero-shot learning, linear probing, parameter-efficient fine-tuning, and prompting in various downstream tasks -- classification and segmentation. Our exhaustive analysis evaluates the fairness performance over different evaluation metrics from multiple perspectives, revealing the existence of bias, varied utility-fairness trade-offs on different FMs, consistent disparities on the same datasets regardless FMs, and limited effectiveness of existing unfairness mitigation methods. Checkout FairMedFM's project page and open-sourced codebase, which supports extendible functionalities and applications as well as inclusive for studies on FMs in medical imaging over the long term.</p></details> | 29 pages, 17 figures |
| **[Federated Fine-Tuning for Pre-Trained Foundation Models Over Wireless Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02924v1)** | 2024-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pre-trained foundation models (FMs), with extensive number of neurons, are key to advancing next-generation intelligence services, where personalizing these models requires massive amount of task-specific data and computational resources. The prevalent solution involves centralized processing at the edge server, which, however, raises privacy concerns due to the transmission of raw data. Instead, federated fine-tuning (FedFT) is an emerging privacy-preserving fine-tuning (FT) paradigm for personalized pre-trained foundation models. In particular, by integrating low-rank adaptation (LoRA) with federated learning (FL), federated LoRA enables the collaborative FT of a global model with edge devices, achieving comparable learning performance to full FT while training fewer parameters over distributed data and preserving raw data privacy. However, the limited radio resources and computation capabilities of edge devices pose significant challenges for deploying federated LoRA over wireless networks. To this paper, we propose a split federated LoRA framework, which deploys the computationally-intensive encoder of a pre-trained model at the edge server, while keeping the embedding and task modules at the edge devices. Building on this split framework, the paper provides a rigorous analysis of the upper bound of the convergence gap for the wireless federated LoRA system. This analysis motivates the formulation of a long-term upper bound minimization problem, where we decompose the formulated long-term mixed-integer programming (MIP) problem into sequential sub-problems using the Lyapunov technique. We then develop an online algorithm for effective device scheduling and bandwidth allocation. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed online algorithm in enhancing learning performance.</p></details> |  |

This study addresses the need for efficient and objective evaluation methods by introducing ZEAL (surgical skill assessment with Zero-shot surgical tool segmentation with a unifiEd foundAtion modeL). ZEAL uses segmentation masks of surgical instruments obtained through a unified foundation model for proficiency assessment. Through zero-shot inference with text prompts, ZEAL predicts segmentation masks, capturing essential features of both instruments and surroundings. Utilizing sparse convolutional neural networks and segmentation masks, ZEAL extracts feature vectors for foreground (instruments) and background. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks encode temporal dynamics, modeling sequential data and dependencies in surgical videos. Combining LSTM-encoded vectors, ZEAL produces a surgical skill score, offering an objective measure of proficiency. Comparative analysis with conventional methods using open datasets demonstrates ZEAL's superiority, affirming its potential in advancing surgical training and evaluation. This innovative approach to surgical skill assessment addresses challenges in traditional supervised learning techniques, paving the way for enhanced surgical care quality and patient outcomes.</p></details> |  |

To handle this issue, we propose the General Computer Control (GCC) setting to restrict foundation agents to interact with software through the most unified and standardized interface, i.e., using screenshots as input and keyboard and mouse actions as output. We introduce Cradle, a modular and flexible LMM-powered framework, as a preliminary attempt towards GCC. Enhanced by six key modules, Cradle can understand input screenshots and output executable code for low-level keyboard and mouse control after high-level planning, so that Cradle can interact with any software and complete long-horizon complex tasks without relying on any built-in APIs. Experimental results show that Cradle exhibits remarkable generalizability and impressive performance across four previously unexplored commercial video games, five software applications, and a comprehensive benchmark, OSWorld. Cradle is the first to enable foundation agents to follow the main storyline and complete 40-minute-long real missions in the complex AAA game Red Dead Redemption 2 (RDR2). Cradle can also create a city of a thousand people in Cities: Skylines, farm and harvest parsnips in Stardew Valley, and trade and bargain with a maximal weekly total profit of 87% in Dealer's Life 2. Cradle can not only operate daily software, like Chrome, Outlook, and Feishu, but also edit images and videos using Meitu and CapCut. Cradle greatly extends the reach of foundation agents by enabling the easy conversion of any software, especially complex games, into benchmarks to evaluate agents' various abilities and facilitate further data collection, thus paving the way for generalist agents.</p></details> |  |

However, most of the production-grade systems rely on cloud solutions, such as GPT-4. While there have been several attempts to develop open foundation models for Azerbaijani, these works have not found their way into common use due to a lack of systemic benchmarking. This paper encompasses several lines of work that promote open-source foundation models for Azerbaijani. We introduce (1) a large text corpus for Azerbaijani, (2) a family of encoder-only language models trained on this dataset, (3) labeled datasets for evaluating these models, and (4) extensive evaluation that covers all major open-source models with Azerbaijani support.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the 1st SIGTURK Workshop</p></details> |

However, this approach faces a challenge when speakers talk simultaneously, requiring stereo dialogue data with speakers recorded on separate channels, a notably scarce resource. To address this, we have developed an innovative pipeline capable of transforming single-channel dialogue data into pseudo-stereo data. This expanded our training dataset from a mere 2,000 to an impressive 17,600 hours, significantly enriching the diversity and quality of the training examples available. The inclusion of this pseudo-stereo data has proven to be effective in improving the performance of spoken dialogue language models. Additionally, we explored the use of discrete units of different speech foundation models for spoken dialogue generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted to interspeech 2024</p></details> |

However, one of the key challenges of training embodied foundation models is the lack of data grounded in the physical world. In this paper, we propose AutoRT, a system that leverages existing foundation models to scale up the deployment of operational robots in completely unseen scenarios with minimal human supervision. AutoRT leverages vision-language models (VLMs) for scene understanding and grounding, and further uses large language models (LLMs) for proposing diverse and novel instructions to be performed by a fleet of robots. Guiding data collection by tapping into the knowledge of foundation models enables AutoRT to effectively reason about autonomy tradeoffs and safety while significantly scaling up data collection for robot learning. We demonstrate AutoRT proposing instructions to over 20 robots across multiple buildings and collecting 77k real robot episodes via both teleoperation and autonomous robot policies. We experimentally show that such "in-the-wild" data collected by AutoRT is significantly more diverse, and that AutoRT's use of LLMs allows for instruction following data collection robots that can align to human preferences.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, 9 figures, ICRA 2024 VLMNM Workshop</p></details> |

However, due to their high inference compute cost, these models cannot be deployed for many real-world applications. Motivated by this, we ask the following important question, "How can we leverage the knowledge from a large VFM to train a small task-specific model for a new target task with limited labeled training data?", and propose a simple task-oriented knowledge transfer approach as a highly effective solution to this problem. Our experimental results on five target tasks show that the proposed approach outperforms task-agnostic VFM distillation, web-scale CLIP pretraining, supervised ImageNet pretraining, and self-supervised DINO pretraining by up to 11.6%, 22.1%, 13.7%, and 29.8%, respectively. Furthermore, the proposed approach also demonstrates up to 9x, 4x and 15x reduction in pretraining compute cost when compared to task-agnostic VFM distillation, ImageNet pretraining and DINO pretraining, respectively, while outperforming them. We also show that the dataset used for transferring knowledge has a significant effect on the final target task performance, and introduce a retrieval-augmented knowledge transfer strategy that uses web-scale image retrieval to curate effective transfer sets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Inter...</summary><p>International Conference on Machine Learning, 2024</p></details> |

Graph-structured data often lacks the same scale as unstructured data, making the development of graph foundation models challenging. In this work, we propose Foundation-Informed Message Passing (FIMP), a Graph Neural Network (GNN) message-passing framework that leverages pretrained non-textual foundation models in graph-based tasks. We show that the self-attention layers of foundation models can effectively be repurposed on graphs to perform cross-node attention-based message-passing. Our model is evaluated on a real-world image network dataset and two biological applications (single-cell RNA sequencing data and fMRI brain activity recordings) in both finetuned and zero-shot settings. FIMP outperforms strong baselines, demonstrating that it can effectively leverage state-of-the-art foundation models in graph tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages (12 + 4 pages appendix). 5 figures and 4 tables</p></details> |
| **[Fine-tuning can cripple your foundation model; preserving features may be the solution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13320v3)** | 2024-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pre-trained foundation models, due to their enormous capacity and exposure to vast amounts of data during pre-training, are known to have learned plenty of real-world concepts. An important step in making these pre-trained models effective on downstream tasks is to fine-tune them on related datasets. While various fine-tuning methods have been devised and have been shown to be highly effective, we observe that a fine-tuned model's ability to recognize concepts on tasks $\textit{different}$ from the downstream one is reduced significantly compared to its pre-trained counterpart. This is an undesirable effect of fine-tuning as a substantial amount of resources was used to learn these pre-trained concepts in the first place. We call this phenomenon ''concept forgetting'' and via experiments show that most end-to-end fine-tuning approaches suffer heavily from this side effect. To this end, we propose a simple fix to this problem by designing a new fine-tuning method called $\textit{LDIFS}$ (short for $\ell_2$ distance in feature space) that, while learning new concepts related to the downstream task, allows a model to preserve its pre-trained knowledge as well. Through extensive experiments on 10 fine-tuning tasks we show that $\textit{LDIFS}$ significantly reduces concept forgetting. Additionally, we show that LDIFS is highly effective in performing continual fine-tuning on a sequence of tasks as well, in comparison with both fine-tuning as well as continual learning baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in TMLR: https://openreview.net/forum?id=kfhoeZCeW7</p></details> |

| **[Towards Graph Foundation Models: A Survey and Beyond](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11829v3)** | 2024-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models have emerged as critical components in a variety of artificial intelligence applications, and showcase significant success in natural language processing and several other domains. Meanwhile, the field of graph machine learning is witnessing a paradigm transition from shallow methods to more sophisticated deep learning approaches. The capabilities of foundation models to generalize and adapt motivate graph machine learning researchers to discuss the potential of developing a new graph learning paradigm. This paradigm envisions models that are pre-trained on extensive graph data and can be adapted for various graph tasks. Despite this burgeoning interest, there is a noticeable lack of clear definitions and systematic analyses pertaining to this new domain. To this end, this article introduces the concept of Graph Foundation Models (GFMs), and offers an exhaustive explanation of their key characteristics and underlying technologies. We proceed to classify the existing work related to GFMs into three distinct categories, based on their dependence on graph neural networks and large language models. In addition to providing a thorough review of the current state of GFMs, this article also outlooks potential avenues for future research in this rapidly evolving domain.</p></details> |  |

Here we introduce RetiZero, a vision-language foundation model that leverages knowledge from over 400 fundus diseases. To RetiZero's pre-training, we compiled 341,896 fundus images paired with text descriptions, sourced from public datasets, ophthalmic literature, and online resources, encompassing a diverse range of diseases across multiple ethnicities and countries. RetiZero exhibits superior performance in several downstream tasks, including zero-shot disease recognition, image-to-image retrieval, and internal- and cross-domain disease identification. In zero-shot scenarios, RetiZero achieves Top5 accuracy scores of 0.8430 for 15 fundus diseases and 0.7561 for 52 fundus diseases. For image retrieval, it achieves Top5 scores of 0.9500 and 0.8860 for the same disease sets, respectively. Clinical evaluations show that RetiZero's Top3 zero-shot performance surpasses the average of 19 ophthalmologists from Singapore, China and the United States. Furthermore, RetiZero significantly enhances clinicians' accuracy in diagnosing fundus disease. These findings underscore the value of integrating the RetiZero foundation model into clinical settings, where a variety of fundus diseases are encountered.</p></details> |  |

However, their effectiveness largely depends on pre-training with extensive datasets. Applying foundation models directly to small datasets of capsule endoscopy images from scratch is challenging. Pre-training on broad, general vision datasets is crucial for successfully fine-tuning our model for specific tasks. In this work, we introduce a simplified approach called Adapt foundation models with a low-rank adaptation (LoRA) technique for easier customization. Our method, inspired by the DINOv2 foundation model, applies low-rank adaptation learning to tailor foundation models for capsule endoscopy diagnosis effectively. Unlike traditional fine-tuning methods, our strategy includes LoRA layers designed to absorb specific surgical domain knowledge. During the training process, we keep the main model (the backbone encoder) fixed and focus on optimizing the LoRA layers and the disease classification component. We tested our method on two publicly available datasets for capsule endoscopy disease classification. The results were impressive, with our model achieving 97.75% accuracy on the Kvasir-Capsule dataset and 98.81% on the Kvasirv2 dataset. Our solution demonstrates that foundation models can be adeptly adapted for capsule endoscopy diagnosis, highlighting that mere reliance on straightforward fine-tuning or pre-trained models from general computer vision tasks is inadequate for such specific applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in ICBIR 2024</p></details> |
| **[Scalable Training of Graph Foundation Models for Atomistic Materials Modeling: A Case Study with HydraGNN](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12909v2)** | 2024-06-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present our work on developing and training scalable graph foundation models (GFM) using HydraGNN, a multi-headed graph convolutional neural network architecture. HydraGNN expands the boundaries of graph neural network (GNN) in both training scale and data diversity. It abstracts over message passing algorithms, allowing both reproduction of and comparison across algorithmic innovations that define convolution in GNNs. This work discusses a series of optimizations that have allowed scaling up the GFM training to tens of thousands of GPUs on datasets that consist of hundreds of millions of graphs. Our GFMs use multi-task learning (MTL) to simultaneously learn graph-level and node-level properties of atomistic structures, such as the total energy and atomic forces. Using over 150 million atomistic structures for training, we illustrate the performance of our approach along with the lessons learned on two United States Department of Energy (US-DOE) supercomputers, namely the Perlmutter petascale system at the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center and the Frontier exascale system at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. The HydraGNN architecture enables the GFM to achieve near-linear strong scaling performance using more than 2,000 GPUs on Perlmutter and 16,000 GPUs on Frontier. Hyperparameter optimization (HPO) was performed on over 64,000 GPUs on Frontier to select GFM architectures with high accuracy. Early stopping was applied on each GFM architecture for energy awareness in performing such an extreme-scale task. The training of an ensemble of highest-ranked GFM architectures continued until convergence to establish uncertainty quantification (UQ) capabilities with ensemble learning. Our contribution opens the door for rapidly developing, training, and deploying GFMs using large-scale computational resources to enable AI-accelerated materials discovery and design.</p></details> | 16 pages, 13 figures |
| **[Single Parent Family: A Spectrum of Family Members from a Single Pre-Trained Foundation Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19995v1)** | 2024-06-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces a novel method of Progressive Low Rank Decomposition (PLRD) tailored for the compression of large language models. Our approach leverages a pre-trained model, which is then incrementally decompressed to smaller sizes using progressively lower ranks. This method allows for significant reductions in computational overhead and energy consumption, as subsequent models are derived from the original without the need for retraining from scratch. We detail the implementation of PLRD, which strategically decreases the tensor ranks, thus optimizing the trade-off between model performance and resource usage. The efficacy of PLRD is demonstrated through extensive experiments showing that models trained with PLRD method on only 1B tokens maintain comparable performance with traditionally trained models while using 0.1% of the tokens. The versatility of PLRD is highlighted by its ability to generate multiple model sizes from a single foundational model, adapting fluidly to varying computational and memory budgets. Our findings suggest that PLRD could set a new standard for the efficient scaling of LLMs, making advanced AI more feasible on diverse platforms.</p></details> |  |
