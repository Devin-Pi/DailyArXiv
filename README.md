| **[GeoRSMLLM: A Multimodal Large Language Model for Vision-Language Tasks in Geoscience and Remote Sensing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12490v1)** | 2025-03-16 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2503.12490v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The application of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in remote sensing (RS) has demonstrated significant potential in traditional tasks such as scene classification, object detection, and image captioning. However, current models, which excel in Referring Expression Comprehension (REC), struggle with tasks involving complex instructions (e.g., exists multiple conditions) or pixel-level operations like segmentation and change detection. In this white paper, we provide a comprehensive hierarchical summary of vision-language tasks in RS, categorized by the varying levels of cognitive capability required. We introduce the Remote Sensing Vision-Language Task Set (RSVLTS), which includes Open-Vocabulary Tasks (OVT), Referring Expression Tasks (RET), and Described Object Tasks (DOT) with increased difficulty, and Visual Question Answering (VQA) aloneside. Moreover, we propose a novel unified data representation using a set-of-points approach for RSVLTS, along with a condition parser and a self-augmentation strategy based on cyclic referring. These features are integrated into the GeoRSMLLM model, and this enhanced model is designed to handle a broad range of tasks of RSVLTS, paving the way for a more generalized solution for vision-language tasks in geoscience and remote sensing.</p></details> |  |

This success has led to the development of geoscience foundation models (FMs), which promise to accomplish multiple tasks within a workflow or replace the workflow altogether. However, lack of robust evaluation frameworks, even for traditional DLMs, leaves the geoscience community ill prepared for the inevitable adoption of FMs. We address this gap by designing an evaluation framework that jointly incorporates three crucial aspects to current DLMs and future FMs: performance uncertainty, learning efficiency, and overlapping training-test data splits. To target the three aspects, we meticulously construct the training, validation, and test splits using clustering methods tailored to geoscience data and enact an expansive training design to segregate performance uncertainty arising from stochastic training processes and random data sampling. The framework's ability to guard against misleading declarations of model superiority is demonstrated through evaluation of PhaseNet, a popular seismic phase picking DLM, under 3 training approaches. Furthermore, we show how the performance gains due to overlapping training-test data can lead to biased FM evaluation. Our framework helps practitioners choose the best model for their problem and set performance expectations by explicitly analyzing model performance at varying budgets of training data.</p></details> |  |
| **[When Geoscience Meets Foundation Models: Towards General Geoscience Artificial Intelligence System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06799v5)** | 2024-11-12 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2309.06799v5) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Artificial intelligence (AI) has significantly advanced Earth sciences, yet its full potential in to comprehensively modeling Earth's complex dynamics remains unrealized. Geoscience foundation models (GFMs) emerge as a paradigm-shifting solution, integrating extensive cross-disciplinary data to enhance the simulation and understanding of Earth system dynamics. These data-centric AI models extract insights from petabytes of structured and unstructured data, effectively addressing the complexities of Earth systems that traditional models struggle to capture. The unique strengths of GFMs include flexible task specification, diverse input-output capabilities, and multi-modal knowledge representation, enabling analyses that surpass those of individual data sources or traditional AI methods. This review not only highlights the key advantages of GFMs, but also presents essential techniques for their construction, with a focus on transformers, pre-training, and adaptation strategies. Subsequently, we examine recent advancements in GFMs, including large language models, vision models, and vision-language models, particularly emphasizing the potential applications in remote sensing. Additionally, the review concludes with a comprehensive analysis of the challenges and future trends in GFMs, addressing five critical aspects: data integration, model complexity, uncertainty quantification, interdisciplinary collaboration, and concerns related to privacy, trust, and security. This review offers a comprehensive overview of emerging geoscientific research paradigms, emphasizing the untapped opportunities at the intersection of advanced AI techniques and geoscience. It examines major methodologies, showcases advances in large-scale models, and discusses the challenges and prospects that will shape the future landscape of GFMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>accpe...</summary><p>accpeted by IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Magazine</p></details> |

In this work, we discuss a series of developments in the field of prototype-based XAI that show potential for scientific learning tasks, with a focus on the geosciences. We organize the prototype-based XAI literature into three themes: the development and visualization of prototypes, types of prototypes, and the use of prototypes in various learning tasks. We discuss how the authors use prototype-based methods, their novel contributions, and any limitations or challenges that may arise when adapting these methods for geoscientific learning tasks. We highlight differences between geoscientific data sets and the standard benchmarks used to develop XAI methods, and discuss how specific geoscientific applications may benefit from using or modifying existing prototype-based XAI techniques.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at AI for Science Workshop-Oral (Attention Track), Proceedings of 41st International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML) 2024</p></details> |
| **[Interpretable Geoscience Artificial Intelligence (XGeoS-AI): Application to Demystify Image Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04940v2)** | 2024-05-07 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2311.04940v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As Earth science enters the era of big data, artificial intelligence (AI) not only offers great potential for solving geoscience problems, but also plays a critical role in accelerating the understanding of the complex, interactive, and multiscale processes of Earth's behavior. As geoscience AI models are progressively utilized for significant predictions in crucial situations, geoscience researchers are increasingly demanding their interpretability and versatility. This study proposes an interpretable geoscience artificial intelligence (XGeoS-AI) framework to unravel the mystery of image recognition in the Earth sciences, and its effectiveness and versatility is demonstrated by taking computed tomography (CT) image recognition as an example. Inspired by the mechanism of human vision, the proposed XGeoS-AI framework generates a threshold value from a local region within the whole image to complete the recognition. Different kinds of artificial intelligence (AI) methods, such as Support Vector Regression (SVR), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), can be adopted as the AI engines of the proposed XGeoS-AI framework to efficiently complete geoscience image recognition tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that the effectiveness, versatility, and heuristics of the proposed framework have great potential in solving geoscience image recognition problems. Interpretable AI should receive more and more attention in the field of the Earth sciences, which is the key to promoting more rational and wider applications of AI in the field of Earth sciences. In addition, the proposed interpretable framework may be the forerunner of technological innovation in the Earth sciences.</p></details> | <details><summary>there...</summary><p>there are some erros in the results, and a newer revision is still preparing</p></details> |
| **[GeoGalactica: A Scientific Large Language Model in Geoscience](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00434v2)** | 2024-04-13 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2401.00434v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have achieved huge success for their general knowledge and ability to solve a wide spectrum of tasks in natural language processing (NLP). Due to their impressive abilities, LLMs have shed light on potential inter-discipline applications to foster scientific discoveries of a specific domain by using artificial intelligence (AI for science, AI4S). In the meantime, utilizing NLP techniques in geoscience research and practice is wide and convoluted, contributing from knowledge extraction and document classification to question answering and knowledge discovery. In this work, we take the initial step to leverage LLM for science, through a rather straightforward approach. We try to specialize an LLM into geoscience, by further pre-training the model with a vast amount of texts in geoscience, as well as supervised fine-tuning (SFT) the resulting model with our custom collected instruction tuning dataset. These efforts result in a model GeoGalactica consisting of 30 billion parameters. To our best knowledge, it is the largest language model for the geoscience domain. More specifically, GeoGalactica is from further pre-training of Galactica. We train GeoGalactica over a geoscience-related text corpus containing 65 billion tokens, preserving as the largest geoscience-specific text corpus. Then we fine-tune the model with 1 million pairs of instruction-tuning data consisting of questions that demand professional geoscience knowledge to answer. In this technical report, we will illustrate in detail all aspects of GeoGalactica, including data collection, data cleaning, base model selection, pre-training, SFT, and evaluation. We open-source our data curation tools and the checkpoints of GeoGalactica during the first 3/4 of pre-training.</p></details> |  |
| **[A novel approach for estimating functions in the multivariate setting based on an adaptive knot selection for B-splines with an application to a chemical system used in geoscience](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00686v3)** | 2024-01-25 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2306.00686v3) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we will outline a novel data-driven method for estimating functions in a multivariate nonparametric regression model based on an adaptive knot selection for B-splines. The underlying idea of our approach for selecting knots is to apply the generalized lasso, since the knots of the B-spline basis can be seen as changes in the derivatives of the function to be estimated. This method was then extended to functions depending on several variables by processing each dimension independently, thus reducing the problem to a univariate setting. The regularization parameters were chosen by means of a criterion based on EBIC. The nonparametric estimator was obtained using a multivariate B-spline regression with the corresponding selected knots. Our procedure was validated through numerical experiments by varying the number of observations and the level of noise to investigate its robustness. The influence of observation sampling was also assessed and our method was applied to a chemical system commonly used in geoscience. For each different framework considered in this paper, our approach performed better than state-of-the-art methods. Our completely data-driven method is implemented in the glober R package which is available on the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN).</p></details> | 29 pages, 27 figures |
| **[When Geoscience Meets Generative AI and Large Language Models: Foundations, Trends, and Future Challenges](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03349v1)** | 2024-01-25 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2402.03349v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) represents an emerging field that promises the creation of synthetic data and outputs in different modalities. GAI has recently shown impressive results across a large spectrum of applications ranging from biology, medicine, education, legislation, computer science, and finance. As one strives for enhanced safety, efficiency, and sustainability, generative AI indeed emerges as a key differentiator and promises a paradigm shift in the field. This paper explores the potential applications of generative AI and large language models in geoscience. The recent developments in the field of machine learning and deep learning have enabled the generative model's utility for tackling diverse prediction problems, simulation, and multi-criteria decision-making challenges related to geoscience and Earth system dynamics. This survey discusses several GAI models that have been used in geoscience comprising generative adversarial networks (GANs), physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), and generative pre-trained transformer (GPT)-based structures. These tools have helped the geoscience community in several applications, including (but not limited to) data generation/augmentation, super-resolution, panchromatic sharpening, haze removal, restoration, and land surface changing. Some challenges still remain such as ensuring physical interpretation, nefarious use cases, and trustworthiness. Beyond that, GAI models show promises to the geoscience community, especially with the support to climate change, urban science, atmospheric science, marine science, and planetary science through their extraordinary ability to data-driven modeling and uncertainty quantification.</p></details> |  |
| **[Differentiable modeling to unify machine learning and physical models and advance Geosciences](http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.04027v2)** | 2023-12-27 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2301.04027v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Process-Based Modeling (PBM) and Machine Learning (ML) are often perceived as distinct paradigms in the geosciences. Here we present differentiable geoscientific modeling as a powerful pathway toward dissolving the perceived barrier between them and ushering in a paradigm shift. For decades, PBM offered benefits in interpretability and physical consistency but struggled to efficiently leverage large datasets. ML methods, especially deep networks, presented strong predictive skills yet lacked the ability to answer specific scientific questions. While various methods have been proposed for ML-physics integration, an important underlying theme -- differentiable modeling -- is not sufficiently recognized. Here we outline the concepts, applicability, and significance of differentiable geoscientific modeling (DG). "Differentiable" refers to accurately and efficiently calculating gradients with respect to model variables, critically enabling the learning of high-dimensional unknown relationships. DG refers to a range of methods connecting varying amounts of prior knowledge to neural networks and training them together, capturing a different scope than physics-guided machine learning and emphasizing first principles. Preliminary evidence suggests DG offers better interpretability and causality than ML, improved generalizability and extrapolation capability, and strong potential for knowledge discovery, while approaching the performance of purely data-driven ML. DG models require less training data while scaling favorably in performance and efficiency with increasing amounts of data. With DG, geoscientists may be better able to frame and investigate questions, test hypotheses, and discover unrecognized linkages.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we bring LLMs to the realm of geoscience with the objective of advancing research and applications in this field. To this end, we present the first-ever LLM in geoscience, K2, alongside a suite of resources developed to further promote LLM research within geoscience. For instance, we have curated the first geoscience instruction tuning dataset, GeoSignal, which aims to align LLM responses to geoscience-related user queries. Additionally, we have established the first geoscience benchmark, GeoBench, to evaluate LLMs in the context of geoscience. In this work, we experiment with a complete recipe to adapt a pre-trained general-domain LLM to the geoscience domain. Specifically, we further train the LLaMA-7B model on 5.5B tokens of geoscience text corpus, including over 1 million pieces of geoscience literature, and utilize GeoSignal's supervised data to fine-tune the model. Moreover, we share a protocol that can efficiently gather domain-specific data and construct domain-supervised data, even in situations where manpower is scarce. Meanwhile, we equip K2 with the abilities of using tools to be a naive geoscience aide. Experiments conducted on the GeoBench demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and datasets on geoscience knowledge understanding and utilization.We open-source all the training data and K2 model checkpoints at https://github.com/davendw49/k2.</p></details> |  |
| **[AI Security for Geoscience and Remote Sensing: Challenges and Future Trends](http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.09360v2)** | 2023-06-22 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2212.09360v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have significantly intensified research in the geoscience and remote sensing (RS) field. AI algorithms, especially deep learning-based ones, have been developed and applied widely to RS data analysis. The successful application of AI covers almost all aspects of Earth observation (EO) missions, from low-level vision tasks like super-resolution, denoising and inpainting, to high-level vision tasks like scene classification, object detection and semantic segmentation. While AI techniques enable researchers to observe and understand the Earth more accurately, the vulnerability and uncertainty of AI models deserve further attention, considering that many geoscience and RS tasks are highly safety-critical. This paper reviews the current development of AI security in the geoscience and RS field, covering the following five important aspects: adversarial attack, backdoor attack, federated learning, uncertainty and explainability. Moreover, the potential opportunities and trends are discussed to provide insights for future research. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this paper is the first attempt to provide a systematic review of AI security-related research in the geoscience and RS community. Available code and datasets are also listed in the paper to move this vibrant field of research forward.</p></details> |  |
| **[Coarse-to-fine Task-driven Inpainting for Geoscience Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.11059v3)** | 2022-12-06 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2211.11059v3) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The processing and recognition of geoscience images have wide applications. Most of existing researches focus on understanding the high-quality geoscience images by assuming that all the images are clear. However, in many real-world cases, the geoscience images might contain occlusions during the image acquisition. This problem actually implies the image inpainting problem in computer vision and multimedia. To the best of our knowledge, all the existing image inpainting algorithms learn to repair the occluded regions for a better visualization quality, they are excellent for natural images but not good enough for geoscience images by ignoring the geoscience related tasks. This paper aims to repair the occluded regions for a better geoscience task performance with the advanced visualization quality simultaneously, without changing the current deployed deep learning based geoscience models. Because of the complex context of geoscience images, we propose a coarse-to-fine encoder-decoder network with coarse-to-fine adversarial context discriminators to reconstruct the occluded image regions. Due to the limited data of geoscience images, we use a MaskMix based data augmentation method to exploit more information from limited geoscience image data. The experimental results on three public geoscience datasets for remote sensing scene recognition, cross-view geolocation and semantic segmentation tasks respectively show the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Investigating the fidelity of explainable artificial intelligence methods for applications of convolutional neural networks in geoscience](http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.03407v2)** | 2022-09-05 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2202.03407v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have recently attracted great attention in geoscience due to their ability to capture non-linear system behavior and extract predictive spatiotemporal patterns. Given their black-box nature however, and the importance of prediction explainability, methods of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) are gaining popularity as a means to explain the CNN decision-making strategy. Here, we establish an intercomparison of some of the most popular XAI methods and investigate their fidelity in explaining CNN decisions for geoscientific applications. Our goal is to raise awareness of the theoretical limitations of these methods and gain insight into the relative strengths and weaknesses to help guide best practices. The considered XAI methods are first applied to an idealized attribution benchmark, where the ground truth of explanation of the network is known a priori, to help objectively assess their performance. Secondly, we apply XAI to a climate-related prediction setting, namely to explain a CNN that is trained to predict the number of atmospheric rivers in daily snapshots of climate simulations. Our results highlight several important issues of XAI methods (e.g., gradient shattering, inability to distinguish the sign of attribution, ignorance to zero input) that have previously been overlooked in our field and, if not considered cautiously, may lead to a distorted picture of the CNN decision-making strategy. We envision that our analysis will motivate further investigation into XAI fidelity and will help towards a cautious implementation of XAI in geoscience, which can lead to further exploitation of CNNs and deep learning for prediction problems.</p></details> |  |

However, the predominant reliance on visual encoding of data continues to create accessibility barriers for people who are blind/vision impaired resulting in their under representation in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) disciplines. This research study seeks to understand the experiences of professionals who are blind/vision impaired in one such STEM discipline (geosciences) in accessing data visualizations. In-depth, semi-structured interviews with seven professionals were conducted to examine the accessibility barriers and areas for improvement to inform accessibility research pertaining to data visualizations through a socio-technical lens. A reflexive thematic analysis revealed the negative impact of visualizations in influencing their career path, lack of data exploration tools for research, barriers in accessing works of peers and mismatched pace of visualization and accessibility research. The article also includes recommendations from the participants to address some of these accessibility barriers.</p></details> |  |

Many different methods have been introduced in the emerging field of eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), which aim at attributing the network s prediction to specific features in the input domain. XAI methods are usually assessed by using benchmark datasets (like MNIST or ImageNet for image classification). However, an objective, theoretically derived ground truth for the attribution is lacking for most of these datasets, making the assessment of XAI in many cases subjective. Also, benchmark datasets specifically designed for problems in geosciences are rare. Here, we provide a framework, based on the use of additively separable functions, to generate attribution benchmark datasets for regression problems for which the ground truth of the attribution is known a priori. We generate a large benchmark dataset and train a fully connected network to learn the underlying function that was used for simulation. We then compare estimated heatmaps from different XAI methods to the ground truth in order to identify examples where specific XAI methods perform well or poorly. We believe that attribution benchmarks as the ones introduced herein are of great importance for further application of neural networks in the geosciences, and for more objective assessment and accurate implementation of XAI methods, which will increase model trust and assist in discovering new science.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is an updated preprint version of the manuscript.

Quantifying complexity and non-stationarity of these data is a challenging task, and advanced complexity-based exploratory tool are required for understanding and visualizing such data.

The state-of-the-art studies related to the Fisher-Shannon measures are collected, and new analytical formulas for positive unimodal skewed distributions are proposed. Case studies on both synthetic and real data illustrate the usefulness of the Fisher-Shannon method, which can find application in different domains including time series discrimination and generation of times series features for clustering, modeling and forecasting. The paper is accompanied with Python and R libraries for the non-parametric estimation of the proposed measures.</p></details> | 18 pages, 5 figures |

In remote sensing and geosciences this is of special relevance to better understand the Earth's system and the complex interactions between the governing processes. In this paper, we focus on observational causal inference, thus we try to estimate the correct direction of causation using a finite set of empirical data. In addition, we focus on the more complex bivariate scenario that requires strong assumptions and no conditional independence tests can be used. In particular, we explore the framework of (non-deterministic) additive noise models, which relies on the principle of independence between the cause and the generating mechanism. A practical algorithmic instantiation of such principle only requires 1) two regression models in the forward and backward directions, and 2) the estimation of {\em statistical independence} between the obtained residuals and the observations. The direction leading to more independent residuals is decided to be the cause. We instead propose a criterion that uses the {\em sensitivity} (derivative) of the dependence estimator, the sensitivity criterion allows to identify samples most affecting the dependence measure, and hence the criterion is robust to spurious detections. We illustrate performance in a collection of 28 geoscience causal inference problems, in a database of radiative transfer models simulations and machine learning emulators in vegetation parameter modeling involving 182 problems, and in assessing the impact of different regression models in a carbon cycle problem. The criterion achieves state-of-the-art detection rates in all cases, it is generally robust to noise sources and distortions.</p></details> |  |

A thorough analysis of the co-developments of machine learning applications throughout the last 70 years relates the recent enthusiasm for machine learning to developments in geoscience. I explore the shift of kriging towards a mainstream machine learning method and the historic application of neural networks in geoscience, following the general trend of machine learning enthusiasm through the decades. Furthermore, this chapter explores the shift from mathematical fundamentals and knowledge in software development towards skills in model validation, applied statistics, and integrated subject matter expertise. The review is interspersed with code examples to complement the theoretical foundations and illustrate model validation and machine learning explainability for science. The scope of this review includes various shallow machine learning methods, e.g. Decision Trees, Random Forests, Support-Vector Machines, and Gaussian Processes, as well as, deep neural networks, including feed-forward neural networks, convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks and generative adversarial networks. Regarding geoscience, the review has a bias towards geophysics but aims to strike a balance with geochemistry, geostatistics, and geology, however excludes remote sensing, as this would exceed the scope.

As such, neural networks have often been used within the geosciences to most accurately identify a desired output given a set of inputs, with the interpretation of what the network learns used as a secondary metric to ensure the network is making the right decision for the right reason. Neural network interpretation techniques have become more advanced in recent years, however, and we therefore propose that the ultimate objective of using a neural network can also be the interpretation of what the network has learned rather than the output itself. We show that the interpretation of neural networks can enable the discovery of scientifically meaningful connections within geoscientific data. In particular, we use two methods for neural network interpretation called backwards optimization and layerwise relevance propagation, both of which project the decision pathways of a network back onto the original input dimensions. To the best of our knowledge, LRP has not yet been applied to geoscientific research, and we believe it has great potential in this area. We show how these interpretation techniques can be used to reliably infer scientifically meaningful information from neural networks by applying them to common climate patterns. These results suggest that combining interpretable neural networks with novel scientific hypotheses will open the door to many new avenues in neural network-related geoscience research.</p></details> | <details><summary>The s...</summary><p>The second version of this manuscript is currently under review at the Journal of Advances in Modeling Earth Systems (JAMES)</p></details> |

Such extreme quantities of generated and modeled data greatly impact computational performances on many levels of high-performance computing (HPC): storage media, memory requirements, transfer capability, and finally simulation interactivity, necessary to exploit this instance of big data. Efficient representations and storage are thus becoming "enabling technologies'' in HPC experimental and simulation science. We propose HexaShrink, an original decomposition scheme for structured hexahedral volume meshes. The latter are used for instance in biomedical engineering, materials science, or geosciences. HexaShrink provides a comprehensive framework allowing efficient mesh visualization and storage. Its exactly reversible multiresolution decomposition yields a hierarchy of meshes of increasing levels of details, in terms of either geometry, continuous or categorical properties of cells. Starting with an overview of volume meshes compression techniques, our contribution blends coherently different multiresolution wavelet schemes in different dimensions. It results in a global framework preserving discontinuities (faults) across scales, implemented as a fully reversible upscaling at different resolutions. Experimental results are provided on meshes of varying size and complexity. They emphasize the consistency of the proposed representation, in terms of visualization, attribute downsampling and distribution at different resolutions. Finally, HexaShrink yields gains in storage space when combined to lossless compression techniques.</p></details> |  |

They have been applied in numerous science areas, but their application to the geosciences has been limited due to their inefficiency in high-dimensional systems in standard settings. However, huge progress has been made, and this limitation is disappearing fast due to recent developments in proposal densities, the use of ideas from (optimal) transportation, the use of localisation and intelligent adaptive resampling strategies. Furthermore, powerful hybrids between particle filters and ensemble Kalman filters and variational methods have been developed. We present a state of the art discussion of present efforts of developing particle filters for highly nonlinear geoscience state-estimation problems with an emphasis on atmospheric and oceanic applications, including many new ideas, derivations, and unifications, highlighting hidden connections, and generating a valuable tool and guide for the community. Initial experiments show that particle filters can be competitive with present-day methods for numerical weather prediction suggesting that they will become mainstream soon.</p></details> | <details><summary>Revie...</summary><p>Review paper, 36 pages, 9 figures, Resubmitted to Q.J.Royal Meteorol.

A rigorous statistical analysis of such observations is tricky, though. Observables can span several orders of magnitude, but the range for which the power law may be valid is typically truncated, usually because the smallest events are too tiny to be detected and the largest ones are limited by the system size. We revisit several examples of proposed power-law distributions dealing with potentially damaging natural phenomena. Adequate fits of the distributions of sizes are especially important in these cases, given that they may be used to assess long-term hazard. After reviewing the theoretical background for power-law distributions, we improve an objective statistical fitting method and apply it to diverse data sets. The method is described in full detail and it is easy to implement. Our analysis elucidates the range of validity of the power-law fit and the corresponding exponent, and whether a power-law tail is improved by a truncated log-normal. We confirm that impact fireballs and Californian earthquakes show untruncated power-law behavior, whereas global earthquakes follow a double power law. Rain precipitation over space and time and tropical cyclones show a truncated power-law regime. Karst sinkholes and wildfires, in contrast, are better described by truncated log-normals, although wildfires also may show power-law regimes. Our conclusions only apply to the analyzed data sets, but show the potential of applying this robust statistical technique in the future.</p></details> |  |

This term encompasses the entire sequence of operations that, starting from the observations of a system, and from additional statistical and dynamical information (such as a dynamical evolution model), provides an estimate of its state. Data assimilation is standard practice in numerical weather prediction, but its application is becoming widespread in many other areas of climate, atmosphere, ocean and environment modeling; in all circumstances where one intends to estimate the state of a large dynamical system based on limited information. While the complexity of data assimilation, and of the methods thereof, stands on its interdisciplinary nature across statistics, dynamical systems and numerical optimization, when applied to geosciences an additional difficulty arises by the continually increasing sophistication of the environmental models. Thus, in spite of data assimilation being nowadays ubiquitous in geosciences, it has so far remained a topic mostly reserved to experts. We aim this overview article at geoscientists with a background in mathematical and physical modeling, who are interested in the rapid development of data assimilation and its growing domains of application in environmental science, but so far have not delved into its conceptual and methodological complexities.</p></details> | <details><summary>79 pa...</summary><p>79 pages, 10 figures, Invited review</p></details> |

This article introduces researchers in the machine learning (ML) community to these challenges offered by geoscience problems and the opportunities that exist for advancing both machine learning and geosciences. We first highlight typical sources of geoscience data and describe their properties that make it challenging to use traditional machine learning techniques. We then describe some of the common categories of geoscience problems where machine learning can play a role, and discuss some of the existing efforts and promising directions for methodological development in machine learning. We conclude by discussing some of the emerging research themes in machine learning that are applicable across all problems in the geosciences, and the importance of a deep collaboration between machine learning and geosciences for synergistic advancements in both disciplines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review at IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering</p></details> |

This issue can significantly disrupt systems that rely on the data. Spatial and temporal dependencies can be leveraged to impute the missing samples. Existing imputation methods often ignore dynamic changes in spatial dependencies. We propose a Spatial Dynamic Aware Graph Recurrent Imputation Network (SDA-GRIN) which is capable of capturing dynamic changes in spatial dependencies.SDA-GRIN leverages a multi-head attention mechanism to adapt graph structures with time. SDA-GRIN models multivariate time series as a sequence of temporal graphs and uses a recurrent message-passing architecture for imputation. We evaluate SDA-GRIN on four real-world datasets: SDA-GRIN improves MSE by 9.51% for the AQI and 9.40% for AQI-36. On the PEMS-BAY dataset, it achieves a 1.94% improvement in MSE. Detailed ablation study demonstrates the effect of window sizes and missing data on the performance of the method. Project page:https://ameskandari.github.io/sda-grin/</p></details> |  |

Both tasks are solved by a two-step hierarchical algorithm. The first step differs for the two tasks generating either a piecewise-affine or a Dubins reference path. The second step leverages a transformation of vehicle dynamics from the time domain into the spatial domain and linear programming. Benefits such as a hyperparameter-free objective function and spatial constraints useful for area coverage gaps avoidance and precision path planning are discussed. The method, which is a deterministic optimisation-based method, is evaluated on 5 real-world fields solving 19 instances of the first task and 84 instances of the second task.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 12 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

However, base models face limitations, as they only contain the knowledge available at the time of training, and updating them is both time-consuming and costly. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged in the literature as the preferred approach for injecting contextual information into Foundation Models. It prevails over techniques such as fine-tuning, which are less effective in dynamic, real-time scenarios like those found in urban environments. However, traditional RAG architectures, based on semantic databases, knowledge graphs, structured data, or AI-powered web searches, do not fully meet the demands of urban contexts. Urban environments are complex systems characterized by large volumes of interconnected data, frequent updates, real-time processing requirements, security needs, and strong links to the physical world. This work proposes a real-time spatial RAG architecture that defines the necessary components for the effective integration of generative AI into cities, leveraging temporal and spatial filtering capabilities through linked data. The proposed architecture is implemented using FIWARE, an ecosystem of software components to develop smart city solutions and digital twins. The design and implementation are demonstrated through the use case of a tourism assistant in the city of Madrid. The use case serves to validate the correct integration of Foundation Models through the proposed RAG architecture.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unaligned RGB Guided Hyperspectral Image Super-Resolution with Spatial-Spectral Concordance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02109v1)** | 2025-05-04 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2505.02109v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hyperspectral images super-resolution aims to improve the spatial resolution, yet its performance is often limited at high-resolution ratios. The recent adoption of high-resolution reference images for super-resolution is driven by the poor spatial detail found in low-resolution HSIs, presenting it as a favorable method. However, these approaches cannot effectively utilize information from the reference image, due to the inaccuracy of alignment and its inadequate interaction between alignment and fusion modules. In this paper, we introduce a Spatial-Spectral Concordance Hyperspectral Super-Resolution (SSC-HSR) framework for unaligned reference RGB guided HSI SR to address the issues of inaccurate alignment and poor interactivity of the previous approaches. Specifically, to ensure spatial concordance, i.e., align images more accurately across resolutions and refine textures, we construct a Two-Stage Image Alignment with a synthetic generation pipeline in the image alignment module, where the fine-tuned optical flow model can produce a more accurate optical flow in the first stage and warp model can refine damaged textures in the second stage. To enhance the interaction between alignment and fusion modules and ensure spectral concordance during reconstruction, we propose a Feature Aggregation module and an Attention Fusion module. In the feature aggregation module, we introduce an Iterative Deformable Feature Aggregation block to achieve significant feature matching and texture aggregation with the fusion multi-scale results guidance, iteratively generating learnable offset. Besides, we introduce two basic spectral-wise attention blocks in the attention fusion module to model the inter-spectra interactions. Extensive experiments on three natural or remote-sensing datasets show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on both quantitative and qualitative evaluations.</p></details> |  |

While there are nonparametric methods for process monitoring with such spatial data to detect changes in the mean, there is a gap in the literature for nonparametric control charting methods developed to monitor spatial dependence. This study considers streams of regular, rectangular data sets using spatial ordinal patterns (SOPs) as a nonparametric method to detect spatial dependencies. We propose novel SOP control charts, which are distribution-free and do not require prior Phase-I analysis. To uncover higher-order dependencies, we develop a new class of statistics that combines SOPs with the Box-Pierce approach. An extensive simulation study demonstrates the superiority and effectiveness of our proposed charts over traditional parametric approaches, particularly when the spatial dependence is nonlinear or bilateral or when the spatial data contains outliers. The proposed SOP control charts are illustrated using real-world datasets to detect (i) heavy rainfall in Germany, (ii) war-related fires in (eastern) Ukraine, and (iii) manufacturing defects in textile production. This wide range of applications and findings demonstrates the broad utility of the proposed nonparametric control charts. In addition, all methods in this study are provided as a publicly available \texttt{Julia} package on \href{https://github.com/AdaemmerP/OrdinalPatterns.jl}{GitHub} for further implementations.</p></details> | <details><summary>38 pa...</summary><p>38 pages, 9 figures, 19 tables</p></details> |
| **[Evaluation of Thermal Control Based on Spatial Thermal Comfort with Reconstructed Environmental Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00468v2)** | 2025-05-04 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2505.00468v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Achieving thermal comfort while maintaining energy efficiency is a critical objective in building system control. Conventional thermal comfort models, such as the Predicted Mean Vote (PMV), rely on both environmental and personal variables. However, the use of fixed-location sensors limits the ability to capture spatial variability, which reduces the accuracy of occupant-specific comfort estimation. To address this limitation, this study proposes a new PMV estimation method that incorporates spatial environmental data reconstructed using the Gappy Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (Gappy POD) algorithm. In addition, a group PMV-based control framework is developed to account for the thermal comfort of multiple occupants. The Gappy POD method enables fast and accurate reconstruction of indoor temperature fields from sparse sensor measurements. Using these reconstructed fields and occupant location data, spatially resolved PMV values are calculated. Group-level thermal conditions are then derived through statistical aggregation methods and used to control indoor temperature in a multi-occupant living lab environment. Experimental results show that the Gappy POD algorithm achieves an average relative error below 3\% in temperature reconstruction. PMV distributions varied by up to 1.26 scale units depending on occupant location. Moreover, thermal satisfaction outcomes varied depending on the group PMV method employed. These findings underscore the importance for adaptive thermal control strategies that incorporate both spatial and individual variability, offering valuable insights for future occupant-centric building operations.</p></details> |  |

However, because these models typically operate in continuous intensity spaces - diffusing independently per pixel and color channel - they are fundamentally ill-suited for applications where quantities such as particle counts or material units are inherently discrete and governed by strict conservation laws such as mass preservation, limiting their applicability in scientific workflows. To address this limitation, we propose Discrete Spatial Diffusion (DSD), a framework based on a continuous-time, discrete-state jump stochastic process that operates directly in discrete spatial domains while strictly preserving mass in both forward and reverse diffusion processes. By using spatial diffusion to achieve mass preservation, we introduce stochasticity naturally through a discrete formulation. We demonstrate the expressive flexibility of DSD by performing image synthesis, class conditioning, and image inpainting across widely-used image benchmarks, with the ability to condition on image intensity. Additionally, we highlight its applicability to domain-specific scientific data for materials microstructure, bridging the gap between diffusion models and mass-conditioned scientific applications.</p></details> |  |

However, existing 2D editing-based methods often rely on spatial priors such as 2D masks or 3D bounding boxes, and they struggle to ensure consistency of the inserted object. These limitations hinder flexibility and scalability in real-world applications. In this paper, we propose FreeInsert, a novel framework that leverages foundation models including MLLMs, LGMs, and diffusion models to disentangle object generation from spatial placement. This enables unsupervised and flexible object insertion in 3D scenes without spatial priors. FreeInsert starts with an MLLM-based parser that extracts structured semantics, including object types, spatial relationships, and attachment regions, from user instructions. These semantics guide both the reconstruction of the inserted object for 3D consistency and the learning of its degrees of freedom. We leverage the spatial reasoning capabilities of MLLMs to initialize object pose and scale. A hierarchical, spatially aware refinement stage further integrates spatial semantics and MLLM-inferred priors to enhance placement. Finally, the appearance of the object is improved using the inserted-object image to enhance visual fidelity. Experimental results demonstrate that FreeInsert achieves semantically coherent, spatially precise, and visually realistic 3D insertions without relying on spatial priors, offering a user-friendly and flexible editing experience.</p></details> |  |

The low rank component coefficients are endowed with a flexible graphical Gaussian Markov random field model. The utilization of a low rank and compactly-supported covariance structure combines the full-scale approximation and the basis graphical lasso; we term this new approach the full-scale basis graphical lasso (FSBGL). Estimation employs a graphical lasso-penalized likelihood, which is optimized using a difference-of-convex scheme. We illustrate the proposed approach with a challenging high-resolution simulation dataset of the thermosphere. In a comparison against state-of-the-art spatial models, the FSBGL performs better at capturing salient features of the thermospheric temperature fields, even with limited available training data.</p></details> | 37 pages, 6 figures |

In fission-fusion dynamics, where group members come together and split from others often, sharing complementary information about uniquely known foraging areas could allow a group to track a heterogenous foraging environment better than any group member on its own. We analyse the partial overlaps between individual core ranges, which we assume represent the knowledge of an individual during a given season. We identify sets of individuals whose overlap shows a balance between redundantly and uniquely known portions and we use simplicial complexes to represent these higher-order interactions. The structure of the simplicial complexes shows holes in various dimensions, revealing complementarity in the foraging information that is being shared. We propose that the complex spatial networks arising from fission-fusion dynamics allow for adaptive, collective processing of foraging information in dynamic environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 6 figures plus supplementary information with 12 pages, methods, model and 4 figures of results</p></details> |

However, Transformer-based methods either ignore the spatial neighborhood relationships between the joints when used for skeleton representations or disregard the local temporal patterns of the local joint movements in skeleton sequence modeling, while GCN-based methods often neglect the need for pose-specific representations. To address these problems, we propose a new method that exploits the graph modeling capability of GCN to represent each skeleton with multiple graphs of different orders, incorporated with a newly introduced Graph Order Attention module that dynamically emphasizes the most representative orders for each joint. The resulting spatial features of the sequence are further processed using a proposed temporal Body Aware Transformer that models the global body feature dependencies in the sequence with awareness of the local inter-skeleton feature dependencies of joints. Given that our 3D pose output aligns with the central 2D pose in the sequence, we improve the self-attention mechanism to be aware of the central pose while diminishing its focus gradually towards the first and the last poses. Extensive experiments on Human3.6m, MPIINF-3DHP, and HumanEva-I datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

However, the commonly used quasi-maximum likelihood estimation (QMLE) for the SAR model is not computationally scalable to handle the data with a large size. In addition, when establishing the asymptotic properties of the parameter estimators of the SAR model, both weights matrix and regressors are assumed to be nonstochastic in classical spatial econometrics, which is perhaps not realistic in real applications. Motivated by the machine learning literature, this paper proposes quasi-score matching estimation for the SAR model. This new estimation approach is developed based on the likelihood, but significantly reduces the computational complexity of the QMLE. The asymptotic properties of parameter estimators under the random weights matrix and regressors are established, which provides a new theoretical framework for the asymptotic inference of the SAR-type models. The usefulness of the quasi-score matching estimation and its asymptotic inference is illustrated via extensive simulation studies and a case study of an anti-conflict social network experiment for middle school students.</p></details> | 35 pages |

Current large multimodal models (LMMs), however, lack of this capability of 3D spatial reasoning. This limitation stems from the scarcity of 3D training data and the bias in current model designs toward 2D data. In this paper, we systematically study the impact of 3D-informed data, architecture, and training setups, introducing SpatialLLM, a large multi-modal model with advanced 3D spatial reasoning abilities. To address data limitations, we develop two types of 3D-informed training datasets: (1) 3D-informed probing data focused on object's 3D location and orientation, and (2) 3D-informed conversation data for complex spatial relationships. Notably, we are the first to curate VQA data that incorporate 3D orientation relationships on real images. Furthermore, we systematically integrate these two types of training data with the architectural and training designs of LMMs, providing a roadmap for optimal design aimed at achieving superior 3D reasoning capabilities. Our SpatialLLM advances machines toward highly capable 3D-informed reasoning, surpassing GPT-4o performance by 8.7%. Our systematic empirical design and the resulting findings offer valuable insights for future research in this direction.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025 highlight, camera ready version</p></details> |

A key objective in spatial analysis is to model spatial relationships and infer spatial processes to generate knowledge from spatial data, which has been largely based on spatial statistical methods. More recently, machine learning offers scalable and flexible approaches that complement traditional methods and has been increasingly applied in spatial data science. Despite its advantages, machine learning is often criticized for being a black box, which limits our understanding of model behavior and output. Recognizing this limitation, XAI has emerged as a pivotal field in AI that provides methods to explain the output of machine learning models to enhance transparency and understanding. These methods are crucial for model diagnosis, bias detection, and ensuring the reliability of results obtained from machine learning models. This chapter introduces key concepts and methods in XAI with a focus on Shapley value-based approaches, which is arguably the most popular XAI method, and their integration with spatial analysis. An empirical example of county-level voting behaviors in the 2020 Presidential election is presented to demonstrate the use of Shapley values and spatial analysis with a comparison to multi-scale geographically weighted regression. The chapter concludes with a discussion on the challenges and limitations of current XAI techniques and proposes new directions.</p></details> |  |

The outputs of such systems vary not only with physical parameters but also with external time-varying input signals. Accurately catching the dynamics of such systems is challenging. We have adapted and extended an existing transformer model for single output prediction to a multiple-output transformer that is able to predict multiple output responses of these systems. The multiple-output transformer generalizes the interpretability of the original transformer. The generalized interpretable attention weight matrix explores not only the temporal correlations in the sequence, but also the interactions between the multiple outputs, providing explanation for the spatial correlation in the output domain. This multiple-output transformer accurately predicts the sequence of multiple outputs, regardless of the nonlinearity of the system and the dimensionality of the parameter space.</p></details> |  |

In many of these cases, the treated and control units correspond to spatial units such as regions or neighborhoods. Our approach addresses the challenge of understanding how an intervention applied at specific locations influences the surrounding area. Traditional synthetic control applications may struggle with defining the effective area of impact, the extent of treatment propagation across space, and the variation of effects with distance from the treatment sites. To address these challenges, we introduce Spatial Vertical Regression (SVR) within the Bayesian paradigm. This innovative approach allows us to accurately predict the outcomes in varying proximities to the treatment sites, while meticulously accounting for the spatial structure inherent in the data. Specifically, rooted on the vertical regression framework of the synthetic control method, SVR employs a Gaussian process to ensure that the imputation of missing potential outcomes for areas of different distance around the treatment sites is spatially coherent, reflecting the expectation that nearby areas experience similar outcomes and have similar relationships to control areas. This approach is particularly pertinent to our study on the Florentine tramway's first line construction. We study its influence on the local commercial landscape, focusing on how business prevalence varies at different distances from the tram stops.</p></details> |  |

This becomes even more critical during anomaly conditions like the epidemic outbreak, during which couriers' delivery timely rate will decline markedly and fluctuates significantly. Existing studies pay less attention to the logistics scenario. Moreover, many works focusing on prediction tasks in anomaly scenarios fail to explicitly model abnormal events, e.g., treating external factors equally with other features, resulting in great information loss. Further, since some anomalous events occur infrequently, traditional data-driven methods perform poorly in these scenarios. To deal with them, we propose a deep spatial-temporal attention model, named DeepSTA. To be specific, to avoid information loss, we design an anomaly spatio-temporal learning module that employs a recurrent neural network to model incident information. Additionally, we utilize Node2vec to model correlations between road districts, and adopt graph neural networks and long short-term memory to capture the spatial-temporal dependencies of couriers. To tackle the issue of insufficient training data in abnormal circumstances, we propose an anomaly pattern attention module that adopts a memory network for couriers' anomaly feature patterns storage via attention mechanisms. The experiments on real-world logistics datasets during the COVID-19 outbreak in 2022 show the model outperforms the best baselines by 12.11% in MAE and 13.71% in MSE, demonstrating its superior performance over multiple competitive baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CIKM 2023</p></details> |

Although approaches have been proposed to support spatial dataset search and data point search, they consider the two types of searches independently. To enable search operations ranging from the coarse-grained dataset level to the fine-grained data point level, we provide an integrated one that supports diverse query types and distance metrics. In this paper, we focus on designing a multi-granularity spatial data search system, called Spadas, that supports both dataset and data point search operations. To address the challenges of the high cost of indexing and susceptibility to outliers, we propose a unified index that can drastically improve query efficiency in various scenarios by organizing data reasonably and removing outliers in datasets. Moreover, to accelerate all data search operations, we propose a set of pruning mechanisms based on the unified index, including fast bound estimation, approximation technique with error bound, and pruning in batch techniques, to effectively filter out non-relevant datasets and points. Finally, we report the results of a detailed experimental evaluation using six spatial data repositories, achieving orders of magnitude faster than the state-of-the-art algorithms and demonstrating the effectiveness by case study. An online spatial data search system of Spadas is also implemented and made accessible to users.</p></details> |  |

These observations are commonly streams of RGB images, whose high dimensionality includes substantial task-irrelevant information, requiring large models to extract relevant patterns. In contrast, using more structured observations, such as the spatial poses (positions and orientations) of key objects over time, enables training more compact policies that can recognize relevant patterns with fewer parameters. However, obtaining accurate object poses in open-set, real-world environments remains challenging. For instance, it is impractical to assume that all relevant objects are equipped with markers, and recent learning-based 6D pose estimation and tracking methods often depend on pre-scanned object meshes, requiring manual reconstruction. In this work, we propose PRISM-DP, an approach that leverages segmentation, mesh generation, pose estimation, and pose tracking models to enable compact diffusion policy learning directly from the spatial poses of task-relevant objects. Crucially, because PRISM-DP uses a mesh generation model, it eliminates the need for manual mesh processing or creation, improving scalability and usability in open-set, real-world environments. Experiments across a range of tasks in both simulation and real-world settings show that PRISM-DP outperforms high-dimensional image-based diffusion policies and achieves performance comparable to policies trained with ground-truth state information. We conclude with a discussion of the broader implications and limitations of our approach.</p></details> |  |

Despite long-standing concerns, there are limited methods that can efficiently and accurately detect and segment leaks due to their concealed appearance and random shapes. In this paper, we propose a Fine-grained Spatial-Temporal Perception (FGSTP) algorithm for gas leak segmentation. FGSTP captures critical motion clues across frames and integrates them with refined object features in an end-to-end network. Specifically, we first construct a correlation volume to capture motion information between consecutive frames. Then, the fine-grained perception progressively refines the object-level features using previous outputs. Finally, a decoder is employed to optimize boundary segmentation. Because there is no highly precise labeled dataset for gas leak segmentation, we manually label a gas leak video dataset, GasVid. Experimental results on GasVid demonstrate that our model excels in segmenting non-rigid objects such as gas leaks, generating the most accurate mask compared to other state-of-the-art (SOTA) models.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 4 figures, ICIP 2025 Conference</p></details> |

Thus, Wind Power Forecasting (WPF) has been widely recognized as one of the most critical issues in wind power integration and operation. There has been an explosion of studies on wind power forecasting problems in the past decades. Nevertheless, how to well handle the WPF problem is still challenging, since high prediction accuracy is always demanded to ensure grid stability and security of supply. We present a unique Spatial Dynamic Wind Power Forecasting dataset: SDWPF, which includes the spatial distribution of wind turbines, as well as the dynamic context factors. Whereas, most of the existing datasets have only a small number of wind turbines without knowing the locations and context information of wind turbines at a fine-grained time scale. By contrast, SDWPF provides the wind power data of 134 wind turbines from a wind farm over half a year with their relative positions and internal statuses. We use this dataset to launch the Baidu KDD Cup 2022 to examine the limit of current WPF solutions.

However, as a foundational model on interactive segmentation, SAM2 performs segmentation directly based on mask memory from the past six frames, leading to two significant challenges. Firstly, during inference in videos, objects may disappear since SAM2 relies solely on memory without accounting for object motion information, which limits its long-range object tracking capabilities. Secondly, its memory is constructed from fixed past frames, making it susceptible to challenges associated with object disappearance or occlusion, due to potentially inaccurate segmentation results in memory. To address these problems, we present MoSAM, incorporating two key strategies to integrate object motion cues into the model and establish more reliable feature memory. Firstly, we propose Motion-Guided Prompting (MGP), which represents the object motion in both sparse and dense manners, then injects them into SAM2 through a set of motion-guided prompts. MGP enables the model to adjust its focus towards the direction of motion, thereby enhancing the object tracking capabilities. Furthermore, acknowledging that past segmentation results may be inaccurate, we devise a Spatial-Temporal Memory Selection (ST-MS) mechanism that dynamically identifies frames likely to contain accurate segmentation in both pixel- and frame-level. By eliminating potentially inaccurate mask predictions from memory, we can leverage more reliable memory features to exploit similar regions for improving segmentation results. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks of video object segmentation and video instance segmentation demonstrate that our MoSAM achieves state-of-the-art results compared to other competitors.</p></details> |  |

We find that spatial relations are generally rare in widely used VL datasets, with only a few being well represented, while most form a long tail of underrepresented relations. This gap leaves VLMs ill-equipped to handle diverse spatial relationships. To bridge it, we construct a synthetic VQA dataset focused on spatial reasoning generated from hyper-detailed image descriptions in Localized Narratives, DOCCI, and PixMo-Cap. Our dataset consists of 455k samples containing 3.4 million QA pairs. Trained on this dataset, our Spatial-Reasoning Enhanced (SpaRE) VLMs show strong improvements on spatial reasoning benchmarks, achieving up to a 49% performance gain on the What's Up benchmark, while maintaining strong results on general tasks. Our work narrows the gap between human and VLM spatial reasoning and makes VLMs more capable in real-world tasks such as robotics and navigation.</p></details> |  |

However, existing systems such as Simba and Sedona, which incorporate distributed spatial indexing, still incur substantial index construction overheads, rendering them far from optimal for real-time analytics. Recent studies demonstrate that learned indices can achieve high efficiency through well-designed machine learning models, but how to design a learned index for distributed spatial analytics remains unaddressed. In this paper, we present LiLIS, a Lightweight Distributed Learned Index for big spatial data. LiLIS combines machine-learned search strategies with spatial-aware partitioning within a distributed framework, and efficiently implements common spatial queries, including point query, range query, k-nearest neighbors (kNN), and spatial joins. Extensive experimental results over real-world and synthetic datasets show that LiLIS outperforms state-of-the-art big spatial data analytics by $2-3$ orders of magnitude for most spatial queries, and the index building achieves $1.5-2\times$ speed-up.

However, most linear models in imaging genetics didn't explicitly model the inner relationship among QTs, which might miss some potential efficiency gains from information borrowing across brain regions. In this work, we developed a novel Bayesian regression framework for identifying significant associations between QTs and genetic markers while explicitly modeling spatial dependency between QTs, with the main contributions as follows. Firstly, we developed a spatial-correlated multitask linear mixed-effects model (LMM) to account for dependencies between QTs. We incorporated a population-level mixed effects term into the model, taking full advantage of the dependent structure of brain imaging-derived QTs. Secondly, we implemented the model in the Bayesian framework and derived a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm to achieve the model inference. Further, we incorporated the MCMC samples with the Cauchy combination test (CCT) to examine the association between SNPs and QTs, which avoided computationally intractable multi-test issues. The simulation studies indicated improved power of our proposed model compared to classic models where inner dependencies of QTs were not modeled. We also applied the new spatial model to an imaging dataset obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database.</p></details> | 32 pages, 5 figures |

This task requires simultaneous modeling of spatial information and dramatic prosody based on multimodal inputs, with high data collection costs. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first attempt to address these challenges. We construct MRSDrama, the first multimodal recorded spatial drama dataset, containing binaural drama audios, scripts, videos, geometric poses, and textual prompts. Then, we propose ISDrama, the first immersive spatial drama generation model through multimodal prompting. ISDrama comprises these primary components: 1) Multimodal Pose Encoder, based on contrastive learning, considering the Doppler effect caused by moving speakers to extract unified pose information from multimodal prompts. 2) Immersive Drama Transformer, a flow-based mamba-transformer model that generates high-quality drama, incorporating Drama-MOE to select proper experts for enhanced prosody and pose control. We also design a context-consistent classifier-free guidance strategy to coherently generate complete drama. Experimental results show that ISDrama outperforms baseline models on objective and subjective metrics.

However, existing Mamba-based methods usually neglect the spectral and spatial directional characteristics related to heterogeneous objects in hyperspectral scenes, leading to limited classification performance. To address these issues, we propose MambaMoE, a novel spectral-spatial mixture-of-experts framework, representing the first MoE-based approach in the HSI classification community. Specifically, we design a Mixture of Mamba Expert Block (MoMEB) that leverages sparse expert activation to enable adaptive spectral-spatial modeling. Furthermore, we introduce an uncertainty-guided corrective learning (UGCL) strategy to encourage the model's attention toward complex regions prone to prediction ambiguity. Extensive experiments on multiple public HSI benchmarks demonstrate that MambaMoE achieves state-of-the-art performance in both accuracy and efficiency compared to existing advanced approaches, especially for Mamba-based methods.

This allows attackers to control the model to misclassify poisoned samples with triggers into any desired target class during inference, exhibiting superior attack performance compared with conventional backdoor attacks. However, existing multi-target backdoor attacks fail to guarantee trigger specificity and stealthiness in black-box settings, resulting in two main issues. First, they are unable to simultaneously target all classes when only training data can be manipulated, limiting their effectiveness in realistic attack scenarios. Second, the triggers often lack visual imperceptibility, making poisoned samples easy to detect. To address these problems, we propose a Spatial-based Full-target Invisible Backdoor Attack, called SFIBA. It restricts triggers for different classes to specific local spatial regions and morphologies in the pixel space to ensure specificity, while employing a frequency-domain-based trigger injection method to guarantee stealthiness. Specifically, for injection of each trigger, we first apply fast fourier transform to obtain the amplitude spectrum of clean samples in local spatial regions. Then, we employ discrete wavelet transform to extract the features from the amplitude spectrum and use singular value decomposition to integrate the trigger. Subsequently, we selectively filter parts of the trigger in pixel space to implement trigger morphology constraints and adjust injection coefficients based on visual effects. We conduct experiments on multiple datasets and models. The results demonstrate that SFIBA can achieve excellent attack performance and stealthiness, while preserving the model's performance on benign samples, and can also bypass existing backdoor defenses.</p></details> |  |

However, the performance gap between SNNs and ANNs remains a substantial challenge hindering the widespread adoption of SNNs. In this paper, we propose a Spatial-Temporal Attention Aggregator SNN (STAA-SNN) framework, which dynamically focuses on and captures both spatial and temporal dependencies. First, we introduce a spike-driven self-attention mechanism specifically designed for SNNs. Additionally, we pioneeringly incorporate position encoding to integrate latent temporal relationships into the incoming features. For spatial-temporal information aggregation, we employ step attention to selectively amplify relevant features at different steps. Finally, we implement a time-step random dropout strategy to avoid local optima. As a result, STAA-SNN effectively captures both spatial and temporal dependencies, enabling the model to analyze complex patterns and make accurate predictions. The framework demonstrates exceptional performance across diverse datasets and exhibits strong generalization capabilities. Notably, STAA-SNN achieves state-of-the-art results on neuromorphic datasets CIFAR10-DVS, with remarkable performances of 97.14%, 82.05% and 70.40% on the static datasets CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet, respectively.

To address this gap, we propose a novel generalized linear model to analyze such that using a von Mises Fisher (vMF) distributed error structure. Using a novel link function that relies on the transformation between Cartesian and spherical coordinates, we regress the vMF-distributed directional data on the external covariates. This regression model enables us to quantify the impact of external factors on the observed directional data. Furthermore, we impose the spatial dependence using an autoregressive model, appropriately accounting for the directional dependence in the outcome. This novel specification renders computational efficiency and flexibility. In addition, a comprehensive Bayesian inferential toolbox is thoroughly developed and applied to our analysis. Subsequently, employing our regression model on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) data, we gain new insights into the relationship between cognitive impairment and the orientations of brain fibers, along with examining empirical efficacy through simulation experiments.

However, they face challenges in real-time collision-free planning. Hence, Robotic Attention Mamba (RAM) is designed for refined planning. Specifically, by integrating Mamba and parallel single-view attention, RAM aligns multi-view vision and task-related language features, ensuring efficient fine-grained task planning with linear complexity and robust real-time performance. Nevertheless, it has the potential for further improvement in high-precision grasping and manipulation. Thus, Grasp-Pretraining Augmentation (GPA) is devised, with a grasp pose feature extractor pretrained utilizing object grasp poses directly inherited from whole-task demonstrations. Subsequently, the extracted grasp features are fused with the spatially aligned planning features from RAM through attention-based Pre-trained Location Fusion, preserving high-resolution grasping cues overshadowed by an overemphasis on global planning. To summarize, we propose Grasp-Pretraining Augmented Robotic Attention Mamba (GPA-RAM), dividing spatial task learning into RAM for planning skill learning and GPA for grasping skill learning. GPA-RAM demonstrates superior performance across three robot systems with distinct camera configurations in simulation and the real world.

However, the motifs previously considered are either limited to a handful of nodes and edges, or do not include triangles, which are thought to be of critical relevance to understand the dynamics of social systems. Thus, we introduce a new class of motifs, that include these triangles, are not limited in their number of nodes or edges, and yet can be mined efficiently in any temporal network. Referring to these motifs as the edge-centered motifs, we show analytically how they subsume the Egocentric Temporal Neighborhoods motifs of the literature. We also confirm in empirical data that the edge-centered motifs bring relevant information with respect to the Egocentric motifs by using a principle of maximum entropy. Then, we show how mining for the edge-centered motifs in a network can be used to probe for spatial correlations in the underlying dynamics that have produced that network. We deduce an approximate formula for the distribution of the edge-centered motifs in empirical networks of social face-to-face interactions. In the last section of this paper, we explore how the statistics of the edge-centered motifs can be used to infer the complete topology of the network they were sampled from. This leads to the needs of mathematical development, that we inaugurate here under the name of graph tiling theory.</p></details> |  |

While current practices attempt to address this by organizing these phases into hybrid batches, such solutions create an inefficient tradeoff that sacrifices either throughput or latency, leaving substantial GPU resources underutilized. We identify two key root causes: 1) the prefill phase suffers from suboptimal compute utilization due to wave quantization and attention bottlenecks. 2) hybrid batches disproportionately prioritize latency over throughput, resulting in wasted compute and memory bandwidth. To mitigate the issues, we present Bullet, a novel spatial-temporal orchestration system that eliminates these inefficiencies through precise phase coordination. Bullet enables concurrent execution of prefill and decode phases, while dynamically provisioning GPU resources using real-time performance modeling. By integrating SLO-aware scheduling and adaptive resource allocation, Bullet maximizes utilization without compromising latency targets. Experimental evaluations on real-world workloads demonstrate that Bullet delivers 1.26x average throughput gains (up to 1.55x) over state-of-the-arts, while consistently meeting latency constraints.</p></details> |  |

In order to nonparametrically approximate these sampling distributions for purposes of inference, resampling can be useful, but previous developments in spatial bootstrap have faced challenges in the scope of their validity, specifically due to issues in capturing the complex variances of spatial spectral averages. As a consequence, existing frequency domain bootstraps for spatial data are highly restricted in application to only special processes (e.g. Gaussian) or certain spatial statistics. To address this limitation and to approximate a wide range of spatial spectral averages, we propose a practical hybrid-resampling approach that combines two different resampling techniques in the forms of spatial subsampling and spatial bootstrap. Subsampling helps to capture the variance of spectral averages while bootstrap captures the distributional shape. The hybrid resampling procedure can then accurately quantify uncertainty in spectral inference under mild spatial assumptions. Moreover, compared to the more studied time series setting, this work fills a gap in the theory of subsampling/bootstrap for spatial data regarding spectral average statistics.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose an adaptive and robust approach to changepoint testing. Specifically, by generalizing the classical mean-based cumulative sum (CUSUM) statistic, we construct CUSUM statistics based on spatial medians and spatial signs. We introduce test statistics that consider the maximum and summation of the CUSUM statistics across different dimensions, respectively, and take the maximum across all potential changepoint locations. The asymptotic distributions of test statistics under the null hypothesis are derived. Furthermore, the test statistics exhibit asymptotic independence under mild conditions. Building on these results, we propose an adaptive testing procedure that combines the max-$L_\infty$-type and max-$L_2$-type statistics to achieve high power under both sparse and dense alternatives. Through numerical experiments and theoretical analysis, the proposed method demonstrates strong performance and exhibits robustness across a wide range of signal sparsity levels and heavy-tailed distributions.</p></details> |  |

Recently, deep vision models such as the U-Net have been adapted to radio map estimation, whose effectiveness can be guaranteed with sufficient spatial observations (typically 0.01% to 1% of pixels) in each map, to model local dependency of observed signal power. However, such a setting of sufficient measurements can be less practical in real-world scenarios, where extreme sparsity in spatial sampling can be widely encountered. To address this challenge, we propose RadioFormer, a novel multiple-granularity transformer designed to handle the constraints posed by spatial sparse observations. Our RadioFormer, through a dual-stream self-attention (DSA) module, can respectively discover the correlation of pixel-wise observed signal power and also learn patch-wise buildings' geometries in a style of multiple granularities, which are integrated into multi-scale representations of radio maps by a cross stream cross-attention (CCA) module. Extensive experiments on the public RadioMapSeer dataset demonstrate that RadioFormer outperforms state-of-the-art methods in radio map estimation while maintaining the lowest computational cost. Furthermore, the proposed approach exhibits exceptional generalization capabilities and robust zero-shot performance, underscoring its potential to advance radio map estimation in a more practical setting with very limited observation nodes.</p></details> |  |

This inefficiency primarily arises from the quadratic computational complexity of 3D Full Attention with respect to the context length. In this paper, we propose a training-free framework termed Sparse VideoGen (SVG) that leverages the inherent sparsity in 3D Full Attention to boost inference efficiency. We reveal that the attention heads can be dynamically classified into two groups depending on distinct sparse patterns: (1) Spatial Head, where only spatially-related tokens within each frame dominate the attention output, and (2) Temporal Head, where only temporally-related tokens across different frames dominate. Based on this insight, SVG proposes an online profiling strategy to capture the dynamic sparse patterns and predicts the type of attention head. Combined with a novel hardware-efficient tensor layout transformation and customized kernel implementations, SVG achieves up to 2.28x and 2.33x end-to-end speedup on CogVideoX-v1.5 and HunyuanVideo, respectively, while preserving generation quality.

We show that this approximate posterior retains the rate of recovery of the full data posterior distribution, where the rate of recovery adapts to the smoothness of the true regression function. As particular examples we consider Gaussian process priors based on integrated Brownian motion and the Mat\'ern kernel augmented with a prior on the length scale. Besides theoretical guarantees we present a numerical study of the methods both on synthetic and real world data. We also propose a new aggregation technique, which numerically outperforms previous approaches. Finally, we demonstrate empirically that spatially distributed methods can adapt to local regularities, potentially outperforming the original Gaussian process.</p></details> | 90 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Real-time High-fidelity Gaussian Human Avatars with Position-based Interpolation of Spatially Distributed MLPs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12909v2)** | 2025-04-26 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2504.12909v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many works have succeeded in reconstructing Gaussian human avatars from multi-view videos. However, they either struggle to capture pose-dependent appearance details with a single MLP, or rely on a computationally intensive neural network to reconstruct high-fidelity appearance but with rendering performance degraded to non-real-time. We propose a novel Gaussian human avatar representation that can reconstruct high-fidelity pose-dependence appearance with details and meanwhile can be rendered in real time. Our Gaussian avatar is empowered by spatially distributed MLPs which are explicitly located on different positions on human body. The parameters stored in each Gaussian are obtained by interpolating from the outputs of its nearby MLPs based on their distances. To avoid undesired smooth Gaussian property changing during interpolation, for each Gaussian we define a set of Gaussian offset basis, and a linear combination of basis represents the Gaussian property offsets relative to the neutral properties. Then we propose to let the MLPs output a set of coefficients corresponding to the basis. In this way, although Gaussian coefficients are derived from interpolation and change smoothly, the Gaussian offset basis is learned freely without constraints. The smoothly varying coefficients combined with freely learned basis can still produce distinctly different Gaussian property offsets, allowing the ability to learn high-frequency spatial signals. We further use control points to constrain the Gaussians distributed on a surface layer rather than allowing them to be irregularly distributed inside the body, to help the human avatar generalize better when animated under novel poses. Compared to the state-of-the-art method, our method achieves better appearance quality with finer details while the rendering speed is significantly faster under novel views and novel poses.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025.

In recent years, with advances in geospatial artificial intelligence (GeoAI), numerous models have been developed to improve the accuracy of geographic variable predictions. Beyond achieving higher accuracy, it is equally important to obtain predictions with uncertainty measures to enhance model credibility and support responsible spatial prediction. Although geostatistic methods like Kriging offer some level of uncertainty assessment, such as Kriging variance, these measurements are not always accurate and lack general applicability to other spatial models. To address this issue, we propose a model-agnostic uncertainty assessment method called GeoConformal Prediction, which incorporates geographical weighting into conformal prediction. We applied it to two classic spatial prediction cases, spatial regression and spatial interpolation, to evaluate its reliability. First, in the spatial regression case, we used XGBoost to predict housing prices, followed by GeoConformal to calculate uncertainty. Our results show that GeoConformal achieved a coverage rate of 93.67%, while Bootstrap methods only reached a maximum coverage of 81.00% after 2000 runs. Next, we applied GeoConformal to spatial interpolation models. We found that the uncertainty obtained from GeoConformal aligned closely with the variance in Kriging. Finally, using GeoConformal, we analyzed the sources of uncertainty in spatial prediction. We found that explicitly including local features in AI models can significantly reduce prediction uncertainty, especially in areas with strong local dependence. Our findings suggest that GeoConformal holds potential not only for geographic knowledge discovery but also for guiding the design of future GeoAI models, paving the way for more reliable and interpretable spatial prediction frameworks.</p></details> |  |

We introduce spatial speech translation, a novel concept for hearables that translate speakers in the wearer's environment, while maintaining the direction and unique voice characteristics of each speaker in the binaural output. To achieve this, we tackle several technical challenges spanning blind source separation, localization, real-time expressive translation, and binaural rendering to preserve the speaker directions in the translated audio, while achieving real-time inference on the Apple M2 silicon. Our proof-of-concept evaluation with a prototype binaural headset shows that, unlike existing models, which fail in the presence of interference, we achieve a BLEU score of up to 22.01 when translating between languages, despite strong interference from other speakers in the environment. User studies further confirm the system's effectiveness in spatially rendering the translated speech in previously unseen real-world reverberant environments. Taking a step back, this work marks the first step towards integrating spatial perception into speech translation.</p></details> | Accepted by CHI2025 |

However, this task is often challenging due to the diversity of scenes, large number of fine-grained objects, and complex free-form nature of language references. Furthermore, in the 3D domain, obtaining large amounts of natural language training data is difficult. Thus, it is important for methods to learn from little data and zero-shot generalize to new environments. To address these challenges, we propose SORT3D, an approach that utilizes rich object attributes from 2D data and merges a heuristics-based spatial reasoning toolbox with the ability of large language models (LLMs) to perform sequential reasoning. Importantly, our method does not require text-to-3D data for training and can be applied zero-shot to unseen environments. We show that SORT3D achieves state-of-the-art performance on complex view-dependent grounding tasks on two benchmarks. We also implement the pipeline to run real-time on an autonomous vehicle and demonstrate that our approach can be used for object-goal navigation on previously unseen real-world environments.

In this work, we present a novel system architecture that incorporates spatial speech understanding into LLMs, enabling contextually aware and adaptive applications for wearable technologies. Our approach leverages microstructure-based spatial sensing to extract precise Direction of Arrival (DoA) information using a monaural microphone. To address the lack of existing dataset for microstructure-assisted speech recordings, we synthetically create a dataset called OmniTalk by using the LibriSpeech dataset. This spatial information is fused with linguistic embeddings from OpenAI's Whisper model, allowing each modality to learn complementary contextual representations. The fused embeddings are aligned with the input space of LLaMA-3.2 3B model and fine-tuned with lightweight adaptation technique LoRA to optimize for on-device processing. SING supports spatially-aware automatic speech recognition (ASR), achieving a mean error of $25.72^\circ$-a substantial improvement compared to the 88.52$^\circ$ median error in existing work-with a word error rate (WER) of 5.3. SING also supports soundscaping, for example, inference how many people were talking and their directions, with up to 5 people and a median DoA error of 16$^\circ$. Our system demonstrates superior performance in spatial speech understanding while addressing the challenges of power efficiency, privacy, and hardware constraints, paving the way for advanced applications in augmented reality, accessibility, and immersive experiences.</p></details> |  |

We present a spatial reasoning framework that bridges geometric facts with symbolic predicates and relations to handle key tasks such as determining how 3D objects are arranged among each other ('on', 'behind', 'near', etc.). Its foundation relies on oriented 3D bounding box representations, enhanced by a comprehensive set of spatial predicates, ranging from topology and connectivity to directionality and orientation, expressed in a formalism related to natural language. The derived predicates form a spatial knowledge graph and, in combination with a pipeline-based inference model, enable spatial queries and dynamic rule evaluation. Implementations for client- and server-side processing demonstrate the framework's capability to efficiently translate geometric data into actionable knowledge, ensuring scalable and technology-independent spatial reasoning in complex 3D environments. The Spatial Reasoner framework is fostering the creation of spatial ontologies, and seamlessly integrates with and therefore enriches machine learning, natural language processing, and rule systems in XR applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, preprint of ICVARS 2025 paper</p></details> |

Compared to previous work, our Flow MAtching Postprocessing (FMAP) better represents the correlation structures of the observations distribution, while also improving marginal performance at the stations. FMAP generates forecasts that are not bound to what is already modeled by the underlying gridded prediction and can infer new correlation structures from data. The resulting model can generate an arbitrary number of forecasts from a limited number of numerical simulations, allowing for low-cost forecasting systems. A single training is sufficient to perform postprocessing at multiple lead times, in contrast with other methods which use multiple trained networks at generation time. This work details our methodology, including a spatial attention transformer backbone trained within a flow matching generative modeling framework. FMAP shows promising performance in experiments on the EUPPBench dataset, forecasting surface temperature and wind gust values at station locations in western Europe up to five-day lead times.</p></details> | 26 pages, 7 figures |

However, conventional MIL methods such as Attention-Based Deep Multiple Instance Learning (ABMIL) typically disregard spatial interactions among patches that are crucial to pathological diagnosis. Recent advancements, such as Transformer based MIL (TransMIL), have incorporated spatial context and inter-patch relationships. However, it remains unclear whether explicitly modeling patch relationships yields similar performance gains in ABMIL, which relies solely on Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs). In contrast, TransMIL employs Transformer-based layers, introducing a fundamental architectural shift at the cost of substantially increased computational complexity. In this work, we enhance the ABMIL framework by integrating interaction-aware representations to address this question. Our proposed model, Global ABMIL (GABMIL), explicitly captures inter-instance dependencies while preserving computational efficiency. Experimental results on two publicly available datasets for tumor subtyping in breast and lung cancers demonstrate that GABMIL achieves up to a 7 percentage point improvement in AUPRC and a 5 percentage point increase in the Kappa score over ABMIL, with minimal or no additional computational overhead. These findings underscore the importance of incorporating patch interactions within MIL frameworks.

However, challenges remain: (1) Semantic features often fail to provide accurate directional information, leading to superfluous actions, and (2) performance drops significantly when viewpoint inconsistencies arise between training and application. To address these challenges, we propose RSRNav, a simple yet effective method that reasons spatial relationships between the goal and current observations as navigation guidance. Specifically, we model the spatial relationship by constructing correlations between the goal and current observations, which are then passed to the policy network for action prediction. These correlations are progressively refined using fine-grained cross-correlation and direction-aware correlation for more precise navigation. Extensive evaluation of RSRNav on three benchmark datasets demonstrates superior navigation performance, particularly in the "user-matched goal" setting, highlighting its potential for real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

They have demonstrated excellent performance in multiple domains involving graph-structured data. However, an important category of learning tasks, namely link weight prediction, has received less emphasis due to its increased complexity compared to binary link classification. Link weight prediction becomes even more challenging when considering multilayer networks, where nodes can be interconnected across multiple layers. To address these challenges, we propose a new method named Multiplex Spatial Graph Convolution Network (MSGCN), which spatially embeds information across multiple layers to predict interlayer link weights. The MSGCN model generalizes spatial graph convolution to multiplex networks and captures the geometric structure of nodes across multiple layers. Extensive experiments using data with known interlayer link information show that the MSGCN model has robust, accurate, and generalizable link weight prediction performance across a wide variety of multiplex network structures.</p></details> |  |

It is challenging due to spatial variability and interpretability needs. Previously proposed techniques require dense training data or have limited ability to handle significant spatial variability within a single place-type. Most importantly, these deep neural network (DNN) approaches are not designed to work in non-Euclidean space, particularly point sets. Existing non-Euclidean DNN methods are limited to one-size-fits-all approaches.

While current deep learning methods have made significant advancements, challenges remain in achieving an optimal balance between accuracy, robustness, and inference speed. To address these challenges, we propose the StereoMamba architecture, which is specifically designed for stereo disparity estimation in RAMIS. Our approach is based on a novel Feature Extraction Mamba (FE-Mamba) module, which enhances long-range spatial dependencies both within and across stereo images. To effectively integrate multi-scale features from FE-Mamba, we then introduce a novel Multidimensional Feature Fusion (MFF) module. Experiments against the state-of-the-art on the ex-vivo SCARED benchmark demonstrate that StereoMamba achieves superior performance on EPE of 2.64 px and depth MAE of 2.55 mm, the second-best performance on Bad2 of 41.49% and Bad3 of 26.99%, while maintaining an inference speed of 21.28 FPS for a pair of high-resolution images (1280*1024), striking the optimum balance between accuracy, robustness, and efficiency. Furthermore, by comparing synthesized right images, generated from warping left images using the generated disparity maps, with the actual right image, StereoMamba achieves the best average SSIM (0.8970) and PSNR (16.0761), exhibiting strong zero-shot generalization on the in-vivo RIS2017 and StereoMIS datasets.</p></details> |  |

Traditional approaches like on-device storage or reactive data fetching from the cloud often result in limited AR experiences or unacceptable lag. Edge caching, which caches AR objects closer to the user, provides a promising solution. However, existing edge caching approaches do not consider AR-specific features such as AR object sizes, user interactions, and physical location. This paper investigates how to further optimize edge caching by employing AR-aware prefetching techniques. We present SPAARC, a Spatial Proximity and Association-based Prefetching policy specifically designed for MAR Caches. SPAARC intelligently prioritizes the caching of virtual objects based on their association with other similar objects and the user's proximity to them. It also considers the recency of associations and uses a lazy fetching strategy to efficiently manage edge resources and maximize Quality of Experience (QoE). Through extensive evaluation using both synthetic and real-world workloads, we demonstrate that SPAARC significantly improves cache hit rates compared to standard caching algorithms, achieving gains ranging from 3% to 40% while reducing the need for on-demand data retrieval from the cloud. Further, we present an adaptive tuning algorithm that automatically tunes SPAARC parameters to achieve optimal performance. Our findings demonstrate the potential of SPAARC to substantially enhance the user experience in MAR applications by ensuring the timely availability of virtual objects.</p></details> |  |

While existing methods predominantly rely on spatial domain analysis, frequency domain operations are primarily limited to feature-level augmentation, leaving frequency-native artifacts and spatial-frequency interactions insufficiently exploited. To address this limitation, we propose a novel detection framework that integrates multi-scale spatial-frequency analysis for universal deepfake detection. Our framework comprises three key components: (1) a local spectral feature extraction pipeline that combines block-wise discrete cosine transform with cascaded multi-scale convolutions to capture subtle spectral artifacts; (2) a global spectral feature extraction pipeline utilizing scale-invariant differential accumulation to identify holistic forgery distribution patterns; and (3) a multi-stage cross-modal fusion mechanism that incorporates shallow-layer attention enhancement and deep-layer dynamic modulation to model spatial-frequency interactions.

This problem is societally important for many applications, such as generating clinical hypotheses for designing new immunotherapies for cancer treatment. The challenge lies in the spatial variability, the inherent heterogeneity and variation observed in spatial properties or arrangements across different locations (i.e., place-types). Previous techniques focus on self-supervised tasks to learn domain-invariant features and mitigate domain differences; however, they often neglect the underlying spatial arrangements among data points, leading to significant discrepancies across different place-types. We explore a novel multi-task self-learning framework that targets spatial arrangements, such as spatial mix-up masking and spatial contrastive predictive coding, for spatially-delineated domain-adapted AI classification.

Most existing functional regression models have limited applicability because they do not consider spatial correlations. Although functional kriging methods can predict the curves at unobserved spatial locations, they are based on variogram fittings rather than constructing hierarchical statistical models. In this manuscript, we propose a Bayesian framework for spatial function-on-function regression that can carry out parameter estimations and predictions. However, the proposed model has computational and inferential challenges because the model needs to account for within and between-curve dependencies. Furthermore, high-dimensional and spatially correlated parameters can lead to the slow mixing of Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms. To address these issues, we first utilize a basis transformation approach to simplify the covariance and apply projection methods for dimension reduction. We also develop a simultaneous band score for the proposed model to detect the significant region in the regression function. We apply our method to both areal and point-level spatial functional data, showing the proposed method is computationally efficient and provides accurate estimations and predictions.</p></details> |  |

Bayesian inference for such models is challenging since the resulting posterior distribution is doubly intractable. Although auxiliary variable MCMC (AVM) algorithms are known to be the most practical, they are computationally expensive due to the repeated auxiliary variable simulations. To address this, we propose delayed-acceptance AVM (DA-AVM) methods, which can reduce the number of auxiliary variable simulations. The first stage of the kernel uses a cheap surrogate to decide whether to accept or reject the proposed parameter value. The second stage guarantees detailed balance with respect to the posterior. The auxiliary variable simulation is performed only on the parameters accepted in the first stage. We construct various surrogates specifically tailored for doubly intractable problems, including subsampling strategy, Gaussian process emulation, and frequentist estimator-based approximation. We validate our method through simulated and real data applications, demonstrating its practicality for complex spatial models.</p></details> |  |

Predicting accurate land emissions is challenging since calibrating the heterogeneous nature of soil properties, moisture, and environmental conditions is hard at decision-relevant scales. Traditional approaches do not adequately estimate land emissions due to location-independent parameters failing to leverage the spatial heterogeneity and also require large datasets. To overcome these limitations, we proposed Spatial Distribution-Shift Aware Knowledge-Guided Machine Learning (SDSA-KGML), which leverages location-dependent parameters that account for significant spatial heterogeneity in soil moisture from multiple sites within the same region. Experimental results demonstrate that SDSA-KGML models achieve higher local accuracy for the specified states in the Midwest Region.</p></details> |  |

However, its effectiveness in video recognition tasks is hampered by two main challenges. First, fast adversarial training for video models remains largely unexplored, which severely impedes its practical applications. Specifically, most video adversarial training methods are computationally costly, with long training times and high expenses. Second, existing methods struggle with the trade-off between clean accuracy and adversarial robustness. To address these challenges, we introduce Video Fast Adversarial Training with Weak-to-Strong consistency (VFAT-WS), the first fast adversarial training method for video data. Specifically, VFAT-WS incorporates the following key designs: First, it integrates a straightforward yet effective temporal frequency augmentation (TF-AUG), and its spatial-temporal enhanced form STF-AUG, along with a single-step PGD attack to boost training efficiency and robustness. Second, it devises a weak-to-strong spatial-temporal consistency regularization, which seamlessly integrates the simpler TF-AUG and the more complex STF-AUG. Leveraging the consistency regularization, it steers the learning process from simple to complex augmentations. Both of them work together to achieve a better trade-off between clean accuracy and robustness. Extensive experiments on UCF-101 and HMDB-51 with both CNN and Transformer-based models demonstrate that VFAT-WS achieves great improvements in adversarial robustness and corruption robustness, while accelerating training by nearly 490%.</p></details> | <details><summary>After...</summary><p>After the submission of the paper, we realized that the study still has room for expansion.

Some research suggests that VLMs can exhibit humanlike scene understanding, while other investigations reveal difficulties in their ability to process relational information. To achieve widespread applicability, VLMs must perform reliably, yielding comparable competence across a wide variety of related tasks. We sought to test how reliable these architectures are at engaging in trivial spatial cognition, e.g., recognizing whether one object is left of another in an uncluttered scene. We developed a benchmark dataset -- TableTest -- whose images depict 3D scenes of objects arranged on a table, and used it to evaluate state-of-the-art VLMs. Results show that performance could be degraded by minor variations of prompts that use logically equivalent descriptions. These analyses suggest limitations in how VLMs may reason about spatial relations in real-world applications. They also reveal novel opportunities for bolstering image caption corpora for more efficient training and testing.</p></details> |  |

Drawing on evidence that visual landmarks play a central role in spatial encoding, the proposed VPCE model activates visual place cells by clustering high-dimensional appearance features extracted from images captured by a robot-mounted camera. Each cluster center defines a receptive field, and activation is computed based on visual similarity using a radial basis function. We evaluate whether the resulting activation patterns correlate with key properties of biological place cells, including spatial proximity, orientation alignment, and boundary differentiation. Experiments demonstrate that the VPCE can distinguish between visually similar yet spatially distinct locations and adapt to environment changes such as the insertion or removal of walls. These results suggest that structured visual input, even in the absence of motion cues or reward-driven learning, is sufficient to generate place-cell-like spatial representations and support biologically inspired cognitive mapping.</p></details> |  |

CV is applicable in a wide range of statistical settings. However, in cases where data are not exchangeable, the design of CV schemes should account for suspected correlation structures within the data. CV scheme designs include the selection of left-out blocks and the choice of scoring function for evaluating predictive performance. This paper focuses on the impact of two scoring strategies for block-wise CV applied to spatial models with Gaussian covariance structures. We investigate, through several experiments, whether evaluating the predictive performance of blocks of left-out observations jointly, rather than aggregating individual (pointwise) predictions, improves model selection performance. Extending recent findings for data with serial correlation (such as time-series data), our experiments suggest that joint scoring reduces the variability of CV estimates, leading to more reliable model selection, particularly when spatial dependence is strong and model differences are subtle.</p></details> |  |

Recently, adopted event oriented multi-track methods affect the generality in polyphonic environments due to the limitation of the number of tracks. To enhance the generality in polyphonic environments, we propose Spatial Mapping and Regression Localization for SELD (SMRL-SELD). SMRL-SELD segments the 3D spatial space, mapping it to a 2D plane, and a new regression localization loss is proposed to help the results converge toward the location of the corresponding event. SMRL-SELD is location-oriented, allowing the model to learn event features based on orientation. Thus, the method enables the model to process polyphonic sounds regardless of the number of overlapping events. We conducted experiments on STARSS23 and STARSS22 datasets and our proposed SMRL-SELD outperforms the existing SELD methods in overall evaluation and polyphony environments.</p></details> |  |

To test models' ability to reason about multiple occluded objects, we introduce a novel task, Counting Amodally for Patterns Through Unseen REgions (CAPTURe), which requires a model to count objects arranged in a pattern by inferring how the pattern continues behind an occluder (an object which blocks parts of the scene). CAPTURe requires both recognizing visual patterns and reasoning, making it a useful testbed for evaluating vision-language models (VLMs) on whether they understand occluded patterns and possess spatial understanding skills. By requiring models to reason about occluded objects, CAPTURe also tests VLMs' ability to form world models that would allow them to fill in missing information. CAPTURe consists of two parts: (1) CAPTURe-real, with manually filtered images of real objects in patterns and (2) CAPTURe-synthetic, a controlled diagnostic with generated patterned images. We evaluate four strong VLMs (GPT-4o, Intern-VL2, Molmo, and Qwen2-VL) on CAPTURe, finding that models struggle to count on both occluded and unoccluded patterns. Crucially, we find that models perform worse with occlusion, suggesting that VLMs are also deficient in inferring unseen spatial relationships: even the strongest VLMs like GPT-4o fail to count with occlusion. In contrast, we find that humans achieve very little error on CAPTURe. We also find that providing auxiliary information of occluded object locations increases performance, underscoring that the model error comes both from an inability to handle occlusion as well as difficulty counting in images.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code and data: https://github.com/atinpothiraj/CAPTURe</p></details> |

Current surrogate models fall short in the flexibility of point- or region-based predictions as the entire field reconstruction is required for each parameter setting, hence hindering the efficiency of parameter space exploration. Limitations exist in capturing physical attribute distributions and pinpointing optimal parameter configurations. In this work, we propose Explorable INR, a novel implicit neural representation-based surrogate model, designed to facilitate exploration and allow point-based spatial queries without computing full-scale field data. In addition, to further address computational bottlenecks of spatial exploration, we utilize probabilistic affine forms (PAFs) for uncertainty propagation through Explorable INR to obtain statistical summaries, facilitating various ensemble analysis and visualization tasks that are expensive with existing models. Furthermore, we reformulate the parameter exploration problem as optimization tasks using gradient descent and KL divergence minimization that ensures scalability. We demonstrate that the Explorable INR with the proposed approach for spatial and parameter exploration can significantly reduce computation and memory costs while providing effective ensemble analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics (TVCG)</p></details> |

To evaluate models' Spatial-Temporal Intelligence, we introduce STI-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs' spatial-temporal understanding through challenging tasks such as estimating and predicting the appearance, pose, displacement, and motion of objects. Our benchmark encompasses a wide range of robot and vehicle operations across desktop, indoor, and outdoor scenarios.

However, recent studies have exposed critical limitations in their spatial reasoning capabilities. This deficiency in spatial reasoning significantly constrains MLLMs' ability to interact effectively with the physical world, thereby limiting their broader applications. We argue that spatial reasoning capabilities will not naturally emerge from merely scaling existing architectures and training methodologies. Instead, this challenge demands dedicated attention to fundamental modifications in the current MLLM development approach. In this position paper, we first establish a comprehensive framework for spatial reasoning within the context of MLLMs. We then elaborate on its pivotal role in real-world applications. Through systematic analysis, we examine how individual components of the current methodology-from training data to reasoning mechanisms-influence spatial reasoning capabilities. This examination reveals critical limitations while simultaneously identifying promising avenues for advancement. Our work aims to direct the AI research community's attention toward these crucial yet underexplored aspects. By highlighting these challenges and opportunities, we seek to catalyze progress toward achieving human-like spatial reasoning capabilities in MLLMs.</p></details> |  |

This issue can significantly disrupt systems that rely on the data. Spatial and temporal dependencies can be leveraged to impute the missing samples. Existing imputation methods often ignore dynamic changes in spatial dependencies. We propose a Spatial Dynamic Aware Graph Recurrent Imputation Network (SDA-GRIN) which is capable of capturing dynamic changes in spatial dependencies.SDA-GRIN leverages a multi-head attention mechanism to adapt graph structures with time. SDA-GRIN models multivariate time series as a sequence of temporal graphs and uses a recurrent message-passing architecture for imputation. We evaluate SDA-GRIN on four real-world datasets: SDA-GRIN improves MSE by 9.51% for the AQI and 9.40% for AQI-36. On the PEMS-BAY dataset, it achieves a 1.94% improvement in MSE. Detailed ablation study demonstrates the effect of window sizes and missing data on the performance of the method. Project page:https://ameskandari.github.io/sda-grin/</p></details> |  |

To address this issue, we introduce a novel latent factor model with change-points for item response data, designed to detect and account for individual-level shifts in response patterns during testing. This model extends traditional Item Response Theory (IRT) by incorporating person-specific change-points, which enables simultaneous estimation of item parameters, person latent traits, and the location of behavioral changes. We evaluate the proposed model through extensive simulation studies, which demonstrate its ability to accurately recover item parameters, change-point locations, and individual ability estimates under various conditions. Our findings show that accounting for change-points significantly reduces bias in ability estimates, particularly for respondents affected by time pressure. Application of the model to two real-world educational testing datasets reveals distinct patterns of change-point occurrence between high-stakes and lower-stakes tests, providing insights into how test-taking behavior evolves during the tests. This approach offers a more nuanced understanding of test-taking dynamics, with important implications for test design, scoring, and interpretation.</p></details> |  |

Rather than merely reacting to commands, it would continuously listen, reason, and respond proactively, fostering fluid, dynamic, and emotionally resonant interactions. We introduce Voila, a family of large voice-language foundation models that make a step towards this vision. Voila moves beyond traditional pipeline systems by adopting a new end-to-end architecture that enables full-duplex, low-latency conversations while preserving rich vocal nuances such as tone, rhythm, and emotion. It achieves a response latency of just 195 milliseconds, surpassing the average human response time. Its hierarchical multi-scale Transformer integrates the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) with powerful acoustic modeling, enabling natural, persona-aware voice generation -- where users can simply write text instructions to define the speaker's identity, tone, and other characteristics. Moreover, Voila supports over one million pre-built voices and efficient customization of new ones from brief audio samples as short as 10 seconds. Beyond spoken dialogue, Voila is designed as a unified model for a wide range of voice-based applications, including automatic speech recognition (ASR), Text-to-Speech (TTS), and, with minimal adaptation, multilingual speech translation. Voila is fully open-sourced to support open research and accelerate progress toward next-generation human-machine interactions.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 7 figures, Website: https://voila.maitrix.org</p></details> |

In machine learning, the answer is almost universally given by the error backpropagation algorithm, through both space and time. However, this algorithm is well-known to rely on biologically implausible assumptions, in particular with respect to spatio-temporal (non-)locality. Alternative forward-propagation models such as real-time recurrent learning only partially solve the locality problem, but only at the cost of scaling, due to prohibitive storage requirements. We introduce Generalized Latent Equilibrium (GLE), a computational framework for fully local spatio-temporal credit assignment in physical, dynamical networks of neurons. We start by defining an energy based on neuron-local mismatches, from which we derive both neuronal dynamics via stationarity and parameter dynamics via gradient descent. The resulting dynamics can be interpreted as a real-time, biologically plausible approximation of backpropagation through space and time in deep cortical networks with continuous-time neuronal dynamics and continuously active, local synaptic plasticity. In particular, GLE exploits the morphology of dendritic trees to enable more complex information storage and processing in single neurons, as well as the ability of biological neurons to phase-shift their output rate with respect to their membrane potential, which is essential in both directions of information propagation. For the forward computation, it enables the mapping of time-continuous inputs to neuronal space, effectively performing a spatio-temporal convolution. For the backward computation, it permits the temporal inversion of feedback signals, which consequently approximate the adjoint variables necessary for useful parameter updates.</p></details> | <details><summary>First...</summary><p>First authorship shared by Benjamin Ellenberger and Paul Haider</p></details> |

Across these developments, a key unified paradigm has arisen: Learning from Rewards, where reward signals act as the guiding stars to steer LLM behavior. It has underpinned a wide range of prevalent techniques, such as reinforcement learning (in RLHF, DPO, and GRPO), reward-guided decoding, and post-hoc correction. Crucially, this paradigm enables the transition from passive learning from static data to active learning from dynamic feedback. This endows LLMs with aligned preferences and deep reasoning capabilities. In this survey, we present a comprehensive overview of the paradigm of learning from rewards. We categorize and analyze the strategies under this paradigm across training, inference, and post-inference stages. We further discuss the benchmarks for reward models and the primary applications.

We present the development of reasoning LLMs and list their key technologies. By synthesizing over 100 studies, it charts a path toward LLMs that combine human-like deep thinking with scalable efficiency for reasoning. The review breaks down methods into three categories: (1) test-time scaling dynamically adjusts computation based on task complexity via search and sampling, dynamic verification; (2) reinforced learning refines decision-making through iterative improvement leveraging policy networks, reward models, and self-evolution strategies; and (3) slow-thinking frameworks (e.g., long CoT, hierarchical processes) that structure problem-solving with manageable steps. The survey highlights the challenges and further directions of this domain. Understanding and advancing the reasoning abilities of LLMs is crucial for unlocking their full potential in real-world applications, from scientific discovery to decision support systems.</p></details> |  |

Our detection procedure employs an initial estimator that systematically searches across time points. We examine the localization error and its dependence on time series properties and sample size. To enhance accuracy, we introduce an optimal rate method with an asymptotic distribution, facilitating the construction of confidence intervals.

However, the growing volume of high-frequency data from sensors and IoT devices poses challenges for storage and transmission. This study explores Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT)-based data compression as a solution to these challenges while ensuring forecasting accuracy. A case study of a seawater supply system in Hirtshals, Denmark, operating under dynamic weather, operational schedules, and seasonal trends, is used for evaluation. Biorthogonal wavelets of varying orders were applied to compress data at different rates. Three forecasting models - Ordinary Least Squares (OLS), XGBoost, and the Time Series Dense Encoder (TiDE) - were tested to assess the impact of compression on forecasting performance. Lossy compression rates up to $r_{\mathrm{lossy}} = 0.999$ were analyzed, with the Normalized Mutual Information (NMI) metric quantifying the relationship between compression and information retention. Results indicate that wavelet-based compression can retain essential features for accurate forecasting when applied carefully. XGBoost proved highly robust to compression artifacts, maintaining stable performance across diverse compression rates. In contrast, OLS demonstrated sensitivity to smooth wavelets and high compression rates, while TiDE showed some variability but remained competitive. This study highlights the potential of wavelet-based compression for scalable, efficient data management in smart energy systems without sacrificing forecasting accuracy. The findings are relevant to other fields requiring high-frequency time series forecasting, including climate modeling, water supply systems, and industrial operations.</p></details> |  |

In particular, we work with data in which only the total count of units in a system at a given time point is observed, but the underlying process of inflows, length of stay and outflows is not. The particular data example looked at in this paper is the occupancy of intensive care units (ICU) during the COVID-19 pandemic, where the aggregated numbers of occupied beds in ICUs on the district level (`Landkreis') are recorded, but not the number of incoming and outgoing patients. The Skellam distribution allows us to infer the number of incoming and outgoing patients from the occupancy in the ICUs. This paper goes a step beyond and approaches the question of whether we can also estimate the average length of stay of ICU patients. Hence, the task is to derive not only the number of incoming and outgoing units from a total net count but also to gain information on the duration time of patients on ICUs. We make use of a stochastic Expectation-Maximisation algorithm and additionally include exogenous information which are assumed to explain the intensity of inflow.</p></details> |  |

However, a fundamental cross-modality gap between time series and LLMs exists, as LLMs are pre-trained on textual corpora and are not inherently optimized for time series. Many recent proposals are designed to address this issue. In this survey, we provide an up-to-date overview of LLMs-based cross-modality modeling for time series analytics. We first introduce a taxonomy that classifies existing approaches into four groups based on the type of textual data employed for time series modeling. We then summarize key cross-modality strategies, e.g., alignment and fusion, and discuss their applications across a range of downstream tasks. Furthermore, we conduct experiments on multimodal datasets from different application domains to investigate effective combinations of textual data and cross-modality strategies for enhancing time series analytics. Finally, we suggest several promising directions for future research. This survey is designed for a range of professionals, researchers, and practitioners interested in LLM-based time series modeling.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IJCAI 2025 Survey Track</p></details> |

A key challenge is determining the optimal timing for integrating these modalities-specifically, identifying the network layers where fusion modules should be inserted. Current approaches often rely on manual tuning or exhaustive search, which are computationally expensive without any guarantee of converging to optimal results. We propose a sequential forward search algorithm that incrementally activates and evaluates candidate fusion modules at different layers of a multimodal network. At each step, the algorithm retrains from previously learned weights and compares validation loss to identify the best-performing configuration. This process systematically reduces the search space, enabling efficient identification of the optimal fusion timing without exhaustively testing all possible module placements. The approach is validated on two multimodal MRI datasets, each addressing different classification tasks. Our algorithm consistently identified configurations that outperformed unimodal baselines, late fusion, and a brute-force ensemble of all potential fusion placements. These architectures demonstrated superior accuracy, F-score, and specificity while maintaining competitive or improved AUC values. Furthermore, the sequential nature of the search significantly reduced computational overhead, making the optimization process more practical. By systematically determining the optimal timing to fuse imaging modalities, our method advances multimodal deep learning for medical imaging. It provides an efficient and robust framework for fusion optimization, paving the way for improved clinical decision-making and more adaptable, scalable architectures in medical AI applications.</p></details> |  |

While diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in Text-to-X (e.g., vision and audio data) generation, their use in time series generation remains in its nascent stages. Existing approaches face two critical limitations: (1) the lack of systematic exploration of general-proposed time series captions, which are often domain-specific and struggle with generalization; and (2) the inability to generate time series of arbitrary lengths, limiting their applicability to real-world scenarios. In this work, we first categorize time series captions into three levels: point-level, fragment-level, and instance-level. Additionally, we introduce a new fragment-level dataset containing over 600,000 high-resolution time series-text pairs. Second, we propose Text-to-Series (T2S), a diffusion-based framework that bridges the gap between natural language and time series in a domain-agnostic manner. T2S employs a length-adaptive variational autoencoder to encode time series of varying lengths into consistent latent embeddings. On top of that, T2S effectively aligns textual representations with latent embeddings by utilizing Flow Matching and employing Diffusion Transformer as the denoiser. We train T2S in an interleaved paradigm across multiple lengths, allowing it to generate sequences of any desired length. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that T2S achieves state-of-the-art performance across 13 datasets spanning 12 domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the 34th International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI 2025)</p></details> |

A key feature of our approach is its ability to directly incorporate road geometries of arbitrary shape without resorting to conservative overapproximations. We formulate the safety filter as a constrained optimization problem in the form of a Quadratic Program (QP). It achieves safety by making minimal, necessary adjustments to the control actions issued by the nominal motion planner. We validate our safety filter through extensive numerical experiments across a variety of traffic scenarios featuring complex roads. The results confirm its reliable safety and high computational efficiency (execution frequency up to 40 Hz). Code & Video Demo: github.com/bassamlab/SigmaRL</p></details> |  |

However, in some problems, there is uncertainty about the time horizon for which the system runs. This creates uncertainty about the cost (or reward) incurred based on the state distribution when the system stops. Given past data samples of how long a system ran, we propose to theoretically analyze a distributional robust cost estimation task in a Wasserstein ambiguity set, instead of learning a probability distribution from a few samples. Towards this, we show an equivalence between a discrete time Markov Chain on a probability simplex and a global asymptotic stable (GAS) discrete time linear dynamical system, allowing us to base our study on a GAS system only. Then, we provide various polynomial time algorithms and hardness results for different cases in our theoretical study, including a fundamental result about Wasserstein distance based polytope.</p></details> |  |

Most available estimation methods can be divided into two categories: the covariance-based under asymptotically-identifiable assumption and the autocovariance-based with white idiosyncratic noise. This paper follows the autocovariance-based framework and develops a novel weight-calibrated method to improve the estimation performance. It adopts a linear projection to tackle high-dimensionality, and employs a reduced-rank autoregression formulation. The asymptotic theory of the proposed method is established, relaxing the assumption on white noise. Additionally, we make the first attempt in the literature by providing a systematic theoretical comparison among the covariance-based, the standard autocovariance-based, and our proposed weight-calibrated autocovariance-based methods in the presence of factors with different strengths. Extensive simulations are conducted to showcase the superior finite-sample performance of our proposed method, as well as to validate the newly established theory. The superiority of our proposal is further illustrated through the analysis of one financial and one macroeconomic data sets.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This version includes the supplementary material of the paper</p></details> |

Existing well-established methods often struggle to attain this goal due to insufficient 3D training data from broader concepts. Meanwhile, pre-trained large vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) have shown remarkable zero-shot generalization capabilities. Yet, they are limited in extracting suitable 3D representations due to substantial gaps between their 2D training and 3D testing distributions. To address these challenges, we propose Testing-time Distribution Alignment (TeDA), a novel framework that adapts a pretrained 2D vision-language model CLIP for unknown 3D object retrieval at test time. To our knowledge, it is the first work that studies the test-time adaptation of a vision-language model for 3D feature learning. TeDA projects 3D objects into multi-view images, extracts features using CLIP, and refines 3D query embeddings with an iterative optimization strategy by confident query-target sample pairs in a self-boosting manner. Additionally, TeDA integrates textual descriptions generated by a multimodal language model (InternVL) to enhance 3D object understanding, leveraging CLIP's aligned feature space to fuse visual and textual cues. Extensive experiments on four open-set 3D object retrieval benchmarks demonstrate that TeDA greatly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, even those requiring extensive training. We also experimented with depth maps on Objaverse-LVIS, further validating its effectiveness.

| **[REPLAY: Modeling Time-Varying Temporal Regularities of Human Mobility for Location Prediction over Sparse Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16310v4)** | 2025-05-05 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2402.16310v4) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Location prediction forecasts a user's location based on historical user mobility traces. To tackle the intrinsic sparsity issue of real-world user mobility traces, spatiotemporal contexts have been shown as significantly useful. Existing solutions mostly incorporate spatiotemporal distances between locations in mobility traces, either by feeding them as additional inputs to Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) or by using them to search for informative past hidden states for prediction. However, such distance-based methods fail to capture the time-varying temporal regularities of human mobility, where human mobility is often more regular in the morning than in other periods, for example; this suggests the usefulness of the actual timestamps besides the temporal distances. Against this background, we propose REPLAY, a general RNN architecture learning to capture the time-varying temporal regularities for location prediction. Specifically, REPLAY not only resorts to the spatiotemporal distances in sparse trajectories to search for the informative past hidden states, but also accommodates the time-varying temporal regularities by incorporating smoothed timestamp embeddings using Gaussian weighted averaging with timestamp-specific learnable bandwidths, which can flexibly adapt to the temporal regularities of different strengths across different timestamps. Our extensive evaluation compares REPLAY against a sizable collection of state-of-the-art techniques on two real-world datasets. Results show that REPLAY consistently and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 7.7\%-10.5\% in the location prediction task, and the bandwidths reveal interesting patterns of the time-varying temporal regularities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing</p></details> |

Although safe reactive approaches have been proposed to ensure robot safety in complex environments, many base their theory off the assumption that the robot has prior knowledge on obstacle locations and geometries. In this paper, we present a real-time, vision-based framework that constructs continuous, first-order differentiable Signed Distance Fields (SDFs) of unknown environments without any pre-training. Our proposed method ensures full compatibility with established SDF-based reactive controllers. To achieve robust performance under practical sensing conditions, our approach explicitly accounts for noise in affordable RGB-D cameras, refining the neural SDF representation online for smoother geometry and stable gradient estimates. We validate the proposed method in simulation and real-world experiments using a Fetch robot.</p></details> |  |

However, base models face limitations, as they only contain the knowledge available at the time of training, and updating them is both time-consuming and costly. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged in the literature as the preferred approach for injecting contextual information into Foundation Models. It prevails over techniques such as fine-tuning, which are less effective in dynamic, real-time scenarios like those found in urban environments. However, traditional RAG architectures, based on semantic databases, knowledge graphs, structured data, or AI-powered web searches, do not fully meet the demands of urban contexts. Urban environments are complex systems characterized by large volumes of interconnected data, frequent updates, real-time processing requirements, security needs, and strong links to the physical world. This work proposes a real-time spatial RAG architecture that defines the necessary components for the effective integration of generative AI into cities, leveraging temporal and spatial filtering capabilities through linked data. The proposed architecture is implemented using FIWARE, an ecosystem of software components to develop smart city solutions and digital twins. The design and implementation are demonstrated through the use case of a tourism assistant in the city of Madrid. The use case serves to validate the correct integration of Foundation Models through the proposed RAG architecture.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient FPGA Implementation of Time-Domain Popcount for Low-Complexity Machine Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02181v1)** | 2025-05-04 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2505.02181v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Population count (popcount) is a crucial operation for many low-complexity machine learning (ML) algorithms, including Tsetlin Machine (TM)-a promising new ML method, particularly well-suited for solving classification tasks. The inference mechanism in TM consists of propositional logic-based structures within each class, followed by a majority voting scheme, which makes the classification decision. In TM, the voters are the outputs of Boolean clauses. The voting mechanism comprises two operations: popcount for each class and determining the class with the maximum vote by means of an argmax operation. While TMs offer a lightweight ML alternative, their performance is often limited by the high computational cost of popcount and comparison required to produce the argmax result. In this paper, we propose an innovative approach to accelerate and optimize these operations by performing them in the time domain. Our time-domain implementation uses programmable delay lines (PDLs) and arbiters to efficiently manage these tasks through delay-based mechanisms. We also present an FPGA design flow for practical implementation of the time-domain popcount, addressing delay skew and ensuring that the behavior matches that of the model's intended functionality. By leveraging the natural compatibility of the proposed popcount with asynchronous architectures, we demonstrate significant improvements in an asynchronous TM, including up to 38% reduction in latency, 43.1% reduction in dynamic power, and 15% savings in resource utilization, compared to synchronous TMs using adder-based popcount.</p></details> |  |

It is used in applications such as healthcare, finance, economics, energy, and climate science. Several time series clustering methods have been introduced and used for over four decades. Most of them focus on measuring either Euclidean distances or association dissimilarities between time series. In this work, we propose a new dissimilarity measure called ranked Pearson correlation dissimilarity (RDPC), which combines a weighted average of a specified fraction of the largest element-wise differences with the well-known Pearson correlation dissimilarity. It is incorporated into hierarchical clustering. The performance is evaluated and compared with existing clustering algorithms. The results show that the RDPC algorithm outperforms others in complicated cases involving different seasonal patterns, trends, and peaks. Finally, we demonstrate our method by clustering a random sample of customers from a Thai electricity consumption time series dataset into seven groups with unique characteristics.</p></details> | 17 pages |

Recent studies demonstrate that TTS can further elicit the problem-solving capabilities of large language models (LLMs), enabling significant breakthroughs not only in specialized reasoning tasks, such as mathematics and coding, but also in general tasks like open-ended Q&A. However, despite the explosion of recent efforts in this area, there remains an urgent need for a comprehensive survey offering a systemic understanding. To fill this gap, we propose a unified, multidimensional framework structured along four core dimensions of TTS research: what to scale, how to scale, where to scale, and how well to scale. Building upon this taxonomy, we conduct an extensive review of methods, application scenarios, and assessment aspects, and present an organized decomposition that highlights the unique functional roles of individual techniques within the broader TTS landscape. From this analysis, we distill the major developmental trajectories of TTS to date and offer hands-on guidelines for practical deployment. Furthermore, we identify several open challenges and offer insights into promising future directions, including further scaling, clarifying the functional essence of techniques, generalizing to more tasks, and more attributions.

We propose a novel Logic-Based Benders Decomposition (LBBD) that improves optimality gaps for all benchmarks in the literature and scales up to handle larger ones. To tackle even larger instances, we introduce a refined Large Neighborhood Search (LNS) algorithm that improves the adaptability of LNS beyond case-specific configurations appearing in related literature. To bridge the gap in benchmark availability, we develop an instance generator that allows for extensive experimentation. For moderate datasets (25 and 50 requests), we evaluate the performance of both LBBD and LNS, the former being able to close the gap and the latter capable of providing near-optimal solutions. For larger instances (75 and 100 requests), we recreate indicative state-of-the-art metaheuristics to highlight the improvements introduced by our LNS refinements, while establishing its scalability.</p></details> |  |

With advancements in large language models (LLMs), recent studies employ textual prompt tuning to infuse the knowledge of LLMs into MTSF. However, the deployment of LLMs often suffers from low efficiency during the inference phase. To address this problem, we introduce TimeKD, an efficient MTSF framework that leverages the calibrated language models and privileged knowledge distillation. TimeKD aims to generate high-quality future representations from the proposed cross-modality teacher model and cultivate an effective student model. The cross-modality teacher model adopts calibrated language models (CLMs) with ground truth prompts, motivated by the paradigm of Learning Under Privileged Information (LUPI). In addition, we design a subtractive cross attention (SCA) mechanism to refine these representations. To cultivate an effective student model, we propose an innovative privileged knowledge distillation (PKD) mechanism including correlation and feature distillation. PKD enables the student to replicate the teacher's behavior while minimizing their output discrepancy. Extensive experiments on real data offer insight into the effectiveness, efficiency, and scalability of the proposed TimeKD.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICDE 2025</p></details> |

In this paper, five data augmentation-based defense methods tailored for time series are developed, with the most computationally intensive method among them increasing the computational resources by only 14.07% compared to the original TSC model. Moreover, the deployment process for these methods is straightforward. By leveraging these advantages of our methods, we create two combined methods. One of these methods is an ensemble of all the proposed techniques, which not only provides better defense performance than PGD-based AT but also enhances the generalization ability of TSC models. Moreover, the computational resources required for our ensemble are less than one-third of those required for PGD-based AT. These methods advance robust TSC in data mining.

In this paper, we present a time scheduler that selects sampling points based on entropy rather than uniform time spacing, ensuring that each point contributes an equal amount of information to the final generation. We prove that this time reparameterization does not depend on the initial choice of time. Furthermore, we provide a tractable exact formula to estimate this \emph{entropic time} for a trained model using the training loss without substantial overhead. Alongside the entropic time, inspired by the optimality results, we introduce a rescaled entropic time. In our experiments with mixtures of Gaussian distributions and ImageNet, we show that using the (rescaled) entropic times greatly improves the inference performance of trained models. In particular, we found that the image quality in pretrained EDM2 models, as evaluated by FID and FD-DINO scores, can be substantially increased by the rescaled entropic time reparameterization without increasing the number of function evaluations, with greater improvements in the few NFEs regime.</p></details> | 17 pages |

However, current benchmarks inadequately evaluate their ability to perform these tasks continuously in dynamic, real-world environments. To bridge this gap, we introduce RTV-Bench, a fine-grained benchmark for MLLM real-time video analysis. RTV-Bench uses three key principles: (1) Multi-Timestamp Question Answering (MTQA), where answers evolve with scene changes; (2) Hierarchical Question Structure, combining basic and advanced queries; and (3) Multi-dimensional Evaluation, assessing the ability of continuous perception, understanding, and reasoning. RTV-Bench contains 552 diverse videos (167.2 hours) and 4,631 high-quality QA pairs. We evaluated leading MLLMs, including proprietary (GPT-4o, Gemini 2.0), open-source offline (Qwen2.5-VL, VideoLLaMA3), and open-source real-time (VITA-1.5, InternLM-XComposer2.5-OmniLive) models. Experiment results show open-source real-time models largely outperform offline ones but still trail top proprietary models. Our analysis also reveals that larger model size or higher frame sampling rates do not significantly boost RTV-Bench performance, sometimes causing slight decreases. This underscores the need for better model architectures optimized for video stream processing and long sequences to advance real-time video analysis with MLLMs. Our benchmark toolkit is available at: https://github.com/LJungang/RTV-Bench.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 4 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

However, previous studies still have limitations in time complexity, computational resources, and cross-dimensional interactions. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel CNN Autoencoder-based Score Attention mechanism (CASA), which can be introduced in diverse Transformers model-agnosticically by reducing memory and leading to improvement in model performance. Experiments on eight real-world datasets validate that CASA decreases computational resources by up to 77.7%, accelerates inference by 44.0%, and achieves state-of-the-art performance, ranking first in 87.5% of evaluated metrics.</p></details> |  |

Transformer-based SRS have achieved distinguished successes recently. However, studies reveal self-attention mechanism in Transformer-based models is essentially a low-pass filter and ignores high frequency information potentially including meaningful user interest patterns. This motivates us to seek better filtering technologies for SRS, and finally we find Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT), a famous time-frequency analysis technique from digital signal processing field, can effectively process both low-frequency and high-frequency information. We design an adaptive time-frequency filter with DWT technique, which decomposes user interests into multiple signals with different frequency and time, and can automatically learn weights of these signals. Furthermore, we develop DWTRec, a model for sequential recommendation all based on the adaptive time-frequency filter. Thanks to fast DWT technique, DWTRec has a lower time complexity and space complexity theoretically, and is Proficient in modeling long sequences. Experiments show that our model outperforms state-of-the-art baseline models in datasets with different domains, sparsity levels and average sequence lengths. Especially, our model shows great performance increase in contrast with previous models when the sequence grows longer, which demonstrates another advantage of our model.</p></details> | <details><summary>17pag...</summary><p>17pages, accepted by ICIC 2025 oral</p></details> |

To accurately identify causal connectivity for such specified objectives, it is necessary to properly address the influence of all other nodes within the network. The proposed procedure herein starts with the estimation of a low-dimensional representation of the other nodes in the network utilizing (frequency-domain-based) spectral dynamic principal component analysis (sDPCA). The resulting scores can then be removed from the nodes of interest, thus eliminating the confounding effect of other nodes within the HDN. Accordingly, causal interactions can be dissected between nodes that are isolated from the effects of the network. Extensive simulations have demonstrated the effectiveness of this approach as a tool for causality analysis in complex time series networks. The proposed methodology has also been shown to be applicable to multichannel EEG networks.</p></details> |  |

In real practice, the sensor network may suffer from communication and/or sensor failures. This might be due to cyber-attacks, faults, or environmental conditions. Distributed estimation resilient to such conditions is the topic of this paper. By representing the sensor network as a graph and exploiting its inherent structural properties, we introduce novel techniques that enhance the robustness of distributed estimators. As compared to the literature, the proposed estimator (i) relaxes the network connectivity of most existing single time-scale estimators and (ii) reduces the communication load of the existing double time-scale estimators by avoiding the inner consensus loop. On the other hand, the sensors might be subject to faults or attacks, resulting in biased measurements. Removing these sensor data may result in observability loss. Therefore, we propose resilient design on the definitions of $q$-node-connectivity and $q$-link-connectivity, which capture robust strong-connectivity under link or sensor node failure. By proper design of the sensor network, we prove Schur stability of the proposed distributed estimation protocol under failure of up to $q$ sensors or $q$ communication links.</p></details> | IEEE TNSE 2025 |

Recent studies have explored compact, head-worn devices for HR and HRV monitoring to improve usability and reduce stigma. However, this approach is challenged by the current reliance on wet electrodes, which limits usability, the weakness of ear-derived signals, making HR/HRV extraction more complex, and the incompatibility of current algorithms for embedded deployment. This work introduces a single-ear wearable system for real-time ECG (Electrocardiogram) parameter estimation, which directly runs on BioGAP, an energy-efficient device for biosignal acquisition and processing. By combining SoA in-ear electrode technology, an optimized DeepMF algorithm, and BioGAP, our proposed subject-independent approach allows for robust extraction of HR/HRV parameters directly on the device with just 36.7 uJ/inference at comparable performance with respect to the current state-of-the-art architecture, achieving 0.49 bpm and 25.82 ms for HR/HRV mean errors, respectively and an estimated battery life of 36h with a total system power consumption of 7.6 mW. Clinical relevance: The ability to reconstruct ECG signals and extract HR and HRV paves the way for continuous, unobtrusive cardiovascular monitoring with head-worn devices. In particular, the integration of cardiovascular measurements in everyday-use devices (such as earbuds) has potential in continuous at-home monitoring to enable early detection of cardiovascular irregularities.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 7 figures, to be published in IEEE EMBC conference</p></details> |

While it improves reliability by providing factual texts, it significantly increases inference costs as context length grows and introduces challenging issue of RAG hallucination, primarily caused by the lack of corresponding parametric knowledge in LLMs. An efficient solution is to enhance the knowledge of LLMs at test-time. Parametric RAG (PRAG) addresses this by embedding document into LLMs parameters to perform test-time knowledge enhancement, effectively reducing inference costs through offline training. However, its high training and storage costs, along with limited generalization ability, significantly restrict its practical adoption. To address these challenges, we propose Dynamic Parametric RAG (DyPRAG), a novel framework that leverages a lightweight parameter translator model to efficiently convert documents into parametric knowledge. DyPRAG not only reduces inference, training, and storage costs but also dynamically generates parametric knowledge, seamlessly enhancing the knowledge of LLMs and resolving knowledge conflicts in a plug-and-play manner at test-time. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization capabilities of DyPRAG, offering a powerful and practical RAG paradigm which enables superior knowledge fusion and mitigates RAG hallucination in real-world applications.

To address this issue, we developed an AI-based speaking assistant (AISA) that provides speaking references for NNSs based on their input queries, task background, and conversation history. To explore NNSs' interaction with AISA and its impact on NNSs' speaking during real-time multilingual communication, we conducted a mixed-method study involving a within-subject experiment and follow-up interviews. In the experiment, two native speakers (NSs) and one NNS formed a team (31 teams in total) and completed two collaborative tasks--one with access to the AISA and one without. Overall, our study revealed four types of AISA input patterns among NNSs, each reflecting different levels of effort and language preferences. Although AISA did not improve NNSs' speaking competence, follow-up interviews revealed that it helped improve the logical flow and depth of their speech. Moreover, the additional multitasking introduced by AISA, such as entering and reviewing system output, potentially elevated NNSs' workload and anxiety. Based on these observations, we discuss the pros and cons of implementing tools to assist NNS in real-time multilingual communication and offer design recommendations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACM CSCW 2025</p></details> |

To address these challenges and enhance predictive accuracy, this study introduces a hybrid forecasting framework that integrates the Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Inference System (IT2FIS) with the GARCH model. Leveraging the interval-based uncertainty representation of IT2FIS and the volatility-capturing capability of GARCH, the proposed model effectively mitigates the adverse impact of heteroskedasticity on prediction reliability. Specifically, the GARCH component estimates conditional variance, which is subsequently incorporated into the Gaussian membership functions of IT2FIS. This integration transforms IT2FIS into an adaptive variable-parameter system, dynamically aligning with the time-varying volatility of the target series. Through systematic parameter optimization, the framework not only captures intricate volatility patterns but also accounts for heteroskedasticity and epistemic uncertainties during modeling, thereby improving both prediction precision and model robustness. Experimental validation employs diverse datasets, including air quality concentration, urban traffic flow, and energy consumption. Comparative analyses are conducted against models: the GARCH-Takagi-Sugeno-Kang (GARCH-TSK) model, fixed-variance time series models, the GARCH-Gated Recurrent Unit (GARCH-GRU), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. The results indicate that the proposed model achieves superior predictive performance across the majority of test scenarios in error metrics. These findings underscore the effectiveness of hybrid approaches in forecasting uncertainty for GARCH-type time series, highlighting their practical utility in real-world time series forecasting applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>40 pa...</summary><p>40 pages, 13 figures, references added</p></details> |

For temperature-linked strangles in Toronto and Chicago, we benchmark a harmonic-regression/ARMA model against a feed-forward neural network (NN), finding that the NN reduces out-of-sample mean-squared error (MSE) and materially shifts December fair values relative to both the time-series model and the industry-standard Historic Burn Approach (HBA). For precipitation, we employ a compound Poisson--Gamma framework: shape and scale parameters are estimated via maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) and via a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained on 30-day rainfall sequences spanning multiple seasons. The CNN adaptively learns season-specific $(\alpha,\beta)$ mappings, thereby capturing heterogeneity across regimes that static i.i.d.\ fits miss. At valuation, we assume days are i.i.d.\ $\Gamma(\hat{\alpha},\hat{\beta})$ within each regime and apply a mean-count approximation (replacing the Poisson count by its mean ($n\hat{\lambda}$) to derive closed-form strangle prices. Exploratory analysis of 1981--2023 NASA POWER data confirms pronounced seasonal heterogeneity in $(\alpha,\beta)$ between summer and winter, demonstrating that static global fits are inadequate. Back-testing on Toronto and Chicago grids shows that our regime-adaptive CNN yields competitive valuations and underscores how model choice can shift strangle prices. Payoffs are evaluated analytically when possible and by simulation elsewhere, enabling a like-for-like comparison of forecasting and valuation methods.</p></details> | 23 pages, 31 figures |

Contrary to conventional single bit quantizers which only utilize the transmitted bit to convey information, in our codebook, we use an additional `$\emptyset$' symbol to encode the event of \emph{not transmitting}. Thus, our quantization functions are composed of three decision regions as opposed to the conventional two regions. First, we propose an optimum quantization method in which the optimum quantization functions are obtained by tracking the distributions of the quantization error. However, this method requires a high computational cost and might not be applicable for energy-conserving sensors. Thus, we propose two additional low complexity methods. In the last-bit aware method, three predefined quantization functions are available to both devices, and they switch the quantization function based on the last transmitted bit. With the Gaussian approximation method, we calculate a single quantization function by assuming that the quantization error can be approximated as Gaussian. While previous methods require a constant delay assumption, this method also works for random delay. We observe that all three methods perform similarly in terms of mean-squared error and transmission cost.</p></details> |  |

A Study on Water Level Forecasting in Everglades](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01415v1)** | 2025-05-02 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2505.01415v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Everglades play a crucial role in flood and drought regulation, water resource planning, and ecosystem management in the surrounding regions. However, traditional physics-based and statistical methods for predicting water levels often face significant challenges, including high computational costs and limited adaptability to diverse or unforeseen conditions. Recent advancements in large time series models have demonstrated the potential to address these limitations, with state-of-the-art deep learning and foundation models achieving remarkable success in time series forecasting across various domains. Despite this progress, their application to critical environmental systems, such as the Everglades, remains underexplored. In this study, we fill the gap by investigating twelve task-specific models and five time series foundation models across six categories for a real-world application focused on water level prediction in the Everglades. Our primary results show that the foundation model, Chronos, significantly outperforms all other models while the remaining foundation models exhibit relatively poor performance. Moreover, the performance of task-specific models varies with the model architectures. Lastly, we discuss the possible reasons for the varying performance of models.</p></details> |  |

Performing tasks in such environments requires swarms to achieve autonomous localization, perception, decision-making, control, and planning. The limited computational resources of onboard platforms present significant challenges for planning and control. Reactive planners offer low computational demands and high re-planning frequencies but lack predictive capabilities, often resulting in local minima. Long-horizon planners, on the other hand, can perform multi-step predictions to reduce deadlocks but cost much computation, leading to lower re-planning frequencies. This paper proposes a real-time optimal virtual tube planning method for swarm robotics in unknown environments, which generates approximate solutions for optimal trajectories through affine functions. As a result, the computational complexity of approximate solutions is $O(n_t)$, where $n_t$ is the number of parameters in the trajectory, thereby significantly reducing the overall computational burden. By integrating reactive methods, the proposed method enables low-computation, safe swarm motion in unknown environments. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated through several simulations and experiments.</p></details> | 18 pages, 21 figures |

Heart rate data has shown promise in assessing patient health, and wearable devices offer a cost-effective solution for real-time monitoring. However, extracting meaningful insights from diverse heart rate data and handling missing values in wearable device data remain key challenges. To address these challenges, we propose TARL, an innovative approach that models the structural relationships of representative subsequences, known as shapelets, in heart rate time series. TARL creates a shapelet-transition knowledge graph to model shapelet dynamics in heart rate time series, indicating illness progression and potential future changes. We further introduce a transition-aware knowledge embedding to reinforce relationships among shapelets and quantify the impact of missing values, enabling the formulation of comprehensive heart rate representations. These representations capture explanatory structures and predict future heart rate trends, aiding early illness detection. We collaborate with physicians and nurses to gather ICU patient heart rate data from wearables and diagnostic metrics assessing illness severity for evaluating deterioration. Experiments on real-world ICU data demonstrate that TARL achieves both high reliability and early detection. A case study further showcases TARL's explainable detection process, highlighting its potential as an AI-driven tool to assist clinicians in recognizing early signs of patient deterioration.</p></details> |  |

We first formulate the involved Least Squares (LS) problem and discuss the need for regularization, indicating a connection between the typically employed $l_2$ regularization and the stability of the inferred discrete-time sFOM. We then provide theoretical insights considering the consistency and stability properties of the inferred numerical schemes that form the sFOM and exemplify them via illustrative, 1D test cases of linear diffusion and linear advection. For linear advection, we analytically derive a "sampling CFL" condition, which dictates a bound for the ratio of spatial and temporal discretization steps in the training data that ensures stability of the inferred sFOM. Finally, we investigate the sFOM inference for two nonlinear problems, namely a 2D Burgers' test case and the incompressible flow in an oscillating lid driven cavity, and draw connections between the theoretical findings and the properties of the inferred, nonlinear sFOMs.</p></details> |  |

The population model is a well-established and powerful model for asynchronous, distributed computation with a large number of applications. For self-stabilizing leader election, the population of $n$ anonymous agents, interacting in uniformly random pairs, must stabilize with a single leader from any possible initial configuration. The focus of this paper is to develop time-efficient self-stabilizing protocols whilst minimizing the number of states. We present a parametrized protocol, which, for a suitable setting, achieves the asymptotically optimal time $O(\log n)$ using $2^{O(n^2\log n)}$ states (throughout the paper, ``time'' refers to ``parallel time'', i.e., the number of pairwise interactions divided by $n$). This is a significant improvement over the previously best protocol Sublinear-Time-SSR due to Burman, Chen, Chen, Doty, Nowak, Severson, and Xu (PODC '21), which requires $2^{O(n^{\log n}\log n)}$ states for the same time bound. In general, for $1\le r\le n/2$, our protocol requires $2^{O(r^2\log{n})}$ states and stabilizes in time $O((n\log{n})/r)$, w.h.p.; the above result is achieved for $r=\Theta(n)$. For $r=\log^2n$ our protocol requires only sub-linear time using only $2^{O(\log^3 n)}$ states, resolving an open problem stated in that paper. Sublinear-Time-SSR requires $O(\log n\cdot n^{1/(H+1)})$ time using $2^{\Theta(n^H) \cdot \log n}$ states for all $1\le H\le\Theta(\log n)$. Similar to previous works, it solves leader election by assigning a unique rank from $1$ through $n$ to each agent. The principal bottleneck for self-stabilizing ranking usually is to detect if there exist agents with the same rank. One of our main conceptual contributions is a novel technique for collision detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be published at PODC'25</p></details> |

To address this deficiency, we present (binary) Timeout Asynchronous Session Types (TOAST) as an extension to (binary) asynchronous timed session types, that permits mixed-choice. TOAST deploys timing constraints to regulate the use of mixed-choice so as to preserve communication safety. We provide a new behavioural semantics for TOAST which guarantees progress in the presence of mixed-choice. Building upon TOAST, we provide a calculus featuring process timers which is capable of modelling timeouts using a receive-after pattern, much like Erlang, and capture the correspondence with TOAST specifications via a type system for which we prove subject reduction.</p></details> | <details><summary>65 pa...</summary><p>65 pages, revised for LMCS (round 2)</p></details> |

Unsupervised learning methods have become popular because they have no requirement for labels. However, due to the challenges posed by the multiplicity of abnormal patterns, the sparsity of anomalies, and the growth of data scale and complexity, these methods often fail to capture robust and representative dependencies within the time series for identifying anomalies. To enhance the ability of models to capture normal patterns of time series and avoid the retrogression of modeling ability triggered by the dependencies on high-quality prior knowledge, we propose a differencing-based contrastive representation learning framework for time series anomaly detection (DConAD). Specifically, DConAD generates differential data to provide additional information about time series and utilizes transformer-based architecture to capture spatiotemporal dependencies, which enhances the robustness of unbiased representation learning ability. Furthermore, DConAD implements a novel KL divergence-based contrastive learning paradigm that only uses positive samples to avoid deviation from reconstruction and deploys the stop-gradient strategy to compel convergence. Extensive experiments on five public datasets show the superiority and effectiveness of DConAD compared with nine baselines. The code is available at https://github.com/shaieesss/DConAD.</p></details> |  |

It can be distilled into a \emph{two-timed flow model} (TTFM) $\phi_{s,x}(t)$ that can transform a sample belonging to the distribution at an initial time $s$ to another belonging to the distribution at a terminal time $t$ in one function evaluation. We present a new loss function for TTFM distillation called the \emph{initial/terminal velocity matching} (ITVM) loss that extends the Lagrangian Flow Map Distillation (LFMD) loss proposed by Boffi et al. by adding redundant terms to match the initial velocities at time $s$, removing the derivative from the terminal velocity term at time $t$, and using a version of the model under training, stabilized by exponential moving averaging (EMA), to compute the target terminal average velocity. Preliminary experiments show that our loss leads to better few-step generation performance on multiple types of datasets and model architectures over baselines.</p></details> |  |

This study provides an empirical comparison between a Polynomial Classifier and a Radial Basis Function Neural Network (RBFNN) across four real-world time series datasets (weather conditions, gold prices, crude oil prices, and beer production volumes) that cover both seasonal and nonseasonal patterns. Model performance is evaluated by forecasting accuracy (using Mean Absolute Error, Root Mean Squared Error, and Coefficient of Variation of Root Mean Squared Error) and computational time to assess each model's viability for real time forecasting. The results show that the PC yields more accurate and faster forecasts for non seasonal series, whereas the RBFNN performs better on series with pronounced seasonal patterns. From an interpretability standpoint, the polynomial model offers a simpler, more transparent structure (in contrast to the black box nature of neural network), which is advantageous for understanding and trust in real time decision making. The performance differences between PC and RBFNN are statistically significant, as confirmed by paired t tests and Wilcoxon signed rank tests. These findings provide practical guidance for model selection in time series forecasting, indicating that PC may be preferable for quick, interpretable forecasts in non-seasonal contexts, whereas RBFNN is superior for capturing complex seasonal behaviors</p></details> |  |

To tackle it by smart planning, the availability of highly resolved heating demand data is key. Several existing models provide heating demand only for specific applications. Typically, they either offer time series for a larger area or annual demand data on a building level, but not both simultaneously. Additionally, the diversity in heating demand across different buildings is often not considered. To address these limitations, this paper presents a novel method for generating temporally resolved heat demand time series at the building level using publicly available data. The approach integrates a thermal building model with stochastic occupancy simulations that account for variability in user behavior. As a result, the tool serves as a cost-effective resource for cross-sectoral energy system planning and policy development, particularly with a focus on the heating sector. The obtained data can be used to assess the impact of renovation and retrofitting strategies, or to analyze district heating expansion. To illustrate the potential applications of this approach, we conducted a case study in Puertollano (Spain), where we prepared a dataset of heating demand with hourly resolution for each of 9,298 residential buildings. This data was then used to compare two different pathways for the thermal renovation of these buildings. By relying on publicly available data, this method can be adapted and applied to various European regions, offering broad usability in energy system optimization and analysis of decarbonization strategies.</p></details> |  |

Recent studies have revealed that multimodal models can address the core issue by integrating textual information. However, these models focus on either historical or future textual information, overlooking the unique contributions each plays in time series forecasting. Besides, these models fail to grasp the intricate relationships between textual and time series data, constrained by their moderate capacity for multimodal comprehension. To tackle these challenges, we propose Dual-Forecaster, a pioneering multimodal time series model that combines both descriptively historical textual information and predictive textual insights, leveraging advanced multimodal comprehension capability empowered by three well-designed cross-modality alignment techniques. Our comprehensive evaluations on fifteen multimodal time series datasets demonstrate that Dual-Forecaster is a distinctly effective multimodal time series model that outperforms or is comparable to other state-of-the-art models, highlighting the superiority of integrating textual information for time series forecasting. This work opens new avenues in the integration of textual information with numerical time series data for multimodal time series analysis.</p></details> |  |

Sophisticated approaches employ issue tracking systems like Jira, predicting the time required to resolve issues and effectively assigning and prioritizing project tasks. Several methods have been developed to address this challenge, widely known as bug-fix time prediction, yet they exhibit significant limitations. Most consider only textual issue data and/or use techniques that overlook the semantics and metadata of issues (e.g., priority or assignee expertise). Many also fail to distinguish actual development effort from administrative delays, including assignment and review phases, leading to estimates that do not reflect the true effort needed. In this work, we build an issue monitoring system that extracts the actual effort required to fix issues on a per-project basis. Our approach employs topic modeling to capture issue semantics and leverages metadata (components, labels, priority, issue type, assignees) for interpretable resolution time analysis. Final predictions are generated by an aggregated model, enabling contributors to make informed decisions. Evaluation across multiple projects shows the system can effectively estimate resolution time and provide valuable insights.</p></details> |  |

While achieving optimal accuracy, existing CTTA approaches present poor real-world applicability on resource-constrained edge devices, due to the substantial memory overhead and energy consumption. In this work, we first introduce a novel paradigm -- on-demand TTA -- which triggers adaptation only when a significant domain shift is detected. Then, we present OD-TTA, an on-demand TTA framework for accurate and efficient adaptation on edge devices. OD-TTA comprises three innovative techniques: 1) a lightweight domain shift detection mechanism to activate TTA only when it is needed, drastically reducing the overall computation overhead, 2) a source domain selection module that chooses an appropriate source model for adaptation, ensuring high and robust accuracy, 3) a decoupled Batch Normalization (BN) update scheme to enable memory-efficient adaptation with small batch sizes. Extensive experiments show that OD-TTA achieves comparable and even better performance while reducing the energy and computation overhead remarkably, making TTA a practical reality.</p></details> |  |

However, rapid advancements have produced a diversity of seemingly unrelated architectures, such as Transformers and recurrent alternatives. In this paper, we introduce a unifying framework to understand and derive these sequence models, inspired by the empirical importance of associative recall, the capability to retrieve contextually relevant tokens. We formalize associative recall as a two-step process, memorization and retrieval, casting memorization as a regression problem. Layers that combine these two steps perform associative recall via ``test-time regression'' over its input tokens. Prominent layers, including linear attention, state-space models, fast-weight programmers, online learners, and softmax attention, arise as special cases defined by three design choices: the regression weights, the regressor function class, and the test-time optimization algorithm. Our approach clarifies how linear attention fails to capture inter-token correlations and offers a mathematical justification for the empirical effectiveness of query-key normalization in softmax attention. Further, it illuminates unexplored regions within the design space, which we use to derive novel higher-order generalizations of softmax attention. Beyond unification, our work bridges sequence modeling with classic regression methods, a field with extensive literature, paving the way for developing more powerful and theoretically principled architectures.</p></details> |  |

However, for most reconstruction-based approaches, detecting anomalies remains a challenge due to the complexity of sequential patterns in time series data. On the one hand, reconstruction-based techniques are susceptible to computational deviation stemming from anomalies, which can lead to impure representations of normal sequence patterns. On the other hand, they often focus on the time-domain dependencies of time series, while ignoring the alignment of frequency information beyond the time domain. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Frequency-augmented Convolutional Transformer (FreCT). FreCT utilizes patch operations to generate contrastive views and employs an improved Transformer architecture integrated with a convolution module to capture long-term dependencies while preserving local topology information. The introduced frequency analysis based on Fourier transformation could enhance the model's ability to capture crucial characteristics beyond the time domain. To protect the training quality from anomalies and improve the robustness, FreCT deploys stop-gradient Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence and absolute error to optimize consistency information in both time and frequency domains. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate that FreCT outperforms existing methods in identifying anomalies.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we obtain a number of sharp lower bound results which show that adaptivity provides a significant extra power in cryptanalytic time-space tradeoffs with (possibly unlimited) preprocessing time. Most notably, we consider the discrete logarithm (DLOG) problem in a generic group of $N$ elements. The classical `baby-step giant-step' algorithm for the problem has time complexity $T=O(\sqrt{N})$, uses $O(\sqrt{N})$ bits of space (up to logarithmic factors in $N$) and achieves constant success probability. We examine a generalized setting where an algorithm obtains an advice string of $S$ bits and is allowed to make $T$ arbitrary non-adaptive queries that depend on the advice string (but not on the challenge group element). We show that in this setting, the $T=O(\sqrt{N})$ online time complexity of the baby-step giant-step algorithm cannot be improved, unless the advice string is more than $\Omega(\sqrt{N})$ bits long. This lies in stark contrast with the classical adaptive Pollard's rho algorithm for DLOG, which can exploit preprocessing to obtain the tradeoff curve $ST^2=O(N)$. We obtain similar sharp lower bounds for several other cryptanalytic problems. To obtain our results, we present a new model that allows analyzing non-adaptive preprocessing algorithms for a wide array of search and decision problems in a unified way. Since previous proof techniques inherently cannot distinguish between adaptive and non-adaptive algorithms for the problems in our model, they cannot be used to obtain our results. Consequently, our proof uses a variant of Shearer's lemma for this setting, due to Barthe, Cordero-Erausquin, Ledoux, and Maurey (2011). This seems to be the first time a variant of Shearer's lemma for permutations is used in an algorithmic context.</p></details> |  |

Real-world scenarios often involve diverse and complex time patterns, which pose significant challenges for time encoding methods. While previous methods focus on capturing time patterns, many rely on specific inductive biases, such as using trigonometric functions to model periodicity. This narrow focus on single-pattern modeling makes them less effective in handling the diversity and complexities of real-world time patterns. In this paper, we investigate to improve the existing commonly used time encoding methods and introduce Learnable Transformation-based Generalized Time Encoding (LeTE). We propose using deep function learning techniques to parameterize non-linear transformations in time encoding, making them learnable and capable of modeling generalized time patterns, including diverse and complex temporal dynamics. By enabling learnable transformations, LeTE encompasses previous methods as specific cases and allows seamless integration into a wide range of tasks. Through extensive experiments across diverse domains, we demonstrate the versatility and effectiveness of LeTE.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, 13 figures, 10 tables</p></details> |

Being an effective strategy, while caging configuration-based manipulation frameworks have successfully provided robust solutions, they are not broadly applicable due to their strict requirements on the availability of multiple robots, widely distributed contacts, or specific geometries of robots or objects. Building upon previous sensorless manipulation ideas and uncertainty handling approaches, this work proposes a novel framework termed Caging in Time to allow caging configurations to be formed even with one robot engaged in a task. This concept leverages the insight that while caging requires constraining the object's motion, only part of the cage actively contacts the object at any moment. As such, by strategically switching the end-effector configuration and collapsing it in time, we form a cage with its necessary portion active whenever needed. We instantiate our approach on challenging quasi-static and dynamic manipulation tasks, showing that Caging in Time can be achieved in general cage formulations including geometry-based and energy-based cages. With extensive experiments, we show robust and accurate manipulation, in an open-loop manner, without requiring detailed knowledge of the object geometry or physical properties, or real-time accurate feedback on the manipulation states. In addition to being an effective and robust open-loop manipulation solution, Caging in Time can be a supplementary strategy to other manipulation systems affected by uncertain or limited robot perception.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 26 figures, video available at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ag_jTzazuSM</p></details> |

A crucial component in developing a reliable prediction model is collecting high-quality time series clinical events. In this work, we release such a dataset that consists of 22,588,586 Clinical Time Series events, which we term MIMIC-\RNum{4}-Ext-22MCTS. Our source data are discharge summaries selected from the well-known yet unstructured MIMIC-IV-Note \cite{Johnson2023-pg}. We then extract clinical events as short text span from the discharge summaries, along with the timestamps of these events as temporal information. The general-purpose MIMIC-IV-Note pose specific challenges for our work: it turns out that the discharge summaries are too lengthy for typical natural language models to process, and the clinical events of interest often are not accompanied with explicit timestamps. Therefore, we propose a new framework that works as follows: 1) we break each discharge summary into manageably small text chunks; 2) we apply contextual BM25 and contextual semantic search to retrieve chunks that have a high potential of containing clinical events; and 3) we carefully design prompts to teach the recently released Llama-3.1-8B \cite{touvron2023llama} model to identify or infer temporal information of the chunks. We show that the obtained dataset is so informative and transparent that standard models fine-tuned on our dataset are achieving significant improvements in healthcare applications. In particular, the BERT model fine-tuned based on our dataset achieves 10\% improvement in accuracy on medical question answering task, and 3\% improvement in clinical trial matching task compared with the classic BERT. The GPT-2 model, fine-tuned on our dataset, produces more clinically reliable results for clinical questions.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces a novel system, which we call Mirror of Diversity (MOD), that combines Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for texture manipulation and 3D Morphable Models (3DMMs) for facial geometry to achieve realistic face transformations that reflect various demographic characteristics, emphasizing the beauty of diversity and the universality of human features. As participants sit in front of a computer monitor with a camera positioned above, their facial characteristics are captured in real time and can further alter their digital face reconstruction with transformations reflecting different demographic characteristics, such as gender and ethnicity (e.g., a person from Africa, Asia, Europe). Another feature of our system, which we call Collective Face, generates an averaged face representation from multiple participants' facial data. A comprehensive evaluation protocol is implemented to assess the realism and demographic accuracy of the transformations. Qualitative feedback is gathered through participant questionnaires, which include comparisons of MOD transformations with similar filters on platforms like Snapchat and TikTok. Additionally, quantitative analysis is conducted using a pretrained Convolutional Neural Network that predicts gender and ethnicity, to validate the accuracy of demographic transformations.</p></details> |  |

Understanding webpages is challenging due to the visual complexity of GUI images and the large number of interface elements, making accurate action selection difficult. Our approach dynamically zooms in on relevant regions, reducing background clutter and improving grounding accuracy. To support this process, we propose an image-as-map mechanism that visualizes key landmarks at each step, providing a transparent action record and enables the agent to effectively choose among action candidates. Even with a simple region selection strategy, we observe significant performance gains of 28+\% on Screenspot-pro and 24+\% on WebVoyager benchmarks on top of two state-of-the-art open vision language model agents, UI-TARS and Qwen2.5-VL, highlighting the effectiveness of visual test-time scaling in interactive settings. We achieve a new state-of-the-art grounding performance of 61.6\% on the ScreenSpot-Pro benchmark by applying RegionFocus to a Qwen2.5-VL-72B model. Our code will be released publicly at https://github.com/tiangeluo/RegionFocus.</p></details> |  |

While diffusion models have shown promise in planning, they are limited to solving tasks similar to those seen in their training data. We propose CompDiffuser, a novel generative approach that can solve new tasks by learning to compositionally stitch together shorter trajectory chunks from previously seen tasks. Our key insight is modeling the trajectory distribution by subdividing it into overlapping chunks and learning their conditional relationships through a single bidirectional diffusion model. This allows information to propagate between segments during generation, ensuring physically consistent connections. We conduct experiments on benchmark tasks of various difficulties, covering different environment sizes, agent state dimension, trajectory types, training data quality, and show that CompDiffuser significantly outperforms existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://comp-diffuser.github.io/</p></details> |

We implement these innovations in an open-source solver and present simulation examples to support the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Although direct trajectory optimization is widely applied to solve this problem, inappropriate parameterizations of rigid body dynamics often result in slow convergence and violations of the intrinsic topological structure of the rotation group. This paper introduces a Riemannian optimization framework for direct trajectory optimization of rigid bodies. We first use the Lie Group Variational Integrator to formulate the discrete rigid body dynamics on matrix Lie groups. We then derive the closed-form first- and second-order Riemannian derivatives of the dynamics. Finally, this work applies a line-search Riemannian Interior Point Method (RIPM) to perform trajectory optimization with general nonlinear constraints. As the optimization is performed on matrix Lie groups, it is correct-by-construction to respect the topological structure of the rotation group and be free of singularities. The paper demonstrates that both the derivative evaluations and Newton steps required to solve the RIPM exhibit linear complexity with respect to the planning horizon and system degrees of freedom. Simulation results illustrate that the proposed method is faster than conventional methods by an order of magnitude in challenging robotics tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Robotics: Science and Systems (RSS) 2025</p></details> |

To tackle the intrinsic sparsity issue of real-world user mobility traces, spatiotemporal contexts have been shown as significantly useful. Existing solutions mostly incorporate spatiotemporal distances between locations in mobility traces, either by feeding them as additional inputs to Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) or by using them to search for informative past hidden states for prediction. However, such distance-based methods fail to capture the time-varying temporal regularities of human mobility, where human mobility is often more regular in the morning than in other periods, for example; this suggests the usefulness of the actual timestamps besides the temporal distances. Against this background, we propose REPLAY, a general RNN architecture learning to capture the time-varying temporal regularities for location prediction. Specifically, REPLAY not only resorts to the spatiotemporal distances in sparse trajectories to search for the informative past hidden states, but also accommodates the time-varying temporal regularities by incorporating smoothed timestamp embeddings using Gaussian weighted averaging with timestamp-specific learnable bandwidths, which can flexibly adapt to the temporal regularities of different strengths across different timestamps. Our extensive evaluation compares REPLAY against a sizable collection of state-of-the-art techniques on two real-world datasets. Results show that REPLAY consistently and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 7.7\%-10.5\% in the location prediction task, and the bandwidths reveal interesting patterns of the time-varying temporal regularities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing</p></details> |

Traditional modular methods suffer from error propagation, while existing end-to-end models typically employ static one-shot inference paradigms that inadequately capture the dynamic changes of the environment. ARTEMIS takes a different method by generating trajectory waypoints sequentially, preserves critical temporal dependencies while dynamically routing scene-specific queries to specialized expert networks. It effectively relieves trajectory quality degradation issues encountered when guidance information is ambiguous, and overcomes the inherent representational limitations of singular network architectures when processing diverse driving scenarios. Additionally, we use a lightweight batch reallocation strategy that significantly improves the training speed of the Mixture-of-Experts model. Through experiments on the NAVSIM dataset, ARTEMIS exhibits superior competitive performance, achieving 87.0 PDMS and 83.1 EPDMS with ResNet-34 backbone, demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on multiple metrics.</p></details> |  |

Directly mapping camera data to actions via neural networks can result in jerky motions and difficulties in meeting critical constraints, compromising safety and robustness in real-world deployment. For tasks that require high robustness or strict adherence to constraints, ensuring trajectory quality is crucial. However, the lack of interpretability in neural networks makes it challenging to generate constraint-compliant actions in a controlled manner. This paper introduces differentiable policy trajectory optimization with generalizability (DiffOG), a learning-based trajectory optimization framework designed to enhance visuomotor policies. By leveraging the proposed differentiable formulation of trajectory optimization with transformer, DiffOG seamlessly integrates policies with a generalizable optimization layer. Visuomotor policies enhanced by DiffOG generate smoother, constraint-compliant action trajectories in a more interpretable way. DiffOG exhibits strong generalization capabilities and high flexibility. We evaluated DiffOG across 11 simulated tasks and 2 real-world tasks. The results demonstrate that DiffOG significantly enhances the trajectory quality of visuomotor policies while having minimal impact on policy performance, outperforming trajectory processing baselines such as greedy constraint clipping and penalty-based trajectory optimization. Furthermore, DiffOG achieves superior performance compared to existing constrained visuomotor policy.</p></details> |  |

In particular, reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise in the synthesis of controllers for systems with complex dynamics and modest online compute budgets. However, the poor sample efficiency of RL and the challenges of reward design make training slow and sometimes unstable, especially for high-dimensional systems. In this work, we leverage the inherent Lie group symmetries of robotic systems with a floating base to mitigate these challenges when learning tracking controllers. We model a general tracking problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) that captures the evolution of both the physical and reference states. Next, we prove that symmetry in the underlying dynamics and running costs leads to an MDP homomorphism, a mapping that allows a policy trained on a lower-dimensional "quotient" MDP to be lifted to an optimal tracking controller for the original system. We compare this symmetry-informed approach to an unstructured baseline, using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to learn tracking controllers for three systems: the Particle (a forced point mass), the Astrobee (a fullyactuated space robot), and the Quadrotor (an underactuated system). Results show that a symmetry-aware approach both accelerates training and reduces tracking error at convergence.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The first three authors contributed equally to this work.

While this space simplifies handling the line process, the spatial functions representing sensor performance (i.e. probability of detection) become less intuitive. To illustrate our approach, we focus on positioning sensors of the barrier coverage system on the seafloor to detect passing ships.

Despite its significance, research in this domain remains relatively limited, with most existing studies concentrating on single-modal trajectory prediction of vehicles. In this work, we propose ParkDiffusion, a novel approach that predicts the trajectories of both vehicles and pedestrians in automated parking scenarios. ParkDiffusion employs diffusion models to capture the inherent uncertainty and multi-modality of future trajectories, incorporating several key innovations. First, we propose a dual map encoder that processes soft semantic cues and hard geometric constraints using a two-step cross-attention mechanism. Second, we introduce an adaptive agent type embedding module, which dynamically conditions the prediction process on the distinct characteristics of vehicles and pedestrians. Third, to ensure kinematic feasibility, our model outputs control signals that are subsequently used within a kinematic framework to generate physically feasible trajectories. We evaluate ParkDiffusion on the Dragon Lake Parking (DLP) dataset and the Intersections Drone (inD) dataset. Our work establishes a new baseline for heterogeneous trajectory prediction in parking scenarios, outperforming existing methods by a considerable margin.</p></details> |  |

State-of-the-art motion forecasting models rely on large curated datasets with manually annotated or heavily post-processed trajectories. However, building these datasets is costly, generally manual, hard to scale, and lacks reproducibility. They also introduce domain gaps that limit generalization across environments. We introduce PPT (Pretraining with Pseudo-labeled Trajectories), a simple and scalable alternative that uses unprocessed and diverse trajectories automatically generated from off-the-shelf 3D detectors and tracking. Unlike traditional pipelines aiming for clean, single-label annotations, PPT embraces noise and diversity as useful signals for learning robust representations. With optional finetuning on a small amount of labeled data, models pretrained with PPT achieve strong performance across standard benchmarks particularly in low-data regimes, and in cross-domain, end-to-end and multi-class settings. PPT is easy to implement and improves generalization in motion forecasting.

Over the past two decades, researchers have extended these methods to analyze trajectories of humans, animals, and vehicles, studying their behavior and movement across applications. This paper presents whole-trajectory clustering and sub-trajectory clustering algorithms based on DBSCAN line segment clustering, which encompasses two key events: split and merge of line segments. The events are employed by object movement history and the average Euclidean distance between line segments. In this framework, whole-trajectory clustering considers entire entities' trajectories, whereas sub-trajectory clustering employs a sliding window model to identify similar sub-trajectories. Many existing trajectory clustering algorithms respond to temporary anomalies in data by splitting trajectories, which often obscures otherwise consistent clustering patterns and leads to less reliable insights. We introduce the stable trajectory clustering algorithm, which leverages the mean absolute deviation concept to demonstrate that selective omission of transient deviations not only preserves the integrity of clusters but also improves their stability and interpretability. We run all proposed algorithms on real trajectory datasets to illustrate their effectiveness and sensitivity to parameter variations.</p></details> |  |

However, existing agents need to collect a large number of expert data for fine-tuning to adapt to new environments. In this paper, we propose an online self-exploration method for multimodal agents, namely SPORT, via step-wise preference optimization to refine the trajectories of agents, which automatically generates tasks and learns from solving the generated tasks, without any expert annotation. SPORT operates through four iterative components: task synthesis, step sampling, step verification, and preference tuning. First, we synthesize multi-modal tasks using language models. Then, we introduce a novel search scheme, where step sampling and step verification are executed alternately to solve each generated task. We employ a verifier to provide AI feedback to construct step-wise preference data. The data is subsequently used to update the controller's policy through preference tuning, producing a SPORT Agent. By interacting with real environments, the SPORT Agent evolves into a more refined and capable system.

Despite their utility in advancing digital automation, a critical bottleneck persists: collecting high-quality trajectory data for training. Common practices for collecting such data rely on human supervision or synthetic data generation through executing pre-defined tasks, which are either resource-intensive or unable to guarantee data quality. Moreover, these methods suffer from limited data diversity and significant gaps between synthetic data and real-world environments. To address these challenges, we propose OS-Genesis, a novel GUI data synthesis pipeline that reverses the conventional trajectory collection process. Instead of relying on pre-defined tasks, OS-Genesis enables agents first to perceive environments and perform step-wise interactions, then retrospectively derive high-quality tasks to enable trajectory-level exploration. A trajectory reward model is then employed to ensure the quality of the generated trajectories. We demonstrate that training GUI agents with OS-Genesis significantly improves their performance on highly challenging online benchmarks. In-depth analysis further validates OS-Genesis's efficiency and its superior data quality and diversity compared to existing synthesis methods. Our codes, data, and checkpoints are available at https://qiushisun.github.io/OS-Genesis-Home/.</p></details> | Work in progress |

In this setup, measurement (output) uncertainties are state-dependent and set-valued. Enveloping ellipsoids are employed to characterize state-dependent uncertainties with unknown distributions. The concept of regularity for set-valued output maps is then introduced, facilitating the formulation of the estimation-aware trajectory generation problem. Specifically, it is demonstrated that for output-regular maps, one can utilize a set-valued observability measure that is concave with respect to the finite horizon state trajectories. By maximizing this measure, estimation-aware trajectories can then be synthesized for a broad class of systems. Trajectory planning routines are also examined in this work, by which the observability measure is optimized for systems with locally linearized dynamics. To illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, representative examples in the context of trajectory planning with vision-based estimation are presented. Moreover, the paper presents estimation-aware planning for an uncooperative Target-Rendezvous problem, where an Ego-satellite employs an onboard machine learning (ML)-based estimation module to realize the rendezvous trajectory.</p></details> | 40 pages, 9 figures |

However, maintaining tracking continuity and consistency remains a significant challenge. Traditional detection-assignment tracking methods struggle with false positives, false negatives, and frequent identity switches, leading to degraded counting accuracy and making in-depth analysis impossible. This paper introduces a point-oriented online tracking algorithm that improves trajectory continuity and counting reliability in drone-based crowd monitoring. Our method builds on the Simple Online and Real-time Tracking (SORT) framework, replacing the original bounding-box assignment with a point-distance metric. The algorithm is enhanced with three cost-effective techniques: camera motion compensation, altitude-aware assignment, and classification-based trajectory validation. Further, Deep Discriminative Correlation Filters (DDCF) that re-use spatial feature maps from localisation algorithms for increased computational efficiency through neural network resource sharing are integrated to refine object tracking by reducing noise and handling missed detections. The proposed method is evaluated on the DroneCrowd and newly shared UP-COUNT-TRACK datasets, demonstrating substantial improvements in tracking metrics, reducing counting errors to 23% and 15%, respectively. The results also indicate a significant reduction of identity switches while maintaining high tracking accuracy, outperforming baseline online trackers and even an offline greedy optimisation method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint submitted to the Expert Systems with Applications journal</p></details> |

Simultaneous control and trajectory estimation using probabilistic graphical models has been proposed as a unified solution to these challenges. Previous work, however, relies heavily on appropriate Gaussian priors and is limited to holonomic robots with linear time-varying models. The current research extends graphical optimization methods to vehicles with arbitrary dynamical models via Simultaneous Trajectory Estimation and Local Adaptation (STELA). The overall approach initializes feasible trajectories using a kinodynamic, sampling-based motion planner. Then, it simultaneously: (i) estimates the past trajectory based on noisy observations, and (ii) adapts the controls to be executed to minimize deviations from the planned, feasible trajectory, while avoiding collisions. The proposed factor graph representation of trajectories in STELA can be applied for any dynamical system given access to first or second-order state update equations, and introduces the duration of execution between two states in the trajectory discretization as an optimization variable. These features provide both generalization and flexibility in trajectory following. In addition to targeting computational efficiency, the proposed strategy performs incremental updates of the factor graph using the iSAM algorithm and introduces a time-window mechanism. This mechanism allows the factor graph to be dynamically updated to operate over a limited history and forward horizon of the planned trajectory. This enables online updates of controls at a minimum of 10Hz. Experiments demonstrate that STELA achieves at least comparable performance to previous frameworks on idealized vehicles with linear dynamics.[...]</p></details> | [Accepted] RSS 2025 |

We present a novel method to infer the initial spin and 3D trajectory from the corresponding 2D trajectory in a video. Without ground truth labels for broadcast videos, we train a neural network solely on synthetic data. Due to the choice of our input data representation, physically correct synthetic training data, and using targeted augmentations, the network naturally generalizes to real data. Notably, these simple techniques are sufficient to achieve generalization. No real data at all is required for training. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to present a method for spin and trajectory prediction in simple monocular broadcast videos, achieving an accuracy of 92.0% in spin classification and a 2D reprojection error of 0.19% of the image diagonal.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be published in 2025 IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops (CVPRW)</p></details> |

However, existing methods face robotic hardware dependency and control frequency mismatches between teleoperation devices and robotic platforms. Our approach automatically extracts kinematic parameters from unified robot description format (URDF) files, and enables pluggable deployment across diverse robots through uniform interfaces. The proposed interpolation algorithm bridges the frequency gap between low-rate human inputs and high-frequency robotic control commands through online continuous trajectory generation, \n{while requiring no access to the closed, bottom-level control loop}. To enhance trajectory smoothness, we introduce a minimum-stretch spline that optimizes the motion quality. The system further provides precision and rapid modes to accommodate different task requirements.

Existing deep generative models learn from real trajectories to generate synthetic ones. Despite the progress, most of them suffer from training stability issues and scale poorly with increasing data size. More importantly, they often lack control mechanisms to guide the generated trajectories under constraints such as enforcing specific visits. To address these limitations, we formally define the controlled trajectory generation problem for effectively handling multiple spatiotemporal constraints. We introduce Geo-Llama, a novel LLM finetuning framework that can enforce multiple explicit visit constraints while maintaining contextual coherence of the generated trajectories. In this approach, pre-trained LLMs are fine-tuned on trajectory data with a visit-wise permutation strategy where each visit corresponds to a specific time and location. This strategy enables the model to capture spatiotemporal patterns regardless of visit orders while maintaining flexible and in-context constraint integration through prompts during generation. Extensive experiments on real-world and synthetic datasets validate the effectiveness of Geo-Llama, demonstrating its versatility and robustness in handling a broad range of constraints to generate more realistic trajectories compared to existing methods.</p></details> |  |

To tackle this, an end-to-end foot trajectory and force optimization framework (FTFOF) is proposed, which optimizes foot adhesion and detachment forces through trajectory adjustments. This framework accepts general foot trajectory constraints and user-defined parameters as input, ultimately producing an optimal single foot trajectory. It integrates three-segment $C^2$ continuous Bezier curves, tailored to various foot structures, enabling the generation of effective climbing trajectories. A dilate-based GRU predictive model establishes the relationship between foot trajectories and the corresponding foot forces. Multi-objective optimization algorithms, combined with a redundancy hierarchical strategy, identify the most suitable foot trajectory for specific tasks, thereby ensuring optimal performance across detachment force, adhesion force and vibration amplitude. Experimental validation on the quadruped climbing robot MST-M3F showed that, compared to commonly used trajectories in existing legged climbing robots, the proposed framework achieved reductions in maximum detachment force by 28 \%, vibration amplitude by 82 \%, which ensures the stable climbing of dry adhesion legged climbing robots.</p></details> |  |

The proposed method utilizes Model Predictive Control (MPC) with a focus on handling the uncertainties associated with the movement prediction of dynamic obstacles. Unlike existing Nav2 trajectory planners which primarily deal with static obstacles or react to the current position of dynamic obstacles, this planner predicts future obstacle positions using a stochastic Vector Auto-Regressive Model (VAR). The obstacles' future positions are represented by probability distributions, and collision avoidance is achieved through constraints based on the Mahalanobis distance, ensuring the robot avoids regions where obstacles are likely to be. This approach considers the robot's kinodynamic constraints, enabling it to track a reference path while adapting to real-time changes in the environment. The paper details the implementation, including obstacle prediction, tracking, and the construction of feasible sets for MPC. Simulation results in a Gazebo environment demonstrate the effectiveness of this method in scenarios where robots must navigate around each other, showing improved collision avoidance capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been accepted to IFAC for publication under a Creative Commons Licence CC-BY-NC-ND</p></details> |

This study proposes an analytic control allocation method for underactuated Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs). By integrating an adaptive hybrid feedback controller, we enable an AUV with 4 actuators to move in 6 degrees of freedom (DOF) in simulation and up to 5-DOF in real-world experiments. The proposed method outperformed state-of-the-art control allocation techniques in 6-DOF trajectory tracking simulations, exhibiting centimeter-scale accuracy and higher energy and computational efficiency. Real-world pool experiments confirmed the method's robustness and efficacy in tracking complex 3D trajectories, with significant computational efficiency gains 0.007 (ms) vs. 22.28 (ms).

These seek to answer a fundamental question: What can we learn from time series measurements of a complex dynamical system? For small systems interacting with external environments, the effective dynamics are inherently stochastic, making it crucial to properly manage noise in data. Here, we explore this for systems obeying Langevin dynamics and, using currents, we construct a learning framework for stochastic modeling. Currents have recently gained increased attention for their role in bounding entropy production (EP) from thermodynamic uncertainty relations (TURs). We introduce a fundamental relationship between the cumulant currents there and standard machine-learning loss functions. Using this, we derive loss functions for several key thermodynamic functions directly from the system dynamics without the (common) intermediate step of deriving a TUR. These loss functions reproduce results derived both from TURs and other methods. More significantly, they open a path to discover new loss functions for previously inaccessible quantities. Notably, this includes access to per-trajectory entropy production, even if the observed system is driven far from its steady-state. We also consider higher order estimation. Our method is straightforward and unifies dynamic inference with recent approaches to entropy production estimation. Taken altogether, this reveals a deep connection between diffusion models in machine learning and entropy production estimation in stochastic thermodynamics.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 6 appendices (10 pages), 4 figures; https://csc.ucdavis.edu/~cmg/compmech/pubs/currents.htm</p></details> |

These same capabilities have made diffusion models increasingly popular in robotics research, where they are used for generating robot motion. However, the stochastic nature of diffusion models is fundamentally at odds with the precise dynamical equations describing the feasible motion of robots. Hence, generating dynamically admissible robot trajectories is a challenge for diffusion models. To alleviate this issue, we introduce DDAT: Diffusion policies for Dynamically Admissible Trajectories to generate provably admissible trajectories of black-box robotic systems using diffusion models. A sequence of states is a dynamically admissible trajectory if each state of the sequence belongs to the reachable set of its predecessor by the robot's equations of motion. To generate such trajectories, our diffusion policies project their predictions onto a dynamically admissible manifold during both training and inference to align the objective of the denoiser neural network with the dynamical admissibility constraint. The auto-regressive nature of these projections along with the black-box nature of robot dynamics render these projections immensely challenging. We thus enforce admissibility by iteratively sampling a polytopic under-approximation of the reachable set of a state onto which we project its predicted successor, before iterating this process with the projected successor. By producing accurate trajectories, this projection eliminates the need for diffusion models to continually replan, enabling one-shot long-horizon trajectory planning. We demonstrate that our framework generates higher quality dynamically admissible robot trajectories through extensive simulations on a quadcopter and various MuJoCo environments, along with real-world experiments on a Unitree GO1 and GO2.</p></details> |  |

Critical to these improvements is understanding AVs' longitudinal behavior, relying heavily on real-world trajectory data. Existing open-source trajectory datasets of AV, however, often fall short in refinement, reliability, and completeness, hindering effective performance metrics analysis and model development. This study addresses these challenges by creating a Unified Longitudinal TRAjectory dataset for AVs (Ultra-AV) to analyze their microscopic longitudinal driving behaviors. This dataset compiles data from 13 distinct sources, encompassing various AV types, test sites, and experiment scenarios. We established a three-step data processing: 1. extraction of longitudinal trajectory data, 2. general data cleaning, and 3. data-specific cleaning to obtain the longitudinal trajectory data and car-following trajectory data. The validity of the processed data is affirmed through performance evaluations across safety, mobility, stability, and sustainability, along with an analysis of the relationships between variables in car-following models. Our work not only furnishes researchers with standardized data and metrics for longitudinal AV behavior studies but also sets guidelines for data collection and model development.</p></details> | NA |

In addition, these methods lack explainability due to their black box nature, which poses further challenges in terms of the approval process and social trustworthiness. Therefore, in order to use the capabilities of data-driven statistical AI methods in a reliable and trustworthy manner, the concept of TrustMHE is introduced and investigated in this paper. TrustMHE represents a complementary approach, independent of the underlying AI systems, that combines AI-driven out-of-distribution detection with control-driven moving horizon estimation (MHE) to enable not only detection and monitoring, but also intervention.

While many data-driven approaches aim to learn system dynamics, jointly predicting internal loads and system trajectories remains a key challenge. This dual prediction is especially important for fault detection and predictive maintenance, where internal loads-such as contact forces-act as early indicators of faults, reflecting wear or misalignment before affecting motion. These forces also serve as inputs to degradation models (e.g., crack growth), enabling damage prediction and remaining useful life estimation. We propose Equi-Euler GraphNet, a physics-informed graph neural network (GNN) that simultaneously predicts internal forces and global trajectories in multi-body systems. In this mesh-free framework, nodes represent system components and edges encode interactions. Equi-Euler GraphNet introduces two inductive biases: (1) an equivariant message-passing scheme, interpreting edge messages as interaction forces consistent under Euclidean transformations; and (2) a temporal-aware iterative node update mechanism, based on Euler integration, to capture influence of distant interactions over time. Tailored for cylindrical roller bearings, it decouples ring dynamics from constrained motion of rolling elements. Trained on high-fidelity multiphysics simulations, Equi-Euler GraphNet generalizes beyond the training distribution, accurately predicting loads and trajectories under unseen speeds, loads, and configurations. It outperforms state-of-the-art GNNs focused on trajectory prediction, delivering stable rollouts over thousands of time steps with minimal error accumulation. Achieving up to a 200x speedup over conventional solvers while maintaining comparable accuracy, it serves as an efficient reduced-order model for digital twins, design, and maintenance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Reupl...</summary><p>Reuploaded with new version-- equation 16 was incorrect</p></details> |

To address this issue, we first present PARM and PARM*, perception-aware, decentralized, asynchronous multiagent trajectory planners that enable a team of agents to navigate uncertain environments while deconflicting trajectories and avoiding obstacles using perception information. PARM* differs from PARM as it is less conservative, using more computation to find closer-to-optimal solutions. While these methods achieve state-of-the-art performance, they suffer from high computational costs as they need to solve large optimization problems onboard, making it difficult for agents to replan at high rates. To overcome this challenge, we present our second key contribution, PRIMER, a learning-based planner trained with imitation learning (IL) using PARM* as the expert demonstrator. PRIMER leverages the low computational requirements at deployment of neural networks and achieves a computation speed up to 5500 times faster than optimization-based approaches.</p></details> | 7 pages, 3 figures |

While these systems offer unprecedented efficiency in transporting people and goods, they rely heavily on computation capability, safety-critical operations such as real-time navigation, environmental sensing, and trajectory tracking--necessitating robust offboard computational support. A widely adopted solution involves offloading these tasks to terrestrial base stations (BSs) along the flight path. However, air-to-ground connectivity is often constrained by spectrum conflicts with terrestrial users, which poses a significant challenge to maintaining reliable task execution. Cognitive radio (CR) techniques offer promising capabilities for dynamic spectrum access, making them a natural fit for addressing this issue. Existing studies often overlook the time-varying nature of BS resources, such as spectrum availability and CPU cycles, which leads to inaccurate trajectory planning, suboptimal offloading success rates, excessive energy consumption, and operational delays. To address these challenges, we propose a trajectory optimization framework for eVTOL swarms that maximizes task offloading success probability while minimizing both energy consumption and resource competition (e.g., spectrum and CPU cycles) with primary terrestrial users. The proposed algorithm integrates a Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) model to dynamically estimate BS resource availability and a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm to determine optimal offloading decisions, selecting both the BSs and access time windows that align with energy and temporal constraints.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces a novel mixed Bernstein-Fourier approximation framework tailored explicitly for optimal motion planning. Our proposed methodology leverages the uniform convergence properties of Bernstein polynomials for nonperiodic behaviors while effectively capturing periodic dynamics through Fourier series. Theoretical results are established, including uniform convergence proofs for approximations of functions, derivatives, and integrals, as well as detailed error bound analyses. We further introduce a regulated least squares approach for determining approximation coefficients, enhancing numerical stability and practical applicability. Within an optimal control context, we establish feasibility and consistency of approximated solutions to their continuous counterparts. We also extend the covector mapping theorem, providing theoretical guarantees for approximating dual variables crucial in verifying the necessary optimality conditions from Pontryagin's Maximum Principle. Comprehensive numerical examples illustrate the method's superior performance, demonstrating substantial improvements in computational efficiency and precision in scenarios with complex periodic constraints and dynamics. Our mixed Bernstein-Fourier methodology thus presents a robust, theoretically grounded, and computationally efficient approach for advanced optimal trajectory planning in autonomous systems.</p></details> | 49 pages, 9 figures |

However, predictive modeling of such data remains challenging due to high dimensionality, irregular sampling, and data sparsity. To address these issues, we propose ImageFlowNet, a novel model designed to forecast disease trajectories from initial images while preserving spatial details. ImageFlowNet first learns multiscale joint representation spaces across patients and time points, then optimizes deterministic or stochastic flow fields within these spaces using a position-parameterized neural ODE/SDE framework. The model leverages a UNet architecture to create robust multiscale representations and mitigates data scarcity by combining knowledge from all patients.

Operating in such settings presents many challenges -- most notably, because the agent cannot predict the ground-truth future paths of obstacles, a previously planned trajectory can become unsafe at any moment, requiring rapid replanning to avoid collisions. Recently developed planners have used soft-constraint approaches to achieve the necessary fast computation times; however, these methods do not guarantee collision-free paths even with static obstacles. In contrast, hard-constraint methods ensure collision-free safety, but typically have longer computation times. To address these issues, we propose three key contributions. First, the DYNUS Global Planner (DGP) and Temporal Safe Corridor Generation operate in spatio-temporal space and handle both static and dynamic obstacles in the 3D environment. Second, the Safe Planning Framework leverages a combination of exploratory, safe, and contingency trajectories to flexibly re-route when potential future collisions with dynamic obstacles are detected. Finally, the Fast Hard-Constraint Local Trajectory Formulation uses a variable elimination approach to reduce the problem size and enable faster computation by pre-computing dependencies between free and dependent variables while still ensuring collision-free trajectories. We evaluated DYNUS in a variety of simulations, including dense forests, confined office spaces, cave systems, and dynamic environments. Our experiments show that DYNUS achieves a success rate of 100% and travel times that are approximately 25.0% faster than state-of-the-art methods. We also evaluated DYNUS on multiple platforms -- a quadrotor, a wheeled robot, and a quadruped -- in both simulation and hardware experiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 30 figures, Under review at IEEE Transactions on Robotics</p></details> |

There is a urgent need to minimize the data size in LLM training. Compared with data selection method, the data distillation method aims to synthesize a small number of data samples to achieve the training effect of the full data set and has better flexibility. Despite its successes in computer vision, the discreteness of text data has hitherto stymied its exploration in natural language processing (NLP). In this work, we proposed a method that involves learning pseudo prompt data based on trajectory matching and finding its nearest neighbor ID to achieve cross-architecture transfer. During the distillation process, we introduce a regularization loss to improve the robustness of our distilled data. To our best knowledge, this is the first data distillation work suitable for text generation tasks such as instruction tuning. Evaluations on two benchmarks, including ARC-Easy and MMLU instruction tuning datasets, established the superiority of our distillation approach over the SOTA data selection method LESS. Furthermore, our method demonstrates a good transferability over LLM structures (i.e., OPT to Llama).</p></details> |  |

Our framework begins by generating panoptic occupancy local semantic maps and accurate localization information from data aligned between a monocular camera, IMU, and GPS. This information is combined with input terrain point clouds or preloaded terrain information to initialize the planning process. We propose the Radiant Field-Informed Coverage Planning algorithm, which utilizes a diffusion field model to dynamically adjust the robot's coverage trajectory and speed based on environmental attributes such as dirtiness and dryness. By modeling the spatial influence of the robot's actions using a Gaussian field, ensures a speed-optimized, uniform coverage trajectory while adapting to varying environmental conditions.</p></details> |  |

Even well-trained machine learning models may produce unreliable predictions due to discrepancies between training data and real-world conditions encountered during inference. In particular, the training dataset tends to overrepresent common scenes (e.g., straight lanes) while underrepresenting less frequent ones (e.g., traffic circles). In addition, it often overlooks unpredictable real-world events such as sudden braking or falling objects. To ensure safety, it is critical to detect in real-time when a model's predictions become unreliable. Leveraging the intuition that in-distribution (ID) scenes exhibit error patterns similar to training data, while out-of-distribution (OOD) scenes do not, we introduce a principled, real-time approach for OOD detection by framing it as a change-point detection problem. We address the challenging settings where the OOD scenes are deceptive, meaning that they are not easily detectable by human intuitions. Our lightweight solutions can handle the occurrence of OOD at any time during trajectory prediction inference. Experimental results on multiple real-world datasets using a benchmark trajectory prediction model demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods.</p></details> |  |

In practice, safety constraints, including cost functions and budgets, are unknown or hard to specify, as it requires anticipation of all possible unsafe behaviors. We therefore address a general setting where the true safety definition is unknown, and has to be learned from sparsely labeled data. Our key contributions are: first, we design a safety model that performs credit assignment to estimate each decision step's impact on the overall safety using a dataset of diverse trajectories and their corresponding binary safety labels (i.e., whether the corresponding trajectory is safe/unsafe). Second, we illustrate the architecture of our safety model to demonstrate its ability to learn a separate safety score for each timestep. Third, we reformulate the safe RL problem using the proposed safety model and derive an effective algorithm to optimize a safe yet rewarding policy. Finally, our empirical results corroborate our findings and show that this approach is effective in satisfying unknown safety definition, and scalable to various continuous control tasks.</p></details> |  |

Accurately predicting the future trajectories of each traffic participant is a prerequisite for building high safety and high reliability decision-making, planning, and control capabilities in autonomous driving. However, existing methods often focus solely on the motion of other traffic participants without considering the underlying intent behind that motion, which increases the uncertainty in trajectory prediction. Autonomous vehicles operate in real-time environments, meaning that trajectory prediction algorithms must be able to process data and generate predictions in real-time. While many existing methods achieve high accuracy, they often struggle to effectively handle heterogeneous traffic scenarios. In this paper, we propose a Subjective Intent-based Low-latency framework for Multiple traffic participants joint trajectory prediction. Our method explicitly incorporates the subjective intent of traffic participants based on their key points, and predicts the future trajectories jointly without map, which ensures promising performance while significantly reducing the prediction latency. Additionally, we introduce a novel dataset designed specifically for trajectory prediction. Related code and dataset will be available soon.</p></details> |  |

As this is a novel task, there is currently no relevant dataset available in the community. To address this gap, we first devised a new visualization language called Trajectory Visualization Language (TVL) to facilitate querying trajectory data and generating visualizations. Building on this foundation, we further proposed a dataset construction method that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with human efforts to create high-quality data. Specifically, we first generate TVLs using a comprehensive and systematic process, and then label each TVL with corresponding natural language questions using LLMs. This process results in the creation of the first large-scale Text-to-TrajVis dataset, named TrajVL, which contains 18,140 (question, TVL) pairs. Based on this dataset, we systematically evaluated the performance of multiple LLMs (GPT, Qwen, Llama, etc.) on this task. The experimental results demonstrate that this task is both feasible and highly challenging and merits further exploration within the research community.</p></details> |  |
| **[DriVerse: Navigation World Model for Driving Simulation via Multimodal Trajectory Prompting and Motion Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18576v1)** | 2025-04-22 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2504.18576v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents DriVerse, a generative model for simulating navigation-driven driving scenes from a single image and a future trajectory. Previous autonomous driving world models either directly feed the trajectory or discrete control signals into the generation pipeline, leading to poor alignment between the control inputs and the implicit features of the 2D base generative model, which results in low-fidelity video outputs. Some methods use coarse textual commands or discrete vehicle control signals, which lack the precision to guide fine-grained, trajectory-specific video generation, making them unsuitable for evaluating actual autonomous driving algorithms. DriVerse introduces explicit trajectory guidance in two complementary forms: it tokenizes trajectories into textual prompts using a predefined trend vocabulary for seamless language integration, and converts 3D trajectories into 2D spatial motion priors to enhance control over static content within the driving scene. To better handle dynamic objects, we further introduce a lightweight motion alignment module, which focuses on the inter-frame consistency of dynamic pixels, significantly enhancing the temporal coherence of moving elements over long sequences. With minimal training and no need for additional data, DriVerse outperforms specialized models on future video generation tasks across both the nuScenes and Waymo datasets. The code and models will be released to the public.</p></details> | 10 pages, 5 figures |

Modern trajectory prediction models strive to interpret complex patterns and dependencies from agent and map data. The Motion Transformer (MTR) architecture and subsequent work define the most accurate methods in common benchmarks such as the Waymo Open Motion Benchmark. The MTR model employs pre-generated static intention points as initial goal points for trajectory prediction. However, the static nature of these points frequently leads to misalignment with map data in specific traffic scenarios, resulting in unfeasible or unrealistic goal points. Our research addresses this limitation by integrating scene-specific dynamic intention points into the MTR model. This adaptation of the MTR model was trained and evaluated on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset. Our findings demonstrate that incorporating dynamic intention points has a significant positive impact on trajectory prediction accuracy, especially for predictions over long time horizons. Furthermore, we analyze the impact on ground truth trajectories which are not compliant with the map data or are illegal maneuvers.</p></details> |  |

Agents and their social interactions have been quantified and modeled by researchers from various perspectives; however, substantial limitations exist in the current work due to the inherent high uncertainty of agent intentions and the complex higher-order influences among neighboring groups. SocialMOIF is proposed to tackle these challenges, concentrating on the higher-order intention interactions among neighboring groups while reinforcing the primary role of first-order intention interactions between neighbors and the target agent. This method develops a multi-order intention fusion model to achieve a more comprehensive understanding of both direct and indirect intention information. Within SocialMOIF, a trajectory distribution approximator is designed to guide the trajectories toward values that align more closely with the actual data, thereby enhancing model interpretability. Furthermore, a global trajectory optimizer is introduced to enable more accurate and efficient parallel predictions. By incorporating a novel loss function that accounts for distance and direction during training, experimental results demonstrate that the model outperforms previous state-of-the-art baselines across multiple metrics in both dynamic and static datasets.</p></details> | 11 pages,6 figures |

Most existing methods in offline safe RL rely on cost constraints at each time step (derived from global cost constraints) and this can result in either overly conservative policies or violation of safety constraints. In this paper, we propose to learn a policy that generates desirable trajectories and avoids undesirable trajectories. To be specific, we first partition the pre-collected dataset of state-action trajectories into desirable and undesirable subsets. Intuitively, the desirable set contains high reward and safe trajectories, and undesirable set contains unsafe trajectories and low-reward safe trajectories. Second, we learn a policy that generates desirable trajectories and avoids undesirable trajectories, where (un)desirability scores are provided by a classifier learnt from the dataset of desirable and undesirable trajectories. This approach bypasses the computational complexity and stability issues of a min-max objective that is employed in existing methods. Theoretically, we also show our approach's strong connections to existing learning paradigms involving human feedback. Finally, we extensively evaluate our method using the DSRL benchmark for offline safe RL. Empirically, our method outperforms competitive baselines, achieving higher rewards and better constraint satisfaction across a wide variety of benchmark tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>AAAI ...</summary><p>AAAI 2025.

However, existing models handle predictions as an instantaneous task of forecasting future trajectories based on observed information. As time proceeds, the next prediction is made independently of the previous one, which means that the model cannot correct its errors during inference and will repeat them. To alleviate this problem and better leverage temporal data, we propose a novel retrospection technique. Through training on closed-loop rollouts the model learns to use aggregated feedback. Given new observations it reflects on previous predictions and analyzes its errors to improve the quality of subsequent predictions. Thus, the model can learn to correct systematic errors during inference. Comprehensive experiments on nuScenes and Argoverse demonstrate a considerable decrease in minimum Average Displacement Error of up to 31.9% compared to the state-of-the-art baseline without retrospection. We further showcase the robustness of our technique by demonstrating a better handling of out-of-distribution scenarios with undetected road-users.</p></details> |  |

So we present a lightweight multi-modal framework for 3D object detection and trajectory prediction. Our system synergistically integrates LiDAR and camera inputs to achieve real-time perception of pedestrians, vehicles, and riders in 3D space. The framework proposes two novel modules: 1) a Cross-Modal Deformable Transformer (CMDT) for object detection with high accuracy and acceptable amount of computation, and 2) a Reference Trajectory-based Multi-Class Transformer (RTMCT) for efficient and diverse trajectory prediction of mult-class objects with flexible trajectory lengths. Evaluations on the CODa benchmark demonstrate superior performance over existing methods across detection (+2.03% in mAP) and trajectory prediction (-0.408m in minADE5 of pedestrians) metrics. Remarkably, the system exhibits exceptional deployability - when implemented on a wheelchair robot with an entry-level NVIDIA 3060 GPU, it achieves real-time inference at 13.2 fps. To facilitate reproducibility and practical deployment, we release the related code of the method at https://github.com/TossherO/3D_Perception and its ROS inference version at https://github.com/TossherO/ros_packages.</p></details> |  |

However, when given suboptimal task trajectory demonstrations with shape characteristics reflecting human preferences but subpar dynamic attributes such as slow motion, robots not only need to mimic the behaviors but also optimize the dynamic performance. In this work, we leverage optimization-based methods to search for a superior-performing trajectory whose shape is similar to that of the demonstrated trajectory. Specifically, we use Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) to quantify the difference between two trajectories and combine it with additional performance metrics, such as collision cost, to construct the cost function. Moreover, we develop a multi-policy version of the Stochastic Trajectory Optimization for Motion Planning (STOMP), called MSTOMP, which is more stable and robust to parameter changes. To deal with the jitter in the demonstrated trajectory, we further utilize the gain-controlling method in the frequency domain to denoise the demonstration and propose a computationally more efficient metric, called Mean Square Error in the Spectrum (MSES), that measures the trajectories' differences in the frequency domain. We also theoretically highlight the connections between the time domain and the frequency domain methods. Finally, we verify our method in both simulation experiments and real-world experiments, showcasing its improved optimization performance and stability compared to existing methods.</p></details> |  |

Current model-based SOH estimation methods typically rely on low C-rate constant current tests to extract health parameters like solid phase volume fraction and lithium-ion stoichiometry, which are often impractical in real-world scenarios due to time and operational constraints. Additionally, these methods are susceptible to modeling uncertainties that can significantly degrade the estimation accuracy, especially when jointly estimating multiple parameters. In this paper, we present a novel reference voltage-based method for robust battery SOH estimation. This method utilizes the voltage response of a battery under a predefined current excitation at the beginning of life (BOL) as a reference to compensate for modeling uncertainty. As the battery degrades, the same excitation is applied to generate the voltage response, which is compared with the BOL trajectory to estimate the key health parameters accurately. The current excitation is optimally designed using the Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm to maximize the information content of the target parameters. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed method significantly improves parameter estimation accuracy under different degradation levels, compared to conventional methods relying only on direct voltage measurements. Furthermore, our method jointly estimates four key SOH parameters in only 10 minutes, making it practical for real-world battery health diagnostics, e.g., fast testing to enable battery repurposing.</p></details> |  |

However, their out-of-distribution generalization remains a significant challenge, particularly due to unbalanced data and a lack of enough data and diversity to ensure robustness and calibration. To address this, we propose SHIFT (Spectral Heteroscedastic Informed Forecasting for Trajectories), a novel framework that uniquely combines well-calibrated uncertainty modeling with informative priors derived through automated rule extraction. SHIFT reformulates trajectory prediction as a classification task and employs heteroscedastic spectral-normalized Gaussian processes to effectively disentangle epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties. We learn informative priors from training labels, which are automatically generated from natural language driving rules, such as stop rules and drivability constraints, using a retrieval-augmented generation framework powered by a large language model. Extensive evaluations over the nuScenes dataset, including challenging low-data and cross-location scenarios, demonstrate that SHIFT outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving substantial gains in uncertainty calibration and displacement metrics. In particular, our model excels in complex scenarios, such as intersections, where uncertainty is inherently higher.

While concept erasure methods offer a promising solution, existing finetuning-based approaches suffer from notable limitations. Anchor-free methods risk disrupting sampling trajectories, leading to visual artifacts, while anchor-based methods rely on the heuristic selection of anchor concepts. To overcome these shortcomings, we introduce a finetuning framework, dubbed ANT, which Automatically guides deNoising Trajectories to avoid unwanted concepts. ANT is built on a key insight: reversing the condition direction of classifier-free guidance during mid-to-late denoising stages enables precise content modification without sacrificing early-stage structural integrity. This inspires a trajectory-aware objective that preserves the integrity of the early-stage score function field, which steers samples toward the natural image manifold, without relying on heuristic anchor concept selection. For single-concept erasure, we propose an augmentation-enhanced weight saliency map to precisely identify the critical parameters that most significantly contribute to the unwanted concept, enabling more thorough and efficient erasure. For multi-concept erasure, our objective function offers a versatile plug-and-play solution that significantly boosts performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ANT achieves state-of-the-art results in both single and multi-concept erasure, delivering high-quality, safe outputs without compromising the generative fidelity.

Recent score distillation methods distill a heavy teacher model into a student generator to achieve one-step generation, which is optimized by calculating the difference between the two score functions on the samples generated by the student model. However, there is a score mismatch issue in the early stage of the distillation process, because existing methods mainly focus on using the endpoint of pre-trained diffusion models as teacher models, overlooking the importance of the convergence trajectory between the student generator and the teacher model. To address this issue, we extend the score distillation process by introducing the entire convergence trajectory of teacher models and propose Distribution Backtracking Distillation (DisBack). DisBask is composed of two stages: Degradation Recording and Distribution Backtracking. Degradation Recording is designed to obtain the convergence trajectory of the teacher model, which records the degradation path from the trained teacher model to the untrained initial student generator. The degradation path implicitly represents the teacher model's intermediate distributions, and its reverse can be viewed as the convergence trajectory from the student generator to the teacher model. Then Distribution Backtracking trains a student generator to backtrack the intermediate distributions along the path to approximate the convergence trajectory of teacher models. Extensive experiments show that DisBack achieves faster and better convergence than the existing distillation method and accomplishes comparable generation performance, with FID score of 1.38 on ImageNet 64x64 dataset. Notably, DisBack is easy to implement and can be generalized to existing distillation methods to boost performance.

In complex environments, like modern 3D video games, distribution shift and stochasticity necessitate robust approaches beyond simple action replay. In this study, we apply Inverse Dynamics Models (IDM) with different encoders and policy heads to trajectory following in a modern 3D video game -- Bleeding Edge. Additionally, we investigate several future alignment strategies that address the distribution shift caused by the aleatoric uncertainty and imperfections of the agent. We measure both the trajectory deviation distance and the first significant deviation point between the reference and the agent's trajectory and show that the optimal configuration depends on the chosen setting. Our results show that in a diverse data setting, a GPT-style policy head with an encoder trained from scratch performs the best, DINOv2 encoder with the GPT-style policy head gives the best results in the low data regime, and both GPT-style and MLP-style policy heads had comparable results when pre-trained on a diverse setting and fine-tuned for a specific behaviour setting.</p></details> |  |

This overlooks the critical fact that the tires and the surface are the two force-transmitting partners in vehicle dynamics; while the tires stay with the vehicle, surface conditions vary with location. Recognizing these challenges, this paper presents a novel framework for spatially resolving dynamic constraints in both offline and online planning algorithms applied to autonomous racing. We introduce the GripMap concept, which provides a spatial resolution of vehicle dynamic constraints in the Frenet frame, allowing adaptation to locally varying grip conditions. This enables compensation for location-specific effects, more efficient vehicle behavior, and increased safety, unattainable with spatially invariant vehicle models. The focus is on low storage demand and quick access through perfect hashing. This framework proved advantageous in real-world applications in the presented form. Experiments inspired by autonomous racing demonstrate its effectiveness. In future work, this framework can serve as a foundational layer for developing future interpretable learning algorithms that adjust to varying grip conditions in real-time.</p></details> |  |

| **[Trajectory Encoding Temporal Graph Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11386v1)** | 2025-04-15 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2504.11386v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal Graph Networks (TGNs) have demonstrated significant success in dynamic graph tasks such as link prediction and node classification. Both tasks comprise transductive settings, where the model predicts links among known nodes, and in inductive settings, where it generalises learned patterns to previously unseen nodes. Existing TGN designs face a dilemma under these dual scenarios. Anonymous TGNs, which rely solely on temporal and structural information, offer strong inductive generalisation but struggle to distinguish known nodes. In contrast, non-anonymous TGNs leverage node features to excel in transductive tasks yet fail to adapt to new nodes. To address this challenge, we propose Trajectory Encoding TGN (TETGN). Our approach introduces automatically expandable node identifiers (IDs) as learnable temporal positional features and performs message passing over these IDs to capture each node's historical context. By integrating this trajectory-aware module with a standard TGN using multi-head attention, TETGN effectively balances transductive accuracy with inductive generalisation. Experimental results on three real-world datasets show that TETGN significantly outperforms strong baselines on both link prediction and node classification tasks, demonstrating its ability to unify the advantages of anonymous and non-anonymous models for dynamic graph learning.</p></details> |  |

The context itself can be static (lanes, regulatory elements, etc) or dynamic (traffic participants). This paper presents a lane graph-based motion prediction model that first predicts graph-based goal proposals and later fuses them with cross attention over multiple contextual elements. We follow the famous encoder-interactor-decoder architecture where the encoder encodes scene context using lightweight Gated Recurrent Units, the interactor applies cross-context attention over encoded scene features and graph goal proposals, and the decoder regresses multimodal trajectories via Laplacian Mixture Density Network from the aggregated encodings. Using cross-attention over graph-based goal proposals gives robust trajectory estimates since the model learns to attend to future goal-relevant scene elements for the intended agent. We evaluate our work on nuScenes motion prediction dataset, achieving state-of-the-art results.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Robust Trajectory Embedding for Similarity Computation: When Triangle Inequality Violations in Distance Metrics Matter](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10933v1)** | 2025-04-15 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2504.10933v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory similarity is a cornerstone of trajectory data management and analysis. Traditional similarity functions often suffer from high computational complexity and a reliance on specific distance metrics, prompting a shift towards deep representation learning in Euclidean space. However, existing Euclidean-based trajectory embeddings often face challenges due to the triangle inequality constraints that do not universally hold for trajectory data. To address this issue, this paper introduces a novel approach by incorporating non-Euclidean geometry, specifically hyperbolic space, into trajectory representation learning. We present the first-ever integration of hyperbolic space to resolve the inherent limitations of the triangle inequality in Euclidean embeddings. In particular, we achieve it by designing a Lorentz distance measure, which is proven to overcome triangle inequality constraints. Additionally, we design a model-agnostic framework LH-plugin to seamlessly integrate hyperbolic embeddings into existing representation learning pipelines. This includes a novel projection method optimized with the Cosh function to prevent the diminishment of distances, supported by a theoretical foundation. Furthermore, we propose a dynamic fusion distance that intelligently adapts to variations in triangle inequality constraints across different trajectory pairs, blending Lorentzian and Euclidean distances for more robust similarity calculations. Comprehensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that our approach effectively enhances the accuracy of trajectory similarity measures in state-of-the-art models across multiple real-world datasets. The LH-plugin not only addresses the triangle inequality issues but also significantly refines the precision of trajectory similarity computations, marking a substantial advancement in the field of trajectory representation learning.</p></details> | 14 pages, 8 figures |

Although predicting the ego-vehicle's path is valuable for driver-assistance systems, existing methods mainly focus on external factors like other vehicles' motions, often neglecting the driver's attention and intent. To address this gap, we infer the ego-trajectory by integrating the driver's gaze and the surrounding scene. We introduce RouteFormer, a novel multimodal ego-trajectory prediction network combining GPS data, environmental context, and the driver's field-of-view, comprising first-person video and gaze fixations. We also present the Path Complexity Index (PCI), a new metric for trajectory complexity that enables a more nuanced evaluation of challenging scenarios. To tackle data scarcity and enhance diversity, we introduce GEM, a comprehensive dataset of urban driving scenarios enriched with synchronized driver field-of-view and gaze data. Extensive evaluations on GEM and DR(eye)VE demonstrate that RouteFormer significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving notable improvements in prediction accuracy across diverse conditions. Ablation studies reveal that incorporating driver field-of-view data yields significantly better average displacement error, especially in challenging scenarios with high PCI scores, underscoring the importance of modeling driver attention.

This paper presents RINGO: Real-time Navigation with a Guiding Trajectory, a novel planning framework that enables aerial manipulators to navigate unknown environments in real time. The proposed method simultaneously considers the positions of both the multi-rotor and the end-effector. A pre-obtained multi-rotor trajectory serves as a guiding reference, allowing the end-effector to generate a smooth, collision-free, and workspace-compatible trajectory. Leveraging the convex hull property of B-spline curves, we theoretically guarantee that the trajectory remains within the reachable workspace. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that enables real-time navigation of aerial manipulators in unknown environments. The simulation and experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed method. The proposed method generates less conservative trajectories than approaches that consider only the multi-rotor.</p></details> | 9 pages, 15 figures |

In many real-world scenarios, where data collection is costly and risky, offline reinforcement learning (RL) offers a solution by utilizing data collected by domain experts and searching for a batch-constrained optimal policy. This approach is further augmented by incorporating external data sources, expanding the range and diversity of data collection possibilities. However, existing offline RL methods often struggle with challenges posed by non-matching data from these external sources. In this work, we specifically address the problem of source-target domain mismatch in scenarios involving mixed datasets, characterized by a predominance of source data generated from random or suboptimal policies and a limited amount of target data generated from higher-quality policies. To tackle this problem, we introduce Transition Scoring (TS), a novel method that assigns scores to transitions based on their similarity to the target domain, and propose Curriculum Learning-Based Trajectory Valuation (CLTV), which effectively leverages these transition scores to identify and prioritize high-quality trajectories through a curriculum learning approach. Our extensive experiments across various offline RL methods and MuJoCo environments, complemented by rigorous theoretical analysis, demonstrate that CLTV enhances the overall performance and transferability of policies learned by offline RL algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at AAMAS 2025</p></details> |

Traditional assessment tools often fail to fully cover course content, leading to imprecise evaluations of student mastery. To tackle this problem, the study proposes a knowledge graph construction method based on large language models (LLMs), which transforms learning materials into structured data and generates personalized learning trajectory graphs by analyzing students' test data. Experimental results demonstrate that the model effectively alerts teachers to potential biases in their exam questions and tracks individual student progress. This system not only enhances the accuracy of learning assessments but also helps teachers provide timely guidance to students who are falling behind, thereby improving overall teaching strategies.</p></details> |  |

This approach, an upgrade from traditional methods, extends the original algorithm to effectively address 3D perforated surface milling. Unlike conventional algorithms, the method embeds a continuous spiral trajectory within perforated surfaces without requiring cellular decomposition or additional boundaries. The proposed method addresses three primary challenges, including modifying conformal slit mapping for mesh surfaces, maintaining uniform scallop height between adjacent spiral trajectories, and optimizing the mapped origin point to ensure uniform scallop height distribution. To overcome these challenges, surface flattening techniques are incorporated into the original approach to accommodate mesh surfaces effectively. Tool path spacing is then optimized using a binary search strategy to regulate scallop height. A functional energy metric associated with scallop height uniformity is introduced for rapid evaluation of points mapped to the origin, with the minimum functional energy determined through perturbation techniques. The optimal placement of this point is identified using a modified gradient descent approach applied to the energy function. Validation on intricate surfaces, including low-quality and high-genus meshes, verifies the robustness of the algorithm. Surface milling experiments comparing this method with conventional techniques indicate a 15.63% improvement in scallop height uniformity while reducing machining time, average spindle impact, and spindle impact variance by up to 7.36%, 27.79%, and 55.98%, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>The r...</summary><p>The revised manuscript has improved the quality of the figures</p></details> |
| **[IMPACT: Behavioral Intention-aware Multimodal Trajectory Prediction with Adaptive Context Trimming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09103v1)** | 2025-04-12 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2504.09103v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While most prior research has focused on improving the precision of multimodal trajectory predictions, the explicit modeling of multimodal behavioral intentions (e.g., yielding, overtaking) remains relatively underexplored. This paper proposes a unified framework that jointly predicts both behavioral intentions and trajectories to enhance prediction accuracy, interpretability, and efficiency. Specifically, we employ a shared context encoder for both intention and trajectory predictions, thereby reducing structural redundancy and information loss. Moreover, we address the lack of ground-truth behavioral intention labels in mainstream datasets (Waymo, Argoverse) by auto-labeling these datasets, thus advancing the community's efforts in this direction. We further introduce a vectorized occupancy prediction module that infers the probability of each map polyline being occupied by the target vehicle's future trajectory. By leveraging these intention and occupancy prediction priors, our method conducts dynamic, modality-dependent pruning of irrelevant agents and map polylines in the decoding stage, effectively reducing computational overhead and mitigating noise from non-critical elements. Our approach ranks first among LiDAR-free methods on the Waymo Motion Dataset and achieves first place on the Waymo Interactive Prediction Dataset. Remarkably, even without model ensembling, our single-model framework improves the soft mean average precision (softmAP) by 10 percent compared to the second-best method in the Waymo Interactive Prediction Leaderboard. Furthermore, the proposed framework has been successfully deployed on real vehicles, demonstrating its practical effectiveness in real-world applications.</p></details> | under review |

In this paper, we propose a novel method for trajectory synthesis by adapting the Time-Based Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (TimeVQVAE). Our approach leverages time-frequency domain processing, vector quantization, and transformer-based priors to capture both global and local dynamics in flight data. By discretizing the latent space and integrating transformer priors, the model learns long-range spatiotemporal dependencies and preserves coherence across entire flight paths. We evaluate the adapted TimeVQVAE using an extensive suite of quality, statistical, and distributional metrics, as well as a flyability assessment conducted in an open-source air traffic simulator. Results indicate that TimeVQVAE outperforms a temporal convolutional VAE baseline, generating synthetic trajectories that mirror real flight data in terms of spatial accuracy, temporal consistency, and statistical properties. Furthermore, the simulator-based assessment shows that most generated trajectories maintain operational feasibility, although occasional outliers underscore the potential need for additional domain-specific constraints. Overall, our findings underscore the importance of multi-scale representation learning for capturing complex flight behaviors and demonstrate the promise of TimeVQVAE in producing representative synthetic trajectories for downstream tasks such as model training, airspace design, and air traffic forecasting.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper was presented at the 25th Integrated Communications, Navigation and Surveillance Conference (ICNS 2025), April 8--10, 2025, Brussels, Belgium</p></details> |

Evaluating web agents trajectories is an important problem, since it helps us determine whether the agent successfully completed the tasks. Rule-based methods are widely used for this purpose, but they are challenging to extend to new tasks and may not always recognize successful trajectories. We may achieve higher accuracy through human evaluation, but the process would be substantially slower and more expensive. Automatic evaluations with LLMs may avoid the challenges of designing new rules and manually annotating trajectories, enabling faster and cost-effective evaluation. However, it is unclear how effective they are at evaluating web agents. To this end, we propose AgentRewardBench, the first benchmark to assess the effectiveness of LLM judges for evaluating web agents. AgentRewardBench contains 1302 trajectories across 5 benchmarks and 4 LLMs. Each trajectory in AgentRewardBench is reviewed by an expert, who answers questions pertaining to the success, side effects, and repetitiveness of the agent. Using our benchmark, we evaluate 12 LLM judges and find that no single LLM excels across all benchmarks. We also find that the rule-based evaluation used by common benchmarks tends to underreport the success rate of web agents, highlighting a key weakness of rule-based evaluation and the need to develop more flexible automatic evaluations. We release the benchmark at: https://agent-reward-bench.github.io</p></details> |  |

In This paper, an adaptive transpose Jacobian approach is proposed to deal with the dynamic model complexity, which utilizes an adaptive PI-algorithm to adjust the control gains. The performance of the proposed control algorithm is compared with the conventional transpose Jacobian and sliding mode control algorithms and evaluated by the root mean square of the errors and control input energy criteria. In order to appraise the effectiveness of the proposed control system, simulations are carried out in MATLAB/Simulink software for a quadruped robot leg for semi-elliptical path tracking. The obtained results show that the proposed adaptive transpose Jacobian reduces the overshoot and root mean square of the errors and at the same time, decreases the control input energy. Moreover, transpose Jacobin and adaptive transpose Jacobian are more robust to changes in initial conditions compared to the conventional sliding mode control. Furthermore, sliding mode control performs well up to 20% uncertainties in the parameters due to its model-based nature, whereas the transpose Jacobin and the proposed adaptive transpose Jacobian algorithms show promising results even in higher mass uncertainties.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in IEEE Xplore</p></details> |

Thereby, kinematic constraints with respect to velocity, acceleration and jerk are taken into account. The trajectories are composed of several motion primitives, the most crucial of which is termed jerk segment. Within this contribution, the focus is put on the composition of the overall trajectories, assuming the required motion primitives to be readily available. Since the scheme considered is not time-optimal, even decreasing particular constraints can reduce the overall transition time, which is analysed in detail. This observation implies that replanning of the underlying jerk segments is required as an integral part of the motion planning scheme, further insight into which has been analysed in a complementary contribution. Although the proposed scheme is not time-optimal, it allows for significantly shorter transition times than established methods, such as zero-vibration shaping, while requiring significantly lower computational power than a fully time-optimal scheme.</p></details> |  |

The proposed filter, the trajectory measurement PMBM (TM-PMBM) filter, propagates a PMBM density on the set of target states. In prediction, the filter obtains the PMBM density on the set of trajectories over the last two time steps. This density is then updated with the set of trajectory measurements. After the update step, the PMBM posterior on the set of two-step trajectories is marginalised to obtain a PMBM density on the set of target states. The filter provides a closed-form solution for multi-target filtering based on sets of trajectory measurements, estimating the set of target states at the end of each time window. Additionally, the paper proposes computationally lighter alternatives to the TM-PMBM filter by deriving a Poisson multi-Bernoulli (PMB) density through Kullback-Leibler divergence minimisation in an augmented space with auxiliary variables. The performance of the proposed filters are evaluated in a simulation study.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 7 figures, journal paper</p></details> |

Moreover, incorporating prior information input into such perception model represents an effective approach to ensure the robustness and accuracy. However, utilizing diverse sources of prior information still faces three key challenges: the acquisition of high-quality prior information, alignment between prior and online perception, efficient integration. To address these issues, we investigate prior augmentation from a novel perspective of trajectory priors. In this paper, we initially extract crowdsourcing trajectory data from Argoverse2 motion forecasting dataset and encode trajectory data into rasterized heatmap and vectorized instance tokens, then we incorporate such prior information into the online mapping model through different ways. Besides, with the purpose of mitigating the misalignment between prior and online perception, we design a confidence-based fusion module that takes alignment into account during the fusion process. We conduct extensive experiments on OpenLane-V2 dataset. The results indicate that our method's performance significantly outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods.

However, estimating trajectories of brain biomarkers is challenging due to biological variability, inconsistencies in measurement protocols (e.g., differences in MRI scanners), scarcity, and irregularity in longitudinal measurements. Herein, we introduce a novel personalized deep kernel regression framework for forecasting brain biomarkers, with application to regional volumetric measurements. Our approach integrates two key components: a population model that captures brain trajectories from a large and diverse cohort, and a subject-specific model that captures individual trajectories. To optimally combine these, we propose Adaptive Shrinkage Estimation, which effectively balances population and subject-specific models. We assess our model's performance through predictive accuracy metrics, uncertainty quantification, and validation against external clinical studies. Benchmarking against state-of-the-art statistical and machine learning models -- including linear mixed effects models, generalized additive models, and deep learning methods -- demonstrates the superior predictive performance of our approach. Additionally, we apply our method to predict trajectories of composite neuroimaging biomarkers, which highlights the versatility of our approach in modeling the progression of longitudinal neuroimaging biomarkers. Furthermore, validation on three external neuroimaging studies confirms the robustness of our method across different clinical contexts.

In cinematography, Directors of Photography meticulously craft camera movements to achieve expressive and intentional framing. However, existing methods for camera trajectory generation remain limited: Traditional approaches rely on geometric optimization or handcrafted procedural systems, while recent learning-based methods often inherit structural biases or lack textual alignment, constraining creative synthesis. In this work, we introduce an auto-regressive model inspired by the expertise of Directors of Photography to generate artistic and expressive camera trajectories. We first introduce DataDoP, a large-scale multi-modal dataset containing 29K real-world shots with free-moving camera trajectories, depth maps, and detailed captions in specific movements, interaction with the scene, and directorial intent. Thanks to the comprehensive and diverse database, we further train an auto-regressive, decoder-only Transformer for high-quality, context-aware camera movement generation based on text guidance and RGBD inputs, named GenDoP. Extensive experiments demonstrate that compared to existing methods, GenDoP offers better controllability, finer-grained trajectory adjustments, and higher motion stability. We believe our approach establishes a new standard for learning-based cinematography, paving the way for future advancements in camera control and filmmaking.
