Specifically, despite impressive results shown by the mass literature, developers often find it hard to ensure the safe deployment of these learning-based perception models. Attributing the challenge to the lack of safety-oriented metrics, we hereby present uncompromising spatial constraints (USC), which characterize a simple yet important localization requirement demanding the predictions to fully cover the objects when seen from the autonomous vehicle. The constraints, as we formulate using the perspective and bird's-eye views, can be naturally reflected by quantitative measures, such that having an object detector with a higher score implies a lower risk of collision. Finally, beyond model evaluation, we incorporate the quantitative measures into common loss functions to enable safety-oriented fine-tuning for existing models. With experiments using the nuScenes dataset and a closed-loop simulation, our work demonstrates such considerations of safety notions at the perception level not only improve model performances beyond accuracy but also allow for a more direct linkage to actual system safety.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages (IEEE double column format), 7 figures, 2 tables, submitted to ITSC 2024</p></details> |
| **[Quantifying Spatial Domain Explanations in BCI using Earth Mover's Distance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01277v1)** | 2024-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Brain-computer interface (BCI) systems facilitate unique communication between humans and computers, benefiting severely disabled individuals. Despite decades of research, BCIs are not fully integrated into clinical and commercial settings. It's crucial to assess and explain BCI performance, offering clear explanations for potential users to avoid frustration when it doesn't work as expected. This work investigates the efficacy of different deep learning and Riemannian geometry-based classification models in the context of motor imagery (MI) based BCI using electroencephalography (EEG). We then propose an optimal transport theory-based approach using earth mover's distance (EMD) to quantify the comparison of the feature relevance map with the domain knowledge of neuroscience. For this, we utilized explainable AI (XAI) techniques for generating feature relevance in the spatial domain to identify important channels for model outcomes. Three state-of-the-art models are implemented - 1) Riemannian geometry-based classifier, 2) EEGNet, and 3) EEG Conformer, and the observed trend in the model's accuracy across different architectures on the dataset correlates with the proposed feature relevance metrics. The models with diverse architectures perform significantly better when trained on channels relevant to motor imagery than data-driven channel selection. This work focuses attention on the necessity for interpretability and incorporating metrics beyond accuracy, underscores the value of combining domain knowledge and quantifying model interpretations with data-driven approaches in creating reliable and robust Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs).</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures, 3 tables, draft of the accepted work at IJCNN, WCCI 2024</p></details> |
| **[Learning-to-solve unit commitment based on few-shot physics-guided spatial-temporal graph convolution network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01200v1)** | 2024-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This letter proposes a few-shot physics-guided spatial temporal graph convolutional network (FPG-STGCN) to fast solve unit commitment (UC). Firstly, STGCN is tailored to parameterize UC. Then, few-shot physics-guided learning scheme is proposed. It exploits few typical UC solutions yielded via commercial optimizer to escape from local minimum, and leverages the augmented Lagrangian method for constraint satisfaction. To further enable both feasibility and continuous relaxation for integers in learning process, straight-through estimator for Tanh-Sign composition is proposed to fully differentiate the mixed integer solution space. Case study on the IEEE benchmark justifies that, our method bests mainstream learning ways on UC feasibility, and surpasses traditional solver on efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[CoViS-Net: A Cooperative Visual Spatial Foundation Model for Multi-Robot Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01107v1)** | 2024-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial understanding from vision is crucial for robots operating in unstructured environments. In the real world, spatial understanding is often an ill-posed problem. There are a number of powerful classical methods that accurately regress relative pose, however, these approaches often lack the ability to leverage data-derived priors to resolve ambiguities. In multi-robot systems, these challenges are exacerbated by the need for accurate and frequent position estimates of cooperating agents. To this end, we propose CoViS-Net, a cooperative, multi-robot, visual spatial foundation model that learns spatial priors from data. Unlike prior work evaluated primarily on offline datasets, we design our model specifically for online evaluation and real-world deployment on cooperative robots. Our model is completely decentralized, platform agnostic, executable in real-time using onboard compute, and does not require existing network infrastructure. In this work, we focus on relative pose estimation and local Bird's Eye View (BEV) prediction tasks. Unlike classical approaches, we show that our model can accurately predict relative poses without requiring camera overlap, and predict BEVs of regions not visible to the ego-agent. We demonstrate our model on a multi-robot formation control task outside the confines of the laboratory.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatial Joint Species N-Mixture Models for Multi-Source Observational Data with Application to Wild Deer Population Abundance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19993v3)** | 2024-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate predictions of the populations and spatial distributions of wild animal species is critical from a species management and conservation perspective. Culling is a measure taken for various reasons, including when overpopulation of a species is observed or suspected. Thus accurate estimates of population numbers are essential for specifying, monitoring, and evaluating the impact of such programmes. Population data for wild animals is generally collated from various sources and at differing spatial resolutions. Citizen science projects typically provide point referenced data, whereas site surveys, hunter reports, and official government data may be aggregated and released at a small area or regional level. Jointly modelling these data resources involves overcoming challenges of spatial misalignment. In this article, we develop an N mixture modelling methodology for joint modelling of species populations in the presence of spatially misaligned data, motivated by the three main species of wild deer in the Republic of Ireland; fallow, red and sika. Previous studies of deer populations investigated the distribution and abundance on a species by species basis, failing to account for possible correlation between individual species and the impact of ecological covariates on their distributions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Individual-level models of disease transmission incorporating piecewise spatial risk functions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00835v1)** | 2024-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modelling epidemics is crucial for understanding the emergence, transmission, impact and control of diseases. Spatial individual-level models (ILMs) that account for population heterogeneity are a useful tool, accounting for factors such as location, vaccination status and genetic information. Parametric forms for spatial risk functions, or kernels, are often used, but rely on strong assumptions about underlying transmission mechanisms. Here, we propose a class of non-parametric spatial disease transmission model, fitted within a Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) framework, allowing for more flexible assumptions when estimating the effect on spatial distance and infection risk. We focus upon two specific forms of non-parametric spatial infection kernel: piecewise constant and piecewise linear. Although these are relatively simple forms, we find them effective. The performance of these models is examined using simulated data, including under circumstances of model misspecification, and then applied to data from the UK 2001 foot-and-mouth disease.</p></details> |  |
| **[Raster Interval Object Approximations for Spatial Intersection Joins](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01716v2)** | 2024-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial join processing techniques that identify intersections between complex geometries (e.g.,polygons) commonly follow a two-step filter-and-refine pipeline; the filter step evaluates the query predicate on the minimum bounding rectangles (MBRs) of objects and the refinement step eliminates false positives by applying the query on the exact geometries. We propose a raster intervals approximation of object geometries and introduce a powerful intermediate step in pipeline. In a preprocessing phase, our method (i) rasterizes each object geometry using a fine grid, (ii) models groups of nearby cells that intersect the polygon as an interval, and (iii) encodes each interval by a bitstring that captures the overlap of each cell in it with the polygon. Going one step further, we improve our approach to approximate each object by two sets of intervals that succintly capture the raster cells which (i) intersect with the object and (ii) are fully contained in the object. Using this representation, we show that we can verify whether two polygons intersect by a sequence of joins between the interval sets that take linear time. Our approximations can effectively be compressed and can be customized for use on partitioned data and polygons of varying sizes, rasterized at different granularities. Finally, we propose a novel algorithm that computes the interval approximation of a polygon without fully rasterizing it first, rendering the computation of approximations orders of magnitude faster. Experiments on real data demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposal over previous work.</p></details> | 34 pages |
| **[Probabilistic Design of Multi-Dimensional Spatially-Coupled Codes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15166v3)** | 2024-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Because of their excellent asymptotic and finite-length performance, spatially-coupled (SC) codes are a class of low-density parity-check codes that is gaining increasing attention. Multi-dimensional (MD) SC codes are constructed by connecting copies of an SC code via relocations in order to mitigate various sources of non-uniformity and improve performance in many data storage and data transmission systems. As the number of degrees of freedom in the MD-SC code design increases, appropriately exploiting them becomes more difficult because of the complexity growth of the design process. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic framework for the MD-SC code design, which is based on the gradient-descent (GD) algorithm, to design better MD codes and address this challenge. In particular, we express the expected number of short cycles, which we seek to minimize, in the graph representation of the code in terms of entries of a probability-distribution matrix that characterizes the MD-SC code design. We then find a locally-optimal probability distribution, which serves as the starting point of a finite-length algorithmic optimizer that produces the final MD-SC code. We offer the theoretical analysis as well as the algorithms, and we present experimental results demonstrating that our MD codes, conveniently called GD-MD codes, have notably lower short cycle numbers compared with the available state-of-the-art. Moreover, our algorithms converge on solutions in few iterations, which confirms the complexity reduction as a result of limiting the search space via the locally-optimal GD-MD distributions.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages (double column), 5 figures, the short version has been accepted at the IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory (ISIT)</p></details> |
| **[Semantic-guided modeling of spatial relation and object co-occurrence for indoor scene recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.12661v3)** | 2024-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Exploring the semantic context in scene images is essential for indoor scene recognition. However, due to the diverse intra-class spatial layouts and the coexisting inter-class objects, modeling contextual relationships to adapt various image characteristics is a great challenge. Existing contextual modeling methods for scene recognition exhibit two limitations: 1) They typically model only one kind of spatial relationship among objects within scenes in an artificially predefined manner, with limited exploration of diverse spatial layouts. 2) They often overlook the differences in coexisting objects across different scenes, suppressing scene recognition performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose SpaCoNet, which simultaneously models Spatial relation and Co-occurrence of objects guided by semantic segmentation. Firstly, the Semantic Spatial Relation Module (SSRM) is constructed to model scene spatial features. With the help of semantic segmentation, this module decouples the spatial information from the scene image and thoroughly explores all spatial relationships among objects in an end-to-end manner. Secondly, both spatial features from the SSRM and deep features from the Image Feature Extraction Module are allocated to each object, so as to distinguish the coexisting object across different scenes. Finally, utilizing the discriminative features above, we design a Global-Local Dependency Module to explore the long-range co-occurrence among objects, and further generate a semantic-guided feature representation for indoor scene recognition. Experimental results on three widely used scene datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of the proposed method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Continuous sPatial-Temporal Deformable Image Registration (CPT-DIR) for motion modelling in radiotherapy: beyond classic voxel-based methods](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00430v1)** | 2024-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Background and purpose: Deformable image registration (DIR) is a crucial tool in radiotherapy for extracting and modelling organ motion. However, when significant changes and sliding boundaries are present, it faces compromised accuracy and uncertainty, determining the subsequential contour propagation and dose accumulation procedures. Materials and methods: We propose an implicit neural representation (INR)-based approach modelling motion continuously in both space and time, named Continues-sPatial-Temporal DIR (CPT-DIR). This method uses a multilayer perception (MLP) network to map 3D coordinate (x,y,z) to its corresponding velocity vector (vx,vy,vz). The displacement vectors (dx,dy,dz) are then calculated by integrating velocity vectors over time. The MLP's parameters can rapidly adapt to new cases without pre-training, enhancing optimisation. The DIR's performance was tested on the DIR-Lab dataset of 10 lung 4DCT cases, using metrics of landmark accuracy (TRE), contour conformity (Dice) and image similarity (MAE). Results: The proposed CPT-DIR can reduce landmark TRE from 2.79mm to 0.99mm, outperforming B-splines' results for all cases. The MAE of the whole-body region improves from 35.46HU to 28.99HU. Furthermore, CPT-DIR surpasses B-splines for accuracy in the sliding boundary region, lowering MAE and increasing Dice coefficients for the ribcage from 65.65HU and 90.41% to 42.04HU and 90.56%, versus 75.40HU and 89.30% without registration. Meanwhile, CPT-DIR offers significant speed advantages, completing in under 15 seconds compared to a few minutes with the conventional B-splines method. Conclusion: Leveraging the continuous representations, the CPT-DIR method significantly enhances registration accuracy, automation and speed, outperforming traditional B-splines in landmark and contour precision, particularly in the challenging areas.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatial-Temporal Extreme Modeling for Point-to-Area Random Effects (PARE)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17271v2)** | 2024-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One measurement modality for rainfall is a fixed location rain gauge. However, extreme rainfall, flooding, and other climate extremes often occur at larger spatial scales and affect more than one location in a community. For example, in 2017 Hurricane Harvey impacted all of Houston and the surrounding region causing widespread flooding. Flood risk modeling requires understanding of rainfall for hydrologic regions, which may contain one or more rain gauges. Further, policy changes to address the risks and damages of natural hazards such as severe flooding are usually made at the community/neighborhood level or higher geo-spatial scale. Therefore, spatial-temporal methods which convert results from one spatial scale to another are especially useful in applications for evolving environmental extremes. We develop a point-to-area random effects (PARE) modeling strategy for understanding spatial-temporal extreme values at the areal level, when the core information are time series at point locations distributed over the region.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 9 tables, 4 figures</p></details> |
| **[Balancing Spectral, Temporal and Spatial Information for EEG-based Alzheimer's Disease Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13523v2)** | 2024-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The prospect of future treatment warrants the development of cost-effective screening for Alzheimer's disease (AD). A promising candidate in this regard is electroencephalography (EEG), as it is one of the most economic imaging modalities. Recent efforts in EEG analysis have shifted towards leveraging spatial information, employing novel frameworks such as graph signal processing or graph neural networks. Here, we investigate the importance of spatial information relative to spectral or temporal information by varying the proportion of each dimension for AD classification. To do so, we systematically test various dimension resolution configurations on two routine EEG datasets. Our findings show that spatial information is more important than temporal information and equally valuable as spectral information. On the larger second dataset, substituting spectral with spatial information even led to an increase of 1.1% in accuracy, which emphasises the importance of spatial information for EEG-based AD classification. We argue that our resolution-based feature extraction has the potential to improve AD classification specifically, and multivariate signal classification generally.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 pag...</summary><p>4 pages, 3 figures, conference paper</p></details> |
| **[SCTransNet: Spatial-channel Cross Transformer Network for Infrared Small Target Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15583v3)** | 2024-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Infrared small target detection (IRSTD) has recently benefitted greatly from U-shaped neural models. However, largely overlooking effective global information modeling, existing techniques struggle when the target has high similarities with the background. We present a Spatial-channel Cross Transformer Network (SCTransNet) that leverages spatial-channel cross transformer blocks (SCTBs) on top of long-range skip connections to address the aforementioned challenge. In the proposed SCTBs, the outputs of all encoders are interacted with cross transformer to generate mixed features, which are redistributed to all decoders to effectively reinforce semantic differences between the target and clutter at full scales. Specifically, SCTB contains the following two key elements: (a) spatial-embedded single-head channel-cross attention (SSCA) for exchanging local spatial features and full-level global channel information to eliminate ambiguity among the encoders and facilitate high-level semantic associations of the images, and (b) a complementary feed-forward network (CFN) for enhancing the feature discriminability via a multi-scale strategy and cross-spatial-channel information interaction to promote beneficial information transfer. Our SCTransNet effectively encodes the semantic differences between targets and backgrounds to boost its internal representation for detecting small infrared targets accurately. Extensive experiments on three public datasets, NUDT-SIRST, NUAA-SIRST, and IRSTD-1k, demonstrate that the proposed SCTransNet outperforms existing IRSTD methods. Our code will be made public at https://github.com/xdFai.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Modeling of Spatial Extremes over Large Geographical Domains](http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.10248v3)** | 2024-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Various natural phenomena exhibit spatial extremal dependence at short spatial distances. However, existing models proposed in the spatial extremes literature often assume that extremal dependence persists across the entire domain. This is a strong limitation when modeling extremes over large geographical domains, and yet it has been mostly overlooked in the literature. We here develop a more realistic Bayesian framework based on a novel Gaussian scale mixture model, with the Gaussian process component defined by a stochastic partial differential equation yielding a sparse precision matrix, and the random scale component modeled as a low-rank Pareto-tailed or Weibull-tailed spatial process determined by compactly-supported basis functions. We show that our proposed model is approximately tail-stationary and that it can capture a wide range of extremal dependence structures. Its inherently sparse structure allows fast Bayesian computations in high spatial dimensions based on a customized Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm prioritizing calibration in the tail. We fit our model to analyze heavy monsoon rainfall data in Bangladesh. Our study shows that our model outperforms natural competitors and that it fits precipitation extremes well. We finally use the fitted model to draw inference on long-term return levels for marginal precipitation and spatial aggregates.</p></details> |  |
| **[Flexible Modeling of Nonstationary Extremal Dependence using Spatially-Fused LASSO and Ridge Penalties](http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.05792v3)** | 2024-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Statistical modeling of a nonstationary spatial extremal dependence structure is challenging. Max-stable processes are common choices for modeling spatially-indexed block maxima, where an assumption of stationarity is usual to make inference feasible. However, this assumption is often unrealistic for data observed over a large or complex domain. We propose a computationally-efficient method for estimating extremal dependence using a globally nonstationary, but locally-stationary, max-stable process by exploiting nonstationary kernel convolutions. We divide the spatial domain into a fine grid of subregions, assign each of them its own dependence parameters, and use LASSO ($L_1$) or ridge ($L_2$) penalties to obtain spatially-smooth parameter estimates. We then develop a novel data-driven algorithm to merge homogeneous neighboring subregions. The algorithm facilitates model parsimony and interpretability. To make our model suitable for high-dimensional data, we exploit a pairwise likelihood to draw inferences and discuss computational and statistical efficiency. An extensive simulation study demonstrates the superior performance of our proposed model and the subregion-merging algorithm over the approaches that either do not model nonstationarity or do not update the domain partition. We apply our proposed method to model monthly maximum temperatures at over 1400 sites in Nepal and the surrounding Himalayan and sub-Himalayan regions; we again observe significant improvements in model fit compared to a stationary process and a nonstationary process without subregion-merging. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the estimated merged partition is interpretable from a geographic perspective and leads to better model diagnostics by adequately reducing the number of subregion-specific parameters.</p></details> |  |
| **[Masked Spatial Propagation Network for Sparsity-Adaptive Depth Refinement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19294v1)** | 2024-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The main function of depth completion is to compensate for an insufficient and unpredictable number of sparse depth measurements of hardware sensors. However, existing research on depth completion assumes that the sparsity -- the number of points or LiDAR lines -- is fixed for training and testing. Hence, the completion performance drops severely when the number of sparse depths changes significantly. To address this issue, we propose the sparsity-adaptive depth refinement (SDR) framework, which refines monocular depth estimates using sparse depth points. For SDR, we propose the masked spatial propagation network (MSPN) to perform SDR with a varying number of sparse depths effectively by gradually propagating sparse depth information throughout the entire depth map. Experimental results demonstrate that MPSN achieves state-of-the-art performance on both SDR and conventional depth completion scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Micro-Macro Spatial-Temporal Graph-based Encoder-Decoder for Map-Constrained Trajectory Recovery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19141v1)** | 2024-04-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recovering intermediate missing GPS points in a sparse trajectory, while adhering to the constraints of the road network, could offer deep insights into users' moving behaviors in intelligent transportation systems. Although recent studies have demonstrated the advantages of achieving map-constrained trajectory recovery via an end-to-end manner, they still face two significant challenges. Firstly, existing methods are mostly sequence-based models. It is extremely hard for them to comprehensively capture the micro-semantics of individual trajectory, including the information of each GPS point and the movement between two GPS points. Secondly, existing approaches ignore the impact of the macro-semantics, i.e., the road conditions and the people's shared travel preferences reflected by a group of trajectories. To address the above challenges, we propose a Micro-Macro Spatial-Temporal Graph-based Encoder-Decoder (MM-STGED). Specifically, we model each trajectory as a graph to efficiently describe the micro-semantics of trajectory and design a novel message-passing mechanism to learn trajectory representations. Additionally, we extract the macro-semantics of trajectories and further incorporate them into a well-designed graph-based decoder to guide trajectory recovery. Extensive experiments conducted on sparse trajectories with three different sampling intervals that are respectively constructed from two real-world trajectory datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed model.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted as a regular paper at IEEE TKDE</p></details> |
| **[Spectral-Spatial Mamba for Hyperspectral Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18401v1)** | 2024-04-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, deep learning models have achieved excellent performance in hyperspectral image (HSI) classification. Among the many deep models, Transformer has gradually attracted interest for its excellence in modeling the long-range dependencies of spatial-spectral features in HSI. However, Transformer has the problem of quadratic computational complexity due to the self-attention mechanism, which is heavier than other models and thus has limited adoption in HSI processing. Fortunately, the recently emerging state space model-based Mamba shows great computational efficiency while achieving the modeling power of Transformers. Therefore, in this paper, we make a preliminary attempt to apply the Mamba to HSI classification, leading to the proposed spectral-spatial Mamba (SS-Mamba). Specifically, the proposed SS-Mamba mainly consists of spectral-spatial token generation module and several stacked spectral-spatial Mamba blocks. Firstly, the token generation module converts any given HSI cube to spatial and spectral tokens as sequences. And then these tokens are sent to stacked spectral-spatial mamba blocks (SS-MB). Each SS-MB block consists of two basic mamba blocks and a spectral-spatial feature enhancement module. The spatial and spectral tokens are processed separately by the two basic mamba blocks, respectively. Besides, the feature enhancement module modulates spatial and spectral tokens using HSI sample's center region information. In this way, the spectral and spatial tokens cooperate with each other and achieve information fusion within each block. The experimental results conducted on widely used HSI datasets reveal that the proposed model achieves competitive results compared with the state-of-the-art methods. The Mamba-based method opens a new window for HSI classification.</p></details> | 12 pages |
| **[S$^2$Mamba: A Spatial-spectral State Space Model for Hyperspectral Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18213v1)** | 2024-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Land cover analysis using hyperspectral images (HSI) remains an open problem due to their low spatial resolution and complex spectral information. Recent studies are primarily dedicated to designing Transformer-based architectures for spatial-spectral long-range dependencies modeling, which is computationally expensive with quadratic complexity. Selective structured state space model (Mamba), which is efficient for modeling long-range dependencies with linear complexity, has recently shown promising progress. However, its potential in hyperspectral image processing that requires handling numerous spectral bands has not yet been explored. In this paper, we innovatively propose S$^2$Mamba, a spatial-spectral state space model for hyperspectral image classification, to excavate spatial-spectral contextual features, resulting in more efficient and accurate land cover analysis. In S$^2$Mamba, two selective structured state space models through different dimensions are designed for feature extraction, one for spatial, and the other for spectral, along with a spatial-spectral mixture gate for optimal fusion. More specifically, S$^2$Mamba first captures spatial contextual relations by interacting each pixel with its adjacent through a Patch Cross Scanning module and then explores semantic information from continuous spectral bands through a Bi-directional Spectral Scanning module. Considering the distinct expertise of the two attributes in homogenous and complicated texture scenes, we realize the Spatial-spectral Mixture Gate by a group of learnable matrices, allowing for the adaptive incorporation of representations learned across different dimensions. Extensive experiments conducted on HSI classification benchmarks demonstrate the superiority and prospect of S$^2$Mamba. The code will be available at: https://github.com/PURE-melo/S2Mamba.</p></details> | 13 pages, 9 figures |

Accurate prediction of spatiotemporal series remains challenging due to the complex spatiotemporal heterogeneity. In particular, current end-to-end models are limited by input length and thus often fall into spatiotemporal mirage, i.e., similar input time series followed by dissimilar future values and vice versa. To address these problems, we propose a novel self-supervised pre-training framework Spatial-Temporal-Decoupled Masked Pre-training (STD-MAE) that employs two decoupled masked autoencoders to reconstruct spatiotemporal series along the spatial and temporal dimensions. Rich-context representations learned through such reconstruction could be seamlessly integrated by downstream predictors with arbitrary architectures to augment their performances. A series of quantitative and qualitative evaluations on six widely used benchmarks (PEMS03, PEMS04, PEMS07, PEMS08, METR-LA, and PEMS-BAY) are conducted to validate the state-of-the-art performance of STD-MAE.

We previously proposed the cardinality leap of possibility spaces as a promising mechanism to facilitate open-endedness in artificial evolutionary systems, and demonstrated its effectiveness using Hash Chemistry, an artificial chemistry model that used a hash function as a universal fitness evaluator. However, the spatial nature of Hash Chemistry came with extensive computational costs involved in its simulation, and the particle density limit imposed to prevent explosion of computational costs prevented unbounded growth in complexity of higher-order entities. To address these limitations, here we propose a simpler non-spatial variant of Hash Chemistry in which spatial proximity of particles are represented explicitly in the form of multisets. This model modification achieved a significant reduction of computational costs in simulating the model. Results of numerical simulations showed much more significant unbounded growth in both maximal and average sizes of replicating higher-order entities than the original model, demonstrating the effectiveness of this non-spatial model as a minimalistic example of open-ended evolutionary systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 6 figures, 1 table; accepted for publication in Proceedings of IEEE CEC 2024 (part of IEEE WCCI 2024)</p></details> |

Their natural integration, termed integrated sensing and edge AI (ISEA), promised to create a platform for enabling environment perception to make intelligent decisions and take real-time actions. A basic operation in ISEA is for a fusion center to acquire and fuse features of spatial sensing data distributed at many agents. To overcome its communication bottleneck due to multiple access by numerous agents over hostile wireless channels, we propose a novel framework, called Spatial Over-the-Air Fusion (Spatial AirFusion), which exploits radio waveform superposition to aggregate spatially sparse features over the air. The technology is more sophisticated than conventional Over-the-Air Computing (AirComp) as it supports simultaneous aggregation over multiple voxels, which partition the 3D sensing region, and across multiple subcarriers. Its efficiency and robustness are derived from exploitation of both spatial feature sparsity and multiuser channel diversity to intelligently pair voxel-level aggregation tasks and subcarriers to maximize the minimum receive SNR among voxels under instantaneous power constraints. To optimally solve the mixed-integer Voxel-Carrier Pairing and Power Allocation (VoCa-PPA) problem, the proposed approach hinges on two useful results: (1) deriving the optimal power allocation as a closed-form function of voxel-carrier pairing and (2) discovering a useful property of VoCa-PPA that dramatically reduces the solution-space dimensionality. Both a low-complexity greedy algorithm and an optimal tree-search based approach are designed for VoCa-PPA. Extensive simulations using real datasets show that Spatial AirFusion achieves significant error reduction and accuracy improvement compared with conventional AirComp without awareness of spatial sparsity.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

Despite their effectiveness, their adoption has not been pervasive because of scalability challenges associated with large-scale graph datasets, particularly when leveraging message passing. To tackle these challenges, we introduce NeuraChip, a novel GNN spatial accelerator based on Gustavson's algorithm. NeuraChip decouples the multiplication and addition computations in sparse matrix multiplication. This separation allows for independent exploitation of their unique data dependencies, facilitating efficient resource allocation. We introduce a rolling eviction strategy to mitigate data idling in on-chip memory as well as address the prevalent issue of memory bloat in sparse graph computations. Furthermore, the compute resource load balancing is achieved through a dynamic reseeding hash-based mapping, ensuring uniform utilization of computing resources agnostic of sparsity patterns. Finally, we present NeuraSim, an open-source, cycle-accurate, multi-threaded, modular simulator for comprehensive performance analysis. Overall, NeuraChip presents a significant improvement, yielding an average speedup of 22.1x over Intel's MKL, 17.1x over NVIDIA's cuSPARSE, 16.7x over AMD's hipSPARSE, and 1.5x over prior state-of-the-art SpGEMM accelerator and 1.3x over GNN accelerator.

| **[Spatial-frequency Dual-Domain Feature Fusion Network for Low-Light Remote Sensing Image Enhancement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17400v1)** | 2024-04-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Low-light remote sensing images generally feature high resolution and high spatial complexity, with continuously distributed surface features in space. This continuity in scenes leads to extensive long-range correlations in spatial domains within remote sensing images. Convolutional Neural Networks, which rely on local correlations for long-distance modeling, struggle to establish long-range correlations in such images. On the other hand, transformer-based methods that focus on global information face high computational complexities when processing high-resolution remote sensing images. From another perspective, Fourier transform can compute global information without introducing a large number of parameters, enabling the network to more efficiently capture the overall image structure and establish long-range correlations. Therefore, we propose a Dual-Domain Feature Fusion Network (DFFN) for low-light remote sensing image enhancement. Specifically, this challenging task of low-light enhancement is divided into two more manageable sub-tasks: the first phase learns amplitude information to restore image brightness, and the second phase learns phase information to refine details. To facilitate information exchange between the two phases, we designed an information fusion affine block that combines data from different phases and scales. Additionally, we have constructed two dark light remote sensing datasets to address the current lack of datasets in dark light remote sensing image enhancement. Extensive evaluations show that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods. The code is available at https://github.com/iijjlk/DFFN.</p></details> | 14 page |

This integration effectively combines object regions with the corresponding semantic and position layouts derived from segmentation to enhance the visual representation. And the modality-independence guarantees efficiency and generalization. Additionally, 3SHNet utilizes the structured contextual visual scene information from segmentation to conduct the local (region-based) or global (grid-based) guidance and achieve accurate hybrid-level retrieval. Extensive experiments conducted on MS-COCO and Flickr30K benchmarks substantiate the superior performances, inference efficiency and generalization of the proposed 3SHNet when juxtaposed with contemporary state-of-the-art methodologies. Specifically, on the larger MS-COCO 5K test set, we achieve 16.3%, 24.8%, and 18.3% improvements in terms of rSum score, respectively, compared with the state-of-the-art methods using different image representations, while maintaining optimal retrieval efficiency. Moreover, our performance on cross-dataset generalization improves by 18.6%.

| **[Guided Interpretable Facial Expression Recognition via Spatial Action Unit Cues](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00281v3)** | 2024-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although state-of-the-art classifiers for facial expression recognition (FER) can achieve a high level of accuracy, they lack interpretability, an important feature for end-users. Experts typically associate spatial action units (\aus) from a codebook to facial regions for the visual interpretation of expressions. In this paper, the same expert steps are followed. A new learning strategy is proposed to explicitly incorporate \au cues into classifier training, allowing to train deep interpretable models. During training, this \au codebook is used, along with the input image expression label, and facial landmarks, to construct a \au heatmap that indicates the most discriminative image regions of interest w.r.t the facial expression. This valuable spatial cue is leveraged to train a deep interpretable classifier for FER. This is achieved by constraining the spatial layer features of a classifier to be correlated with \au heatmaps. Using a composite loss, the classifier is trained to correctly classify an image while yielding interpretable visual layer-wise attention correlated with \au maps, simulating the expert decision process. Our strategy only relies on image class expression for supervision, without additional manual annotations. Our new strategy is generic, and can be applied to any deep CNN- or transformer-based classifier without requiring any architectural change or significant additional training time. Our extensive evaluation on two public benchmarks \rafdb, and \affectnet datasets shows that our proposed strategy can improve layer-wise interpretability without degrading classification performance. In addition, we explore a common type of interpretable classifiers that rely on class activation mapping (CAM) methods, and show that our approach can also improve CAM interpretability.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 11 figures, 3 tables, International Conference on Automatic Face and Gesture Recognition (FG 2024)</p></details> |

Our approach builds on recent advances in deep learning and leverages the strengths of both sensors to improve object detection performance. Precisely, we extract 2D features from camera images using a state-of-the-art deep learning architecture and then apply a novel Cross-Domain Spatial Matching (CDSM) transformation method to convert these features into 3D space. We then fuse them with extracted radar data using a complementary fusion strategy to produce a final 3D object representation. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we evaluate it on the NuScenes dataset. We compare our approach to both single-sensor performance and current state-of-the-art fusion methods. Our results show that the proposed approach achieves superior performance over single-sensor solutions and could directly compete with other top-level fusion methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages including highlights and graphical abstract, submitted to Expert Systems with Applications journal</p></details> |

The importance is especially high in cases when an object of interest is visually partly or fully covered. Interactions with users of technology are mainly focused on the visual domain of navigation tasks. This paper presents the results of a literature review and user study exploring the impact of spatial auditory navigation on user experience during an augmented outdoor navigation task. For the user test, participants used an augmented reality app guiding them to different locations with different digital augmentation. We conclude that the utilization of the auditory sense is yet still underrepresented in augmented reality applications. In the future, more usage scenarios for audio-augmented reality such as navigation will enhance user experience and interaction quality.</p></details> |  |
| **[Accurate Spatial Gene Expression Prediction by integrating Multi-resolution features](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07592v2)** | 2024-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in Spatial Transcriptomics (ST) technology have facilitated detailed gene expression analysis within tissue contexts. However, the high costs and methodological limitations of ST necessitate a more robust predictive model. In response, this paper introduces TRIPLEX, a novel deep learning framework designed to predict spatial gene expression from Whole Slide Images (WSIs). TRIPLEX uniquely harnesses multi-resolution features, capturing cellular morphology at individual spots, the local context around these spots, and the global tissue organization. By integrating these features through an effective fusion strategy, TRIPLEX achieves accurate gene expression prediction. Our comprehensive benchmark study, conducted on three public ST datasets and supplemented with Visium data from 10X Genomics, demonstrates that TRIPLEX outperforms current state-of-the-art models in Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC). The model's predictions align closely with ground truth gene expression profiles and tumor annotations, underscoring TRIPLEX's potential in advancing cancer diagnosis and treatment.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2024</p></details> |

Many different types of noise exist, each produced by a separate algorithm. In this paper, we present a single generative model which can learn to generate multiple types of noise as well as blend between them. In addition, it is capable of producing spatially-varying noise blends despite not having access to such data for training. These features are enabled by training a denoising diffusion model using a novel combination of data augmentation and network conditioning techniques. Like procedural noise generators, the model's behavior is controllable via interpretable parameters and a source of randomness. We use our model to produce a variety of visually compelling noise textures. We also present an application of our model to improving inverse procedural material design; using our model in place of fixed-type noise nodes in a procedural material graph results in higher-fidelity material reconstructions without needing to know the type of noise in advance.</p></details> | <details><summary>In AC...</summary><p>In ACM Transactions on Graphics (Proceedings of SIGGRAPH) 2024, 21 pages</p></details> |

Such extension is challenging; the hierarchy of concepts that describe an outdoor environment is more complex than for indoors, and manually defining such hierarchy is time-consuming and does not scale. Furthermore, the lack of training data prevents the straightforward application of learning-based tools used in indoor settings. To address these challenges, we propose two novel extensions. First, we develop methods to build a spatial ontology defining concepts and relations relevant for indoor and outdoor robot operation. In particular, we use a Large Language Model (LLM) to build such an ontology, thus largely reducing the amount of manual effort required. Second, we leverage the spatial ontology for 3D scene graph construction using Logic Tensor Networks (LTN) to add logical rules, or axioms (e.g., "a beach contains sand"), which provide additional supervisory signals at training time thus reducing the need for labelled data, providing better predictions, and even allowing predicting concepts unseen at training time. We test our approach in a variety of datasets, including indoor, rural, and coastal environments, and show that it leads to a significant increase in the quality of the 3D scene graph generation with sparsely annotated data.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 6 figures, accepted to Robotics and Automation Letters</p></details> |

Analyzing fine-grained and comprehensive relations among stations effectively is imperative for metro Origin-Destination (OD) prediction. However, existing metro OD models either mix information from multiple OD pairs from the station's perspective or exclusively focus on a subset of OD pairs. These approaches may overlook fine-grained relations among OD pairs, leading to difficulties in predicting potential anomalous conditions. To address these challenges, we analyze traffic variations from the perspective of all OD pairs and propose a fine-grained spatial-temporal MLP architecture for metro OD prediction, namely ODMixer. Specifically, our ODMixer has double-branch structure and involves the Channel Mixer, the Multi-view Mixer, and the Bidirectional Trend Learner. The Channel Mixer aims to capture short-term temporal relations among OD pairs, the Multi-view Mixer concentrates on capturing relations from both origin and destination perspectives. To model long-term temporal relations, we introduce the Bidirectional Trend Learner. Extensive experiments on two large-scale metro OD prediction datasets HZMOD and SHMO demonstrate the advantages of our ODMixer. The code will be available.</p></details> |  |
| **[Consistency of common spatial estimators under spatial confounding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12181v2)** | 2024-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper addresses the asymptotic performance of popular spatial regression estimators on the task of estimating the linear effect of an exposure on an outcome under "spatial confounding" -- the presence of an unmeasured spatially-structured variable influencing both the exposure and the outcome. The existing literature on spatial confounding is informal and inconsistent; this paper is an attempt to bring clarity through rigorous results on the asymptotic bias and consistency of estimators from popular spatial regression models. We consider two data generation processes: one where the confounder is a fixed function of space and one where it is a random function (i.e., a stochastic process on the spatial domain). We first show that the estimators from ordinary least squares (OLS) and restricted spatial regression are asymptotically biased under spatial confounding. We then prove a novel main result on the consistency of the generalized least squares (GLS) estimator using a Gaussian process (GP) covariance matrix in the presence of spatial confounding under in-fill (fixed domain) asymptotics. The result holds under very general conditions -- for any exposure with some non-spatial variation (noise), for any spatially continuous confounder, using any choice of Mat\'ern or square exponential Gaussian process covariance used to construct the GLS estimator, and without requiring Gaussianity of errors. Finally, we prove that spatial estimators from GLS, GP regression, and spline models that are consistent under confounding by a fixed function will also be consistent under confounding by a random function. We conclude that, contrary to much of the literature on spatial confounding, traditional spatial estimators are capable of estimating linear exposure effects under spatial confounding in the presence of some noise in the exposure. We support our theoretical arguments with simulation studies.</p></details> | <details><summary>impro...</summary><p>improve analytical result, restructure to put more material in supplement</p></details> |
| **[Bayesian Strategies for Repulsive Spatial Point Processes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15133v1)** | 2024-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There is increasing interest to develop Bayesian inferential algorithms for point process models with intractable likelihoods. A purpose of this paper is to illustrate the utility of using simulation based strategies, including approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods for this task. Shirota and Gelfand (2017) proposed an extended version of an ABC approach for repulsive spatial point processes, including the Strauss point process and the determinantal point process, but their algorithm was not correctly detailed. We explain that is, in general, intractable and therefore impractical to use, except in some restrictive situations. This motivates us to instead consider an ABC-MCMC algorithm developed by Fearnhead and Prangle (2012). We further explore the use of the exchange algorithm, together with the recently proposed noisy Metropolis-Hastings algorithm (Alquier et al., 2016). As an extension of the exchange algorithm, which requires a single simulation from the likelihood at each iteration, the noisy Metropolis-Hastings algorithm considers multiple draws from the same likelihood function. We find that both of these inferential approaches yield good performance for repulsive spatial point processes in both simulated and real data applications and should be considered as viable approaches for the analysis of these models.</p></details> | 26 pages, 8 figures |

Much existing work uses only genetic data for species delimitation, often employing some kind of cluster analysis. This can be misleading, because geographically distant groups of individuals can be genetically quite different even if they belong to the same species. We investigate the problem of testing whether two potentially separated groups of individuals can belong to a single species or not based on genetic and spatial data. Existing methods such as the partial Mantel test and jackknife-based distance-distance regression are considered as well as new approaches, i.e., an adaptation of a mixed effects model, a bootstrap approach, and a jackknife version of partial Mantel. All these methods address the issue that distance data violate the independence assumption for standard inference regarding correlation and regression; a standard linear regression is also considered. The approaches are compared on simulated meta-populations generated with SLiM and GSpace - two software packages that can simulate spatially-explicit genetic data at an individual level. Simulations showed that partial Mantel tests and mixed-effects models have larger power than jackknife-based methods, but tend to display type I error rates slightly above the significance level. An application on brassy ringlets concludes the paper.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper of 26 pages with 6 figures; appendix of 19 pages with 17 figures.

We present MIMOSA, a human-AI co-creation tool that enables amateur users to computationally generate and manipulate spatial audio effects. For a video with only monaural or stereo audio, MIMOSA automatically grounds each sound source to the corresponding sounding object in the visual scene and enables users to further validate and fix the errors in the locations of sounding objects. Users can also augment the spatial audio effect by flexibly manipulating the sounding source positions and creatively customizing the audio effect. The design of MIMOSA exemplifies a human-AI collaboration approach that, instead of utilizing state-of art end-to-end "black-box" ML models, uses a multistep pipeline that aligns its interpretable intermediate results with the user's workflow. A lab user study with 15 participants demonstrates MIMOSA's usability, usefulness, expressiveness, and capability in creating immersive spatial audio effects in collaboration with users.</p></details> |  |

However, the interaction between CNN and Transformer in existing VPP methods is not fully explored, leading to inefficient communication between the local and global extracted features. In this paper, we explore the interaction between CNN and Transformer in the task of VPP, and propose a novel Spatial and Channel Hybrid-Attention Video Post-Processing Network (SC-HVPPNet), which can cooperatively exploit the image priors in both spatial and channel domains. Specifically, in the spatial domain, a novel spatial attention fusion module is designed, in which two attention weights are generated to fuse the local and global representations collaboratively. In the channel domain, a novel channel attention fusion module is developed, which can blend the deep representations at the channel dimension dynamically. Extensive experiments show that SC-HVPPNet notably boosts video restoration quality, with average bitrate savings of 5.29%, 12.42%, and 13.09% for Y, U, and V components in the VTM-11.0-NNVC RA configuration.</p></details> |  |
| **[Channel Estimation for Optical IRS-Assisted VLC System via Spatial Coherence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14706v1)** | 2024-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Optical intelligent reflecting surface (OIRS) has been considered a promising technology for visible light communication (VLC) by constructing visual line-of-sight propagation paths to address the signal blockage issue. However, the existing works on OIRSs are mostly based on perfect channel state information (CSI), whose acquisition appears to be challenging due to the passive nature of the OIRS. To tackle this challenge, this paper proposes a customized channel estimation algorithm for OIRSs. Specifically, we first unveil the OIRS spatial coherence characteristics and derive the coherence distance in closed form. Based on this property, a spatial sampling-based algorithm is proposed to estimate the OIRS-reflected channel, by dividing the OIRS into multiple subarrays based on the coherence distance and sequentially estimating their associated CSI, followed by an interpolation to retrieve the full CSI. Simulation results validate the derived OIRS spatial coherence and demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed OIRS channel estimation algorithm.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploring the Potential of Data-Driven Spatial Audio Enhancement Using a Single-Channel Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14564v1)** | 2024-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One key aspect differentiating data-driven single- and multi-channel speech enhancement and dereverberation methods is that both the problem formulation and complexity of the solutions are considerably more challenging in the latter case. Additionally, with limited computational resources, it is cumbersome to train models that require the management of larger datasets or those with more complex designs. In this scenario, an unverified hypothesis that single-channel methods can be adapted to multi-channel scenarios simply by processing each channel independently holds significant implications, boosting compatibility between sound scene capture and system input-output formats, while also allowing modern research to focus on other challenging aspects, such as full-bandwidth audio enhancement, competitive noise suppression, and unsupervised learning. This study verifies this hypothesis by comparing the enhancement promoted by a basic single-channel speech enhancement and dereverberation model with two other multi-channel models tailored to separate clean speech from noisy 3D mixes. A direction of arrival estimation model was used to objectively evaluate its capacity to preserve spatial information by comparing the output signals with ground-truth coordinate values. Consequently, a trade-off arises between preserving spatial information with a more straightforward single-channel solution at the cost of obtaining lower gains in intelligibility scores.</p></details> |  |
| **[GeoAI Reproducibility and Replicability: a computational and spatial perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10108v2)** | 2024-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>GeoAI has emerged as an exciting interdisciplinary research area that combines spatial theories and data with cutting-edge AI models to address geospatial problems in a novel, data-driven manner. While GeoAI research has flourished in the GIScience literature, its reproducibility and replicability (R&R), fundamental principles that determine the reusability, reliability, and scientific rigor of research findings, have rarely been discussed. This paper aims to provide an in-depth analysis of this topic from both computational and spatial perspectives. We first categorize the major goals for reproducing GeoAI research, namely, validation (repeatability), learning and adapting the method for solving a similar or new problem (reproducibility), and examining the generalizability of the research findings (replicability). Each of these goals requires different levels of understanding of GeoAI, as well as different methods to ensure its success. We then discuss the factors that may cause the lack of R&R in GeoAI research, with an emphasis on (1) the selection and use of training data; (2) the uncertainty that resides in the GeoAI model design, training, deployment, and inference processes; and more importantly (3) the inherent spatial heterogeneity of geospatial data and processes. We use a deep learning-based image analysis task as an example to demonstrate the results' uncertainty and spatial variance caused by different factors. The findings reiterate the importance of knowledge sharing, as well as the generation of a "replicability map" that incorporates spatial autocorrelation and spatial heterogeneity into consideration in quantifying the spatial replicability of GeoAI research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Annals of the American Association of Geographers</p></details> |

However, this progress is accompanied by new security challenges, particularly in the form of backdoor attacks. These attacks involve inserting malicious information into the training data of machine learning models, potentially compromising the model's behavior. In this paper, we propose CloudFort, a novel defense mechanism designed to enhance the robustness of 3D point cloud classifiers against backdoor attacks. CloudFort leverages spatial partitioning and ensemble prediction techniques to effectively mitigate the impact of backdoor triggers while preserving the model's performance on clean data. We evaluate the effectiveness of CloudFort through extensive experiments, demonstrating its strong resilience against the Point Cloud Backdoor Attack (PCBA). Our results show that CloudFort significantly enhances the security of 3D point cloud classification models without compromising their accuracy on benign samples. Furthermore, we explore the limitations of CloudFort and discuss potential avenues for future research in the field of 3D point cloud security. The proposed defense mechanism represents a significant step towards ensuring the trustworthiness and reliability of point-cloud-based systems in real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

While this approach has enabled impressive performance across many coarse-grained tasks like image captioning and visual question answering, more fine-grained tasks that require spatial understanding have not been thoroughly examined. In this paper, we use \textit{diagnostic classifiers} to measure the extent to which the visual prompt produced by the resampler encodes spatial information. Our results show that this information is largely absent from the resampler output when kept frozen during training of the classifiers. However, when the resampler and classifier are trained jointly, we observe a significant performance boost. This shows that the compression achieved by the resamplers can in principle encode the requisite spatial information, but that more object-aware objectives are needed at the pretraining stage to facilitate this capability</p></details> | NAACL 2024 |

Examples include count data, for instance, abundance (or lack thereof) of animal species and disease counts, as well as semi-continuous data like observed precipitation. Spatial two-part models are a flexible class of models for such data. Fitting two-part models can be computationally expensive for large data due to high-dimensional dependent latent variables, costly matrix operations, and slow mixing Markov chains. We describe a flexible, computationally efficient approach for modeling large zero-inflated spatial data using the projection-based intrinsic conditional autoregression (PICAR) framework. We study our approach, which we call PICAR-Z, through extensive simulation studies and two environmental data sets. Our results suggest that PICAR-Z provides accurate predictions while remaining computationally efficient. An important goal of our work is to allow researchers who are not experts in computation to easily build computationally efficient extensions to zero-inflated spatial models; this also allows for a more thorough exploration of modeling choices in two-part models than was previously possible. We show that PICAR-Z is easy to implement and extend in popular probabilistic programming languages such as nimble and stan.</p></details> |  |

| **[Online Planning of Power Flows for Power Systems Against Bushfires Using Spatial Context](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13391v1)** | 2024-04-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The 2019-20 Australia bushfire incurred numerous economic losses and significantly affected the operations of power systems. A power station or transmission line can be significantly affected due to bushfires, leading to an increase in operational costs. We study a fundamental but challenging problem of planning the optimal power flow (OPF) for power systems subject to bushfires. Considering the stochastic nature of bushfire spread, we develop a model to capture such dynamics based on Moore's neighborhood model. Under a periodic inspection scheme that reveals the in-situ bushfire status, we propose an online optimization modeling framework that sequentially plans the power flows in the electricity network. Our framework assumes that the spread of bushfires is non-stationary over time, and the spread and containment probabilities are unknown. To meet these challenges, we develop a contextual online learning algorithm that treats the in-situ geographical information of the bushfire as a 'spatial context'. The online learning algorithm learns the unknown probabilities sequentially based on the observed data and then makes the OPF decision accordingly. The sequential OPF decisions aim to minimize the regret function, which is defined as the cumulative loss against the clairvoyant strategy that knows the true model parameters. We provide a theoretical guarantee of our algorithm by deriving a bound on the regret function, which outperforms the regret bound achieved by other benchmark algorithms. Our model assumptions are verified by the real bushfire data from NSW, Australia, and we apply our model to two power systems to illustrate its applicability.</p></details> |  |

(2) CT-scan contains large number of out-of-distribution (OOD) slices. The crucial features may only be present in specific spatial regions and slices of the entire CT scan. How can we effectively figure out where these are located? To deal with this, we introduce an enhanced Spatial-Slice Feature Learning (SSFL++) framework specifically designed for CT scan. It aim to filter out a OOD data within whole CT scan, enabling our to select crucial spatial-slice for analysis by reducing 70% redundancy totally. Meanwhile, we proposed Kernel-Density-based slice Sampling (KDS) method to improve the stability when training and inference stage, therefore speeding up the rate of convergence and boosting performance. As a result, the experiments demonstrate the promising performance of our model using a simple EfficientNet-2D (E2D) model, even with only 1% of the training data. The efficacy of our approach has been validated on the COVID-19-CT-DB datasets provided by the DEF-AI-MIA workshop, in conjunction with CVPR 2024.

Most state-of-the-art methods for traffic prediction effectively predict both long-term and short-term by employing spatio-temporal neural networks as prediction models, together with transformers to learn global information on prediction objects (e.g., traffic states of road segments). However, these methods often have a high computational cost to obtain good performance. This paper introduces an innovative approach to traffic flow prediction, the Spatial-Temporal Selective State Space Model (ST-SSMs), featuring the novel ST-Mamba block, which can achieve good prediction accuracy with less computational cost. A comparative analysis highlights the ST-Mamba layer's efficiency, revealing its equivalence to three attention layers, yet with markedly reduced processing time. Through rigorous testing on diverse real-world datasets, the ST-SSMs model demonstrates exceptional improvements in prediction accuracy and computational simplicity, setting new benchmarks in the domain of traffic flow forecasting</p></details> | 17 pages, 5 figures |

Many researchers have incorporated ViTs for Hyperspectral Image (HSI) classification. HSIs are characterised by narrow contiguous spectral bands, providing rich spectral data. Although ViTs excel with sequential data, they cannot extract spectral-spatial information like CNNs. Furthermore, to have high classification performance, there should be a strong interaction between the HSI token and the class (CLS) token. To solve these issues, we propose a 3D-Convolution guided Spectral-Spatial Transformer (3D-ConvSST) for HSI classification that utilizes a 3D-Convolution Guided Residual Module (CGRM) in-between encoders to "fuse" the local spatial and spectral information and to enhance the feature propagation. Furthermore, we forego the class token and instead apply Global Average Pooling, which effectively encodes more discriminative and pertinent high-level features for classification. Extensive experiments have been conducted on three public HSI datasets to show the superiority of the proposed model over state-of-the-art traditional, convolutional, and Transformer models. The code is available at https://github.com/ShyamVarahagiri/3D-ConvSST.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in IEEE Conference on Artificial Intelligence, 2024</p></details> |

However, current ST platforms suffer from low resolution, hindering in-depth understanding of spatial gene expression. Super-resolution approaches promise to enhance ST maps by integrating histology images with gene expressions of profiled tissue spots. However, current super-resolution methods are limited by restoration uncertainty and mode collapse. Although diffusion models have shown promise in capturing complex interactions between multi-modal conditions, it remains a challenge to integrate histology images and gene expression for super-resolved ST maps. This paper proposes a cross-modal conditional diffusion model for super-resolving ST maps with the guidance of histology images. Specifically, we design a multi-modal disentangling network with cross-modal adaptive modulation to utilize complementary information from histology images and spatial gene expression. Moreover, we propose a dynamic cross-attention modelling strategy to extract hierarchical cell-to-tissue information from histology images. Lastly, we propose a co-expression-based gene-correlation graph network to model the co-expression relationship of multiple genes. Experiments show that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in ST super-resolution on three public datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Low-Depth Spatial Tree Algorithms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12953v1)** | 2024-04-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contemporary accelerator designs exhibit a high degree of spatial localization, wherein two-dimensional physical distance determines communication costs between processing elements. This situation presents considerable algorithmic challenges, particularly when managing sparse data, a pivotal component in progressing data science. The spatial computer model quantifies communication locality by weighting processor communication costs by distance, introducing a term named energy. Moreover, it integrates depth, a widely-utilized metric, to promote high parallelism. We propose and analyze a framework for efficient spatial tree algorithms within the spatial computer model. Our primary method constructs a spatial tree layout that optimizes the locality of the neighbors in the compute grid. This approach thereby enables locality-optimized messaging within the tree. Our layout achieves a polynomial factor improvement in energy compared to utilizing a PRAM approach. Using this layout, we develop energy-efficient treefix sum and lowest common ancestor algorithms, which are both fundamental building blocks for other graph algorithms. With high probability, our algorithms exhibit near-linear energy and poly-logarithmic depth. Our contributions augment a growing body of work demonstrating that computations can have both high spatial locality and low depth. Moreover, our work constitutes an advancement in the spatial layout of irregular and sparse computations.</p></details> | <details><summary>to ap...</summary><p>to appear at IPDPS 2024</p></details> |

A comparative study using Bayesian inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12756v1)** | 2024-04-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial modelling often uses Gaussian random fields to capture the stochastic nature of studied phenomena. However, this approach incurs significant computational burdens (O(n3)), primarily due to covariance matrix computations. In this study, we propose to use a low-rank approximation of a thin plate spline as a spatial random effect in Bayesian spatial models. We compare its statistical performance and computational efficiency with the approximated Gaussian random field (by the SPDE method). In this case, the dense matrix of the thin plate spline is approximated using a truncated spectral decomposition, resulting in computational complexity of O(kn2) operations, where k is the number of knots. Bayesian inference is conducted via the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo algorithm of the probabilistic software Stan, which allows us to evaluate performance and diagnostics for the proposed models. A simulation study reveals that both models accurately recover the parameters used to simulate data. However, models using a thin plate spline demonstrate superior execution time to achieve the convergence of chains compared to the models utilizing an approximated Gaussian random field. Furthermore, thin plate spline models exhibited better computational efficiency for simulated data coming from different spatial locations. In a real application, models using a thin plate spline as spatial random effect produced similar results in estimating a relative index of abundance for a benthic marine species when compared to models incorporating an approximated Gaussian random field. Although they were not the more computational efficient models, their simplicity in parametrization, execution time and predictive performance make them a valid alternative for spatial modelling under Bayesian inference.</p></details> | <details><summary>Preli...</summary><p>Preliminary results of this analysis were presented in CMStatistics, 2023 (Berlin)</p></details> |
| **[Spatially Selected and Dependent Random Effects for Small Area Estimation with Application to Rent Burden](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12463v1)** | 2024-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Area-level models for small area estimation typically rely on areal random effects to shrink design-based direct estimates towards a model-based predictor. Incorporating the spatial dependence of the random effects into these models can further improve the estimates when there are not enough covariates to fully account for spatial dependence of the areal means. A number of recent works have investigated models that include random effects for only a subset of areas, in order to improve the precision of estimates. However, such models do not readily handle spatial dependence. In this paper, we introduce a model that accounts for spatial dependence in both the random effects as well as the latent process that selects the effects. We show how this model can significantly improve predictive accuracy via an empirical simulation study based on data from the American Community Survey, and illustrate its properties via an application to estimate county-level median rent burden.</p></details> |  |

The primary focus of their research is to ensure safety, comfort, and efficiency. An autonomous vehicle has several modules responsible for one or more of the aforementioned items. Among these modules, the trajectory planner plays a pivotal role in the safety of the vehicle and the comfort of its passengers. The module is also responsible for respecting kinematic constraints and any applicable road constraints. In this paper, a novel online spatial-temporal graph trajectory planner is introduced to generate safe and comfortable trajectories. First, a spatial-temporal graph is constructed using the autonomous vehicle, its surrounding vehicles, and virtual nodes along the road with respect to the vehicle itself. Next, the graph is forwarded into a sequential network to obtain the desired states. To support the planner, a simple behavioral layer is also presented that determines kinematic constraints for the planner. Furthermore, a novel potential function is also proposed to train the network. Finally, the proposed planner is tested on three different complex driving tasks, and the performance is compared with two frequently used methods. The results show that the proposed planner generates safe and feasible trajectories while achieving similar or longer distances in the forward direction and comparable comfort ride.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is the accepted version and published in the "Early Access" area of IEEE Xplore for the IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles on 16 April 2024.

Despite the success of Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) in computer vision, its application to HTR has been rather scattered, leaving key SSL methodologies unexplored. This work focuses on one of them, namely Spatial Context-based SSL. We investigate how this family of approaches can be adapted and optimized for HTR and propose new workflows that leverage the unique features of handwritten text. Our experiments demonstrate that the methods considered lead to advancements in the state-of-the-art of SSL for HTR in a number of benchmark cases.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatial Heterogeneous Additive Partial Linear Model: A Joint Approach of Bivariate Spline and Forest Lasso](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11579v1)** | 2024-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Identifying spatial heterogeneous patterns has attracted a surge of research interest in recent years, due to its important applications in various scientific and engineering fields. In practice the spatially heterogeneous components are often mixed with components which are spatially smooth, making the task of identifying the heterogeneous regions more challenging. In this paper, we develop an efficient clustering approach to identify the model heterogeneity of the spatial additive partial linear model. Specifically, we aim to detect the spatially contiguous clusters based on the regression coefficients while introducing a spatially varying intercept to deal with the smooth spatial effect. On the one hand, to approximate the spatial varying intercept, we use the method of bivariate spline over triangulation, which can effectively handle the data from a complex domain. On the other hand, a novel fusion penalty termed the forest lasso is proposed to reveal the spatial clustering pattern. Our proposed fusion penalty has advantages in both the estimation and computation efficiencies when dealing with large spatial data. Theoretically properties of our estimator are established, and simulation results show that our approach can achieve more accurate estimation with a limited computation cost compared with the existing approaches. To illustrate its practical use, we apply our approach to analyze the spatial pattern of the relationship between land surface temperature measured by satellites and air temperature measured by ground stations in the United States.</p></details> |  |
| **[SSDiff: Spatial-spectral Integrated Diffusion Model for Remote Sensing Pansharpening](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11537v1)** | 2024-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pansharpening is a significant image fusion technique that merges the spatial content and spectral characteristics of remote sensing images to generate high-resolution multispectral images. Recently, denoising diffusion probabilistic models have been gradually applied to visual tasks, enhancing controllable image generation through low-rank adaptation (LoRA). In this paper, we introduce a spatial-spectral integrated diffusion model for the remote sensing pansharpening task, called SSDiff, which considers the pansharpening process as the fusion process of spatial and spectral components from the perspective of subspace decomposition. Specifically, SSDiff utilizes spatial and spectral branches to learn spatial details and spectral features separately, then employs a designed alternating projection fusion module (APFM) to accomplish the fusion. Furthermore, we propose a frequency modulation inter-branch module (FMIM) to modulate the frequency distribution between branches. The two components of SSDiff can perform favorably against the APFM when utilizing a LoRA-like branch-wise alternative fine-tuning method. It refines SSDiff to capture component-discriminating features more sufficiently. Finally, extensive experiments on four commonly used datasets, i.e., WorldView-3, WorldView-2, GaoFen-2, and QuickBird, demonstrate the superiority of SSDiff both visually and quantitatively. The code will be made open source after possible acceptance.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we propose a variant of this scheme based on low-density parity-check codes where the BCH codes at the constraint nodes are replaced by simple single parity-check codes. Furthermore, we apply spatial coupling to both GT schemes, perform a density evolution analysis, and compare their performance with and without coupling. Our analysis shows that both schemes improve with increasing coupling memory, and for all considered cases, it is observed that the LDPC code-based scheme substantially outperforms the original scheme. Simulation results for finite block length confirm the asymptotic density evolution thresholds.</p></details> |  |

Despite the recent advancements of sign language understanding methods, they often solely focus on individual frames, inevitably overlooking the inter-frame correlations that are essential for effectively modeling human body trajectories. To address this limitation, this paper introduces a spatial-temporal correlation network, denoted as CorrNet+, which explicitly identifies body trajectories across multiple frames. In specific, CorrNet+ employs a correlation module and an identification module to build human body trajectories. Afterwards, a temporal attention module is followed to adaptively evaluate the contributions of different frames. The resultant features offer a holistic perspective on human body movements, facilitating a deeper understanding of sign language. As a unified model, CorrNet+ achieves new state-of-the-art performance on two extensive sign language understanding tasks, including continuous sign language recognition (CSLR) and sign language translation (SLT). Especially, CorrNet+ surpasses previous methods equipped with resource-intensive pose-estimation networks or pre-extracted heatmaps for hand and facial feature extraction. Compared with CorrNet, CorrNet+ achieves a significant performance boost across all benchmarks while halving the computational overhead. A comprehensive comparison with previous spatial-temporal reasoning methods verifies the superiority of CorrNet+.

Past research has focused on refining hash functions to distill images into compact indicators of resemblance. Initial attempts used shallow models, evolving to attention mechanism-based architectures from Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to advanced models. Recognizing limitations in gradient-based models for spatial information embedding, we propose an innovative image hashing method, NeuroHash leveraging Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC). HDC symbolically encodes spatial information into high-dimensional vectors, reshaping image representation. Our approach combines pre-trained large vision models with HDC operations, enabling spatially encoded feature representations. Hashing with locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) ensures swift and efficient image retrieval. Notably, our framework allows dynamic hash manipulation for conditional image retrieval. Our work introduces a transformative image hashing framework enabling spatial-aware conditional retrieval. By seamlessly combining DNN-based neural and HDC-based symbolic models, our methodology breaks from traditional training, offering flexible and conditional image retrieval. Performance evaluations signify a paradigm shift in image-hashing methodologies, demonstrating enhanced retrieval accuracy.</p></details> |  |

Flip-n-Slide is a concise and minimalistic approach that allows OoI to be represented at multiple tile positions and orientations. This strategy introduces multiple views of spatio-contextual information, without introducing redundancies into the training set. By maintaining distinct transformation permutations for each tile overlap, we enhance the generalizability of the training set without misrepresenting the true data distribution. Our experiments validate the effectiveness of Flip-n-Slide in the task of semantic segmentation, a necessary data product in geophysical studies. We find that Flip-n-Slide outperforms the previous state-of-the-art augmentation routines for tiled data in all evaluation metrics. For underrepresented classes, Flip-n-Slide increases precision by as much as 15.8%.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the Machine Learning for Remote Sensing (ML4RS) Workshop at ICLR 2024</p></details> |

We compare the performance with classical LDPC code design which involves optimizing the degree distribution for a given (known) channel. We demonstrate that these classical schemes, despite working very good when designed for a given channel, can perform poorly if the channel is exchanged. With spatially coupled LDPC codes, however, we get performances close to the symmetric information rates with just a single code, without the need to know the channel and adapt to it at the transmitter. We also investigate threshold saturation with the linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE) detector and show that with spatial coupling its performance can get remarkably close to that of an optimal detector for regular LDPC codes.</p></details> |  |

In this regard, covariance properties with respect to geometric image transformations in the earliest layers of the visual hierarchy are essential for expressing robust image operations, and for formulating invariant visual operations at higher levels. This paper defines and proves a set of joint covariance properties under compositions of spatial scaling transformations, spatial affine transformations, Galilean transformations and temporal scaling transformations, which make it possible to characterize how different types of image transformations interact with each other and the associated spatio-temporal receptive field responses. In this regard, we also extend the notion of scale-normalized derivatives to affine-normalized derivatives, to be able to obtain true affine-covariant properties of spatial derivatives, that are computed based on spatial smoothing with affine Gaussian kernels. The derived relations show how the parameters of the receptive fields need to be transformed, in order to match the output from spatio-temporal receptive fields under composed spatio-temporal image transformations. As a side effect, the presented proof for the joint covariance property over the integrated combination of the different geometric image transformations also provides specific proofs for the individual transformation properties, which have not previously been fully reported in the literature. The paper also presents an in-depth theoretical analysis of geometric interpretations of the derived covariance properties, as well as outlines a number of biological interpretations of these results.</p></details> | <details><summary>38 pa...</summary><p>38 pages, 13 figures.

In recent years, spatio-temporal graph neural networks have achieved state-of-the-art results in the context of numerous traffic forecasting challenges. This work aims at expanding upon the conventional spatio-temporal graph neural network architectures in a manner that may facilitate the inclusion of information regarding the examined regions, as well as the populations that traverse them, in order to establish a more efficient prediction model. The end-product of this scientific endeavour is a novel spatio-temporal graph neural network architecture that is referred to as WEST (WEighted STacked) GCN-LSTM. Furthermore, the inclusion of the aforementioned information is conducted via the use of two novel dedicated algorithms that are referred to as the Shared Borders Policy and the Adjustable Hops Policy. Through information fusion and distillation, the proposed solution manages to significantly outperform its competitors in the frame of an experimental evaluation that consists of 19 forecasting models, across several datasets. Finally, an additional ablation study determined that each of the components of the proposed solution contributes towards enhancing its overall performance.</p></details> |  |

Neuromorphic disciplines view the brain as a coevolved system, simultaneously optimizing the hardware and the algorithms running on it. There are clear efficiency gains when bringing the computations into a physical substrate, but we presently lack theories to guide efficient implementations. Here, we present a principled computational model for neuromorphic systems in terms of spatio-temporal receptive fields, based on affine Gaussian kernels over space and leaky-integrator and leaky integrate-and-fire models over time. Our theory is provably covariant to spatial affine and temporal scaling transformations, and with close similarities to the visual processing in mammalian brains. We use these spatio-temporal receptive fields as a prior in an event-based vision task, and show that this improves the training of spiking networks, which otherwise is known as problematic for event-based vision. This work combines efforts within scale-space theory and computational neuroscience to identify theoretically well-founded ways to process spatio-temporal signals in neuromorphic systems. Our contributions are immediately relevant for signal processing and event-based vision, and can be extended to other processing tasks over space and time, such as memory and control.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code available at https://github.com/jegp/nrf</p></details> |

Our work primarily addresses this, introducing more realistic and flexible models for spatio-temporal random fields. We break away from the traditional confines of the classic frozen field by either relaxing the assumption of a single deterministic velocity or rethinking the hypothesis regarding the spectrum shape, thus enhancing the realism of our models. While the proposed models stand out for their realism and flexibility, they are also paired with simulation algorithms that are equally or less computationally complex than the commonly used circulant embedding for Gaussian random fields in $\mathbb{R}^{2+1}$. This combination of realistic modeling with efficient simulation methods creates an effective solution for better understanding traveling phenomena.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Survey on Diffusion Models for Time Series and Spatio-Temporal Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18886v1)** | 2024-04-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The study of time series data is crucial for understanding trends and anomalies over time, enabling predictive insights across various sectors. Spatio-temporal data, on the other hand, is vital for analyzing phenomena in both space and time, providing a dynamic perspective on complex system interactions. Recently, diffusion models have seen widespread application in time series and spatio-temporal data mining. Not only do they enhance the generative and inferential capabilities for sequential and temporal data, but they also extend to other downstream tasks. In this survey, we comprehensively and thoroughly review the use of diffusion models in time series and spatio-temporal data, categorizing them by model category, task type, data modality, and practical application domain. In detail, we categorize diffusion models into unconditioned and conditioned types and discuss time series data and spatio-temporal data separately. Unconditioned models, which operate unsupervised, are subdivided into probability-based and score-based models, serving predictive and generative tasks such as forecasting, anomaly detection, classification, and imputation. Conditioned models, on the other hand, utilize extra information to enhance performance and are similarly divided for both predictive and generative tasks. Our survey extensively covers their application in various fields, including healthcare, recommendation, climate, energy, audio, and transportation, providing a foundational understanding of how these models analyze and generate data.

When using the physics informed neural network (PINN) to simulate the long time evolution, it is necessary to decompose the time domain to capture the transition of solutions in different time. Moreover, the baseline PINN can't maintain the mass conservation property for the equations. We propose a mass-preserving spatio-temporal adaptive PINN. This method adaptively dividing the time domain according to the rate of energy decrease, and solves the Cahn-Hilliard equation in each time step using an independent neural network. To improve the prediction accuracy, spatial adaptive sampling is employed in the subdomain to select points with large residual value and add them to the training samples. Additionally, a mass constraint is added to the loss function to compensate the mass degradation problem of the PINN method in solving the Cahn-Hilliard equations. The mass-preserving spatio-temporal adaptive PINN is employed to solve a series of numerical examples. These include the Cahn-Hilliard equations with different bulk potentials, the three dimensional Cahn-Hilliard equation with singularities, and the set of Cahn-Hilliard equations. The numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.</p></details> |  |

Bayesian predictive inference allows for coherently incorporating uncertainty about unknown quantities by making use of methods or models that produce predictive distributions, which in turn inform decision problems. By formalizing these decision problems into properties with the help of spatio-temporal logic, we can formulate and predict how likely such properties are to be satisfied in the future at a certain location. Moreover, we can leverage our methodology to evaluate and compare models directly on their ability to predict the satisfaction of application-driven properties. The approach is illustrated in an urban mobility application, where the crowdedness in the center of Milan is proxied by aggregated mobile phone traffic data. We specify several desirable spatio-temporal properties related to city crowdedness such as a fault-tolerant network or the reachability of hospitals. After verifying these properties on draws from the posterior predictive distributions, we compare several spatio-temporal Bayesian models based on their overall and property-based predictive performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Discriminative Spatio-temporal Representations for Semi-supervised Action Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16416v1)** | 2024-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semi-supervised action recognition aims to improve spatio-temporal reasoning ability with a few labeled data in conjunction with a large amount of unlabeled data. Albeit recent advancements, existing powerful methods are still prone to making ambiguous predictions under scarce labeled data, embodied as the limitation of distinguishing different actions with similar spatio-temporal information. In this paper, we approach this problem by empowering the model two aspects of capability, namely discriminative spatial modeling and temporal structure modeling for learning discriminative spatio-temporal representations. Specifically, we propose an Adaptive Contrastive Learning~(ACL) strategy. It assesses the confidence of all unlabeled samples by the class prototypes of the labeled data, and adaptively selects positive-negative samples from a pseudo-labeled sample bank to construct contrastive learning. Additionally, we introduce a Multi-scale Temporal Learning~(MTL) strategy. It could highlight informative semantics from long-term clips and integrate them into the short-term clip while suppressing noisy information. Afterwards, both of these two new techniques are integrated in a unified framework to encourage the model to make accurate predictions. Extensive experiments on UCF101, HMDB51 and Kinetics400 show the superiority of our method over prior state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 6 figures, 6 tables, 56 conferences</p></details> |

Our key contribution is the development of user-level differentially private algorithms that incorporate carefully chosen parameter values to ensure low estimation errors on real-world datasets, while ensuring privacy. We test our algorithms on ITMS (Intelligent Traffic Management System) data from an Indian city, where the speeds of different buses are drawn in a potentially non-i.i.d. manner from an unknown distribution, and where the number of speed samples contributed by different buses is potentially different. We then apply our algorithms to large synthetic datasets, generated based on the ITMS data. Here, we provide theoretical justification for the observed performance trends, and also provide recommendations for the choices of algorithm subroutines that result in low estimation errors. Finally, we characterize the best performance of pseudo-user creation-based algorithms on worst-case datasets via a minimax approach; this then gives rise to a novel procedure for the creation of pseudo-users, which optimizes the worst-case total estimation error. The algorithms discussed in the paper are readily applicable to general spatio-temporal IoT datasets for releasing a differentially private mean of a desired value.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 5 figures, submitted to the ACM for possible publication</p></details> |
| **[NoiseNCA: Noisy Seed Improves Spatio-Temporal Continuity of Neural Cellular Automata](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06279v2)** | 2024-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural Cellular Automata (NCA) is a class of Cellular Automata where the update rule is parameterized by a neural network that can be trained using gradient descent. In this paper, we focus on NCA models used for texture synthesis, where the update rule is inspired by partial differential equations (PDEs) describing reaction-diffusion systems. To train the NCA model, the spatio-termporal domain is discretized, and Euler integration is used to numerically simulate the PDE. However, whether a trained NCA truly learns the continuous dynamic described by the corresponding PDE or merely overfits the discretization used in training remains an open question. We study NCA models at the limit where space-time discretization approaches continuity. We find that existing NCA models tend to overfit the training discretization, especially in the proximity of the initial condition, also called "seed". To address this, we propose a solution that utilizes uniform noise as the initial condition. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in preserving the consistency of NCA dynamics across a wide range of spatio-temporal granularities. Our improved NCA model enables two new test-time interactions by allowing continuous control over the speed of pattern formation and the scale of the synthesized patterns. We demonstrate this new NCA feature in our interactive online demo. Our work reveals that NCA models can learn continuous dynamics and opens new venues for NCA research from a dynamical systems' perspective.</p></details> | 9 pages, 12 figures |
| **[A Unified Replay-based Continuous Learning Framework for Spatio-Temporal Prediction on Streaming Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14999v1)** | 2024-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The widespread deployment of wireless and mobile devices results in a proliferation of spatio-temporal data that is used in applications, e.g., traffic prediction, human mobility mining, and air quality prediction, where spatio-temporal prediction is often essential to enable safety, predictability, or reliability. Many recent proposals that target deep learning for spatio-temporal prediction suffer from so-called catastrophic forgetting, where previously learned knowledge is entirely forgotten when new data arrives. Such proposals may experience deteriorating prediction performance when applied in settings where data streams into the system. To enable spatio-temporal prediction on streaming data, we propose a unified replay-based continuous learning framework. The framework includes a replay buffer of previously learned samples that are fused with training data using a spatio-temporal mixup mechanism in order to preserve historical knowledge effectively, thus avoiding catastrophic forgetting. To enable holistic representation preservation, the framework also integrates a general spatio-temporal autoencoder with a carefully designed spatio-temporal simple siamese (STSimSiam) network that aims to ensure prediction accuracy and avoid holistic feature loss by means of mutual information maximization. The framework further encompasses five spatio-temporal data augmentation methods to enhance the performance of STSimSiam. Extensive experiments on real data offer insight into the effectiveness of the proposed framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICDE 2024</p></details> |
| **[ICST-DNET: An Interpretable Causal Spatio-Temporal Diffusion Network for Traffic Speed Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13853v1)** | 2024-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic speed prediction is significant for intelligent navigation and congestion alleviation. However, making accurate predictions is challenging due to three factors: 1) traffic diffusion, i.e., the spatial and temporal causality existing between the traffic conditions of multiple neighboring roads, 2) the poor interpretability of traffic data with complicated spatio-temporal correlations, and 3) the latent pattern of traffic speed fluctuations over time, such as morning and evening rush. Jointly considering these factors, in this paper, we present a novel architecture for traffic speed prediction, called Interpretable Causal Spatio-Temporal Diffusion Network (ICST-DNET). Specifically, ICST-DENT consists of three parts, namely the Spatio-Temporal Causality Learning (STCL), Causal Graph Generation (CGG), and Speed Fluctuation Pattern Recognition (SFPR) modules. First, to model the traffic diffusion within road networks, an STCL module is proposed to capture both the temporal causality on each individual road and the spatial causality in each road pair. The CGG module is then developed based on STCL to enhance the interpretability of the traffic diffusion procedure from the temporal and spatial perspectives. Specifically, a time causality matrix is generated to explain the temporal causality between each road's historical and future traffic conditions. For spatial causality, we utilize causal graphs to visualize the diffusion process in road pairs. Finally, to adapt to traffic speed fluctuations in different scenarios, we design a personalized SFPR module to select the historical timesteps with strong influences for learning the pattern of traffic speed fluctuations. Extensive experimental results prove that ICST-DNET can outperform all existing baselines, as evidenced by the higher prediction accuracy, ability to explain causality, and adaptability to different scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[D$^2$ST-Adapter: Disentangled-and-Deformable Spatio-Temporal Adapter for Few-shot Action Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01431v3)** | 2024-04-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Adapting large pre-trained image models to few-shot action recognition has proven to be an effective and efficient strategy for learning robust feature extractors, which is essential for few-shot learning. Typical fine-tuning based adaptation paradigm is prone to overfitting in the few-shot learning scenarios and offers little modeling flexibility for learning temporal features in video data. In this work we present the Disentangled-and-Deformable Spatio-Temporal Adapter (D$^2$ST-Adapter), which is a novel adapter tuning framework well-suited for few-shot action recognition due to lightweight design and low parameter-learning overhead. It is designed in a dual-pathway architecture to encode spatial and temporal features in a disentangled manner. In particular, we devise the anisotropic Deformable Spatio-Temporal Attention module as the core component of D$^2$ST-Adapter, which can be tailored with anisotropic sampling densities along spatial and temporal domains to learn spatial and temporal features specifically in corresponding pathways, allowing our D$^2$ST-Adapter to encode features in a global view in 3D spatio-temporal space while maintaining a lightweight design. Extensive experiments with instantiations of our method on both pre-trained ResNet and ViT demonstrate the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art methods for few-shot action recognition. Our method is particularly well-suited to challenging scenarios where temporal dynamics are critical for action recognition.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatio-temporal Joint Analysis of PM2.5 and Ozone in California with INLA](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14446v1)** | 2024-04-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The substantial threat of concurrent air pollutants to public health is increasingly severe under climate change. To identify the common drivers and extent of spatio-temporal similarity of PM2.5 and ozone, this paper proposed a log Gaussian-Gumbel Bayesian hierarchical model allowing for sharing a SPDE-AR(1) spatio-temporal interaction structure. The proposed model outperforms in terms of estimation accuracy and prediction capacity for its increased parsimony and reduced uncertainty, especially for the shared ozone sub-model. Besides the consistently significant influence of temperature (positive), extreme drought (positive), fire burnt area (positive), and wind speed (negative) on both PM2.5 and ozone, surface pressure and GDP per capita (precipitation) demonstrate only positive associations with PM2.5 (ozone), while population density relates to neither. In addition, our results show the distinct spatio-temporal interactions and different seasonal patterns of PM2.5 and ozone, with peaks of PM2.5 and ozone in cold and hot seasons, respectively. Finally, with the aid of the excursion function, we see that the areas around the intersection of San Luis Obispo and Santa Barbara counties are likely to exceed the unhealthy ozone level for sensitive groups throughout the year. Our findings provide new insights for regional and seasonal strategies in the co-control of PM2.5 and ozone. Our methodology is expected to be utilized when interest lies in multiple interrelated processes in the fields of environment and epidemiology.</p></details> |  |
| **[DST-GTN: Dynamic Spatio-Temporal Graph Transformer Network for Traffic Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11996v1)** | 2024-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate traffic forecasting is essential for effective urban planning and congestion management. Deep learning (DL) approaches have gained colossal success in traffic forecasting but still face challenges in capturing the intricacies of traffic dynamics. In this paper, we identify and address this challenges by emphasizing that spatial features are inherently dynamic and change over time. A novel in-depth feature representation, called Dynamic Spatio-Temporal (Dyn-ST) features, is introduced, which encapsulates spatial characteristics across varying times. Moreover, a Dynamic Spatio-Temporal Graph Transformer Network (DST-GTN) is proposed by capturing Dyn-ST features and other dynamic adjacency relations between intersections. The DST-GTN can model dynamic ST relationships between nodes accurately and refine the representation of global and local ST characteristics by adopting adaptive weights in low-pass and all-pass filters, enabling the extraction of Dyn-ST features from traffic time-series data. Through numerical experiments on public datasets, the DST-GTN achieves state-of-the-art performance for a range of traffic forecasting tasks and demonstrates enhanced stability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatio-temporal patterns of diurnal temperature: a random matrix approach I-case of India](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11747v1)** | 2024-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the spatio-temporal gridded daily diurnal temperature range (DTR) data across India during the 72-year period 1951--2022. We augment this data with information on the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and on the climatic regions (Stamp's and Koeppen's classification) and four seasons of India. We use various matrix theory approaches to trim out strong but routine signals, random matrix theory to remove noise, and novel empirical generalised singular-value distributions to establish retention of essential signals in the trimmed data. We make use of the spatial Bergsma statistics to measure spatial association and identify temporal change points in the spatial-association. In particular, our investigation captures a yet unknown change-point over the 72 years under study with drastic changes in spatial-association of DTR in India. It also brings out changes in spatial association with regard to ENSO. We conclude that while studying/modelling Indian DTR data, due consideration should be granted to the strong spatial association that is being persistently exhibited over decades, and provision should be kept for potential change points in the temporal behaviour, which in turn can bring moderate to dramatic changes in the spatial association pattern. Some of our analysis also reaffirms the conclusions made by other authors, regarding spatial and temporal behavior of DTR, adding our own insights. We consider the data from the yearly, seasonal and climatic zones points of view, and discover several new and interesting statistical structures which should be of interest, especially to climatologists and statisticians. Our methods are not country specific and could be used profitably for DTR data from other geographical areas.</p></details> |  |
| **[Equivariant Spatio-Temporal Self-Supervision for LiDAR Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11737v1)** | 2024-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Popular representation learning methods encourage feature invariance under transformations applied at the input. However, in 3D perception tasks like object localization and segmentation, outputs are naturally equivariant to some transformations, such as rotation. Using pre-training loss functions that encourage equivariance of features under certain transformations provides a strong self-supervision signal while also retaining information of geometric relationships between transformed feature representations. This can enable improved performance in downstream tasks that are equivariant to such transformations. In this paper, we propose a spatio-temporal equivariant learning framework by considering both spatial and temporal augmentations jointly. Our experiments show that the best performance arises with a pre-training approach that encourages equivariance to translation, scaling, and flip, rotation and scene flow. For spatial augmentations, we find that depending on the transformation, either a contrastive objective or an equivariance-by-classification objective yields best results. To leverage real-world object deformations and motion, we consider sequential LiDAR scene pairs and develop a novel 3D scene flow-based equivariance objective that leads to improved performance overall. We show our pre-training method for 3D object detection which outperforms existing equivariant and invariant approaches in many settings.</p></details> | technical report |
| **[Spatio-Temporal Motion Retargeting for Quadruped Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11557v1)** | 2024-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work introduces a motion retargeting approach for legged robots, which aims to create motion controllers that imitate the fine behavior of animals. Our approach, namely spatio-temporal motion retargeting (STMR), guides imitation learning procedures by transferring motion from source to target, effectively bridging the morphological disparities by ensuring the feasibility of imitation on the target system. Our STMR method comprises two components: spatial motion retargeting (SMR) and temporal motion retargeting (TMR). On the one hand, SMR tackles motion retargeting at the kinematic level by generating kinematically feasible whole-body motions from keypoint trajectories. On the other hand, TMR aims to retarget motion at the dynamic level by optimizing motion in the temporal domain. We showcase the effectiveness of our method in facilitating Imitation Learning (IL) for complex animal movements through a series of simulation and hardware experiments. In these experiments, our STMR method successfully tailored complex animal motions from various media, including video captured by a hand-held camera, to fit the morphology and physical properties of the target robots. This enabled RL policy training for precise motion tracking, while baseline methods struggled with highly dynamic motion involving flying phases. Moreover, we validated that the control policy can successfully imitate six different motions in two quadruped robots with different dimensions and physical properties in real-world settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>34 pa...</summary><p>34 pages, 7 figures, videos/code available at https://terry97-guel.github.io/STMR-RL.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[Towards Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning based Traffic Signal Control through Spatio-temporal Hypergraphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11014v1)** | 2024-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic signal control systems (TSCSs) are integral to intelligent traffic management, fostering efficient vehicle flow. Traditional approaches often simplify road networks into standard graphs, which results in a failure to consider the dynamic nature of traffic data at neighboring intersections, thereby neglecting higher-order interconnections necessary for real-time control. To address this, we propose a novel TSCS framework to realize intelligent traffic control. This framework collaborates with multiple neighboring edge computing servers to collect traffic information across the road network. To elevate the efficiency of traffic signal control, we have crafted a multi-agent soft actor-critic (MA-SAC) reinforcement learning algorithm. Within this algorithm, individual agents are deployed at each intersection with a mandate to optimize traffic flow across the entire road network collectively. Furthermore, we introduce hypergraph learning into the critic network of MA-SAC to enable the spatio-temporal interactions from multiple intersections in the road network. This method fuses hypergraph and spatio-temporal graph structures to encode traffic data and capture the complex spatial and temporal correlations between multiple intersections. Our empirical evaluation, tested on varied datasets, demonstrates the superiority of our framework in minimizing average vehicle travel times and sustaining high-throughput performance. This work facilitates the development of more intelligent and reactive urban traffic management solutions.</p></details> |  |
| **[A spatio-temporal model to detect potential outliers in disease mapping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09882v1)** | 2024-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal disease mapping models are commonly used to estimate the relative risk of a disease over time and across areas. For each area and time point, the disease count is modelled with a Poisson distribution whose mean is the product of an offset and the disease relative risk. This relative risk is commonly decomposed in the log scale as the sum of fixed and latent effects. The Rushworth model allows for spatio-temporal autocorrelation of the random effects. We build on the Rushworth model to accommodate and identify potentially outlying areas with respect to their disease relative risk evolution, after taking into account the fixed effects. An area may display outlying behaviour at some points in time but not all. At each time point, we assume the latent effects to be spatially structured and include scaling parameters in the precision matrix, to allow for heavy-tails. Two prior specifications are considered for the scaling parameters: one where they are independent across space and one with spatial autocorrelation. We investigate the performance of the different prior specifications of the proposed model through simulation studies and analyse the weekly evolution of the number of COVID-19 cases across the 33 boroughs of Montreal and the 96 French departments during the second wave. In Montreal, 6 boroughs are found to be potentially outlying. In France, the model with spatially structured scaling parameters identified 21 departments as potential outliers. We find that these departments tend to be close to each other and within common French regions.</p></details> |  |

To bridge the gap of learning accurate representations with efficient and flexible mechanisms, we introduce Efflex, a comprehensive pipeline for transformative graph modeling and representation learning of the large-volume spatio-temporal trajectories. Efflex pioneers the incorporation of a multi-scale k-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm with feature fusion for graph construction, marking a leap in dimensionality reduction techniques by preserving essential data features. Moreover, the groundbreaking graph construction mechanism and the high-performance lightweight GCN increase embedding extraction speed by up to 36 times faster. We further offer Efflex in two versions, Efflex-L for scenarios demanding high accuracy, and Efflex-B for environments requiring swift data processing. Comprehensive experimentation with the Porto and Geolife datasets validates our approach, positioning Efflex as the state-of-the-art in the domain. Such enhancements in speed and accuracy highlight the versatility of Efflex, underscoring its wide-ranging potential for deployment in time-sensitive and computationally constrained applications.</p></details> |  |

However, both architectures have inherent shortcomings. Recently, the Mamba architecture, based on state space models, has shown remarkable performance in a series of natural language processing tasks, which can effectively compensate for the shortcomings of the above two architectures. In this paper, we explore for the first time the potential of the Mamba architecture for remote sensing CD tasks. We tailor the corresponding frameworks, called MambaBCD, MambaSCD, and MambaBDA, for binary change detection (BCD), semantic change detection (SCD), and building damage assessment (BDA), respectively. All three frameworks adopt the cutting-edge Visual Mamba architecture as the encoder, which allows full learning of global spatial contextual information from the input images. For the change decoder, which is available in all three architectures, we propose three spatio-temporal relationship modeling mechanisms, which can be naturally combined with the Mamba architecture and fully utilize its attribute to achieve spatio-temporal interaction of multi-temporal features, thereby obtaining accurate change information. On five benchmark datasets, our proposed frameworks outperform current CNN- and Transformer-based approaches without using any complex training strategies or tricks, fully demonstrating the potential of the Mamba architecture in CD tasks. Specifically, we obtained 83.11%, 88.39% and 94.19% F1 scores on the three BCD datasets SYSU, LEVIR-CD+, and WHU-CD; on the SCD dataset SECOND, we obtained 24.11% SeK; and on the BDA dataset xBD, we obtained 81.41% overall F1 score. Further experiments show that our architecture is quite robust to degraded data. The source code will be available in https://github.com/ChenHongruixuan/MambaCD</p></details> |  |

The T-Former simultaneously extracts temporal information while continually integrating multi-scale spatial information. This process culminates in the generation of multi-scale spatio-temporal features that are utilized for the final classification. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results on two in-the-wild datasets. Furthermore, a series of ablation experiments and visualizations provide further validation of our approach's proficiency in leveraging spatio-temporal information within DFER.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to 2024 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing (ICASSP 2024)</p></details> |

Existing methods often prioritize the development of intricate neural networks to capture the complex dependencies of the data, yet their accuracy fails to show sustained improvement. Besides, these methods also overlook node heterogeneity, hindering customized prediction modules from handling diverse regional nodes effectively. In this paper, our goal is not to propose a new model but to present a novel low-rank adaptation framework as an off-the-shelf plugin for existing spatial-temporal prediction models, termed ST-LoRA, which alleviates the aforementioned problems through node-level adjustments. Specifically, we first tailor a node adaptive low-rank layer comprising multiple trainable low-rank matrices. Additionally, we devise a multi-layer residual fusion stacking module, injecting the low-rank adapters into predictor modules of various models. Across six real-world traffic datasets and six different types of spatio-temporal prediction models, our approach minimally increases the parameters and training time of the original models by less than 4%, still achieving consistent and sustained performance enhancement.</p></details> |  |

The associated challenges are exacerbated when solutions to these interconnected problems need to both maximize task performance and respect practical constraints on time and resources. In this work, we formulate a new class of spatio-temporal heterogeneous task allocation problems that consider these complexities. We contribute a novel framework, named Quality-Optimized Incremental Task Allocation Graph Search (Q-ITAGS), to solve such problems. Q-ITAGS builds upon our prior work in trait-based coordination and offers a flexible interleaved framework that i) explicitly models and optimizes the effect of collective capabilities on task performance via learnable trait-quality maps, and ii) respects both resource constraints and spatio-temporal constraints, including a user-specified time budget (i.e., maximum makespan). In addition to algorithmic contributions, we derive theoretical suboptimality bounds in terms of task performance that varies as a function of a single hyperparameter. Our detailed experiments involving a simulated emergency response task and a real-world video game dataset reveal that i) Q-ITAGS results in superior team performance compared to a state-of-the-art method, while also respecting complex spatio-temporal and resource constraints, ii) Q-ITAGS efficiently learns trait-quality maps to enable effective trade-off between task performance and resource constraints, and iii) Q-ITAGS' suboptimality bounds consistently hold in practice.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2209.13092</p></details> |

Specifically, in the context of estimation, we seek the most likely evolution realizing prescribed spatio-temporal marginals of stopped particles. In the context of control, we seek the control action directing the stochastic flow toward spatio-temporal probabilistic constraints. To this end, we derive a new Schr\"odinger system of coupled, in space and time, partial differential equations to construct the solution of the proposed problem. Further, we show that a Fortet-Sinkhorn type of algorithm is, once again, available to attain the associated bridge. A key feature of the framework is that the obtained bridge retains the Markovian structure in the prior process, and thereby, the corresponding control action takes the form of state feedback.</p></details> | 6 pages, 2 figures |

The restoration and enhancement have proven to be highly beneficial. However, there are only a limited number of enhancement methods explicitly designed for videos acquired in low-light conditions. We propose a Spatio-Temporal Aligned SUNet (STA-SUNet) model using a Swin Transformer as a backbone to capture low light video features and exploit their spatio-temporal correlations. The STA-SUNet model is trained on a novel, fully registered dataset (BVI), which comprises dynamic scenes captured under varying light conditions. It is further analysed comparatively against various other models over three test datasets. The model demonstrates superior adaptivity across all datasets, obtaining the highest PSNR and SSIM values. It is particularly effective in extreme low-light conditions, yielding fairly good visualisation results.</p></details> |  |
| **[Seasonal Fire Prediction using Spatio-Temporal Deep Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06437v1)** | 2024-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With climate change expected to exacerbate fire weather conditions, the accurate anticipation of wildfires on a global scale becomes increasingly crucial for disaster mitigation. In this study, we utilize SeasFire, a comprehensive global wildfire dataset with climate, vegetation, oceanic indices, and human-related variables, to enable seasonal wildfire forecasting with machine learning. For the predictive analysis, we train deep learning models with different architectures that capture the spatio-temporal context leading to wildfires. Our investigation focuses on assessing the effectiveness of these models in predicting the presence of burned areas at varying forecasting time horizons globally, extending up to six months into the future, and on how different spatial or/and temporal context affects the performance of the models. Our findings demonstrate the great potential of deep learning models in seasonal fire forecasting; longer input time-series leads to more robust predictions across varying forecasting horizons, while integrating spatial information to capture wildfire spatio-temporal dynamics boosts performance. Finally, our results hint that in order to enhance performance at longer forecasting horizons, a larger receptive field spatially needs to be considered.</p></details> |  |
| **[PASTA: Towards Flexible and Efficient HDR Imaging Via Progressively Aggregated Spatio-Temporal Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10376v2)** | 2024-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Leveraging Transformer attention has led to great advancements in HDR deghosting. However, the intricate nature of self-attention introduces practical challenges, as existing state-of-the-art methods often demand high-end GPUs or exhibit slow inference speeds, especially for high-resolution images like 2K. Striking an optimal balance between performance and latency remains a critical concern. In response, this work presents PASTA, a novel Progressively Aggregated Spatio-Temporal Alignment framework for HDR deghosting. Our approach achieves effectiveness and efficiency by harnessing hierarchical representation during feature distanglement. Through the utilization of diverse granularities within the hierarchical structure, our method substantially boosts computational speed and optimizes the HDR imaging workflow. In addition, we explore within-scale feature modeling with local and global attention, gradually merging and refining them in a coarse-to-fine fashion. Experimental results showcase PASTA's superiority over current SOTA methods in both visual quality and performance metrics, accompanied by a substantial 3-fold (x3) increase in inference speed.</p></details> |  |
| **[Video Anomaly Detection via Spatio-Temporal Pseudo-Anomaly Generation : A Unified Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16514v2)** | 2024-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) is an open-set recognition task, which is usually formulated as a one-class classification (OCC) problem, where training data is comprised of videos with normal instances while test data contains both normal and anomalous instances. Recent works have investigated the creation of pseudo-anomalies (PAs) using only the normal data and making strong assumptions about real-world anomalies with regards to abnormality of objects and speed of motion to inject prior information about anomalies in an autoencoder (AE) based reconstruction model during training. This work proposes a novel method for generating generic spatio-temporal PAs by inpainting a masked out region of an image using a pre-trained Latent Diffusion Model and further perturbing the optical flow using mixup to emulate spatio-temporal distortions in the data. In addition, we present a simple unified framework to detect real-world anomalies under the OCC setting by learning three types of anomaly indicators, namely reconstruction quality, temporal irregularity and semantic inconsistency. Extensive experiments on four VAD benchmark datasets namely Ped2, Avenue, ShanghaiTech and UBnormal demonstrate that our method performs on par with other existing state-of-the-art PAs generation and reconstruction based methods under the OCC setting. Our analysis also examines the transferability and generalisation of PAs across these datasets, offering valuable insights by identifying real-world anomalies through PAs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in CVPRW 2024 - VAND Workshop</p></details> |

Existing approaches struggle to establish effective symbolic reasoning structures, which are crucial for answering compositional spatio-temporal questions. To address this challenge, we propose a neural-symbolic framework called Neural-Symbolic VideoQA (NS-VideoQA), specifically designed for real-world VideoQA tasks. The uniqueness and superiority of NS-VideoQA are two-fold: 1) It proposes a Scene Parser Network (SPN) to transform static-dynamic video scenes into Symbolic Representation (SR), structuralizing persons, objects, relations, and action chronologies. 2) A Symbolic Reasoning Machine (SRM) is designed for top-down question decompositions and bottom-up compositional reasonings. Specifically, a polymorphic program executor is constructed for internally consistent reasoning from SR to the final answer. As a result, Our NS-VideoQA not only improves the compositional spatio-temporal reasoning in real-world VideoQA task, but also enables step-by-step error analysis by tracing the intermediate results. Experimental evaluations on the AGQA Decomp benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed NS-VideoQA framework. Empirical studies further confirm that NS-VideoQA exhibits internal consistency in answering compositional questions and significantly improves the capability of spatio-temporal and logical inference for VideoQA tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Personalized Federated Learning for Spatio-Temporal Forecasting: A Dual Semantic Alignment-Based Contrastive Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03702v1)** | 2024-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The existing federated learning (FL) methods for spatio-temporal forecasting fail to capture the inherent spatio-temporal heterogeneity, which calls for personalized FL (PFL) methods to model the spatio-temporally variant patterns. While contrastive learning approach is promising in addressing spatio-temporal heterogeneity, the existing methods are noneffective in determining negative pairs and can hardly apply to PFL paradigm. To tackle this limitation, we propose a novel PFL method, named Federated dUal sEmantic aLignment-based contraStive learning (FUELS), which can adaptively align positive and negative pairs based on semantic similarity, thereby injecting precise spatio-temporal heterogeneity into the latent representation space by auxiliary contrastive tasks. From temporal perspective, a hard negative filtering module is introduced to dynamically align heterogeneous temporal representations for the supplemented intra-client contrastive task. From spatial perspective, we design lightweight-but-efficient prototypes as client-level semantic representations, based on which the server evaluates spatial similarity and yields client-customized global prototypes for the supplemented inter-client contrastive task. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FUELS outperforms state-of-the-art methods, with communication cost decreasing by around 94%.</p></details> |  |

Regardless of the recipient, the message space and time scale could be too fast, too slow, too large, or too small and may never be decoded. Therefore, it pays to devise a way to encode messages agnostic of space and time scales. We propose the use of fractal functions as self-executable infinite-frequency carriers for sending messages, given their properties of structural self-similarity and scale invariance. We call it `fractal messaging'. Starting from a spatial embedding, we introduce a framework for a space-time scale-free messaging approach to this challenge. When considering a space and time-agnostic framework for message transmission, it would be interesting to encode a message such that it could be decoded at several spatio-temporal scales. Hence, the core idea of the framework proposed herein is to encode a binary message as waves along infinitely many frequencies (in power-like distributions) and amplitudes, transmit such a message, and then decode and reproduce it. To do so, the components of the Weierstrass function, a known fractal, are used as carriers of the message. Each component will have its amplitude modulated to embed the binary stream, allowing for a space-time-agnostic approach to messaging.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages + appendix (21 pages total)</p></details> |

Its purpose is to anticipate future patterns, trends, and events in diverse facets of urban life, including transportation, population movement, and crime rates. Although numerous efforts have been dedicated to developing neural network techniques for accurate predictions on spatio-temporal data, it is important to note that many of these methods heavily depend on having sufficient labeled data to generate precise spatio-temporal representations. Unfortunately, the issue of data scarcity is pervasive in practical urban sensing scenarios. Consequently, it becomes necessary to build a spatio-temporal model with strong generalization capabilities across diverse spatio-temporal learning scenarios. Taking inspiration from the remarkable achievements of large language models (LLMs), our objective is to create a spatio-temporal LLM that can exhibit exceptional generalization capabilities across a wide range of downstream urban tasks. To achieve this objective, we present the UrbanGPT, which seamlessly integrates a spatio-temporal dependency encoder with the instruction-tuning paradigm. This integration enables LLMs to comprehend the complex inter-dependencies across time and space, facilitating more comprehensive and accurate predictions under data scarcity. To validate the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct extensive experiments on various public datasets, covering different spatio-temporal prediction tasks. The results consistently demonstrate that our UrbanGPT, with its carefully designed architecture, consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. These findings highlight the potential of building large language models for spatio-temporal learning, particularly in zero-shot scenarios where labeled data is scarce.</p></details> | 11 pages |

This paper addresses a critical limitation in current video grounding methodologies by introducing an Open-Vocabulary Spatio-Temporal Video Grounding task. Unlike prevalent closed-set approaches that struggle with open-vocabulary scenarios due to limited training data and predefined vocabularies, our model leverages pre-trained representations from foundational spatial grounding models. This empowers it to effectively bridge the semantic gap between natural language and diverse visual content, achieving strong performance in closed-set and open-vocabulary settings. Our contributions include a novel spatio-temporal video grounding model, surpassing state-of-the-art results in closed-set evaluations on multiple datasets and demonstrating superior performance in open-vocabulary scenarios. Notably, the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art methods in closed-set settings on VidSTG (Declarative and Interrogative) and HC-STVG (V1 and V2) datasets. Furthermore, in open-vocabulary evaluations on HC-STVG V1 and YouCook-Interactions, our model surpasses the recent best-performing models by $4.88$ m_vIoU and $1.83\%$ accuracy, demonstrating its efficacy in handling diverse linguistic and visual concepts for improved video understanding.

These models provide several benefits over other types of generative models due to their training stability, invertibility and efficiency in sampling and inference. This makes them a suitable candidate for stochastic spatio-temporal prediction problems, which are omnipresent in many fields of sciences, such as earth sciences, astrophysics or molecular sciences. In this paper, we present conditional normalizing flows for stochastic spatio-temporal modelling. The method is evaluated on the task of daily temperature and hourly geopotential map prediction from ERA5 datasets.

Dominant pipelines propose to tackle the visual discrepancies with additional temporal learners while overlooking the substantial discrepancy for web-scaled descriptive narratives and concise action category names, leading to less distinct semantic space and potential performance limitations. In this work, we prioritize the refinement of text knowledge to facilitate generalizable video recognition. To address the limitations of the less distinct semantic space of category names, we prompt a large language model (LLM) to augment action class names into Spatio-Temporal Descriptors thus bridging the textual discrepancy and serving as a knowledge base for general recognition. Moreover, to assign the best descriptors with different video instances, we propose Optimal Descriptor Solver, forming the video recognition problem as solving the optimal matching flow across frame-level representations and descriptors. Comprehensive evaluations in zero-shot, few-shot, and fully supervised video recognition highlight the effectiveness of our approach. Our best model achieves a state-of-the-art zero-shot accuracy of 75.1% on Kinetics-600.</p></details> | <details><summary>Techn...</summary><p>Technical report.

To correctly exploit the provided information by each sensor in a single common frame, it is essential for these sensors to be accurately calibrated. In this paper, we leverage the ability of Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) to represent different sensors modalities in a common volumetric representation to achieve robust and accurate spatio-temporal sensor calibration. By designing a partitioning approach based on the visible part of the scene for each sensor, we formulate the calibration problem using only the overlapping areas. This strategy results in a more robust and accurate calibration that is less prone to failure. We demonstrate that our approach works on outdoor urban scenes by validating it on multiple established driving datasets. Results show that our method is able to get better accuracy and robustness compared to existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at CVPR 2024.

There is increasing interest in achieving 24/7 Carbon-Free Energy (CFE) matching in electricity usage, aiming to eliminate all carbon footprints associated with electricity consumption on an hourly basis. However, the variability of renewable energy resources poses significant challenges for achieving this goal. We explore the impact of shifting computing jobs and associated power loads both in time and between datacenter locations. We develop an optimization model to simulate a network of geographically distributed datacenters managed by a company leveraging spatio-temporal load flexibility to achieve 24/7 CFE matching. We isolate three signals relevant for informed use of load flexiblity: varying average quality of renewable energy resources, low correlation between wind power generation over long distances due to different weather conditions, and lags in solar radiation peak due to Earth's rotation. We illustrate that the location of datacenters and the time of year affect which signal drives an effective load-shaping strategy. The energy procurement and load-shifting decisions based on informed use of these signals facilitate the resource-efficiency and cost-effectiveness of clean computing -- the costs of 24/7 CFE are reduced by 1.29$\pm$0.07 EUR/MWh for every additional percentage of flexible load. We provide practical guidelines on how companies with datacenters can leverage spatio-temporal load flexibility for truly clean computing. Our results and the open-source optimization model can also be useful for a broader variety of companies with flexible loads and an interest in eliminating their carbon footprint.</p></details> |  |

To bridge this gap, we propose a novel generative pre-training framework, GPD, for spatio-temporal few-shot learning with urban knowledge transfer. Unlike conventional approaches that heavily rely on common feature extraction or intricate few-shot learning designs, our solution takes a novel approach by performing generative pre-training on a collection of neural network parameters optimized with data from source cities. We recast spatio-temporal few-shot learning as pre-training a generative diffusion model, which generates tailored neural networks guided by prompts, allowing for adaptability to diverse data distributions and city-specific characteristics. GPD employs a Transformer-based denoising diffusion model, which is model-agnostic to integrate with powerful spatio-temporal neural networks. By addressing challenges arising from data gaps and the complexity of generalizing knowledge across cities, our framework consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on multiple real-world datasets for tasks such as traffic speed prediction and crowd flow prediction. The implementation of our approach is available: https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/GPD.</p></details> |  |

The accuracy of expression spotting is affected not only by irrelevant facial movements but also by the difficulty of perceiving subtle motions in micro-expressions. In this paper, we propose a Multi-Scale Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (SpoT-GCN) for facial expression spotting. To extract more robust motion features, we track both short- and long-term motion of facial muscles in compact sliding windows whose window length adapts to the temporal receptive field of the network. This strategy, termed the receptive field adaptive sliding window strategy, effectively magnifies the motion features while alleviating the problem of severe head movement. The subtle motion features are then converted to a facial graph representation, whose spatio-temporal graph patterns are learned by a graph convolutional network. This network learns both local and global features from multiple scales of facial graph structures using our proposed facial local graph pooling (FLGP). Furthermore, we introduce supervised contrastive learning to enhance the discriminative capability of our model for difficult-to-classify frames. The experimental results on the SAMM-LV and CAS(ME)^2 datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly in micro-expression spotting. Ablation studies further verify the effectiveness of our proposed modules.</p></details> | Accepted by FG2024 |

However, existing methods, which depend solely on appearance matching via Siamese networks or utilize motion information from successive frames, encounter significant challenges. Issues such as similar objects nearby or occlusions can result in tracker drift. To mitigate these challenges, we design an innovative spatio-temporal bi-directional cross-frame distractor filtering tracker, named STMD-Tracker. Our first step involves the creation of a 4D multi-frame spatio-temporal graph convolution backbone. This design separates KNN graph spatial embedding and incorporates 1D temporal convolution, effectively capturing temporal fluctuations and spatio-temporal information. Subsequently, we devise a novel bi-directional cross-frame memory procedure. This integrates future and synthetic past frame memory to enhance the current memory, thereby improving the accuracy of iteration-based tracking. This iterative memory update mechanism allows our tracker to dynamically compensate for information in the current frame, effectively reducing tracker drift. Lastly, we construct spatially reliable Gaussian masks on the fused features to eliminate distractor points. This is further supplemented by an object-aware sampling strategy, which bolsters the efficiency and precision of object localization, thereby reducing tracking errors caused by distractors. Our extensive experiments on KITTI, NuScenes and Waymo datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly surpasses the current state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | 18 pages,6 figures |

PAR presents two major challenges: 1) recognizing the nuanced interactions among numerous individuals and 2) understanding multi-granular human activities. To address these, we propose Social Proximity-aware Dual-Path Network (SPDP-Net) based on two key design principles. First, while previous works often focus on spatial distance among individuals within an image, we argue to consider the spatio-temporal proximity. It is crucial for individual relation encoding to correctly understand social dynamics. Secondly, deviating from existing hierarchical approaches (individual-to-social-to-global activity), we introduce a dual-path architecture for multi-granular activity recognition. This architecture comprises individual-to-global and individual-to-social paths, mutually reinforcing each other's task with global-local context through multiple layers. Through extensive experiments, we validate the effectiveness of the spatio-temporal proximity among individuals and the dual-path architecture in PAR. Furthermore, SPDP-Net achieves new state-of-the-art performance with 46.5\% of overall F1 score on JRDB-PAR dataset.</p></details> |  |

But coarse, heterogeneous aggregations complicate learning and integration for downstream AI/ML systems. In this work, we consider models to disaggregate spatio-temporal data from a low-resolution, irregular partition (e.g., census tract) to a high-resolution, irregular partition (e.g., city block). We propose a model, Gated Recurrent Unit with Spatial Attention ($GRU^{spa}$), where spatial attention layers are integrated into the original Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) model. The spatial attention layers capture spatial interactions among regions, while the gated recurrent module captures the temporal dependencies. Additionally, we utilize containment relationships between different geographic levels (e.g., when a given city block is wholly contained in a given census tract) to constrain the spatial attention layers. For situations where limited historical training data is available, we study transfer learning scenarios and show that a model pre-trained on one city variable can be fine-tuned for another city variable using only a few hundred samples. Evaluating these techniques on two mobility datasets, we find that $GRU^{spa}$ provides a significant improvement over other neural models as well as typical heuristic methods, allowing us to synthesize realistic point data over small regions useful for training downstream models.</p></details> |  |

Achieving general representation through self-supervised learning (SSL) is a well-known approach to overcome the scarcity of labeled data; however, a naive application of SSL to ECG data, without considering the spatial-temporal relationships inherent in ECG signals, may yield suboptimal results. In this paper, we introduce ST-MEM (Spatio-Temporal Masked Electrocardiogram Modeling), designed to learn spatio-temporal features by reconstructing masked 12-lead ECG data.

Existing geo-textual indexes for TkQs use traditional retrieval models like BM25 to compute text relevance and usually exploit a simple linear function to compute spatial relevance, but its effectiveness is limited. To improve effectiveness, several deep learning models have recently been proposed, but they suffer severe efficiency issues. To the best of our knowledge, there are no efficient indexes specifically designed to accelerate the top-k search process for these deep learning models. To tackle these issues, we propose a novel technique, which Learns to Index the Spatio-Textual data for answering embedding based spatial keyword queries (called LIST). LIST is featured with two novel components. Firstly, we propose a lightweight and effective relevance model that is capable of learning both textual and spatial relevance. Secondly, we introduce a novel machine learning based Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS) index, which utilizes a new learning-to-cluster technique to group relevant queries and objects together while separating irrelevant queries and objects. Two key challenges in building an effective and efficient index are the absence of high-quality labels and unbalanced clustering results. We develop a novel pseudo-label generation technique to address the two challenges. Experimental results show that LIST significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on effectiveness, with improvements up to 19.21% and 12.79% in terms of NDCG@1 and Recall@10, and is three orders of magnitude faster than the most effective baseline.</p></details> |  |

The events are observed in France over a span of three years. Spatio-temporal covariates are observed with resolution $0.1^\circ \times 0.1^\circ$ ($\approx 100$km$^2$) and six-hour periods. This results in an extensive dataset, further characterized by a significant excess of zeroes (i.e., spatio-temporal cells with no observed events). We reexamine composite likelihood methods commonly employed for spatial point processes, especially in situations where covariates are piecewise constant. Additionally, we extend these methods to account for zero-deflated subsampling, a strategy involving dependent subsampling, with a focus on selecting more cells in regions where events are observed. A simulation study is conducted to illustrate these novel methodologies, followed by their application to the dataset of lightning strikes.</p></details> |  |

It automatically decomposes the given task into smaller, more manageable subtasks, and thus enables sparse decision-making and focused computation on the relevant parts of the environment. The decomposition relies on the extraction of an abstracted proxy problem represented as a directed graph, in which vertices and edges are learned end-to-end from hindsight. Our theoretical analyses provide performance guarantees under appropriate assumptions and establish where our approach is expected to be helpful. Generalization-focused experiments validate Skipper's significant advantage in zero-shot generalization, compared to some existing state-of-the-art hierarchical planning methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2024 Camera-Ready</p></details> |

| **[Bayesian Design for Sampling Anomalous Spatio-Temporal Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10791v1)** | 2024-03-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data collected from arrays of sensors are essential for informed decision-making in various systems. However, the presence of anomalies can compromise the accuracy and reliability of insights drawn from the collected data or information obtained via statistical analysis. This study aims to develop a robust Bayesian optimal experimental design (BOED) framework with anomaly detection methods for high-quality data collection. We introduce a general framework that involves anomaly generation, detection and error scoring when searching for an optimal design. This method is demonstrated using two comprehensive simulated case studies: the first study uses a spatial dataset, and the second uses a spatio-temporal river network dataset. As a baseline approach, we employed a commonly used prediction-based utility function based on minimising errors. Results illustrate the trade-off between predictive accuracy and anomaly detection performance for our method under various design scenarios. An optimal design robust to anomalies ensures the collection and analysis of more trustworthy data, playing a crucial role in understanding the dynamics of complex systems such as the environment, therefore enabling informed decisions in monitoring, management, and response.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatio-temporal Occupancy Models with INLA](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10680v1)** | 2024-03-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern methods for quantifying and predicting species distribution play a crucial part in biodiversity conservation. Occupancy models are a popular choice for analyzing species occurrence data as they allow to separate the observational error induced by imperfect detection, and the sources of bias affecting the occupancy process. However, the spatial and temporal variation in occupancy not accounted for by environmental covariates is often ignored or modelled through simple spatial structures as the computational costs of fitting explicit spatio-temporal models is too high. In this work, we demonstrate how INLA may be used to fit complex occupancy models and how the R-INLA package can provide a user-friendly interface to make such complex models available to users. We show how occupancy models, provided some simplification on the detection process, can be framed as latent Gaussian models and benefit from the powerful INLA machinery. A large selection of complex modelling features, and random effect modelshave already been implemented in R-INLA. These become available for occupancy models, providing the user with an efficient and flexible toolbox. We illustrate how INLA provides a computationally efficient framework for developing and fitting complex occupancy models using two case studies. Through these, we show how different spatio-temporal models that include spatial-varying trends, smooth terms, and spatio-temporal random effects can be fitted. At the cost of limiting the complexity of the detection model, INLA can incorporate a range of complex structures in the process. INLA-based occupancy models provide an alternative framework to fit complex spatiotemporal occupancy models. The need for new and more flexible computationally approaches to fit such models makes INLA an attractive option for addressing complex ecological problems, and a promising area of research.</p></details> |  |

However, estimating incidence or mortality rates associated with rare cancers presents important difficulties and poses new statistical methodological challenges. In this paper, we expand the collection of multivariate spatio-temporal models by introducing adaptable shared interactions to enable a comprehensive analysis of both incidence and cancer mortality in rare cancer cases. These models allow the modulation of spatio-temporal interactions between incidence and mortality, allowing for changes in their relationship over time. The new models have been implemented in INLA using r-generic constructions. We conduct a simulation study to evaluate the performance of the new spatio-temporal models in terms of sensitivity and specificity. Results show that multivariate spatio-temporal models with flexible shared interaction outperform conventional multivariate spatio-temporal models with independent interactions. We use these models to analyze incidence and mortality data for pancreatic cancer and leukaemia among males across 142 administrative healthcare districts of Great Britain over a span of nine biennial periods (2002-2019).</p></details> | 39 pages, 12 figures |

The Segment Anything Model (SAM), known for its accurate segmentation and zero-shot generalization, has not yet been tailored for CMR 2D+T segmentation. We therefore introduce CMR2D+T-SAM, a novel approach to adapt SAM for CMR 2D+T segmentation using spatio-temporal adaption. This approach also incorporates a U-Net framework for multi-scale feature extraction, as well as text prompts for accurate segmentation on both short-axis (SAX) and long-axis (LAX) views using a single model. CMR2D+T-SAM outperforms existing deep learning methods on the STACOM2011 dataset, achieving a myocardium Dice score of 0.885 and a Hausdorff distance (HD) of 2.900 pixels. It also demonstrates superior zero-shot generalization on the ACDC dataset with a Dice score of 0.840 and a HD of 4.076 pixels.</p></details> | 10 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Autoregressive Queries for Adaptive Tracking with Spatio-TemporalTransformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10574v1)** | 2024-03-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rich spatio-temporal information is crucial to capture the complicated target appearance variations in visual tracking. However, most top-performing tracking algorithms rely on many hand-crafted components for spatio-temporal information aggregation. Consequently, the spatio-temporal information is far away from being fully explored. To alleviate this issue, we propose an adaptive tracker with spatio-temporal transformers (named AQATrack), which adopts simple autoregressive queries to effectively learn spatio-temporal information without many hand-designed components. Firstly, we introduce a set of learnable and autoregressive queries to capture the instantaneous target appearance changes in a sliding window fashion. Then, we design a novel attention mechanism for the interaction of existing queries to generate a new query in current frame. Finally, based on the initial target template and learnt autoregressive queries, a spatio-temporal information fusion module (STM) is designed for spatiotemporal formation aggregation to locate a target object. Benefiting from the STM, we can effectively combine the static appearance and instantaneous changes to guide robust tracking. Extensive experiments show that our method significantly improves the tracker's performance on six popular tracking benchmarks: LaSOT, LaSOText, TrackingNet, GOT-10k, TNL2K, and UAV123.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatio-temporal methods for estimating subsurface ocean thermal response to tropical cyclones](http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.15130v5)** | 2024-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tropical cyclones (TCs), driven by heat exchange between the air and sea, pose a substantial risk to many communities around the world. Accurate characterization of the subsurface ocean thermal response to TC passage is crucial for accurate TC intensity forecasts and for an understanding of the role that TCs play in the global climate system. However, that characterization is complicated by the high-noise ocean environment, correlations inherent in spatio-temporal data, relative scarcity of in situ observations, and the entanglement of the TC-induced signal with seasonal signals. We present a general methodological framework that addresses these difficulties, integrating existing techniques in seasonal mean field estimation, Gaussian process modeling, and nonparametric regression into an ANOVA decomposition model. Importantly, we improve upon past work by properly handling seasonality, providing rigorous uncertainty quantification, and treating time as a continuous variable, rather than producing estimates that are binned in time. This ANOVA model is estimated using in situ subsurface temperature profiles from the Argo fleet of autonomous floats through a multi-step procedure, which (1) characterizes the upper ocean seasonal shift during the TC season; (2) models the variability in the temperature observations; (3) fits a thin plate spline using the variability estimates to account for heteroskedasticity and correlation between the observations. This spline fit reveals the ocean thermal response to TC passage. Through this framework, we obtain new scientific insights into the interaction between TCs and the ocean on a global scale, including a three-dimensional characterization of the near-surface and subsurface cooling along the TC storm track and the mixing-induced subsurface warming on the track's right side.</p></details> | <details><summary>39 pa...</summary><p>39 pages, 14 figures; supplement and code at https://github.com/huisaddison/tc-ocean-methods</p></details> |

The traditional one-size-fits-all scheme for bitrate ladders is inefficient and reaching the best content-aware decision computationally impractical due to extensive encodings required. To mitigate this, we propose a bitrate and complexity efficient bitrate ladder prediction method using transfer learning and spatio-temporal features. We propose: (1) using feature maps from well-known pre-trained DNNs to predict rate-quality behavior with limited training data; and (2) improving highest quality rung efficiency by predicting minimum bitrate for top quality and using it for the top rung. The method tested on 102 video scenes demonstrates 94.1% reduction in complexity versus brute-force at 1.71% BD-Rate expense.

| **[CINA: Conditional Implicit Neural Atlas for Spatio-Temporal Representation of Fetal Brains](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08550v1)** | 2024-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a conditional implicit neural atlas (CINA) for spatio-temporal atlas generation from Magnetic Resonance Images (MRI) of the neurotypical and pathological fetal brain, that is fully independent of affine or non-rigid registration. During training, CINA learns a general representation of the fetal brain and encodes subject specific information into latent code. After training, CINA can construct a faithful atlas with tissue probability maps of the fetal brain for any gestational age (GA) and anatomical variation covered within the training domain. Thus, CINA is competent to represent both, neurotypical and pathological brains. Furthermore, a trained CINA model can be fit to brain MRI of unseen subjects via test-time optimization of the latent code. CINA can then produce probabilistic tissue maps tailored to a particular subject. We evaluate our method on a total of 198 T2 weighted MRI of normal and abnormal fetal brains from the dHCP and FeTA datasets. We demonstrate CINA's capability to represent a fetal brain atlas that can be flexibly conditioned on GA and on anatomical variations like ventricular volume or degree of cortical folding, making it a suitable tool for modeling both neurotypical and pathological brains. We quantify the fidelity of our atlas by means of tissue segmentation and age prediction and compare it to an established baseline. CINA demonstrates superior accuracy for neurotypical brains and pathological brains with ventriculomegaly. Moreover, CINA scores a mean absolute error of 0.23 weeks in fetal brain age prediction, further confirming an accurate representation of fetal brain development.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to MICCAI 2024</p></details> |
| **[Process signature-driven high spatio-temporal resolution alignment of multimodal data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06888v2)** | 2024-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present HiRA-Pro, a novel procedure to align, at high spatio-temporal resolutions, multimodal signals from real-world processes and systems that exhibit diverse transient, nonlinear stochastic dynamics, such as manufacturing machines. It is based on discerning and synchronizing the process signatures of salient kinematic and dynamic events in these disparate signals. HiRA-Pro addresses the challenge of aligning data with sub-millisecond phenomena, where traditional timestamp, external trigger, or clock-based alignment methods fall short. The effectiveness of HiRA-Pro is demonstrated in a smart manufacturing context, where it aligns data from 13+ channels acquired during 3D-printing and milling operations on an Optomec-LENS MTS 500 hybrid machine. The aligned data is then voxelized to generate 0.25 second aligned data chunks that correspond to physical voxels on the produced part. The superiority of HiRA-Pro is further showcased through case studies in additive manufacturing, demonstrating improved machine learning-based predictive performance due to precise multimodal data alignment. Specifically, testing classification accuracies improved by almost 35% with the application of HiRA-Pro, even with limited data, allowing for precise localization of artifacts. The paper also provides a comprehensive discussion on the proposed method, its applications, and comparative qualitative analysis with a few other alignment methods. HiRA-Pro achieves temporal-spatial resolutions of 10-1000 us and 100 um in order to generate datasets that register with physical voxels on the 3D-printed and milled part. These resolutions are at least an order of magnitude finer than the existing alignment methods that employ individual timestamps, statistical correlations, or common clocks, which achieve precision of hundreds of milliseconds.</p></details> |  |
| **[JSTR: Joint Spatio-Temporal Reasoning for Event-based Moving Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07436v1)** | 2024-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Event-based moving object detection is a challenging task, where static background and moving object are mixed together. Typically, existing methods mainly align the background events to the same spatial coordinate system via motion compensation to distinguish the moving object. However, they neglect the potential spatial tailing effect of moving object events caused by excessive motion, which may affect the structure integrity of the extracted moving object. We discover that the moving object has a complete columnar structure in the point cloud composed of motion-compensated events along the timestamp. Motivated by this, we propose a novel joint spatio-temporal reasoning method for event-based moving object detection. Specifically, we first compensate the motion of background events using inertial measurement unit. In spatial reasoning stage, we project the compensated events into the same image coordinate, discretize the timestamp of events to obtain a time image that can reflect the motion confidence, and further segment the moving object through adaptive threshold on the time image. In temporal reasoning stage, we construct the events into a point cloud along timestamp, and use RANSAC algorithm to extract the columnar shape in the cloud for peeling off the background. Finally, we fuse the results from the two reasoning stages to extract the final moving object region. This joint spatio-temporal reasoning framework can effectively detect the moving object from motion confidence and geometric structure. Moreover, we conduct extensive experiments on various datasets to verify that the proposed method can improve the moving object detection accuracy by 13\%.</p></details> |  |
| **[Minimum contrast for the first-order intensity estimation of spatial and spatio-temporal point processes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04669v2)** | 2024-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we harness a result in point process theory, specifically the expectation of the weighted $K$-function, where the weighting is done by the true first-order intensity function. This theoretical result can be employed as an estimation method to derive parameter estimates for a particular model assumed for the data. The underlying motivation is to avoid the difficulties associated with dealing with complex likelihoods in point process models and their maximization. The exploited result makes our method theoretically applicable to any model specification. In this paper, we restrict our study to Poisson models, whose likelihood represents the base for many more complex point process models. In this context, our proposed method can estimate the vector of local parameters that correspond to the points within the analyzed point pattern without introducing any additional complexity compared to the global estimation. We illustrate the method through simulation studies for both purely spatial and spatio-temporal point processes and show complex scenarios based on the Poisson model through the analysis of two real datasets concerning environmental problems.</p></details> |  |

Tangible cubes, with their rich interaction affordances, high maneuverability, and stable structure, are particularly well-suited for exploring multi-dimensional data types. However, the design potential of these cubes is underexplored. This study introduces a design space for tangible cubes in MR, focusing on interaction space, visualization space, sizes, and multiplicity. Using spatio-temporal data, we explored the interaction affordances of these cubes in a workshop (N=24). We identified unique interactions like rotating, tapping, and stacking, which are linked to augmented reality (AR) visualization commands. Integrating user-identified interactions, we created a design space for tangible-cube interactions and visualization. A prototype visualizing global health spending with small cubes was developed and evaluated, supporting both individual and combined cube manipulation. This research enhances our grasp of tangible interaction in MR, offering insights for future design and application in diverse data contexts.</p></details> |  |

Temporal localization is challenging because it requires robustness, reliability, and accuracy. In this study, we aim to improve the temporal localization and classification accuracy performance by adapting video action recognition and 2D human-pose estimation networks to one model. Therefore, we design a transformer-based fusion architecture to effectively combine 2D-pose features and spatio-temporal features. The model uses 2D-pose features as the positional embedding of the transformer architecture and spatio-temporal features as the main input to the encoder of the transformer. The proposed solution is generic and independent of the camera numbers and positions, giving frame-based class probabilities as output. Finally, the post-processing step combines information from different camera views to obtain final predictions and eliminate false positives. The model performs well on the A2 test set of the 2023 NVIDIA AI City Challenge for naturalistic driving action recognition, achieving the overlap score of the organizer-defined distracted driver behaviour metric of 0.5079.</p></details> |  |

Pillar-based methods stand out as a practical choice for onboard deployment due to their computational efficiency. However, despite their efficiency, these methods can sometimes underperform compared to alternative point encoding techniques such as Voxel-encoding or PointNet++. We argue that current pillar-based methods have not sufficiently captured the fine-grained distributions of LiDAR points within each pillar structure. Consequently, there exists considerable room for improvement in pillar feature encoding. In this paper, we introduce a novel pillar encoding architecture referred to as Fine-Grained Pillar Feature Encoding (FG-PFE). FG-PFE utilizes Spatio-Temporal Virtual (STV) grids to capture the distribution of point clouds within each pillar across vertical, temporal, and horizontal dimensions. Through STV grids, points within each pillar are individually encoded using Vertical PFE (V-PFE), Temporal PFE (T-PFE), and Horizontal PFE (H-PFE). These encoded features are then aggregated through an Attentive Pillar Aggregation method. Our experiments conducted on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that FG-PFE achieves significant performance improvements over baseline models such as PointPillar, CenterPoint-Pillar, and PillarNet, with only a minor increase in computational overhead.</p></details> | ICRA 2024 |

However, existing ST models often require region partition as a prerequisite, resulting in two main pitfalls. Firstly, location-based services necessitate ad-hoc regions for various purposes, requiring multiple ST models with varying scales and zones, which can be costly to support. Secondly, different ST models may produce conflicting outputs, resulting in confusing predictions. In this paper, we propose One4All-ST, a framework that can conduct ST prediction for arbitrary modifiable areal units using only one model. To reduce the cost of getting multi-scale predictions, we design an ST network with hierarchical spatial modeling and scale normalization modules to efficiently and equally learn multi-scale representations. To address prediction inconsistencies across scales, we propose a dynamic programming scheme to solve the formulated optimal combination problem, minimizing predicted error through theoretical analysis. Besides, we suggest using an extended quad-tree to index the optimal combinations for quick response to arbitrary modifiable areal units in practical online scenarios. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets verify the efficiency and effectiveness of One4All-ST in ST prediction for arbitrary modifiable areal units.

Despite their success, they fail to model intrinsic uncertainties within STG data, which cripples their practicality in downstream tasks for decision-making. To this end, this paper focuses on probabilistic STG forecasting, which is challenging due to the difficulty in modeling uncertainties and complex ST dependencies. In this study, we present the first attempt to generalize the popular denoising diffusion probabilistic models to STGs, leading to a novel non-autoregressive framework called DiffSTG, along with the first denoising network UGnet for STG in the framework. Our approach combines the spatio-temporal learning capabilities of STGNNs with the uncertainty measurements of diffusion models.

A foundational framework within neuroscience research posits that trial-based neural population activities rely on low-dimensional latent dynamics, thus focusing on the latter greatly facilitates the alignment procedure. Despite this field's progress, existing methods ignore the intrinsic spatio-temporal structure during the alignment phase. Hence, their solutions usually lead to poor quality in latent dynamics structures and overall performance. To tackle this problem, we propose an alignment method ERDiff, which leverages the expressivity of the diffusion model to preserve the spatio-temporal structure of latent dynamics. Specifically, the latent dynamics structures of the source domain are first extracted by a diffusion model. Then, under the guidance of this diffusion model, such structures are well-recovered through a maximum likelihood alignment procedure in the target domain. We first demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method on a synthetic dataset. Then, when applied to neural recordings from the non-human primate motor cortex, under both cross-day and inter-subject settings, our method consistently manifests its capability of preserving the spatiotemporal structure of latent dynamics and outperforms existing approaches in alignment goodness-of-fit and neural decoding performance.</p></details> |  |

| **[Multi-Factor Spatio-Temporal Prediction based on Graph Decomposition Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10374v2)** | 2024-03-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal (ST) prediction is an important and widely used technique in data mining and analytics, especially for ST data in urban systems such as transportation data. In practice, the ST data generation is usually influenced by various latent factors tied to natural phenomena or human socioeconomic activities, impacting specific spatial areas selectively. However, existing ST prediction methods usually do not refine the impacts of different factors, but directly model the entangled impacts of multiple factors. This amplifies the modeling complexity of ST data and compromises model interpretability. To this end, we propose a multi-factor ST prediction task that predicts partial ST data evolution under different factors, and combines them for a final prediction. We make two contributions to this task: an effective theoretical solution and a portable instantiation framework. Specifically, we first propose a theoretical solution called decomposed prediction strategy and prove its effectiveness from the perspective of information entropy theory. On top of that, we instantiate a novel model-agnostic framework, named spatio-temporal graph decomposition learning (STGDL), for multi-factor ST prediction. The framework consists of two main components: an automatic graph decomposition module that decomposes the original graph structure inherent in ST data into subgraphs corresponding to different factors, and a decomposed learning network that learns the partial ST data on each subgraph separately and integrates them for the final prediction. We conduct extensive experiments on four real-world ST datasets of two types of graphs, i.e., grid graph and network graph. Results show that our framework significantly reduces prediction errors of various ST models by 9.41% on average (35.36% at most). Furthermore, a case study reveals the interpretability potential of our framework.</p></details> |  |
| **[Self-Supervised Deconfounding Against Spatio-Temporal Shifts: Theory and Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12472v2)** | 2024-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As an important application of spatio-temporal (ST) data, ST traffic forecasting plays a crucial role in improving urban travel efficiency and promoting sustainable development. In practice, the dynamics of traffic data frequently undergo distributional shifts attributed to external factors such as time evolution and spatial differences. This entails forecasting models to handle the out-of-distribution (OOD) issue where test data is distributed differently from training data. In this work, we first formalize the problem by constructing a causal graph of past traffic data, future traffic data, and external ST contexts. We reveal that the failure of prior arts in OOD traffic data is due to ST contexts acting as a confounder, i.e., the common cause for past data and future ones. Then, we propose a theoretical solution named Disentangled Contextual Adjustment (DCA) from a causal lens. It differentiates invariant causal correlations against variant spurious ones and deconfounds the effect of ST contexts. On top of that, we devise a Spatio-Temporal sElf-superVised dEconfounding (STEVE) framework. It first encodes traffic data into two disentangled representations for associating invariant and variant ST contexts. Then, we use representative ST contexts from three conceptually different perspectives (i.e., temporal, spatial, and semantic) as self-supervised signals to inject context information into both representations. In this way, we improve the generalization ability of the learned context-oriented representations to OOD ST traffic forecasting. Comprehensive experiments on four large-scale benchmark datasets demonstrate that our STEVE consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines across various ST OOD scenarios.</p></details> | 14 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Spatio-Temporal Self-Supervised Learning for Traffic Flow Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04475v2)** | 2024-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robust prediction of citywide traffic flows at different time periods plays a crucial role in intelligent transportation systems. While previous work has made great efforts to model spatio-temporal correlations, existing methods still suffer from two key limitations: i) Most models collectively predict all regions' flows without accounting for spatial heterogeneity, i.e., different regions may have skewed traffic flow distributions. ii) These models fail to capture the temporal heterogeneity induced by time-varying traffic patterns, as they typically model temporal correlations with a shared parameterized space for all time periods. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel Spatio-Temporal Self-Supervised Learning (ST-SSL) traffic prediction framework which enhances the traffic pattern representations to be reflective of both spatial and temporal heterogeneity, with auxiliary self-supervised learning paradigms. Specifically, our ST-SSL is built over an integrated module with temporal and spatial convolutions for encoding the information across space and time. To achieve the adaptive spatio-temporal self-supervised learning, our ST-SSL first performs the adaptive augmentation over the traffic flow graph data at both attribute- and structure-levels. On top of the augmented traffic graph, two SSL auxiliary tasks are constructed to supplement the main traffic prediction task with spatial and temporal heterogeneity-aware augmentation. Experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that ST-SSL consistently outperforms various state-of-the-art baselines. Since spatio-temporal heterogeneity widely exists in practical datasets, the proposed framework may also cast light on other spatial-temporal applications. Model implementation is available at https://github.com/Echo-Ji/ST-SSL.</p></details> | <details><summary>37th ...</summary><p>37th AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI 2023)</p></details> |

Concretely, earth science systems rely heavily on the extensive deployment of sensors, however, the data collection from sensors is constrained by complex geographical and social factors, making it challenging to achieve comprehensive coverage and uniform deployment. To alleviate the obstacle, traditional approaches to sensor deployment utilize specific algorithms to design and deploy sensors. These methods dynamically adjust the activation times of sensors to optimize the detection process across each sub-region. Regrettably, formulating an activation strategy generally based on historical observations and geographic characteristics, which make the methods and resultant models were neither simple nor practical. Worse still, the complex technical design may ultimately lead to a model with weak generalizability. In this paper, we introduce for the first time the concept of spatio-temporal data dynamic sparse training and are committed to adaptively, dynamically filtering important sensor distributions. To our knowledge, this is the first proposal (termed DynST) of an industry-level deployment optimization concept at the data level. However, due to the existence of the temporal dimension, pruning of spatio-temporal data may lead to conflicts at different timestamps. To achieve this goal, we employ dynamic merge technology, along with ingenious dimensional mapping to mitigate potential impacts caused by the temporal aspect. During the training process, DynST utilize iterative pruning and sparse training, repeatedly identifying and dynamically removing sensor perception areas that contribute the least to future predictions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unsupervised Spatio-Temporal State Estimation for Fine-grained Adaptive Anomaly Diagnosis of Industrial Cyber-physical Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02616v1)** | 2024-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate detection and diagnosis of abnormal behaviors such as network attacks from multivariate time series (MTS) are crucial for ensuring the stable and effective operation of industrial cyber-physical systems (CPS). However, existing researches pay little attention to the logical dependencies among system working states, and have difficulties in explaining the evolution mechanisms of abnormal signals. To reveal the spatio-temporal association relationships and evolution mechanisms of the working states of industrial CPS, this paper proposes a fine-grained adaptive anomaly diagnosis method (i.e. MAD-Transformer) to identify and diagnose anomalies in MTS. MAD-Transformer first constructs a temporal state matrix to characterize and estimate the change patterns of the system states in the temporal dimension. Then, to better locate the anomalies, a spatial state matrix is also constructed to capture the inter-sensor state correlation relationships within the system. Subsequently, based on these two types of state matrices, a three-branch structure of series-temporal-spatial attention module is designed to simultaneously capture the series, temporal, and space dependencies among MTS. Afterwards, three associated alignment loss functions and a reconstruction loss are constructed to jointly optimize the model. Finally, anomalies are determined and diagnosed by comparing the residual matrices with the original matrices. We conducted comparative experiments on five publicly datasets spanning three application domains (service monitoring, spatial and earth exploration, and water treatment), along with a petroleum refining simulation dataset collected by ourselves. The results demonstrate that MAD-Transformer can adaptively detect fine-grained anomalies with short duration, and outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines in terms of noise robustness and localization performance.</p></details> | 23 pages, 7 figures |

Recent works mainly focus on dynamic spatial modeling with adaptive graph embedding or graph attention having less consideration for temporal characteristics and in-situ modeling. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning model named TESTAM, which individually models recurring and non-recurring traffic patterns by a mixture-of-experts model with three experts on temporal modeling, spatio-temporal modeling with static graph, and dynamic spatio-temporal dependency modeling with dynamic graph. By introducing different experts and properly routing them, TESTAM could better model various circumstances, including spatially isolated nodes, highly related nodes, and recurring and non-recurring events. For the proper routing, we reformulate a gating problem into a classification problem with pseudo labels. Experimental results on three public traffic network datasets, METR-LA, PEMS-BAY, and EXPY-TKY, demonstrate that TESTAM achieves a better indication and modeling of recurring and non-recurring traffic.

Considering the sparsity of data due to the high maintenance cost of the stations, good inference algorithms can effectively save the cost and refine the data granularity. While spatio-temporal graph neural networks have made excellent progress on this problem, their non-Euclidean and discrete data structure modeling of reality limits its potential. In this work, we make the first attempt to combine two different spatio-temporal perspectives, fields and graphs, by proposing a new model, Spatio-Temporal Field Neural Network, and its corresponding new framework, Pyramidal Inference. Extensive experiments validate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance in nationwide air quality inference in the Chinese Mainland, demonstrating the superiority of our proposed model and framework.</p></details> |  |

This problem has received ever-increasing attention in various scenarios and facilitated the development of numerous downstream applications such as urban planning and transportation management. However, the efficacy of existing methods remains sub-optimal due to their tendency to model temporal and spatial relationships independently, thereby inadequately accounting for complex high-order interactions of both worlds. Moreover, the diversity of transitional patterns in traffic forecasting makes them challenging to capture for existing approaches, warranting a deeper exploration of their diversity. Toward this end, this paper proposes Conjoint Spatio-Temporal graph neural network (abbreviated as COOL), which models heterogeneous graphs from prior and posterior information to conjointly capture high-order spatio-temporal relationships. On the one hand, heterogeneous graphs connecting sequential observation are constructed to extract composite spatio-temporal relationships via prior message passing. On the other hand, we model dynamic relationships using constructed affinity and penalty graphs, which guide posterior message passing to incorporate complementary semantic information into node representations. Moreover, to capture diverse transitional properties to enhance traffic forecasting, we propose a conjoint self-attention decoder that models diverse temporal patterns from both multi-rank and multi-scale views. Experimental results on four popular benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed COOL provides state-of-the-art performance compared with the competitive baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Information Fusion 2024</p></details> |

Developers of tools for performing high-throughput phenotyping are, however, constrained by the availability of relevant datasets on which to perform validation. To this end, we present a spatio-temporal dataset of 3D point clouds of strawberry plants for two varieties, totalling 84 individual point clouds. We focus on the end use of such tools - the extraction of biologically relevant phenotypes - and demonstrate a phenotyping pipeline on the dataset. This comprises of the steps, including; segmentation, skeletonisation and tracking, and we detail how each stage facilitates the extraction of different phenotypes or provision of data insights. We particularly note that assessment is focused on the validation of phenotypes, extracted from the representations acquired at each step of the pipeline, rather than singularly focusing on assessing the representation itself. Therefore, where possible, we provide \textit{in silico} ground truth baselines for the phenotypes extracted at each step and introduce methodology for the quantitative assessment of skeletonisation and the length trait extracted thereof. This dataset contributes to the corpus of freely available agricultural/horticultural spatio-temporal data for the development of next-generation phenotyping tools, increasing the number of plant varieties available for research in this field and providing a basis for genuine comparison of new phenotyping methodology.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatio-temporal reconstruction of substance dynamics using compressed sensing in multi-spectral magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00402v1)** | 2024-03-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The objective of our study is to observe dynamics of multiple substances in vivo with high temporal resolution from multi-spectral magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) data. The multi-spectral MRSI can effectively separate spectral peaks of multiple substances and is useful to measure spatial distributions of substances. However it is difficult to measure time-varying substance distributions directly by ordinary full sampling because the measurement requires a significantly long time. In this study, we propose a novel method to reconstruct the spatio-temporal distributions of substances from randomly undersampled multi-spectral MRSI data on the basis of compressed sensing (CS) and the partially separable function model with base spectra of substances. In our method, we have employed spatio-temporal sparsity and temporal smoothness of the substance distributions as prior knowledge to perform CS. The effectiveness of our method has been evaluated using phantom data sets of glass tubes filled with glucose or lactate solution in increasing amounts over time and animal data sets of a tumor-bearing mouse to observe the metabolic dynamics involved in the Warburg effect in vivo. The reconstructed results are consistent with the expected behaviors, showing that our method can reconstruct the spatio-temporal distribution of substances with a temporal resolution of four seconds which is extremely short time scale compared with that of full sampling. Since this method utilizes only prior knowledge naturally assumed for the spatio-temporal distributions of substances and is independent of the number of the spectral and spatial dimensions or the acquisition sequence of MRSI, it is expected to contribute to revealing the underlying substance dynamics in MRSI data already acquired or to be acquired in the future.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Bayesian approach to uncover spatio-temporal determinants of heterogeneity in repeated cross-sectional health surveys](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19162v1)** | 2024-02-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In several countries, including Italy, a prominent approach to population health surveillance involves conducting repeated cross-sectional surveys at short intervals of time. These surveys gather information on the health status of individual respondents, including details on their behaviors, risk factors, and relevant socio-demographic information. While the collected data undoubtedly provides valuable information, modeling such data presents several challenges. For instance, in health risk models, it is essential to consider behavioral information, spatio-temporal dynamics, and disease co-occurrence. In response to these challenges, our work proposes a multivariate spatio-temporal logistic model for chronic disease diagnoses. Predictors are modeled using individual risk factor covariates and a latent individual propensity to the disease. Leveraging a state space formulation of the model, we construct a framework in which spatio-temporal heterogeneity in regression parameters is informed by exogenous spatial information, corresponding to different spatial contextual risk factors that may affect health and the occurrence of chronic diseases in different ways. To explore the utility and the effectiveness of our method, we analyze behavioral and risk factor surveillance data collected in Italy (PASSI), which is well-known as a country characterized by high peculiar administrative, social and territorial diversities reflected on high variability in morbidity among population subgroups.</p></details> |  |

It has been demonstrated that a transformer-based entropy model is of critical importance for achieving a high compression ratio, however, at the expense of a significant computational effort. In this work, we introduce the Efficient Contextformer (eContextformer) - a computationally efficient transformer-based autoregressive context model for learned image compression. The eContextformer efficiently fuses the patch-wise, checkered, and channel-wise grouping techniques for parallel context modeling, and introduces a shifted window spatio-channel attention mechanism. We explore better training strategies and architectural designs and introduce additional complexity optimizations. During decoding, the proposed optimization techniques dynamically scale the attention span and cache the previous attention computations, drastically reducing the model and runtime complexity. Compared to the non-parallel approach, our proposal has ~145x lower model complexity and ~210x faster decoding speed, and achieves higher average bit savings on Kodak, CLIC2020, and Tecnick datasets. Additionally, the low complexity of our context model enables online rate-distortion algorithms, which further improve the compression performance. We achieve up to 17% bitrate savings over the intra coding of Versatile Video Coding (VVC) Test Model (VTM) 16.2 and surpass various learning-based compression models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for IEEE TCSVT (14 pages, 10 figures, 9 tables)</p></details> |

Existing methods track by appearance-based similarity or long-term relation modeling, resulting in rich temporal contexts between consecutive frames being easily overlooked. Moreover, training trackers from scratch or fine-tuning large pre-trained models needs more time and memory consumption. In this paper, we present ACTrack, a new tracking framework with additive spatio-temporal conditions. It preserves the quality and capabilities of the pre-trained Transformer backbone by freezing its parameters, and makes a trainable lightweight additive net to model spatio-temporal relations in tracking. We design an additive siamese convolutional network to ensure the integrity of spatial features and perform temporal sequence modeling to simplify the tracking pipeline. Experimental results on several benchmarks prove that ACTrack could balance training efficiency and tracking performance.</p></details> |  |

It is a critical ability for intelligent, real-world systems, especially when data may be insufficient or difficult to obtain. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of real-time learning in Large Language Models.

Chronos tokenizes time series values using scaling and quantization into a fixed vocabulary and trains existing transformer-based language model architectures on these tokenized time series via the cross-entropy loss. We pretrained Chronos models based on the T5 family (ranging from 20M to 710M parameters) on a large collection of publicly available datasets, complemented by a synthetic dataset that we generated via Gaussian processes to improve generalization. In a comprehensive benchmark consisting of 42 datasets, and comprising both classical local models and deep learning methods, we show that Chronos models: (a) significantly outperform other methods on datasets that were part of the training corpus; and (b) have comparable and occasionally superior zero-shot performance on new datasets, relative to methods that were trained specifically on them. Our results demonstrate that Chronos models can leverage time series data from diverse domains to improve zero-shot accuracy on unseen forecasting tasks, positioning pretrained models as a viable tool to greatly simplify forecasting pipelines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code and model checkpoints available at https://github.com/amazon-science/chronos-forecasting</p></details> |

Moreover, the performance of these models on in-distribution data is a poor indicator of their performance on data from unseen domains. Thus, it is essential to develop metrics that can provide insights into the model's performance at test time and can be computed only with the information available at test time (such as their model parameters, the training data or its statistics, and the unlabeled test data). To this end, we propose a metric based on Optimal Transport that is highly correlated with the model's performance on unseen domains and is efficiently computable only using information available at test time. Concretely, our metric characterizes the model's performance on unseen domains using only a small amount of unlabeled data from these domains and data or statistics from the training (source) domain(s). Through extensive empirical evaluation using standard benchmark datasets, and their corruptions, we demonstrate the utility of our metric in estimating the model's performance in various practical applications. These include the problems of selecting the source data and architecture that leads to the best performance on data from an unseen domain and the problem of predicting a deployed model's performance at test time on unseen domains. Our empirical results show that our metric, which uses information from both the source and the unseen domain, is highly correlated with the model's performance, achieving a significantly better correlation than that obtained via the popular prediction entropy-based metric, which is computed solely using the data from the unseen domain.</p></details> |  |

Low-rank compression techniques based on hierarchical matrices are applied to reduce the computational cost during the offline stage when the ROMs are constructed. Numerical results show the accuracy of the approach and demonstrate the compatibility with real-time execution in standard hardware.</p></details> |  |

Heretofore, research on such operations has focused on flying without any physical interaction or exerting a pushing force on a contact surface that does not involve abrupt changes in the interaction force. In this paper, we propose a human reaction time compensating haptic-based bilateral teleoperation strategy for an aerial manipulator extracting a wedged object from a static structure (i.e., plug-pulling), which incurs an abrupt decrease in the interaction force and causes additional difficulty for an aerial platform. A haptic device composed of a 4-degree-of-freedom robotic arm and a gripper is made for the teleoperation of aerial wedged object-extracting tasks, and a haptic-based teleoperation method to execute the aerial manipulator by the haptic device is introduced. We detect the extraction of the object by the estimation of the external force exerted on the aerial manipulator and generate reference trajectories for both the aerial manipulator and the haptic device after the extraction. As an example of the extraction of a wedged object, we conduct comparative plug-pulling experiments with a quadrotor-based aerial manipulator. The results validate that the proposed bilateral teleoperation method reduces the overshoot in the aerial manipulator's position and ensures fast recovery to its initial position after extracting the wedged object.</p></details> | <details><summary>to be...</summary><p>to be presented in 2024 IEEE International Conference on Unmanned Aircraft Systems (ICUAS), Chania, Crete, Greece, 2024</p></details> |

The particular class under study is known as mean-field (overdamped) Langevin equations (MFL). We provide weak and strong error results for the scheme in both finite and infinite time. We work under a strong convexity assumption. Based on a careful analysis of the variation processes and the Kolmogorov backward equation for the particle system associated with the MV-SDE, we show that the method attains a higher-order approximation accuracy in the long-time limit (of weak order convergence rate $3/2$) than the standard Euler method (of weak order $1$). While we use an interacting particle system (IPS) to approximate the MV-SDE, we show the convergence rate is independent of the dimension of the IPS and this includes establishing uniform-in-time decay estimates for moments of the IPS, the Kolmogorov backward equation and their derivatives. The theoretical findings are supported by numerical tests.</p></details> | 68 pages, 1 Figure |

Security and safety of future vehicles highly depend on a holistic protection of automotive components, of which the time-sensitive backbone network takes a significant role. These onboard Time-Sensitive Networks (TSNs) require monitoring for safety and -- as versatile platforms to host Network Anomaly Detection Systems (NADSs) -- for security. Still a thorough evaluation of anomaly detection methods in the context of hard real-time operations, automotive protocol stacks, and domain specific attack vectors is missing along with appropriate input datasets. In this paper, we present an assessment framework that allows for reproducible, comparable, and rapid evaluation of detection algorithms. It is based on a simulation toolchain, which contributes configurable topologies, traffic streams, anomalies, attacks, and detectors. We demonstrate the assessment of NADSs in a comprehensive in-vehicular network with its communication flows, on which we model traffic anomalies. We evaluate exemplary detection mechanisms and reveal how the detection performance is influenced by different combinations of TSN traffic flows and anomaly types. Our approach translates to other real-time Ethernet domains, such as industrial facilities, airplanes, and UAVs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning to Embed Time Series Patches Independently](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16427v4)** | 2024-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Masked time series modeling has recently gained much attention as a self-supervised representation learning strategy for time series. Inspired by masked image modeling in computer vision, recent works first patchify and partially mask out time series, and then train Transformers to capture the dependencies between patches by predicting masked patches from unmasked patches. However, we argue that capturing such patch dependencies might not be an optimal strategy for time series representation learning; rather, learning to embed patches independently results in better time series representations. Specifically, we propose to use 1) the simple patch reconstruction task, which autoencode each patch without looking at other patches, and 2) the simple patch-wise MLP that embeds each patch independently. In addition, we introduce complementary contrastive learning to hierarchically capture adjacent time series information efficiently. Our proposed method improves time series forecasting and classification performance compared to state-of-the-art Transformer-based models, while it is more efficient in terms of the number of parameters and training/inference time.

| **[Scalable network reconstruction in subquadratic time](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01404v4)** | 2024-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Network reconstruction consists in determining the unobserved pairwise couplings between $N$ nodes given only observational data on the resulting behavior that is conditioned on those couplings -- typically a time-series or independent samples from a graphical model. A major obstacle to the scalability of algorithms proposed for this problem is a seemingly unavoidable quadratic complexity of $\Omega(N^2)$, corresponding to the requirement of each possible pairwise coupling being contemplated at least once, despite the fact that most networks of interest are sparse, with a number of non-zero couplings that is only $O(N)$. Here we present a general algorithm applicable to a broad range of reconstruction problems that significantly outperforms this quadratic baseline. Our algorithm relies on a stochastic second neighbor search (Dong et al., 2011) that produces the best edge candidates with high probability, thus bypassing an exhaustive quadratic search. If we rely on the conjecture that the second-neighbor search finishes in log-linear time (Baron & Darling, 2020; 2022), we demonstrate theoretically that our algorithm finishes in subquadratic time, with a data-dependent complexity loosely upper bounded by $O(N^{3/2}\log N)$, but with a more typical log-linear complexity of $O(N\log^2N)$. In practice, we show that our algorithm achieves a performance that is many orders of magnitude faster than the quadratic baseline -- in a manner consistent with our theoretical analysis -- allows for easy parallelization, and thus enables the reconstruction of networks with hundreds of thousands and even millions of nodes and edges.</p></details> | 12 pages, 7 figures |

While no model can work when data evolves in an arbitrary fashion, if there is some pattern to these changes, we might be able to design methods to address it. This paper addresses situations when data evolves gradually. We introduce a time-varying propensity score that can detect gradual shifts in the distribution of data which allows us to selectively sample past data to update the model -- not just similar data from the past like that of a standard propensity score but also data that evolved in a similar fashion in the past. The time-varying propensity score is quite general: we demonstrate different ways of implementing it and evaluate it on a variety of problems ranging from supervised learning (e.g., image classification problems) where data undergoes a sequence of gradual shifts, to reinforcement learning tasks (e.g., robotic manipulation and continuous control) where data shifts as the policy or the task changes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at ICLR 2024</p></details> |

This paper spotlights the significance of the quantitative resilience indices of medium-voltage DC (MVDC) distribution technology in marine vessels, notably naval ships. Given the intricate electrical requirements of modern naval ships, the need for a robust power supply underlines the imperative of resilient DC microgrids. Addressing this, our study introduces a novel quantitative metric for operational resilience of DC microgrids based on the measured voltage of main DC bus. This metric not only fuses real-time tracking, compatibility, and computational efficiency, but also adeptly monitors multiple event phases based on time-domain analysis of dc bus voltage dynamics. The intricacies of the dc bus voltage, including overshoots and undershoots, are meticulously accounted for in the algorithm design. With respect to existing research that typically focuses on offline resilience assessments, the proposed index provides valuable real-time information for microgrid operators and identifies whether microgrid resilience is deteriorating over time.</p></details> |  |

This study presents an optimization-driven active balancing method to minimize the effects of cell inconsistency on the system operational time while simultaneously satisfying the system output power demand and prolonging the system operational time in energy storage applications. The proposed method utilizes a fractional order model to forecast the terminal voltage dynamics of each cell within a battery system, enhanced with a particle-swarm-optimisation-genetic algorithm for precise parameter identification. It is implemented under two distinct cell-level balancing topologies: independent cell balancing and differential cell balancing. Subsequently, the current distribution for each topology is determined by resolving two optimization control problems constrained by the battery's operational specifications and power demands. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated by extensive experiments based on the two balancing topologies. The results demonstrate that the proposed method increases the operational time by 3.2%.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 11 figures; Preprint submitted to IEEE Transactions on Transportation Electrification on 02-May-2024</p></details> |

This paper develops its tightest finite-time error bounds. We show that the Greedy-GQ algorithm converges as fast as $\mathcal{O}({1}/{\sqrt{T}})$ under the i.i.d.\ setting and $\mathcal{O}({\log T}/{\sqrt{T}})$ under the Markovian setting. We further design a variant of the vanilla Greedy-GQ algorithm using the nested-loop approach, and show that its sample complexity is $\mathcal{O}({\log(1/\epsilon)\epsilon^{-2}})$, which matches with the one of the vanilla Greedy-GQ. Our finite-time error bounds match with one of the stochastic gradient descent algorithms for general smooth non-convex optimization problems, despite its additonal challenge in the two time-scale updates. Our finite-sample analysis provides theoretical guidance on choosing step-sizes for faster convergence in practice, and suggests the trade-off between the convergence rate and the quality of the obtained policy. Our techniques provide a general approach for finite-sample analysis of non-convex two timescale value-based reinforcement learning algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Springer Machine Learning Journal</p></details> |
| **[SparseTSF: Modeling Long-term Time Series Forecasting with 1k Parameters](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00946v1)** | 2024-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces SparseTSF, a novel, extremely lightweight model for Long-term Time Series Forecasting (LTSF), designed to address the challenges of modeling complex temporal dependencies over extended horizons with minimal computational resources. At the heart of SparseTSF lies the Cross-Period Sparse Forecasting technique, which simplifies the forecasting task by decoupling the periodicity and trend in time series data. This technique involves downsampling the original sequences to focus on cross-period trend prediction, effectively extracting periodic features while minimizing the model's complexity and parameter count. Based on this technique, the SparseTSF model uses fewer than 1k parameters to achieve competitive or superior performance compared to state-of-the-art models. Furthermore, SparseTSF showcases remarkable generalization capabilities, making it well-suited for scenarios with limited computational resources, small samples, or low-quality data. The code is available at: https://github.com/lss-1138/SparseTSF.</p></details> |  |

Leveraging these bounds, we propose semiparametric mean and variance joint (MVJ) models utilizing a clipped-Laplace link function. These models offer a flexible and feasible structure for both mean and variance, accommodating various scenarios of under-dispersion, equi-dispersion, or over-dispersion in bounded time series. The proposed MVJ models feature a linear mean structure with positive regression coefficients summing to one and allow for negative regression cefficients and autocorrelations. We demonstrate that the autocorrelation structure of MVJ models mirrors that of an autoregressive moving-average (ARMA) process, provided the proposed clipped-Laplace link functions with nonnegative regression coefficients summing to one are utilized. We establish conditions ensuring the stationarity and ergodicity properties of the MVJ process, along with demonstrating the consistency and asymptotic normality of the conditional least squares estimators. To aid model selection and diagnostics, we introduce two model selection criteria and apply two model diagnostics statistics. Finally, we conduct simulations and real data analyses to investigate the finite-sample properties of the proposed MVJ models, providing insights into their efficacy and applicability in practical scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2404.18421</p></details> |
| **[Domain-Specific Block Selection and Paired-View Pseudo-Labeling for Online Test-Time Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10966v2)** | 2024-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Test-time adaptation (TTA) aims to adapt a pre-trained model to a new test domain without access to source data after deployment. Existing approaches typically rely on self-training with pseudo-labels since ground-truth cannot be obtained from test data. Although the quality of pseudo labels is important for stable and accurate long-term adaptation, it has not been previously addressed. In this work, we propose DPLOT, a simple yet effective TTA framework that consists of two components: (1) domain-specific block selection and (2) pseudo-label generation using paired-view images. Specifically, we select blocks that involve domain-specific feature extraction and train these blocks by entropy minimization. After blocks are adjusted for current test domain, we generate pseudo-labels by averaging given test images and corresponding flipped counterparts. By simply using flip augmentation, we prevent a decrease in the quality of the pseudo-labels, which can be caused by the domain gap resulting from strong augmentation. Our experimental results demonstrate that DPLOT outperforms previous TTA methods in CIFAR10-C, CIFAR100-C, and ImageNet-C benchmarks, reducing error by up to 5.4%, 9.1%, and 2.9%, respectively. Also, we provide an extensive analysis to demonstrate effectiveness of our framework. Code is available at https://github.com/gist-ailab/domain-specific-block-selection-and-paired-view-pseudo-labeling-for-online-TTA.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at CVPR 2024</p></details> |
| **[Mixture-of-Linear-Experts for Long-term Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06786v3)** | 2024-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long-term time series forecasting (LTSF) aims to predict future values of a time series given the past values. The current state-of-the-art (SOTA) on this problem is attained in some cases by linear-centric models, which primarily feature a linear mapping layer. However, due to their inherent simplicity, they are not able to adapt their prediction rules to periodic changes in time series patterns. To address this challenge, we propose a Mixture-of-Experts-style augmentation for linear-centric models and propose Mixture-of-Linear-Experts (MoLE). Instead of training a single model, MoLE trains multiple linear-centric models (i.e., experts) and a router model that weighs and mixes their outputs. While the entire framework is trained end-to-end, each expert learns to specialize in a specific temporal pattern, and the router model learns to compose the experts adaptively. Experiments show that MoLE reduces forecasting error of linear-centric models, including DLinear, RLinear, and RMLP, in over 78% of the datasets and settings we evaluated. By using MoLE existing linear-centric models can achieve SOTA LTSF results in 68% of the experiments that PatchTST reports and we compare to, whereas existing single-head linear-centric models achieve SOTA results in only 25% of cases.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Framework for Real-time Safeguarding the Text Generation of Large Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19048v2)** | 2024-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly advanced natural language processing (NLP) tasks but also pose ethical and societal risks due to their propensity to generate harmful content. To address this, various approaches have been developed to safeguard LLMs from producing unsafe content. However, existing methods have limitations, including the need for training specific control models and proactive intervention during text generation, that lead to quality degradation and increased computational overhead. To mitigate those limitations, we propose LLMSafeGuard, a lightweight framework to safeguard LLM text generation in real-time. LLMSafeGuard integrates an external validator into the beam search algorithm during decoding, rejecting candidates that violate safety constraints while allowing valid ones to proceed. We introduce a similarity based validation approach, simplifying constraint introduction and eliminating the need for control model training. Additionally, LLMSafeGuard employs a context-wise timing selection strategy, intervening LLMs only when necessary. We evaluate LLMSafeGuard on two tasks, detoxification and copyright safeguarding, and demonstrate its superior performance over SOTA baselines. For instance, LLMSafeGuard reduces the average toxic score of. LLM output by 29.7% compared to the best baseline meanwhile preserving similar linguistic quality as natural output in detoxification task. Similarly, in the copyright task, LLMSafeGuard decreases the Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) by 56.2% compared to baselines. Moreover, our context-wise timing selection strategy reduces inference time by at least 24% meanwhile maintaining comparable effectiveness as validating each time step. LLMSafeGuard also offers tunable parameters to balance its effectiveness and efficiency.</p></details> |  |

An upper bound is derived for the mean squared error (MSE) of IF-TEM sampler and is compared against that of classical analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) with uniform sampling and quantization. The interplay between a signal's energy, bandwidth, and peak amplitude is used to identify how the MSE of IF-TEM sampler with quantization is influenced by these parameters. More precisely, the quantization step size of the IF-TEM sampler can be reduced when the maximum frequency of a bandlimited signal or the number of pulses of an FRI signal is increased. Leveraging this insight, specific parameter settings are identified for which the quantized IF-TEM sampler achieves an MSE bound that is roughly 8 dB lower than that of a classical ADC with the same number of bits. Experimental results validate the theoretical conclusions.</p></details> |  |
| **["Ask Me Anything": How Comcast Uses LLMs to Assist Agents in Real Time](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00801v1)** | 2024-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Customer service is how companies interface with their customers. It can contribute heavily towards the overall customer satisfaction. However, high-quality service can become expensive, creating an incentive to make it as cost efficient as possible and prompting most companies to utilize AI-powered assistants, or "chat bots". On the other hand, human-to-human interaction is still desired by customers, especially when it comes to complex scenarios such as disputes and sensitive topics like bill payment. This raises the bar for customer service agents. They need to accurately understand the customer's question or concern, identify a solution that is acceptable yet feasible (and within the company's policy), all while handling multiple conversations at once. In this work, we introduce "Ask Me Anything" (AMA) as an add-on feature to an agent-facing customer service interface. AMA allows agents to ask questions to a large language model (LLM) on demand, as they are handling customer conversations -- the LLM provides accurate responses in real-time, reducing the amount of context switching the agent needs. In our internal experiments, we find that agents using AMA versus a traditional search experience spend approximately 10% fewer seconds per conversation containing a search, translating to millions of dollars of savings annually. Agents that used the AMA feature provided positive feedback nearly 80% of the time, demonstrating its usefulness as an AI-assisted feature for customer care.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimizing Profitability in Timely Gossip Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00665v1)** | 2024-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider a communication system where a group of users, interconnected in a bidirectional gossip network, wishes to follow a time-varying source, e.g., updates on an event, in real-time. The users wish to maintain their expected version ages below a threshold, and can either rely on gossip from their neighbors or directly subscribe to a server publishing about the event, if the former option does not meet the timeliness requirements. The server wishes to maximize its profit by increasing subscriptions from users and minimizing event sampling frequency to reduce costs. This leads to a Stackelberg game between the server and the users where the sender is the leader deciding its sampling frequency and the users are the followers deciding their subscription strategies. We investigate equilibrium strategies for low-connectivity and high-connectivity topologies.</p></details> |  |

In particular, we first focus on the expected time for a random walk to hit a given vertex or visit, i.e. cover, all vertices. We show that, a.a.s. (with respect to the HRG), and up to multiplicative constants: the cover time is $n(\log n)^2$, the maximum hitting time is $n\log n$, and the average hitting time is $n$. We then determine the expected time to commute between two given vertices a.a.s., up to a small factor polylogarithmic in $n$, and under some mild hypothesis on the pair of vertices involved. Our results are proved by controlling effective resistances using the energy dissipated by carefully designed network flows associated to a tiling of the hyperbolic plane, on which we overlay a forest-like structure.</p></details> | <details><summary>55 pa...</summary><p>55 pages, 4 figures.

| **[Volume-Preserving Transformers for Learning Time Series Data with Structure](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11166v2)** | 2024-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Two of the many trends in neural network research of the past few years have been (i) the learning of dynamical systems, especially with recurrent neural networks such as long short-term memory networks (LSTMs) and (ii) the introduction of transformer neural networks for natural language processing (NLP) tasks. Both of these trends have created enormous amounts of traction, particularly the second one: transformer networks now dominate the field of NLP. Even though some work has been performed on the intersection of these two trends, those efforts was largely limited to using the vanilla transformer directly without adjusting its architecture for the setting of a physical system. In this work we use a transformer-inspired neural network to learn a dynamical system and furthermore (for the first time) imbue it with structure-preserving properties to improve long-term stability. This is shown to be of great advantage when applying the neural network to real world applications.</p></details> |  |

The system features a compact Gaussian representation and a highly efficient on-the-fly Gaussian optimization scheme. We force each Gaussian to be either opaque or nearly transparent, with the opaque ones fitting the surface and dominant colors, and transparent ones fitting residual colors. By rendering depth in a different way from color rendering, we let a single opaque Gaussian well fit a local surface region without the need of multiple overlapping Gaussians, hence largely reducing the memory and computation cost. For on-the-fly Gaussian optimization, we explicitly add Gaussians for three types of pixels per frame: newly observed, with large color errors, and with large depth errors. We also categorize all Gaussians into stable and unstable ones, where the stable Gaussians are expected to well fit previously observed RGBD images and otherwise unstable. We only optimize the unstable Gaussians and only render the pixels occupied by unstable Gaussians. In this way, both the number of Gaussians to be optimized and pixels to be rendered are largely reduced, and the optimization can be done in real time. We show real-time reconstructions of a variety of large scenes. Compared with the state-of-the-art NeRF-based RGBD SLAM, our system achieves comparable high-quality reconstruction but with around twice the speed and half the memory cost, and shows superior performance in the realism of novel view synthesis and camera tracking accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be published in ACM SIGGRAPH 2024</p></details> |

Concretely, we define logics whose syntax is determined by the type of linear behaviour, and whose domain of truth values is determined by the type of branching behaviour, and we provide two semantics for them: a step-wise semantics akin to that of standard coalgebraic logics, and a path-based semantics akin to that of standard linear-time logics. The former semantics is useful for model checking, whereas the latter is the more natural semantics, as it measures the extent with which qualitative properties hold along computation paths from a given state. Our main result is the equivalence of the two semantics. We also provide a semantic characterisation of a notion of logical distance induced by these logics. Instances of our logics support reasoning about the possibility, likelihood or minimal cost of exhibiting a given linear-time property.</p></details> | <details><summary>final...</summary><p>final version, accepted for publication in Logical Methods in Computer Science</p></details> |

However, the huge overhead associated with beam training imposes a significant challenge in mmWave communications, particularly in urban environments with high background noise. To reduce this high overhead, we propose a novel solution for robust continuous-time beam tracking with liquid neural network, which dynamically adjust the narrow mmWave beams to ensure real-time beam alignment with mobile users. Through extensive simulations, we validate the effectiveness of our proposed method and demonstrate its superiority over existing state-of-the-art deep-learning-based approaches. Specifically, our scheme achieves at most 46.9% higher normalized spectral efficiency than the baselines when the user is moving at 5 m/s, demonstrating the potential of liquid neural networks to enhance mmWave mobile communication performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Arbitrary Time Information Modeling via Polynomial Approximation for Temporal Knowledge Graph Embedding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00358v1)** | 2024-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Distinguished from traditional knowledge graphs (KGs), temporal knowledge graphs (TKGs) must explore and reason over temporally evolving facts adequately. However, existing TKG approaches still face two main challenges, i.e., the limited capability to model arbitrary timestamps continuously and the lack of rich inference patterns under temporal constraints. In this paper, we propose an innovative TKGE method (PTBox) via polynomial decomposition-based temporal representation and box embedding-based entity representation to tackle the above-mentioned problems. Specifically, we decompose time information by polynomials and then enhance the model's capability to represent arbitrary timestamps flexibly by incorporating the learnable temporal basis tensor. In addition, we model every entity as a hyperrectangle box and define each relation as a transformation on the head and tail entity boxes. The entity boxes can capture complex geometric structures and learn robust representations, improving the model's inductive capability for rich inference patterns. Theoretically, our PTBox can encode arbitrary time information or even unseen timestamps while capturing rich inference patterns and higher-arity relations of the knowledge base. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by LREC-COLING 2024 (long paper, camera-ready version)</p></details> |

However, their performance diminishes in the presence of domain shifts. In this study, we introduce CLIP Adaptation duRing Test-Time (CLIPArTT), a fully test-time adaptation (TTA) approach for CLIP, which involves automatic text prompts construction during inference for their use as text supervision. Our method employs a unique, minimally invasive text prompt tuning process, wherein multiple predicted classes are aggregated into a single new text prompt, used as pseudo label to re-classify inputs in a transductive manner. Additionally, we pioneer the standardization of TTA benchmarks (e.g., TENT) in the realm of VLMs. Our findings demonstrate that, without requiring additional transformations nor new trainable modules, CLIPArTT enhances performance dynamically across non-corrupted datasets such as CIFAR-10, corrupted datasets like CIFAR-10-C and CIFAR-10.1, alongside synthetic datasets such as VisDA-C. This research underscores the potential for improving VLMs' adaptability through novel test-time strategies, offering insights for robust performance across varied datasets and environments.

In this paper, we introduce Sup3r, a Semi-Supervised algorithm aimed at addressing these challenges. Sup3r enhances sparsity, stability, and separability in the HOTS networks. It enables end-to-end online training of HOTS networks replacing external classifiers, by leveraging semi-supervised learning. Sup3r learns class-informative patterns, mitigates confounding features, and reduces the number of processed events. Moreover, Sup3r facilitates continual and incremental learning, allowing adaptation to data distribution shifts and learning new tasks without forgetting. Preliminary results on N-MNIST demonstrate that Sup3r achieves comparable accuracy to similarly sized Artificial Neural Networks trained with back-propagation. This work showcases the potential of Sup3r to advance the capabilities of HOTS networks, offering a promising avenue for neuromorphic algorithms in real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

The methodology extends to abstract evolution equations in Banach spaces, including a class of nonlinear partial differential equations. We present three nested multistage methods: the hybrid Euler method and the two- and three-stage DPG methods. We employ a linearization of the problem as in exponential Rosenbrock methods, so we need to compute exponential actions of the Jacobian that change from time steps. The key point of our construction is that one of the stages can be post-processed from another without an extra exponential step. Therefore, the class of methods we introduce is computationally cheaper than the classical exponential Rosenbrock methods. We provide a full convergence proof to show that the methods are second, third, and fourth-order accurate, respectively. We test the convergence in time of our methods on a 2D + time semi-linear partial differential equation after a semidiscretization in space.</p></details> |  |

Given an $n \times n$ matrix $D$ and a $\Delta \in \mathbb{N}$, the goal is to construct a $\Delta$-periodic temporal graph with $n$ vertices such that the duration of a fastest path from $v_i$ to $v_j$ is equal to $D_{i,j}$, or to decide that such a temporal graph does not exist. The variations of the problem on static graphs have been well studied and understood since the 1960's (e.g. [Erd\H{o}s and Gallai, 1960], [Hakimi and Yau, 1965]). As it turns out, the periodic temporal graph realization problem has a very different computational complexity behavior than its static (i.e. non-temporal) counterpart. First, we show that the problem is NP-hard in general, but polynomial-time solvable if the so-called underlying graph is a tree. Building upon those results, we investigate its parameterized computational complexity with respect to structural parameters of the underlying static graph which measure the ``tree-likeness''. We prove a tight classification between such parameters that allow fixed-parameter tractability (FPT) and those which imply W[1]-hardness. We show that our problem is W[1]-hard when parameterized by the feedback vertex number (and therefore also any smaller parameter such as treewidth, degeneracy, and cliquewidth) of the underlying graph, while we show that it is in FPT when parameterized by the feedback edge number (and therefore also any larger parameter such as maximum leaf number) of the underlying graph.</p></details> | 57 pages, 10 figures |

Digital systems answer myriad such inquiries every day. In this paper, we discuss the transitive closure problem. We focus on applicable solutions that enable us to answer queries fast, in constant time, and can serve in real-world applications. In contrast to the majority of research on this topic that revolves around the construction of a two-dimensional adjacency matrix, we present an approach that builds a reachability indexing scheme. This scheme enables us to answer queries in constant time and can be built in parameterized linear time. In addition, it captures a compressed data structure. Our approach and algorithms are validated by extensive experiments that shed light on the factors that play a key role in this problem. To stress the efficiency of this solution and demonstrate the potential to apply our approach to important problems, we use it to speed up Fulkerson's method for finding the width of a DAG. Our results challenge the prevailing belief, reiterated over the last thirty years, regarding the efficiency of this method. Our approach is based on the concept of chain decomposition. Before we delve into its description, we introduce, analyze, and utilize a chain decomposition algorithm. Furthermore, we explore how chain decomposition can facilitate transitive closure solutions introducing a general purpose linear time reduction technique that removes a large subset of transitive edges given any chain decomposition.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2212.03945</p></details> |

Foundation models, pre-trained models that can be adapted to downstream tasks with small datasets, could alleviate this problem. Researchers at Moorfields Eye Hospital (MEH) proposed RETFound-MEH, a foundation model for retinal imaging that was trained on 900,000 images, including private hospital data. Recently, data-efficient DERETFound was proposed that provides comparable performance while being trained on only 150,000 images that are all publicly available. However, both these models required very substantial resources to train initially and are resource-intensive in downstream use. We propose a novel Token Reconstruction objective that we use to train RETFound-Green, a retinal foundation model trained using only 75,000 publicly available images and 400 times less compute. We estimate the cost of training RETFound-MEH and DERETFound at $10,000 and $14,000, respectively, while RETFound-Green could be trained for less than $100, with equally reduced environmental impact. RETFound-Green is also far more efficient in downstream use: it can be downloaded 14 times faster, computes vector embeddings 2.7 times faster which then require 2.6 times less storage space. Despite this, RETFound-Green does not perform systematically worse. In fact, it performs best on 14 tasks, compared to six for DERETFound and two for RETFound-MEH. Our results suggest that RETFound-Green is a very efficient, high-performance retinal foundation model. We anticipate that our Token Reconstruction objective could be scaled up for even higher performance and be applied to other domains beyond retinal imaging.</p></details> |  |

This problem is already well-studied under the assumption that the interaction terms, $E_a$, are given, and only the interaction strengths, $\lambda_a$, are unknown. But is it possible to learn a local Hamiltonian without prior knowledge of its interaction structure? We present a new, general approach to Hamiltonian learning that not only solves the challenging structure learning variant, but also resolves other open questions in the area, all while achieving the gold standard of Heisenberg-limited scaling. In particular, our algorithm recovers the Hamiltonian to $\varepsilon$ error with an evolution time scaling with $1/\varepsilon$, and has the following appealing properties: (1) it does not need to know the Hamiltonian terms; (2) it works beyond the short-range setting, extending to any Hamiltonian $H$ where the sum of terms interacting with a qubit has bounded norm; (3) it evolves according to $H$ in constant time $t$ increments, thus achieving constant time resolution. To our knowledge, no prior algorithm with Heisenberg-limited scaling existed with even one of these properties. As an application, we can also learn Hamiltonians exhibiting power-law decay up to accuracy $\varepsilon$ with total evolution time beating the standard limit of $1/\varepsilon^2$.</p></details> | 50 pages |

Existing methods for spatial control in text-conditioned motion generation suffer from significant runtime inefficiency. To address this issue, we first propose the motion latent consistency model (MotionLCM) for motion generation, building upon the latent diffusion model (MLD). By employing one-step (or few-step) inference, we further improve the runtime efficiency of the motion latent diffusion model for motion generation. To ensure effective controllability, we incorporate a motion ControlNet within the latent space of MotionLCM and enable explicit control signals (e.g., pelvis trajectory) in the vanilla motion space to control the generation process directly, similar to controlling other latent-free diffusion models for motion generation. By employing these techniques, our approach can generate human motions with text and control signals in real-time. Experimental results demonstrate the remarkable generation and controlling capabilities of MotionLCM while maintaining real-time runtime efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Motio...</summary><p>MotionLCM project version 1.0</p></details> |

The users in the network have their own local training data, which is used for learning across all the nodes in the network. The learning method consists of two processes, evolving simultaneously without any necessary synchronization. The first process is the model update, where the users update their local model via a fixed number of stochastic gradient descent steps. The second process is model mixing, where the users communicate with each other via randomized gossiping to exchange their models and average them to reach consensus. In this work, we investigate the staleness criteria for such a system, which is a sufficient condition for convergence of individual user models. We show that for network scaling, i.e., when the number of user devices $n$ is very large, if the gossip capacity of individual users scales as $\Omega(\log n)$, we can guarantee the convergence of user models in finite time. Furthermore, we show that the bounded staleness can only be guaranteed by any distributed opportunistic scheme by $\Omega(n)$ scaling.</p></details> |  |
| **[Causal Discovery from Time Series with Hybrids of Constraint-Based and Noise-Based Algorithms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08765v2)** | 2024-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Constraint-based methods and noise-based methods are two distinct families of methods proposed for uncovering causal graphs from observational data. However, both operate under strong assumptions that may be challenging to validate or could be violated in real-world scenarios. In response to these challenges, there is a growing interest in hybrid methods that amalgamate principles from both methods, showing robustness to assumption violations. This paper introduces a novel comprehensive framework for hybridizing constraint-based and noise-based methods designed to uncover causal graphs from observational time series. The framework is structured into two classes. The first class employs a noise-based strategy to identify a super graph, containing the true graph, followed by a constraint-based strategy to eliminate unnecessary edges. In the second class, a constraint-based strategy is applied to identify a skeleton, which is then oriented using a noise-based strategy. The paper provides theoretical guarantees for each class under the condition that all assumptions are satisfied, and it outlines some properties when assumptions are violated. To validate the efficacy of the framework, two algorithms from each class are experimentally tested on simulated data, realistic ecological data, and real datasets sourced from diverse applications. Notably, two novel datasets related to Information Technology monitoring are introduced within the set of considered real datasets. The experimental results underscore the robustness and effectiveness of the hybrid approaches across a broad spectrum of datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in TMLR: https://openreview.net/forum?id=PGLbZpVk2n</p></details> |

| **[auto-sktime: Automated Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08528v3)** | 2024-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In today's data-driven landscape, time series forecasting is pivotal in decision-making across various sectors. Yet, the proliferation of more diverse time series data, coupled with the expanding landscape of available forecasting methods, poses significant challenges for forecasters. To meet the growing demand for efficient forecasting, we introduce auto-sktime, a novel framework for automated time series forecasting. The proposed framework uses the power of automated machine learning (AutoML) techniques to automate the creation of the entire forecasting pipeline. The framework employs Bayesian optimization, to automatically construct pipelines from statistical, machine learning (ML) and deep neural network (DNN) models. Furthermore, we propose three essential improvements to adapt AutoML to time series data. First, pipeline templates to account for the different supported forecasting models. Second, a novel warm-starting technique to start the optimization from prior optimization runs. Third, we adapt multi-fidelity optimizations to make them applicable to a search space containing statistical, ML and DNN models. Experimental results on 64 diverse real-world time series datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the framework, outperforming traditional methods while requiring minimal human involvement.</p></details> | Accepted at LION18 |
| **[Novel Round Trip Time Estimation in 5G NR](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19618v1)** | 2024-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The fifth generation new radio (5G NR) technology is expected to fulfill reliable and accurate positioning requirements of industry use cases, such as autonomous robots, connected vehicles, and future factories. Starting from Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) Release-16, several enhanced positioning solutions are featured in the 5G standards, including the multi-cell round trip time (multi-RTT) method. This work presents a novel framework to estimate the round-trip time (RTT) between a user equipment (UE) and a base station (gNB) in 5G NR. Unlike the existing scheme in the standards, RTT can be estimated without the need to send timing measurements from both the gNB and UE to a central node. The proposed method relies on obtaining multiple coherent uplink wide-band channel measurements at the gNB by circumventing the timing advance control loops and the clock drift. The performance is evaluated through experiments leveraging a real world 5G testbed based on OpenAirInterface (OAI). Under a moderate system bandwidth of 40MHz, the experimental results show meter level range accuracy even in low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions.</p></details> |  |

The objective is to offer nearly real-time detection of contaminants in coastal waters addressing a significant gap in the existing literature. Moreover, the expected outcomes include substantial advancements in environmental monitoring, public health protection, and resource conservation. The specific focus of our study is on the estimation of Turbidity and pH parameters, for their implications on human and aquatic health. Nevertheless, the designed framework can be extended to include other parameters of interest in the water environment and beyond. Originating from our participation in the European Space Agency (ESA) OrbitalAI Challenge, this article describes the distinctive opportunities and issues for the contaminants monitoring on the Phisat-2 mission. The specific characteristics of this mission, with the tools made available, will be presented, with the methodology proposed by the authors for the onboard monitoring of water contaminants in near real-time.

| **[Behavioural pseudometrics for continuous-time diffusions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16729v2)** | 2024-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bisimulation is a concept that captures behavioural equivalence of states in a variety of types of transition systems. It has been widely studied in a discrete-time setting where the notion of a step is fundamental. In our setting we are considering "flow"-processes emphasizing that they evolve in continuous time. In such continuous-time settings, the concepts are not straightforward adaptations of their discrete-time analogues and we restrict our study to diffusions that do not lose mass over time and with additional regularity constraints. In previous work we proposed different definitions of behavioural equivalences for continuous-time stochastic processes where the evolution is a flow through time. That work only addressed equivalences. In this work, we aim at quantifying how differently processes behave. We present two pseudometrics for diffusion-like processes. These pseudometrics are fixpoints of two different functionals on the space of 1-bounded pseudometrics on the state space. We also characterize these pseudometrics in terms of real-valued modal logics; this is a quantitative analogue of the notion of logical characterization of bisimulation. These real-valued modal logics indicate that the two pseudometrics are different and thus yield different notions of behavioural equivalence.</p></details> |  |

The space-time method presented in [P. Hansbo, M. G. Larson, S. Zahedi, Comput. Methods Appl. Mech.

Furthermore, by partitioning the time-dependent domain into macroelements, a more efficient stabilization procedure for the cut finite element method in time-dependent domains is presented. Numerical experiments illustrate that the method fulfills mass conservation, attains high-order convergence, and the condition number of the resulting system matrix is controlled while sparsity is increased. Problems in bulk domains as well as coupled bulk-surface problems are considered.</p></details> | 27 pages, 20 figures |

Existing methods, however, cannot extrapolate accurately and are prone to error accumulation in long-time integration. Herein, we address this issue by combining neural operators with recurrent neural networks, learning the operator mapping, while offering a recurrent structure to capture temporal dependencies. The integrated framework is shown to stabilize the solution and reduce error accumulation for both interpolation and extrapolation of the Korteweg-de Vries equation.</p></details> | 8 pages, 5 figures |

This limitation presents a significant hurdle in deploying edge devices in real-world scenarios where information is presented in an inherently sequential manner. Active dendrites of pyramidal neurons play an important role in the brain ability to learn new tasks incrementally. By exploiting key properties of time-to-first-spike encoding and leveraging its high sparsity, we present a novel spiking neural network model enhanced with active dendrites. Our model can efficiently mitigate catastrophic forgetting in temporally-encoded SNNs, which we demonstrate with an end-of-training accuracy across tasks of 88.3% on the test set using the Split MNIST dataset. Furthermore, we provide a novel digital hardware architecture that paves the way for real-world deployment in edge devices. Using a Xilinx Zynq-7020 SoC FPGA, we demonstrate a 100-% match with our quantized software model, achieving an average inference time of 37.3 ms and an 80.0% accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work was accepted and presented at AICAS 2024</p></details> |

Time modeling aims to enable recommendation systems to perceive time changes to capture users' dynamic preferences over time, which is an important and challenging problem in recommendation systems. Especially, streaming recommendation systems in the industry, with only available samples of the current moment, present greater challenges for time modeling. There is still a lack of effective time modeling methods for streaming recommendation systems. In this paper, we propose an effective and universal method Interest Clock to perceive time information in recommendation systems. Interest Clock first encodes users' time-aware preferences into a clock (hour-level personalized features) and then uses Gaussian distribution to smooth and aggregate them into the final interest clock embedding according to the current time for the final prediction. By arming base models with Interest Clock, we conduct online A/B tests, obtaining +0.509% and +0.758% improvements on user active days and app duration respectively. Besides, the extended offline experiments show improvements as well. Interest Clock has been deployed on Douyin Music App.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by SIGIR 2024</p></details> |

However, to realize the promise of WNoC, multiple wireless links operating at several tens of Gb/s need to be created within a computing package. Unfortunately, the highly integrated and enclosed nature of such computing packages incurs significant Co-Channel Interference (CCI) and Inter-Symbol Interference (ISI), not only preventing the deployment of multiple spatial channels, but also severely limiting the symbol rate of each individual channel. In this work, Time Reversal (TR) is proposed as a means to compensate the channel impairments and enable multiple concurrent high-speed links at the chip scale. We offer evidence, via full-wave simulations at 140 GHz, that TR can increase the symbol rate by an order of magnitude and allow the deployment of multiple concurrent links towards achieving aggregate speeds in excess of 100 Gb/s. Finally, the challenges relative to the realization of TR at the chip scale are analyzed from the implementation, protocol support, and architectural perspectives.</p></details> |  |

However, the complicated behaviors in dim light conditions are still not clear, restricting the applications of DVS. In this paper, we analyze the typical DVS circuit, and find that there exists discontinuity of event triggering time. In dim light conditions, the discontinuity becomes prominent. We point out that the discontinuity depends exclusively on the changing speed of light intensity. Experimental results on real event data validate the analysis and the existence of discontinuity that reveals the non-first-order behaviors of DVS in dim light conditions.</p></details> | 6 pages, 4 figures |

Offline learning at scale has led to breakthroughs in computer vision, natural language processing, and robotic manipulation domains. However, scaling up learning for legged robot locomotion, especially with multiple skills in a single policy, presents significant challenges for prior online reinforcement learning methods. To address this challenge, we propose a novel, scalable framework that leverages diffusion models to directly learn from offline multimodal datasets with a diverse set of locomotion skills. With design choices tailored for real-time control in dynamical systems, including receding horizon control and delayed inputs, DiffuseLoco is capable of reproducing multimodality in performing various locomotion skills, zero-shot transfer to real quadrupedal robots, and it can be deployed on edge computing devices. Furthermore, DiffuseLoco demonstrates free transitions between skills and robustness against environmental variations. Through extensive benchmarking in real-world experiments, DiffuseLoco exhibits better stability and velocity tracking performance compared to prior reinforcement learning and non-diffusion-based behavior cloning baselines. The design choices are validated via comprehensive ablation studies. This work opens new possibilities for scaling up learning-based legged locomotion controllers through the scaling of large, expressive models and diverse offline datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Inference-Time Rule Eraser: Distilling and Removing Bias Rules to Mitigate Bias in Deployed Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04814v2)** | 2024-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine learning models often make predictions based on biased features such as gender, race, and other social attributes, posing significant fairness risks, especially in societal applications, such as hiring, banking, and criminal justice. Traditional approaches to addressing this issue involve retraining or fine-tuning neural networks with fairness-aware optimization objectives. However, these methods can be impractical due to significant computational resources, complex industrial tests, and the associated CO2 footprint. Additionally, regular users aiming to use fair models often lack access to model parameters. In this paper, we introduce Inference-Time Rule Eraser (Eraser), a novel method focused on removing biased decision-making rules during inference to address fairness concerns without modifying model weights. We begin by establishing a theoretical foundation for modifying model outputs to eliminate biased rules through Bayesian analysis. Next, we present a specific implementation of Eraser that involves two stages: (1) querying the model to distill biased rules into a patched model, and (2) excluding these biased rules during inference. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach, showcasing its superior performance in addressing fairness concerns in AI systems.</p></details> |  |

While many existing time-stepping methods are known to preserve the energy dissipation law, most apply to a modified form of energy. In this work, we demonstrate that, when the nonlinear term of the Allen--Cahn equation is Lipschitz continuous, a class of arbitrarily high-order exponential time differencing Runge--Kutta (ETDRK) schemes preserve the original energy dissipation property, under a mild step-size constraint. Additionally, we guarantee the Lipschitz condition on the nonlinear term by applying a rescaling post-processing technique, which ensures that the numerical solution unconditionally satisfies the maximum bound principle. Consequently, our proposed schemes maintain both the original energy dissipation law and the maximum bound principle and can achieve arbitrarily high-order accuracy. We also establish an optimal error estimate for the proposed schemes. Some numerical experiments are carried out to verify our theoretical results.</p></details> |  |
| **[Real-Time Convolutional Neural Network-Based Star Detection and Centroiding Method for CubeSat Star Tracker](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19108v1)** | 2024-04-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Star trackers are one of the most accurate celestial sensors used for absolute attitude determination. The devices detect stars in captured images and accurately compute their projected centroids on an imaging focal plane with subpixel precision. Traditional algorithms for star detection and centroiding often rely on threshold adjustments for star pixel detection and pixel brightness weighting for centroid computation. However, challenges like high sensor noise and stray light can compromise algorithm performance. This article introduces a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based approach for star detection and centroiding, tailored to address the issues posed by noisy star tracker images in the presence of stray light and other artifacts. Trained using simulated star images overlayed with real sensor noise and stray light, the CNN produces both a binary segmentation map distinguishing star pixels from the background and a distance map indicating each pixel's proximity to the nearest star centroid. Leveraging this distance information alongside pixel coordinates transforms centroid calculations into a set of trilateration problems solvable via the least squares method. Our method employs efficient UNet variants for the underlying CNN architectures, and the variants' performances are evaluated. Comprehensive testing has been undertaken with synthetic image evaluations, hardware-in-the-loop assessments, and night sky tests. The tests consistently demonstrated that our method outperforms several existing algorithms in centroiding accuracy and exhibits superior resilience to high sensor noise and stray light interference. An additional benefit of our algorithms is that they can be executed in real-time on low-power edge AI processors.</p></details> |  |
| **[Distributed Stochastic Optimization of a Neural Representation Network for Time-Space Tomography Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19075v1)** | 2024-04-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>4D time-space reconstruction of dynamic events or deforming objects using X-ray computed tomography (CT) is an extremely ill-posed inverse problem. Existing approaches assume that the object remains static for the duration of several tens or hundreds of X-ray projection measurement images (reconstruction of consecutive limited-angle CT scans). However, this is an unrealistic assumption for many in-situ experiments that causes spurious artifacts and inaccurate morphological reconstructions of the object. To solve this problem, we propose to perform a 4D time-space reconstruction using a distributed implicit neural representation (DINR) network that is trained using a novel distributed stochastic training algorithm. Our DINR network learns to reconstruct the object at its output by iterative optimization of its network parameters such that the measured projection images best match the output of the CT forward measurement model. We use a continuous time and space forward measurement model that is a function of the DINR outputs at a sparsely sampled set of continuous valued object coordinates. Unlike existing state-of-the-art neural representation architectures that forward and back propagate through dense voxel grids that sample the object's entire time-space coordinates, we only propagate through the DINR at a small subset of object coordinates in each iteration resulting in an order-of-magnitude reduction in memory and compute for training. DINR leverages distributed computation across several compute nodes and GPUs to produce high-fidelity 4D time-space reconstructions even for extremely large CT data sizes. We use both simulated parallel-beam and experimental cone-beam X-ray CT datasets to demonstrate the superior performance of our approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted to Nature Machine Intelligence</p></details> |

Specifically, GSTalker learns an audio-driven Gaussian deformation field to translate and transform 3D Gaussians to synchronize with audio information, in which multi-resolution hashing grid-based tri-plane and temporal smooth module are incorporated to learn accurate deformation for fine-grained facial details. In addition, a pose-conditioned deformation field is designed to model the stabilized torso. To enable efficient optimization of the condition Gaussian deformation field, we initialize 3D Gaussians by learning a coarse static Gaussian representation. Extensive experiments in person-specific videos with audio tracks validate that GSTalker can generate high-fidelity and audio-lips synchronized results with fast training and real-time rendering speed.</p></details> |  |

We let the devices adjust the transmission probabilities based on their current battery level. Using a Markovian analysis, we derive analytically the average AoI. We further provide an approximate analysis for accurate and easy-to-compute approximations of both the average AoI and the age-violation probability (AVP), i.e., the probability that the AoI exceeds a given threshold. We also analyze the average throughput. Via numerical results, we investigate two baseline strategies: transmit a new update whenever possible to exploit every opportunity to reduce the AoI, and transmit only when sufficient energy is available to increase the chance of successful decoding. The two strategies are beneficial for low and high update-generation rates, respectively. We show that an optimized policy that balances the two strategies outperforms them significantly in terms of both AoI metrics and throughput. Finally, we show the benefit of decoding multiple packets in a slot using successive interference cancellation and adapting the transmission probability based on both the current battery level and the time elapsed since the last transmission.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE Transaction of Communications.

By design, these claims are without editorial oversight and accessible to a vast population who otherwise may not have access to multiple information sources. This implies the need to fact-check these posts and clearly explain which parts of the posts are fake. In the supervised learning setup, this is often reduced to a binary classification problem, neglecting all intermediate stages. Further, these claims often involve recent events on which systems trained on historical data are prone to fail. In this work, we propose a zero-shot approach by retrieving real-time web-scraped evidence from multiple news websites and matching them with the claim text and image using pretrained language vision systems. We propose a graph structured representation, which a) allows us to gather evidence automatically and b) helps generate interpretable results by explicitly pointing out which parts of the claim can not be verified. Our zero-shot method, with improved interpretability, generates competitive results against the state-of-the-art methods</p></details> |  |

Spatio-temporal data, on the other hand, is vital for analyzing phenomena in both space and time, providing a dynamic perspective on complex system interactions. Recently, diffusion models have seen widespread application in time series and spatio-temporal data mining. Not only do they enhance the generative and inferential capabilities for sequential and temporal data, but they also extend to other downstream tasks. In this survey, we comprehensively and thoroughly review the use of diffusion models in time series and spatio-temporal data, categorizing them by model category, task type, data modality, and practical application domain. In detail, we categorize diffusion models into unconditioned and conditioned types and discuss time series data and spatio-temporal data separately. Unconditioned models, which operate unsupervised, are subdivided into probability-based and score-based models, serving predictive and generative tasks such as forecasting, anomaly detection, classification, and imputation. Conditioned models, on the other hand, utilize extra information to enhance performance and are similarly divided for both predictive and generative tasks. Our survey extensively covers their application in various fields, including healthcare, recommendation, climate, energy, audio, and transportation, providing a foundational understanding of how these models analyze and generate data. Through this structured overview, we aim to provide researchers and practitioners with a comprehensive understanding of diffusion models for time series and spatio-temporal data analysis, aiming to direct future innovations and applications by addressing traditional challenges and exploring innovative solutions within the diffusion model framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>Ongoi...</summary><p>Ongoing work; 27 pages, 8 figures, 2 tables; Github Repo: https://github.com/yyysjz1997/Awesome-TimeSeries-SpatioTemporal-Diffusion-Model</p></details> |

Firstly, STGCN is tailored to parameterize UC. Then, few-shot physics-guided learning scheme is proposed. It exploits few typical UC solutions yielded via commercial optimizer to escape from local minimum, and leverages the augmented Lagrangian method for constraint satisfaction. To further enable both feasibility and continuous relaxation for integers in learning process, straight-through estimator for Tanh-Sign composition is proposed to fully differentiate the mixed integer solution space. Case study on the IEEE benchmark justifies that, our method bests mainstream learning ways on UC feasibility, and surpasses traditional solver on efficiency.</p></details> |  |

In this regard, covariance properties with respect to geometric image transformations in the earliest layers of the visual hierarchy are essential for expressing robust image operations, and for formulating invariant visual operations at higher levels. This paper defines and proves a set of joint covariance properties under compositions of spatial scaling transformations, spatial affine transformations, Galilean transformations and temporal scaling transformations, which make it possible to characterize how different types of image transformations interact with each other and the associated spatio-temporal receptive field responses. In this regard, we also extend the notion of scale-normalized derivatives to affine-normalized derivatives, to be able to obtain true affine-covariant properties of spatial derivatives, that are computed based on spatial smoothing with affine Gaussian kernels. The derived relations show how the parameters of the receptive fields need to be transformed, in order to match the output from spatio-temporal receptive fields under composed spatio-temporal image transformations. As a side effect, the presented proof for the joint covariance property over the integrated combination of the different geometric image transformations also provides specific proofs for the individual transformation properties, which have not previously been fully reported in the literature. The paper also presents an in-depth theoretical analysis of geometric interpretations of the derived covariance properties, as well as outlines a number of biological interpretations of these results.</p></details> | <details><summary>38 pa...</summary><p>38 pages, 13 figures.

Obtaining the dynamic model of an MVDC SMG is a challenging task due to the confidentiality of system components models and uncertainty in the dynamic models through time. In this paper, a dynamic identification framework based on a temporal convolutional neural network (TCN) is developed to learn the system dynamics from measurement data. Different kinds of testing scenarios are implemented, and the testing results show that this approach achieves an exceptional performance and high generalization ability, thus holding substantial promise for development of advanced data-driven control strategies and stability prediction of the system.</p></details> |  |
| **[Cumulative Hazard Function Based Efficient Multivariate Temporal Point Process Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13663v2)** | 2024-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most existing temporal point process models are characterized by conditional intensity function. These models often require numerical approximation methods for likelihood evaluation, which potentially hurts their performance. By directly modelling the integral of the intensity function, i.e., the cumulative hazard function (CHF), the likelihood can be evaluated accurately, making it a promising approach. However, existing CHF-based methods are not well-defined, i.e., the mathematical constraints of CHF are not completely satisfied, leading to untrustworthy results. For multivariate temporal point process, most existing methods model intensity (or density, etc.) functions for each variate, limiting the scalability. In this paper, we explore using neural networks to model a flexible but well-defined CHF and learning the multivariate temporal point process with low parameter complexity. Experimental results on six datasets show that the proposed model achieves the state-of-the-art performance on data fitting and event prediction tasks while having significantly fewer parameters and memory usage than the strong competitors.

| **[Predicting the Temporal Dynamics of Prosthetic Vision](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14591v3)** | 2024-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retinal implants are a promising treatment option for degenerative retinal disease. While numerous models have been developed to simulate the appearance of elicited visual percepts ("phosphenes"), these models often either focus solely on spatial characteristics or inadequately capture the complex temporal dynamics observed in clinical trials, which vary heavily across implant technologies, subjects, and stimulus conditions. Here we introduce two computational models designed to accurately predict phosphene fading and persistence under varying stimulus conditions, cross-validated on behavioral data reported by nine users of the Argus II Retinal Prosthesis System. Both models segment the time course of phosphene perception into discrete intervals, decomposing phosphene fading and persistence into either sinusoidal or exponential components. Our spectral model demonstrates state-of-the-art predictions of phosphene intensity over time (r = 0.7 across all participants). Overall, this study lays the groundwork for enhancing prosthetic vision by improving our understanding of phosphene temporal dynamics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Zonotope-based Symbolic Controller Synthesis for Linear Temporal Logic Specifications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00924v1)** | 2024-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper studies the controller synthesis problem for nonlinear control systems under linear temporal logic (LTL) specifications using zonotope techniques. A local-to-global control strategy is proposed for the desired specification expressed as an LTL formula. First, a novel approach is developed to divide the state space into finite zonotopes and constrained zonotopes, which are called cells and allowed to intersect with the neighbor cells. Second, from the intersection relation, a graph among all cells is generated to verify the realization of the accepting path for the LTL formula. The realization verification determines if there is a need for the control design, and also results in finite local LTL formulas. Third, once the accepting path is realized, a novel abstraction-based method is derived for the controller design. In particular, we only focus on the cells from the realization verification and approximate each cell thanks to properties of zonotopes. Based on local symbolic models and local LTL formulas, an iterative synthesis algorithm is proposed to design all local abstract controllers, whose existence and combination establish the global controller for the LTL formula. Finally, the proposed framework is illustrated via a path planning problem of mobile robots.</p></details> | 16 pages, 11 figures |

In recent years, spatio-temporal graph neural networks have achieved state-of-the-art results in the context of numerous traffic forecasting challenges. This work aims at expanding upon the conventional spatio-temporal graph neural network architectures in a manner that may facilitate the inclusion of information regarding the examined regions, as well as the populations that traverse them, in order to establish a more efficient prediction model. The end-product of this scientific endeavour is a novel spatio-temporal graph neural network architecture that is referred to as WEST (WEighted STacked) GCN-LSTM. Furthermore, the inclusion of the aforementioned information is conducted via the use of two novel dedicated algorithms that are referred to as the Shared Borders Policy and the Adjustable Hops Policy. Through information fusion and distillation, the proposed solution manages to significantly outperform its competitors in the frame of an experimental evaluation that consists of 19 forecasting models, across several datasets. Finally, an additional ablation study determined that each of the components of the proposed solution contributes towards enhancing its overall performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Continuous sPatial-Temporal Deformable Image Registration (CPT-DIR) for motion modelling in radiotherapy: beyond classic voxel-based methods](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00430v1)** | 2024-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Background and purpose: Deformable image registration (DIR) is a crucial tool in radiotherapy for extracting and modelling organ motion. However, when significant changes and sliding boundaries are present, it faces compromised accuracy and uncertainty, determining the subsequential contour propagation and dose accumulation procedures. Materials and methods: We propose an implicit neural representation (INR)-based approach modelling motion continuously in both space and time, named Continues-sPatial-Temporal DIR (CPT-DIR). This method uses a multilayer perception (MLP) network to map 3D coordinate (x,y,z) to its corresponding velocity vector (vx,vy,vz). The displacement vectors (dx,dy,dz) are then calculated by integrating velocity vectors over time. The MLP's parameters can rapidly adapt to new cases without pre-training, enhancing optimisation. The DIR's performance was tested on the DIR-Lab dataset of 10 lung 4DCT cases, using metrics of landmark accuracy (TRE), contour conformity (Dice) and image similarity (MAE). Results: The proposed CPT-DIR can reduce landmark TRE from 2.79mm to 0.99mm, outperforming B-splines' results for all cases. The MAE of the whole-body region improves from 35.46HU to 28.99HU. Furthermore, CPT-DIR surpasses B-splines for accuracy in the sliding boundary region, lowering MAE and increasing Dice coefficients for the ribcage from 65.65HU and 90.41% to 42.04HU and 90.56%, versus 75.40HU and 89.30% without registration. Meanwhile, CPT-DIR offers significant speed advantages, completing in under 15 seconds compared to a few minutes with the conventional B-splines method. Conclusion: Leveraging the continuous representations, the CPT-DIR method significantly enhances registration accuracy, automation and speed, outperforming traditional B-splines in landmark and contour precision, particularly in the challenging areas.</p></details> |  |
| **[Arbitrary Time Information Modeling via Polynomial Approximation for Temporal Knowledge Graph Embedding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00358v1)** | 2024-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Distinguished from traditional knowledge graphs (KGs), temporal knowledge graphs (TKGs) must explore and reason over temporally evolving facts adequately. However, existing TKG approaches still face two main challenges, i.e., the limited capability to model arbitrary timestamps continuously and the lack of rich inference patterns under temporal constraints. In this paper, we propose an innovative TKGE method (PTBox) via polynomial decomposition-based temporal representation and box embedding-based entity representation to tackle the above-mentioned problems. Specifically, we decompose time information by polynomials and then enhance the model's capability to represent arbitrary timestamps flexibly by incorporating the learnable temporal basis tensor. In addition, we model every entity as a hyperrectangle box and define each relation as a transformation on the head and tail entity boxes. The entity boxes can capture complex geometric structures and learn robust representations, improving the model's inductive capability for rich inference patterns. Theoretically, our PTBox can encode arbitrary time information or even unseen timestamps while capturing rich inference patterns and higher-arity relations of the knowledge base. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by LREC-COLING 2024 (long paper, camera-ready version)</p></details> |
| **[Transformer-based Reasoning for Learning Evolutionary Chain of Events on Temporal Knowledge Graph](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00352v1)** | 2024-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal Knowledge Graph (TKG) reasoning often involves completing missing factual elements along the timeline. Although existing methods can learn good embeddings for each factual element in quadruples by integrating temporal information, they often fail to infer the evolution of temporal facts. This is mainly because of (1) insufficiently exploring the internal structure and semantic relationships within individual quadruples and (2) inadequately learning a unified representation of the contextual and temporal correlations among different quadruples. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel Transformer-based reasoning model (dubbed ECEformer) for TKG to learn the Evolutionary Chain of Events (ECE). Specifically, we unfold the neighborhood subgraph of an entity node in chronological order, forming an evolutionary chain of events as the input for our model. Subsequently, we utilize a Transformer encoder to learn the embeddings of intra-quadruples for ECE. We then craft a mixed-context reasoning module based on the multi-layer perceptron (MLP) to learn the unified representations of inter-quadruples for ECE while accomplishing temporal knowledge reasoning. In addition, to enhance the timeliness of the events, we devise an additional time prediction task to complete effective temporal information within the learned unified representation. Extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets verify the state-of-the-art performance and the effectiveness of our method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by SIGIR 2024 (the Full paper track, camera ready version)</p></details> |

Neuromorphic disciplines view the brain as a coevolved system, simultaneously optimizing the hardware and the algorithms running on it. There are clear efficiency gains when bringing the computations into a physical substrate, but we presently lack theories to guide efficient implementations. Here, we present a principled computational model for neuromorphic systems in terms of spatio-temporal receptive fields, based on affine Gaussian kernels over space and leaky-integrator and leaky integrate-and-fire models over time. Our theory is provably covariant to spatial affine and temporal scaling transformations, and with close similarities to the visual processing in mammalian brains. We use these spatio-temporal receptive fields as a prior in an event-based vision task, and show that this improves the training of spiking networks, which otherwise is known as problematic for event-based vision. This work combines efforts within scale-space theory and computational neuroscience to identify theoretically well-founded ways to process spatio-temporal signals in neuromorphic systems. Our contributions are immediately relevant for signal processing and event-based vision, and can be extended to other processing tasks over space and time, such as memory and control.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code available at https://github.com/jegp/nrf</p></details> |
| **[Spatial-Temporal Extreme Modeling for Point-to-Area Random Effects (PARE)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17271v2)** | 2024-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One measurement modality for rainfall is a fixed location rain gauge. However, extreme rainfall, flooding, and other climate extremes often occur at larger spatial scales and affect more than one location in a community. For example, in 2017 Hurricane Harvey impacted all of Houston and the surrounding region causing widespread flooding. Flood risk modeling requires understanding of rainfall for hydrologic regions, which may contain one or more rain gauges. Further, policy changes to address the risks and damages of natural hazards such as severe flooding are usually made at the community/neighborhood level or higher geo-spatial scale. Therefore, spatial-temporal methods which convert results from one spatial scale to another are especially useful in applications for evolving environmental extremes. We develop a point-to-area random effects (PARE) modeling strategy for understanding spatial-temporal extreme values at the areal level, when the core information are time series at point locations distributed over the region.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 9 tables, 4 figures</p></details> |
| **[Realizing temporal graphs from fastest travel times](http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.08860v4)** | 2024-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper we initiate the study of the temporal graph realization problem with respect to the fastest path durations among its vertices, while we focus on periodic temporal graphs. Given an $n \times n$ matrix $D$ and a $\Delta \in \mathbb{N}$, the goal is to construct a $\Delta$-periodic temporal graph with $n$ vertices such that the duration of a fastest path from $v_i$ to $v_j$ is equal to $D_{i,j}$, or to decide that such a temporal graph does not exist. The variations of the problem on static graphs have been well studied and understood since the 1960's (e.g. [Erd\H{o}s and Gallai, 1960], [Hakimi and Yau, 1965]). As it turns out, the periodic temporal graph realization problem has a very different computational complexity behavior than its static (i.e. non-temporal) counterpart. First, we show that the problem is NP-hard in general, but polynomial-time solvable if the so-called underlying graph is a tree. Building upon those results, we investigate its parameterized computational complexity with respect to structural parameters of the underlying static graph which measure the ``tree-likeness''. We prove a tight classification between such parameters that allow fixed-parameter tractability (FPT) and those which imply W[1]-hardness. We show that our problem is W[1]-hard when parameterized by the feedback vertex number (and therefore also any smaller parameter such as treewidth, degeneracy, and cliquewidth) of the underlying graph, while we show that it is in FPT when parameterized by the feedback edge number (and therefore also any larger parameter such as maximum leaf number) of the underlying graph.</p></details> | 57 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Balancing Spectral, Temporal and Spatial Information for EEG-based Alzheimer's Disease Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13523v2)** | 2024-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The prospect of future treatment warrants the development of cost-effective screening for Alzheimer's disease (AD). A promising candidate in this regard is electroencephalography (EEG), as it is one of the most economic imaging modalities. Recent efforts in EEG analysis have shifted towards leveraging spatial information, employing novel frameworks such as graph signal processing or graph neural networks. Here, we investigate the importance of spatial information relative to spectral or temporal information by varying the proportion of each dimension for AD classification. To do so, we systematically test various dimension resolution configurations on two routine EEG datasets. Our findings show that spatial information is more important than temporal information and equally valuable as spectral information. On the larger second dataset, substituting spectral with spatial information even led to an increase of 1.1% in accuracy, which emphasises the importance of spatial information for EEG-based AD classification. We argue that our resolution-based feature extraction has the potential to improve AD classification specifically, and multivariate signal classification generally.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 pag...</summary><p>4 pages, 3 figures, conference paper</p></details> |

Achieving these requirements concurrently is a challenge as interactive planners lack formal safety guarantees, while safe motion planners lack flexibility to adapt. To tackle this, we propose a modular control architecture that generates both safe and reactive motion plans for human-robot interaction by integrating temporal logic-based discrete task level plans with continuous Dynamical System (DS)-based motion plans. We formulate a reactive temporal logic formula that enables users to define task specifications through structured language, and propose a planning algorithm at the task level that generates a sequence of desired robot behaviors while being adaptive to environmental changes. At the motion level, we incorporate control Lyapunov functions and control barrier functions to compute stable and safe continuous motion plans for two types of robot behaviors: (i) complex, possibly periodic motions given by autonomous DS and (ii) time-critical tasks specified by Signal Temporal Logic~(STL). Our methodology is demonstrated on the Franka robot arm performing wiping tasks on a whiteboard and a mannequin that is compliant to human interactions and adaptive to environmental changes.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Spatio-Temporal based Frame Indexing Algorithm for QoS Improvement in Live Low-Motion Video Streaming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19574v1)** | 2024-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-time video life streaming of events over a network continued to gain more popularity among the populace. However, there is need to ensure the judicious utilization of allocated bandwidth without compromising the Quality of Service (QoS) of the system. In this regard, this paper presents an approach based on spatio-temporal frame indexing that detects and eliminate redundancy within and across captured frame, prior transmission from the server to clients. The standard and local low motion videos were the two scenarios considered in evaluating the performance of the proposed algorithm. Results obtained showed that the proposed approach achieved an improvement of 5.13%, 15.8% and 5%, 15.6% improvement in terms of the buffer size and compression ratio. Though with a tradeoff of the frame-built time, where both the standard and local frame indexing outperforms the proposed scheme with 10.8% and 8.71% respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[One-Stage Open-Vocabulary Temporal Action Detection Leveraging Temporal Multi-scale and Action Label Features](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19542v1)** | 2024-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-vocabulary Temporal Action Detection (Open-vocab TAD) is an advanced video analysis approach that expands Closed-vocabulary Temporal Action Detection (Closed-vocab TAD) capabilities. Closed-vocab TAD is typically confined to localizing and classifying actions based on a predefined set of categories. In contrast, Open-vocab TAD goes further and is not limited to these predefined categories. This is particularly useful in real-world scenarios where the variety of actions in videos can be vast and not always predictable. The prevalent methods in Open-vocab TAD typically employ a 2-stage approach, which involves generating action proposals and then identifying those actions. However, errors made during the first stage can adversely affect the subsequent action identification accuracy. Additionally, existing studies face challenges in handling actions of different durations owing to the use of fixed temporal processing methods. Therefore, we propose a 1-stage approach consisting of two primary modules: Multi-scale Video Analysis (MVA) and Video-Text Alignment (VTA). The MVA module captures actions at varying temporal resolutions, overcoming the challenge of detecting actions with diverse durations. The VTA module leverages the synergy between visual and textual modalities to precisely align video segments with corresponding action labels, a critical step for accurate action identification in Open-vocab scenarios. Evaluations on widely recognized datasets THUMOS14 and ActivityNet-1.3, showed that the proposed method achieved superior results compared to the other methods in both Open-vocab and Closed-vocab settings. This serves as a strong demonstration of the effectiveness of the proposed method in the TAD task.</p></details> | <details><summary>The 1...</summary><p>The 18th IEEE International Conference on Automatic Face and Gesture Recognition (FG 2024)</p></details> |

To address this limitation, we introduce the Temporal Graph Ordinary Differential Equation (TG-ODE) framework, which learns both the temporal and spatial dynamics from graph streams where the intervals between observations are not regularly spaced. We empirically validate the proposed approach on several graph benchmarks, showing that TG-ODE can achieve state-of-the-art performance in irregular graph stream tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

Due to delays and errors in reporting, temporal graphs derived from data are unlikely to perfectly reflect reality, especially with respect to the precise times at which edges appear. To reflect this uncertainty, we consider a model in which some number $\zeta$ of edge appearances may have their timestamps perturbed by $\pm\delta$ for some $\delta$. Within this model, we investigate temporal reachability and consider the problem of determining the maximum number of vertices any vertex can reach under these perturbations. We show that this problem is intractable in general but is efficiently solvable when $\zeta$ is sufficiently large. We also give algorithms which solve this problem in several restricted settings. We complement this with some contrasting results concerning the complexity of related temporal eccentricity problems under perturbation.</p></details> | 36 pages, 3 figures |

In this paper, we propose a novel, provably correct model predictive control scheme for linear systems with additive unbounded stochastic disturbances that dynamically evaluates the feasibility of runtime signal temporal logic specifications and automatically reschedules the control inputs accordingly. The control method guarantees the probabilistic satisfaction of newly accepted specifications without sacrificing the satisfaction of the previously accepted ones.

| **[Structural Parameters for Dense Temporal Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19453v1)** | 2024-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal graphs provide a useful model for many real-world networks. Unfortunately the majority of algorithmic problems we might consider on such graphs are intractable. There has been recent progress in defining structural parameters which describe tractable cases by simultaneously restricting the underlying structure and the times at which edges appear in the graph. These all rely on the temporal graph being sparse in some sense. We introduce temporal analogues of three increasingly restrictive static graph parameters -- cliquewidth, modular-width and neighbourhood diversity -- which take small values for highly structured temporal graphs, even if a large number of edges are active at each timestep. The computational problems solvable efficiently when the temporal cliquewidth of the input graph is bounded form a subset of those solvable efficiently when the temporal modular-width is bounded, which is in turn a subset of problems efficiently solvable when the temporal neighbourhood diversity is bounded. By considering specific temporal graph problems, we demonstrate that (up to standard complexity theoretic assumptions) these inclusions are strict.</p></details> | 27 pages, 2 figures |

We use finite temporal logic to express the requirements on the acceptable functionality and define the resilience metric as the maximum disturbance under which the system satisfies the temporal requirements. We fix a parameterized template for the set of disturbances and form a robust optimization problem under the system dynamics and the temporal specifications to find the maximum value of the parameter. Additionally, we introduce two novel classes of specifications: closed and convex finite temporal logics specifications, offering a comprehensive analysis of the resilience metric within these specific frameworks. From a computational standpoint, we present an exact solution for linear systems and exact-time reachability and finite-horizon safety, complemented by an approximate solution for finite-horizon reachability. Extending our findings to nonlinear systems, we leverage linear approximations and SMT-based approaches to offer viable computational methodologies. The theoretical results are demonstrated on the temperature regulation of buildings, adaptive cruise control and DC motors.</p></details> |  |

Although recent studies have demonstrated the advantages of achieving map-constrained trajectory recovery via an end-to-end manner, they still face two significant challenges. Firstly, existing methods are mostly sequence-based models. It is extremely hard for them to comprehensively capture the micro-semantics of individual trajectory, including the information of each GPS point and the movement between two GPS points. Secondly, existing approaches ignore the impact of the macro-semantics, i.e., the road conditions and the people's shared travel preferences reflected by a group of trajectories. To address the above challenges, we propose a Micro-Macro Spatial-Temporal Graph-based Encoder-Decoder (MM-STGED). Specifically, we model each trajectory as a graph to efficiently describe the micro-semantics of trajectory and design a novel message-passing mechanism to learn trajectory representations. Additionally, we extract the macro-semantics of trajectories and further incorporate them into a well-designed graph-based decoder to guide trajectory recovery. Extensive experiments conducted on sparse trajectories with three different sampling intervals that are respectively constructed from two real-world trajectory datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed model.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted as a regular paper at IEEE TKDE</p></details> |

We propose to close this gap by designing an intuitive baseline for TKG Forecasting based on predicting recurring facts. Compared to most TKG models, it requires little hyperparameter tuning and no iterative training. Further, it can help to identify failure modes in existing approaches.

Our work primarily addresses this, introducing more realistic and flexible models for spatio-temporal random fields. We break away from the traditional confines of the classic frozen field by either relaxing the assumption of a single deterministic velocity or rethinking the hypothesis regarding the spectrum shape, thus enhancing the realism of our models. While the proposed models stand out for their realism and flexibility, they are also paired with simulation algorithms that are equally or less computationally complex than the commonly used circulant embedding for Gaussian random fields in $\mathbb{R}^{2+1}$. This combination of realistic modeling with efficient simulation methods creates an effective solution for better understanding traveling phenomena.</p></details> |  |

Spatio-temporal data, on the other hand, is vital for analyzing phenomena in both space and time, providing a dynamic perspective on complex system interactions. Recently, diffusion models have seen widespread application in time series and spatio-temporal data mining. Not only do they enhance the generative and inferential capabilities for sequential and temporal data, but they also extend to other downstream tasks. In this survey, we comprehensively and thoroughly review the use of diffusion models in time series and spatio-temporal data, categorizing them by model category, task type, data modality, and practical application domain. In detail, we categorize diffusion models into unconditioned and conditioned types and discuss time series data and spatio-temporal data separately. Unconditioned models, which operate unsupervised, are subdivided into probability-based and score-based models, serving predictive and generative tasks such as forecasting, anomaly detection, classification, and imputation. Conditioned models, on the other hand, utilize extra information to enhance performance and are similarly divided for both predictive and generative tasks. Our survey extensively covers their application in various fields, including healthcare, recommendation, climate, energy, audio, and transportation, providing a foundational understanding of how these models analyze and generate data. Through this structured overview, we aim to provide researchers and practitioners with a comprehensive understanding of diffusion models for time series and spatio-temporal data analysis, aiming to direct future innovations and applications by addressing traditional challenges and exploring innovative solutions within the diffusion model framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>Ongoi...</summary><p>Ongoing work; 27 pages, 8 figures, 2 tables; Github Repo: https://github.com/yyysjz1997/Awesome-TimeSeries-SpatioTemporal-Diffusion-Model</p></details> |
| **[CVTN: Cross Variable and Temporal Integration for Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18730v1)** | 2024-04-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In multivariate time series forecasting, the Transformer architecture encounters two significant challenges: effectively mining features from historical sequences and avoiding overfitting during the learning of temporal dependencies. To tackle these challenges, this paper deconstructs time series forecasting into the learning of historical sequences and prediction sequences, introducing the Cross-Variable and Time Network (CVTN). This unique method divides multivariate time series forecasting into two phases: cross-variable learning for effectively mining fea tures from historical sequences, and cross-time learning to capture the temporal dependencies of prediction sequences. Separating these two phases helps avoid the impact of overfitting in cross-time learning on cross-variable learning. Exten sive experiments on various real-world datasets have confirmed its state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. CVTN emphasizes three key dimensions in time series fore casting: the short-term and long-term nature of time series (locality and longevity), feature mining from both historical and prediction sequences, and the integration of cross-variable and cross-time learning. This approach not only advances the current state of time series forecasting but also provides a more comprehensive framework for future research in this field.</p></details> |  |
| **[Automata-Theoretic Characterisations of Branching-Time Temporal Logics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17421v2)** | 2024-04-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Characterisations theorems serve as important tools in model theory and can be used to assess and compare the expressive power of temporal languages used for the specification and verification of properties in formal methods. While complete connections have been established for the linear-time case between temporal logics, predicate logics, algebraic models, and automata, the situation in the branching-time case remains considerably more fragmented. In this work, we provide an automata-theoretic characterisation of some important branching-time temporal logics, namely CTL* and ECTL* interpreted on arbitrary-branching trees, by identifying two variants of Hesitant Tree Automata that are proved equivalent to those logics. The characterisations also apply to Monadic Path Logic and the bisimulation-invariant fragment of Monadic Chain Logic, again interpreted over trees. These results widen the characterisation landscape of the branching-time case and solve a forty-year-old open question.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatial-Temporal-Decoupled Masked Pre-training for Spatiotemporal Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00516v3)** | 2024-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatiotemporal forecasting techniques are significant for various domains such as transportation, energy, and weather. Accurate prediction of spatiotemporal series remains challenging due to the complex spatiotemporal heterogeneity. In particular, current end-to-end models are limited by input length and thus often fall into spatiotemporal mirage, i.e., similar input time series followed by dissimilar future values and vice versa. To address these problems, we propose a novel self-supervised pre-training framework Spatial-Temporal-Decoupled Masked Pre-training (STD-MAE) that employs two decoupled masked autoencoders to reconstruct spatiotemporal series along the spatial and temporal dimensions. Rich-context representations learned through such reconstruction could be seamlessly integrated by downstream predictors with arbitrary architectures to augment their performances. A series of quantitative and qualitative evaluations on six widely used benchmarks (PEMS03, PEMS04, PEMS07, PEMS08, METR-LA, and PEMS-BAY) are conducted to validate the state-of-the-art performance of STD-MAE.

| **[Self-Supervised Temporal Graph learning with Temporal and Structural Intensity Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.07491v3)** | 2024-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal graph learning aims to generate high-quality representations for graph-based tasks with dynamic information, which has recently garnered increasing attention. In contrast to static graphs, temporal graphs are typically organized as node interaction sequences over continuous time rather than an adjacency matrix. Most temporal graph learning methods model current interactions by incorporating historical neighborhood. However, such methods only consider first-order temporal information while disregarding crucial high-order structural information, resulting in suboptimal performance. To address this issue, we propose a self-supervised method called S2T for temporal graph learning, which extracts both temporal and structural information to learn more informative node representations. Notably, the initial node representations combine first-order temporal and high-order structural information differently to calculate two conditional intensities. An alignment loss is then introduced to optimize the node representations, narrowing the gap between the two intensities and making them more informative. Concretely, in addition to modeling temporal information using historical neighbor sequences, we further consider structural knowledge at both local and global levels. At the local level, we generate structural intensity by aggregating features from high-order neighbor sequences. At the global level, a global representation is generated based on all nodes to adjust the structural intensity according to the active statuses on different nodes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed model S2T achieves at most 10.13% performance improvement compared with the state-of-the-art competitors on several datasets.</p></details> |  |

When using the physics informed neural network (PINN) to simulate the long time evolution, it is necessary to decompose the time domain to capture the transition of solutions in different time. Moreover, the baseline PINN can't maintain the mass conservation property for the equations. We propose a mass-preserving spatio-temporal adaptive PINN. This method adaptively dividing the time domain according to the rate of energy decrease, and solves the Cahn-Hilliard equation in each time step using an independent neural network. To improve the prediction accuracy, spatial adaptive sampling is employed in the subdomain to select points with large residual value and add them to the training samples. Additionally, a mass constraint is added to the loss function to compensate the mass degradation problem of the PINN method in solving the Cahn-Hilliard equations. The mass-preserving spatio-temporal adaptive PINN is employed to solve a series of numerical examples. These include the Cahn-Hilliard equations with different bulk potentials, the three dimensional Cahn-Hilliard equation with singularities, and the set of Cahn-Hilliard equations. The numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.</p></details> |  |

Traditional approaches focus primarily on pairwise interactions, limiting their ability to capture the complexity of real-world interactions involving multiple entities and their intricate relationship structures. This work addresses the problem of forecasting higher-order interaction events in multi-relational recursive hypergraphs. This is done using a dynamic graph representation learning framework that can capture complex relationships involving multiple entities. The proposed model, \textit{Relational Recursive Hyperedge Temporal Point Process} (RRHyperTPP) uses an encoder that learns a dynamic node representation based on the historical interaction patterns and then a hyperedge link prediction based decoder to model the event's occurrence. These learned representations are then used for downstream tasks involving forecasting the type and time of interactions. The main challenge in learning from hyperedge events is that the number of possible hyperedges grows exponentially with the number of nodes in the network. This will make the computation of negative log-likelihood of the temporal point process expensive, as the calculation of survival function requires a summation over all possible hyperedges. In our work, we use noise contrastive estimation to learn the parameters of our model, and we have experimentally shown that our models perform better than previous state-of-the-art methods for interaction forecasting.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 4 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |
| **[Neural Temporal Point Process for Forecasting Higher Order and Directional Interactions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.12210v2)** | 2024-04-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world systems are made of interacting entities that evolve with time. Creating models that can forecast interactions by learning the dynamics of entities is an important problem in numerous fields. Earlier works used dynamic graph models to achieve this. However, real-world interactions are more complex than pairwise, as they involve more than two entities, and many of these higher-order interactions have directional components. Examples of these can be seen in communication networks such as email exchanges that involve a sender, and multiple recipients, citation networks, where authors draw upon the work of others, and so on. In this paper, we solve the problem of higher-order directed interaction forecasting by proposing a deep neural network-based model \textit{Directed HyperNode Temporal Point Process} for directed hyperedge event forecasting, as hyperedge provides a native framework for modeling relationships among the variable number of nodes. Our proposed technique reduces the search space by initially forecasting the nodes at which events will be observed and then forecasting hyperedge sizes and adjacency vectors for the nodes observing events. Based on these, it generates candidate hyperedges, which are then used by a hyperedge predictor to identify the ground truth. To demonstrate the efficiency of our model, we curated five datasets and conducted an extensive empirical study. We believe that this is the first work that solves the problem of forecasting higher-order directional interactions.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 10 figures, 9 tables</p></details> |

Specifically, we formulate the video-based PAR as a vision-language fusion problem and adopt a pre-trained foundation model CLIP to extract the visual features. More importantly, we propose a novel spatiotemporal side-tuning strategy to achieve parameter-efficient optimization of the pre-trained vision foundation model. To better utilize the semantic information, we take the full attribute list that needs to be recognized as another input and transform the attribute words/phrases into the corresponding sentence via split, expand, and prompt operations. Then, the text encoder of CLIP is utilized for embedding processed attribute descriptions. The averaged visual tokens and text tokens are concatenated and fed into a fusion Transformer for multi-modal interactive learning. The enhanced tokens will be fed into a classification head for pedestrian attribute prediction. Extensive experiments on two large-scale video-based PAR datasets fully validated the effectiveness of our proposed framework.

Traditional feature-based methods heavily rely on handcrafted features, which are domain-specific and lack generalizability to new domains. To address this problem, researchers have turned to neural network-based approaches. However, most existing methods follow a sampling-based modeling approach, potentially losing continuous dynamic information that emerges during the information diffusion process. In this paper, we propose Hierarchical Temporal Graph Attention Networks for cascade popularity prediction (HierCas), which operates on the entire cascade graph by a dynamic graph modeling approach. By leveraging time-aware node embedding, graph attention mechanisms, and hierarchical pooling structures, HierCas effectively captures the popularity trend implicit in the complex cascade. Extensive experiments conducted on two real-world datasets in different scenarios demonstrate that our HierCas significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches. We have released our code at https://github.com/Daisy-zzz/HierCas.</p></details> | Accepted by IJCNN'24 |

However, current CLAP struggles to capture temporal information within audio and text features, presenting substantial limitations for tasks such as audio retrieval and generation. To address this gap, we introduce T-CLAP, a temporal-enhanced CLAP model. We use Large Language Models~(LLMs) and mixed-up strategies to generate temporal-contrastive captions for audio clips from extensive audio-text datasets. Subsequently, a new temporal-focused contrastive loss is designed to fine-tune the CLAP model by incorporating these synthetic data. We conduct comprehensive experiments and analysis in multiple downstream tasks. T-CLAP shows improved capability in capturing the temporal relationship of sound events and outperforms state-of-the-art models by a significant margin.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint submitted to IEEE MLSP 2024</p></details> |
| **[Temporal Scaling Law for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17785v1)** | 2024-04-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely adopted in a wide range of tasks, leading to increasing attention towards the research on how scaling LLMs affects their performance. Existing works, termed as Scaling Laws, have discovered that the loss of LLMs scales as power laws with model size, computational budget, and dataset size. However, the performance of LLMs throughout the training process remains untouched. In this paper, we propose the novel concept of Temporal Scaling Law and study the loss of LLMs from the temporal dimension. We first investigate the imbalance of loss on each token positions and develop a reciprocal-law across model scales and training stages. We then derive the temporal scaling law by studying the temporal patterns of the reciprocal-law parameters. Results on both in-distribution (IID) data and out-of-distribution (OOD) data demonstrate that our temporal scaling law accurately predicts the performance of LLMs in future training stages. Moreover, the temporal scaling law reveals that LLMs learn uniformly on different token positions, despite the loss imbalance. Experiments on pre-training LLMs in various scales show that this phenomenon verifies the default training paradigm for generative language models, in which no re-weighting strategies are attached during training. Overall, the temporal scaling law provides deeper insight into LLM pre-training.</p></details> | Work in progress |

Motivated by the limited approaches to handling recurring STL systematically, we tackle the infinite-horizon control problem with a receding horizon scheme equipped with additional STL constraints that introduce minimal complexity and a backward-reachability-based terminal condition that is straightforward to construct and ensures recursive feasibility. Subsequently, we decompose the global receding horizon optimization problem into agent-level programs the objectives of which are to minimize local cost functions subject to local and joint STL constraints. We propose a scheduling policy that allows individual agents to sequentially optimize their control actions while maintaining recursive feasibility. This results in a distributed strategy that can operate online as a model predictive controller. Last, we illustrate the effectiveness of our method via a multi-agent system example assigned a surveillance task.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for presentation at ECC24</p></details> |
| **[Learning World Models With Hierarchical Temporal Abstractions: A Probabilistic Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16078v2)** | 2024-04-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machines that can replicate human intelligence with type 2 reasoning capabilities should be able to reason at multiple levels of spatio-temporal abstractions and scales using internal world models. Devising formalisms to develop such internal world models, which accurately reflect the causal hierarchies inherent in the dynamics of the real world, is a critical research challenge in the domains of artificial intelligence and machine learning. This thesis identifies several limitations with the prevalent use of state space models (SSMs) as internal world models and propose two new probabilistic formalisms namely Hidden-Parameter SSMs and Multi-Time Scale SSMs to address these drawbacks. The structure of graphical models in both formalisms facilitates scalable exact probabilistic inference using belief propagation, as well as end-to-end learning via backpropagation through time. This approach permits the development of scalable, adaptive hierarchical world models capable of representing nonstationary dynamics across multiple temporal abstractions and scales. Moreover, these probabilistic formalisms integrate the concept of uncertainty in world states, thus improving the system's capacity to emulate the stochastic nature of the real world and quantify the confidence in its predictions. The thesis also discuss how these formalisms are in line with related neuroscience literature on Bayesian brain hypothesis and predicitive processing. Our experiments on various real and simulated robots demonstrate that our formalisms can match and in many cases exceed the performance of contemporary transformer variants in making long-range future predictions. We conclude the thesis by reflecting on the limitations of our current models and suggesting directions for future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Docto...</summary><p>Doctoral Dissertation Preprint, Department of Computer Science, Karlsruhe Institute Of Technology, 2024</p></details> |
| **[Retrieval and Distill: A Temporal Data Shift-Free Paradigm for Online Recommendation System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15678v3)** | 2024-04-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current recommendation systems are significantly affected by a serious issue of temporal data shift, which is the inconsistency between the distribution of historical data and that of online data. Most existing models focus on utilizing updated data, overlooking the transferable, temporal data shift-free information that can be learned from shifting data. We propose the Temporal Invariance of Association theorem, which suggests that given a fixed search space, the relationship between the data and the data in the search space keeps invariant over time. Leveraging this principle, we designed a retrieval-based recommendation system framework that can train a data shift-free relevance network using shifting data, significantly enhancing the predictive performance of the original model in the recommendation system. However, retrieval-based recommendation models face substantial inference time costs when deployed online. To address this, we further designed a distill framework that can distill information from the relevance network into a parameterized module using shifting data. The distilled model can be deployed online alongside the original model, with only a minimal increase in inference time. Extensive experiments on multiple real datasets demonstrate that our framework significantly improves the performance of the original model by utilizing shifting data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Self Attention with Temporal Prior: Can We Learn More from Arrow of Time?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18932v2)** | 2024-04-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many diverse phenomena in nature often inherently encode both short- and long-term temporal dependencies, which especially result from the direction of the flow of time. In this respect, we discovered experimental evidence suggesting that interrelations of these events are higher for closer time stamps. However, to be able for attention-based models to learn these regularities in short-term dependencies, it requires large amounts of data, which are often infeasible. This is because, while they are good at learning piece-wise temporal dependencies, attention-based models lack structures that encode biases in time series. As a resolution, we propose a simple and efficient method that enables attention layers to better encode the short-term temporal bias of these data sets by applying learnable, adaptive kernels directly to the attention matrices. We chose various prediction tasks for the experiments using Electronic Health Records (EHR) data sets since they are great examples with underlying long- and short-term temporal dependencies. Our experiments show exceptional classification results compared to best-performing models on most tasks and data sets.</p></details> |  |

Bayesian predictive inference allows for coherently incorporating uncertainty about unknown quantities by making use of methods or models that produce predictive distributions, which in turn inform decision problems. By formalizing these decision problems into properties with the help of spatio-temporal logic, we can formulate and predict how likely such properties are to be satisfied in the future at a certain location. Moreover, we can leverage our methodology to evaluate and compare models directly on their ability to predict the satisfaction of application-driven properties. The approach is illustrated in an urban mobility application, where the crowdedness in the center of Milan is proxied by aggregated mobile phone traffic data. We specify several desirable spatio-temporal properties related to city crowdedness such as a fault-tolerant network or the reachability of hospitals. After verifying these properties on draws from the posterior predictive distributions, we compare several spatio-temporal Bayesian models based on their overall and property-based predictive performance.</p></details> |  |

To achieve this, we exploit a simple proxy task of ordering a shuffled image sequence, with `time' serving as a supervisory signal since only changes that are monotonic with time can give rise to the correct ordering. We also introduce a flexible transformer-based model for general-purpose ordering of image sequences of arbitrary length with built-in attribution maps. After training, the model successfully discovers and localizes monotonic changes while ignoring cyclic and stochastic ones. We demonstrate applications of the model in multiple video settings covering different scene and object types, discovering both object-level and environmental changes in unseen sequences. We also demonstrate that the attention-based attribution maps function as effective prompts for segmenting the changing regions, and that the learned representations can be used for downstream applications. Finally, we show that the model achieves the state of the art on standard benchmarks for ordering a set of images.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://charigyang.github.io/order/</p></details> |

We explore three STaR distillation objectives and select the best combination as the final STaR loss. Our model distilled from HuBERT BASE achieves an overall score of 79.8 on SUPERB benchmark, the best performance among models with up to 27 million parameters.

Albeit recent advancements, existing powerful methods are still prone to making ambiguous predictions under scarce labeled data, embodied as the limitation of distinguishing different actions with similar spatio-temporal information. In this paper, we approach this problem by empowering the model two aspects of capability, namely discriminative spatial modeling and temporal structure modeling for learning discriminative spatio-temporal representations. Specifically, we propose an Adaptive Contrastive Learning~(ACL) strategy. It assesses the confidence of all unlabeled samples by the class prototypes of the labeled data, and adaptively selects positive-negative samples from a pseudo-labeled sample bank to construct contrastive learning. Additionally, we introduce a Multi-scale Temporal Learning~(MTL) strategy. It could highlight informative semantics from long-term clips and integrate them into the short-term clip while suppressing noisy information. Afterwards, both of these two new techniques are integrated in a unified framework to encourage the model to make accurate predictions.

Our key contribution is the development of user-level differentially private algorithms that incorporate carefully chosen parameter values to ensure low estimation errors on real-world datasets, while ensuring privacy. We test our algorithms on ITMS (Intelligent Traffic Management System) data from an Indian city, where the speeds of different buses are drawn in a potentially non-i.i.d. manner from an unknown distribution, and where the number of speed samples contributed by different buses is potentially different. We then apply our algorithms to large synthetic datasets, generated based on the ITMS data. Here, we provide theoretical justification for the observed performance trends, and also provide recommendations for the choices of algorithm subroutines that result in low estimation errors. Finally, we characterize the best performance of pseudo-user creation-based algorithms on worst-case datasets via a minimax approach; this then gives rise to a novel procedure for the creation of pseudo-users, which optimizes the worst-case total estimation error. The algorithms discussed in the paper are readily applicable to general spatio-temporal IoT datasets for releasing a differentially private mean of a desired value.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 5 figures, submitted to the ACM for possible publication</p></details> |

To tackle this challenge, we propose GRAD, a novel game-theoretic approach that treats the temporally-coupled robust RL problem as a partially observable two-player zero-sum game. By finding an approximate equilibrium within this game, GRAD optimizes for general robustness against temporally-coupled perturbations. Experiments on continuous control tasks demonstrate that, compared with prior methods, our approach achieves a higher degree of robustness to various types of attacks on different attack domains, both in settings with temporally-coupled perturbations and decoupled perturbations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at The Twelfth International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR 2024)</p></details> |

They generate 3D box candidates from the first-stage dense detector, followed by different temporal aggregation methods. However, these approaches require per-frame objects or whole point clouds, posing challenges related to memory bank utilization. Moreover, point clouds and trajectory features are combined solely based on concatenation, which may neglect effective interactions between them. In this paper, we propose a point-trajectory transformer with long short-term memory for efficient temporal 3D object detection. To this end, we only utilize point clouds of current-frame objects and their historical trajectories as input to minimize the memory bank storage requirement. Furthermore, we introduce modules to encode trajectory features, focusing on long short-term and future-aware perspectives, and then effectively aggregate them with point cloud features.

In this paper, we focus on NCA models used for texture synthesis, where the update rule is inspired by partial differential equations (PDEs) describing reaction-diffusion systems. To train the NCA model, the spatio-termporal domain is discretized, and Euler integration is used to numerically simulate the PDE. However, whether a trained NCA truly learns the continuous dynamic described by the corresponding PDE or merely overfits the discretization used in training remains an open question. We study NCA models at the limit where space-time discretization approaches continuity. We find that existing NCA models tend to overfit the training discretization, especially in the proximity of the initial condition, also called "seed". To address this, we propose a solution that utilizes uniform noise as the initial condition. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in preserving the consistency of NCA dynamics across a wide range of spatio-temporal granularities. Our improved NCA model enables two new test-time interactions by allowing continuous control over the speed of pattern formation and the scale of the synthesized patterns. We demonstrate this new NCA feature in our interactive online demo. Our work reveals that NCA models can learn continuous dynamics and opens new venues for NCA research from a dynamical systems' perspective.</p></details> | 9 pages, 12 figures |

Analyzing fine-grained and comprehensive relations among stations effectively is imperative for metro Origin-Destination (OD) prediction. However, existing metro OD models either mix information from multiple OD pairs from the station's perspective or exclusively focus on a subset of OD pairs. These approaches may overlook fine-grained relations among OD pairs, leading to difficulties in predicting potential anomalous conditions. To address these challenges, we analyze traffic variations from the perspective of all OD pairs and propose a fine-grained spatial-temporal MLP architecture for metro OD prediction, namely ODMixer. Specifically, our ODMixer has double-branch structure and involves the Channel Mixer, the Multi-view Mixer, and the Bidirectional Trend Learner. The Channel Mixer aims to capture short-term temporal relations among OD pairs, the Multi-view Mixer concentrates on capturing relations from both origin and destination perspectives. To model long-term temporal relations, we introduce the Bidirectional Trend Learner. Extensive experiments on two large-scale metro OD prediction datasets HZMOD and SHMO demonstrate the advantages of our ODMixer. The code will be available.</p></details> |  |

However, it is difficult to model them using classical methods if the relationship is complex. In addition, when the relationship changes with time, it is necessary to deal with the temporal changes of the model. In this study, we have developed Deep Predictive Model with Parametric Bias (DPMPB) as a more human-like adaptive intelligence to deal with these modeling difficulties and temporal model changes. We categorize and summarize the theory of DPMPB and various task experiments on the actual robots, and discuss the effectiveness of DPMPB.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Robotics and Automation Magazine (RAM)</p></details> |

However, LIGO's high sensitivity makes it susceptible to transient noises known as glitches, which necessitate effective differentiation from real gravitational wave signals. Traditional approaches predominantly employ fully supervised or semi-supervised algorithms for the task of glitch classification and clustering. In the future task of identifying and classifying glitches across main and auxiliary channels, it is impractical to build a dataset with manually labeled ground-truth. In addition, the patterns of glitches can vary with time, generating new glitches without manual labels. In response to this challenge, we introduce the Cross-Temporal Spectrogram Autoencoder (CTSAE), a pioneering unsupervised method for the dimensionality reduction and clustering of gravitational wave glitches. CTSAE integrates a novel four-branch autoencoder with a hybrid of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Vision Transformers (ViT). To further extract features across multi-branches, we introduce a novel multi-branch fusion method using the CLS (Class) token. Our model, trained and evaluated on the GravitySpy O3 dataset on the main channel, demonstrates superior performance in clustering tasks when compared to state-of-the-art semi-supervised learning methods. To the best of our knowledge, CTSAE represents the first unsupervised approach tailored specifically for clustering LIGO data, marking a significant step forward in the field of gravitational wave research.

| **[An MRP Formulation for Supervised Learning: Generalized Temporal Difference Learning Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15518v1)** | 2024-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In traditional statistical learning, data points are usually assumed to be independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.) following an unknown probability distribution. This paper presents a contrasting viewpoint, perceiving data points as interconnected and employing a Markov reward process (MRP) for data modeling. We reformulate the typical supervised learning as an on-policy policy evaluation problem within reinforcement learning (RL), introducing a generalized temporal difference (TD) learning algorithm as a resolution. Theoretically, our analysis draws connections between the solutions of linear TD learning and ordinary least squares (OLS). We also show that under specific conditions, particularly when noises are correlated, the TD's solution proves to be a more effective estimator than OLS. Furthermore, we establish the convergence of our generalized TD algorithms under linear function approximation. Empirical studies verify our theoretical results, examine the vital design of our TD algorithm and show practical utility across various datasets, encompassing tasks such as regression and image classification with deep learning.</p></details> |  |

However, executing these space-time paths directly on robotic systems is infeasible due to real-time execution differences (e.g. delays) which can lead to collisions. To combat this, current methods translate the space-time paths into a temporal plan graph (TPG) that only requires that agents observe the order in which they navigate through locations where their paths cross. However, planning space-time paths and then post-processing them into a TPG does not reduce the required agent-to-agent coordination, which is fixed once the space-time paths are computed. To that end, we propose a novel algorithm Space-Order CBS that can directly plan a TPG and explicitly minimize coordination. Our main theoretical insight is our novel perspective on viewing a TPG as a set of space-visitation order paths where agents visit locations in relative orders (e.g. 1st vs 2nd) as opposed to specific timesteps. We redefine unique conflicts and constraints for adapting CBS for space-order planning. We experimentally validate how Space-Order CBS can return TPGs which significantly reduce coordination, thus subsequently reducing the amount of agent-agent communication and leading to more robustness to delays during execution.</p></details> |  |

The challenges of this problem include both the dynamic mobility patterns of the people and the complex spatial-temporal correlations of the urban traffic data. Meanwhile, most existing models ignore the diverse impacts of the various traffic observations (e.g. vehicle speed and road occupancy) on the traffic flow prediction, and different traffic observations can be considered as different channels of input features. We argue that the analysis in multiple-channel traffic observations might help to better address this problem. In this paper, we study the novel problem of multi-channel traffic flow prediction, and propose a deep \underline{M}ulti-\underline{V}iew \underline{C}hannel-wise \underline{S}patio-\underline{T}emporal \underline{Net}work (MVC-STNet) model to effectively address it. Specifically, we first construct the localized and globalized spatial graph where the multi-view fusion module is used to effectively extract the local and global spatial dependencies. Then LSTM is used to learn the temporal correlations. To effectively model the different impacts of various traffic observations on traffic flow prediction, a channel-wise graph convolutional network is also designed. Extensive experiments are conducted over the PEMS04 and PEMS08 datasets. The results demonstrate that the proposed MVC-STNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a large margin.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI2020 workshop</p></details> |

Many recent proposals that target deep learning for spatio-temporal prediction suffer from so-called catastrophic forgetting, where previously learned knowledge is entirely forgotten when new data arrives. Such proposals may experience deteriorating prediction performance when applied in settings where data streams into the system. To enable spatio-temporal prediction on streaming data, we propose a unified replay-based continuous learning framework. The framework includes a replay buffer of previously learned samples that are fused with training data using a spatio-temporal mixup mechanism in order to preserve historical knowledge effectively, thus avoiding catastrophic forgetting. To enable holistic representation preservation, the framework also integrates a general spatio-temporal autoencoder with a carefully designed spatio-temporal simple siamese (STSimSiam) network that aims to ensure prediction accuracy and avoid holistic feature loss by means of mutual information maximization. The framework further encompasses five spatio-temporal data augmentation methods to enhance the performance of STSimSiam. Extensive experiments on real data offer insight into the effectiveness of the proposed framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICDE 2024</p></details> |
| **[LLM-Enhanced Causal Discovery in Temporal Domain from Interventional Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14786v1)** | 2024-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the field of Artificial Intelligence for Information Technology Operations, causal discovery is pivotal for operation and maintenance of graph construction, facilitating downstream industrial tasks such as root cause analysis. Temporal causal discovery, as an emerging method, aims to identify temporal causal relationships between variables directly from observations by utilizing interventional data. However, existing methods mainly focus on synthetic datasets with heavy reliance on intervention targets and ignore the textual information hidden in real-world systems, failing to conduct causal discovery for real industrial scenarios. To tackle this problem, in this paper we propose to investigate temporal causal discovery in industrial scenarios, which faces two critical challenges: 1) how to discover causal relationships without the interventional targets that are costly to obtain in practice, and 2) how to discover causal relations via leveraging the textual information in systems which can be complex yet abundant in industrial contexts. To address these challenges, we propose the RealTCD framework, which is able to leverage domain knowledge to discover temporal causal relationships without interventional targets. Specifically, we first develop a score-based temporal causal discovery method capable of discovering causal relations for root cause analysis without relying on interventional targets through strategic masking and regularization. Furthermore, by employing Large Language Models (LLMs) to handle texts and integrate domain knowledge, we introduce LLM-guided meta-initialization to extract the meta-knowledge from textual information hidden in systems to boost the quality of discovery. We conduct extensive experiments on simulation and real-world datasets to show the superiority of our proposed RealTCD framework over existing baselines in discovering temporal causal structures.</p></details> |  |
| **[Single-temporal Supervised Remote Change Detection for Domain Generalization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11326v4)** | 2024-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Change detection is widely applied in remote sensing image analysis. Existing methods require training models separately for each dataset, which leads to poor domain generalization. Moreover, these methods rely heavily on large amounts of high-quality pair-labelled data for training, which is expensive and impractical. In this paper, we propose a multimodal contrastive learning (ChangeCLIP) based on visual-language pre-training for change detection domain generalization. Additionally, we propose a dynamic context optimization for prompt learning. Meanwhile, to address the data dependency issue of existing methods, we introduce a single-temporal and controllable AI-generated training strategy (SAIN). This allows us to train the model using a large number of single-temporal images without image pairs in the real world, achieving excellent generalization. Extensive experiments on series of real change detection datasets validate the superiority and strong generalization of ChangeCLIP, outperforming state-of-the-art change detection methods. Code will be available.</p></details> |  |

Our method advances existing pose estimation frameworks by improving robustness and flexibility without requiring direct 3D annotations. At the core of our method, a pose compiler module refines predictions from a 2D keypoints estimator that operates on a single image by leveraging temporal and cross-view information. Our novel cross-view fusion strategy is scalable to any number of cameras, while our synthetic data generation strategy ensures generalization across diverse actors, scenes, and viewpoints. Finally, UPose3D leverages the prediction uncertainty of both the 2D keypoint estimator and the pose compiler module. This provides robustness to outliers and noisy data, resulting in state-of-the-art performance in out-of-distribution settings. In addition, for in-distribution settings, UPose3D yields a performance rivaling methods that rely on 3D annotated data, while being the state-of-the-art among methods relying only on 2D supervision.</p></details> | 18 pages, 12 figures |
| **[Ultra-short-term multi-step wind speed prediction for wind farms based on adaptive noise reduction technology and temporal convolutional network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16198v2)** | 2024-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As an important clean and renewable kind of energy, wind power plays an important role in coping with energy crisis and environmental pollution. However, the volatility and intermittency of wind speed restrict the development of wind power. To improve the utilization of wind power, this study proposes a new wind speed prediction model based on data noise reduction technology, temporal convolutional network (TCN), and gated recurrent unit (GRU). Firstly, an adaptive data noise reduction algorithm P-SSA is proposed based on singular spectrum analysis (SSA) and Pearson correlation coefficient. The original wind speed is decomposed into multiple subsequences by SSA and then reconstructed. When the Pearson correlation coefficient between the reconstructed sequence and the original sequence is greater than 0.99, other noise subsequences are deleted to complete the data denoising. Then, the receptive field of the samples is expanded through the causal convolution and dilated convolution of TCN, and the characteristics of wind speed change are extracted. Then, the time feature information of the sequence is extracted by GRU, and then the wind speed is predicted to form the wind speed sequence prediction model of P-SSA-TCN-GRU. The proposed model was validated on three wind farms in Shandong Province. The experimental results show that the prediction performance of the proposed model is better than that of the traditional model and other models based on TCN, and the wind speed prediction of wind farms with high precision and strong stability is realized. The wind speed predictions of this model have the potential to become the data that support the operation and management of wind farms.

| **[Large Language Models Can Learn Temporal Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06853v3)** | 2024-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning capabilities, they are not without their flaws and inaccuracies. Recent studies have introduced various methods to mitigate these limitations. Temporal reasoning (TR), in particular, presents a significant challenge for LLMs due to its reliance on diverse temporal expressions and intricate temporal logic. In this paper, we propose TG-LLM, a novel framework towards language-based TR. Instead of reasoning over the original context, we adopt a latent representation, temporal graph (TG) that facilitates the TR learning. A synthetic dataset (TGQA), which is fully controllable and requires minimal supervision, is constructed for fine-tuning LLMs on this text-to-TG translation task. We confirmed in experiments that the capability of TG translation learned on our dataset can be transferred to other TR tasks and benchmarks. On top of that, we teach LLM to perform deliberate reasoning over the TGs via Chain of Thought (CoT) bootstrapping and graph data augmentation. We observed that those strategies, which maintain a balance between usefulness and diversity, bring more reliable CoTs and final results than the vanilla CoT distillation.</p></details> |  |
| **[ICST-DNET: An Interpretable Causal Spatio-Temporal Diffusion Network for Traffic Speed Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13853v1)** | 2024-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic speed prediction is significant for intelligent navigation and congestion alleviation. However, making accurate predictions is challenging due to three factors: 1) traffic diffusion, i.e., the spatial and temporal causality existing between the traffic conditions of multiple neighboring roads, 2) the poor interpretability of traffic data with complicated spatio-temporal correlations, and 3) the latent pattern of traffic speed fluctuations over time, such as morning and evening rush. Jointly considering these factors, in this paper, we present a novel architecture for traffic speed prediction, called Interpretable Causal Spatio-Temporal Diffusion Network (ICST-DNET). Specifically, ICST-DENT consists of three parts, namely the Spatio-Temporal Causality Learning (STCL), Causal Graph Generation (CGG), and Speed Fluctuation Pattern Recognition (SFPR) modules. First, to model the traffic diffusion within road networks, an STCL module is proposed to capture both the temporal causality on each individual road and the spatial causality in each road pair. The CGG module is then developed based on STCL to enhance the interpretability of the traffic diffusion procedure from the temporal and spatial perspectives. Specifically, a time causality matrix is generated to explain the temporal causality between each road's historical and future traffic conditions. For spatial causality, we utilize causal graphs to visualize the diffusion process in road pairs. Finally, to adapt to traffic speed fluctuations in different scenarios, we design a personalized SFPR module to select the historical timesteps with strong influences for learning the pattern of traffic speed fluctuations. Extensive experimental results prove that ICST-DNET can outperform all existing baselines, as evidenced by the higher prediction accuracy, ability to explain causality, and adaptability to different scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimal Task Assignment and Path Planning using Conflict-Based Search with Precedence and Temporal Constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08772v3)** | 2024-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) problem entails finding collision-free paths for a set of agents, guiding them from their start to goal locations. However, MAPF does not account for several practical task-related constraints. For example, agents may need to perform actions at goal locations with specific execution times, adhering to predetermined orders and timeframes. Moreover, goal assignments may not be predefined for agents, and the optimization objective may lack an explicit definition. To incorporate task assignment, path planning, and a user-defined objective into a coherent framework, this paper examines the Task Assignment and Path Finding with Precedence and Temporal Constraints (TAPF-PTC) problem. We augment Conflict-Based Search (CBS) to simultaneously generate task assignments and collision-free paths that adhere to precedence and temporal constraints, maximizing an objective quantified by the return from a user-defined reward function in reinforcement learning (RL). Experimentally, we demonstrate that our algorithm, CBS-TA-PTC, can solve highly challenging bomb-defusing tasks with precedence and temporal constraints efficiently relative to MARL and adapted Target Assignment and Path Finding (TAPF) methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[MLP: Motion Label Prior for Temporal Sentence Localization in Untrimmed 3D Human Motions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13657v1)** | 2024-04-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we address the unexplored question of temporal sentence localization in human motions (TSLM), aiming to locate a target moment from a 3D human motion that semantically corresponds to a text query. Considering that 3D human motions are captured using specialized motion capture devices, motions with only a few joints lack complex scene information like objects and lighting. Due to this character, motion data has low contextual richness and semantic ambiguity between frames, which limits the accuracy of predictions made by current video localization frameworks extended to TSLM to only a rough level. To refine this, we devise two novel label-prior-assisted training schemes: one embed prior knowledge of foreground and background to highlight the localization chances of target moments, and the other forces the originally rough predictions to overlap with the more accurate predictions obtained from the flipped start/end prior label sequences during recovery training. We show that injecting label-prior knowledge into the model is crucial for improving performance at high IoU. In our constructed TSLM benchmark, our model termed MLP achieves a recall of 44.13 at IoU@0.7 on the BABEL dataset and 71.17 on HumanML3D (Restore), outperforming prior works. Finally, we showcase the potential of our approach in corpus-level moment retrieval. Our source code is openly accessible at https://github.com/eanson023/mlp.</p></details> | 13 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Beyond Alignment: Blind Video Face Restoration via Parsing-Guided Temporal-Coherent Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13640v1)** | 2024-04-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiple complex degradations are coupled in low-quality video faces in the real world. Therefore, blind video face restoration is a highly challenging ill-posed problem, requiring not only hallucinating high-fidelity details but also enhancing temporal coherence across diverse pose variations. Restoring each frame independently in a naive manner inevitably introduces temporal incoherence and artifacts from pose changes and keypoint localization errors. To address this, we propose the first blind video face restoration approach with a novel parsing-guided temporal-coherent transformer (PGTFormer) without pre-alignment. PGTFormer leverages semantic parsing guidance to select optimal face priors for generating temporally coherent artifact-free results. Specifically, we pre-train a temporal-spatial vector quantized auto-encoder on high-quality video face datasets to extract expressive context-rich priors. Then, the temporal parse-guided codebook predictor (TPCP) restores faces in different poses based on face parsing context cues without performing face pre-alignment. This strategy reduces artifacts and mitigates jitter caused by cumulative errors from face pre-alignment. Finally, the temporal fidelity regulator (TFR) enhances fidelity through temporal feature interaction and improves video temporal consistency. Extensive experiments on face videos show that our method outperforms previous face restoration baselines. The code will be released on \href{https://github.com/kepengxu/PGTFormer}{https://github.com/kepengxu/PGTFormer}.</p></details> | 9 pages |

Many existing works directly incorporate the given video and temporally localized query for temporal grounding, overlooking the inherent domain gap between different modalities. In this paper, we utilize pseudo-query features containing extensive temporally global textual knowledge sourced from the same video-query pair, to enhance the bridging of domain gaps and attain a heightened level of similarity between multi-modal features. Specifically, we propose a Pseudo-query Intermediary Network (PIN) to achieve an improved alignment of visual and comprehensive pseudo-query features within the feature space through contrastive learning. Subsequently, we utilize learnable prompts to encapsulate the knowledge of pseudo-queries, propagating them into the textual encoder and multi-modal fusion module, further enhancing the feature alignment between visual and language for better temporal grounding. Extensive experiments conducted on the Charades-STA and ActivityNet-Captions datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.</p></details> |  |
| **[End-to-End Temporal Action Detection with 1B Parameters Across 1000 Frames](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17241v2)** | 2024-04-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, temporal action detection (TAD) has seen significant performance improvement with end-to-end training. However, due to the memory bottleneck, only models with limited scales and limited data volumes can afford end-to-end training, which inevitably restricts TAD performance. In this paper, we reduce the memory consumption for end-to-end training, and manage to scale up the TAD backbone to 1 billion parameters and the input video to 1,536 frames, leading to significant detection performance. The key to our approach lies in our proposed temporal-informative adapter (TIA), which is a novel lightweight module that reduces training memory. Using TIA, we free the humongous backbone from learning to adapt to the TAD task by only updating the parameters in TIA. TIA also leads to better TAD representation by temporally aggregating context from adjacent frames throughout the backbone. We evaluate our model across four representative datasets. Owing to our efficient design, we are able to train end-to-end on VideoMAEv2-giant and achieve 75.4% mAP on THUMOS14, being the first end-to-end model to outperform the best feature-based methods.

Although previous studies have noted that Wikipedia users' information needs vary throughout the day, there is to date no large-scale, quantitative study of the underlying dynamics. The present paper fills this gap by investigating temporal regularities in daily consumption patterns in a large-scale analysis of billions of timezone-corrected page requests mined from English Wikipedia's server logs, with the goal of investigating how context and time relate to the kind of information consumed. First, we show that even after removing the global pattern of day-night alternation, the consumption habits of individual articles maintain strong diurnal regularities. Then, we characterize the prototypical shapes of consumption patterns, finding a particularly strong distinction between articles preferred during the evening/night and articles preferred during working hours. Finally, we investigate topical and contextual correlates of Wikipedia articles' access rhythms, finding that article topic, reader country, and access device (mobile vs. desktop) are all important predictors of daily attention patterns. These findings shed new light on how humans seek information on the Web by focusing on Wikipedia as one of the largest open platforms for knowledge and learning, emphasizing Wikipedia's role as a rich knowledge base that fulfills information needs spread throughout the day, with implications for understanding information seeking across the globe and for designing appropriate information systems.</p></details> | ICWSM 2024 |

Typical fine-tuning based adaptation paradigm is prone to overfitting in the few-shot learning scenarios and offers little modeling flexibility for learning temporal features in video data. In this work we present the Disentangled-and-Deformable Spatio-Temporal Adapter (D$^2$ST-Adapter), which is a novel adapter tuning framework well-suited for few-shot action recognition due to lightweight design and low parameter-learning overhead. It is designed in a dual-pathway architecture to encode spatial and temporal features in a disentangled manner. In particular, we devise the anisotropic Deformable Spatio-Temporal Attention module as the core component of D$^2$ST-Adapter, which can be tailored with anisotropic sampling densities along spatial and temporal domains to learn spatial and temporal features specifically in corresponding pathways, allowing our D$^2$ST-Adapter to encode features in a global view in 3D spatio-temporal space while maintaining a lightweight design. Extensive experiments with instantiations of our method on both pre-trained ResNet and ViT demonstrate the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art methods for few-shot action recognition. Our method is particularly well-suited to challenging scenarios where temporal dynamics are critical for action recognition.</p></details> |  |

To identify the common drivers and extent of spatio-temporal similarity of PM2.5 and ozone, this paper proposed a log Gaussian-Gumbel Bayesian hierarchical model allowing for sharing a SPDE-AR(1) spatio-temporal interaction structure. The proposed model outperforms in terms of estimation accuracy and prediction capacity for its increased parsimony and reduced uncertainty, especially for the shared ozone sub-model. Besides the consistently significant influence of temperature (positive), extreme drought (positive), fire burnt area (positive), and wind speed (negative) on both PM2.5 and ozone, surface pressure and GDP per capita (precipitation) demonstrate only positive associations with PM2.5 (ozone), while population density relates to neither. In addition, our results show the distinct spatio-temporal interactions and different seasonal patterns of PM2.5 and ozone, with peaks of PM2.5 and ozone in cold and hot seasons, respectively. Finally, with the aid of the excursion function, we see that the areas around the intersection of San Luis Obispo and Santa Barbara counties are likely to exceed the unhealthy ozone level for sensitive groups throughout the year. Our findings provide new insights for regional and seasonal strategies in the co-control of PM2.5 and ozone. Our methodology is expected to be utilized when interest lies in multiple interrelated processes in the fields of environment and epidemiology.</p></details> |  |

Despite the significant progress, existing methods suffer from severe performance degradation when transferring to different distributions and thus may hardly adapt to real-world scenarios . To address this problem, we propose the Generalizable Temporal Action Localization task (GTAL), which focuses on improving the generalizability of action localization methods. We observed that the performance decline can be primarily attributed to the lack of generalizability to different action scales. To address this problem, we propose STAT (Self-supervised Temporal Adaptive Teacher), which leverages a teacher-student structure for iterative refinement. Our STAT features a refinement module and an alignment module. The former iteratively refines the model's output by leveraging contextual information and helps adapt to the target scale. The latter improves the refinement process by promoting a consensus between student and teacher models. We conduct extensive experiments on three datasets, THUMOS14, ActivityNet1.2, and HACS, and the results show that our method significantly improves the Baseline methods under the cross-distribution evaluation setting, even approaching the same-distribution evaluation performance.</p></details> | 14 pages, LaTeX; |

Most state-of-the-art methods for traffic prediction effectively predict both long-term and short-term by employing spatio-temporal neural networks as prediction models, together with transformers to learn global information on prediction objects (e.g., traffic states of road segments). However, these methods often have a high computational cost to obtain good performance. This paper introduces an innovative approach to traffic flow prediction, the Spatial-Temporal Selective State Space Model (ST-SSMs), featuring the novel ST-Mamba block, which can achieve good prediction accuracy with less computational cost.

Despite the existence of various video summarization datasets, a notable limitation is their limited amount of source videos, which hampers the effective fine-tuning of advanced large vision-language models (VLMs). Additionally, most existing datasets are created for video-to-video summarization, overlooking the contemporary need for multimodal video content summarization. Recent efforts have been made to expand from unimodal to multimodal video summarization, categorizing the task into three sub-tasks based on the summary's modality: video-to-video (V2V), video-to-text (V2T), and a combination of video and text summarization (V2VT). However, the textual summaries in previous multimodal datasets are inadequate. To address these issues, we introduce Instruct-V2Xum, a cross-modal video summarization dataset featuring 30,000 diverse videos sourced from YouTube, with lengths ranging from 40 to 940 seconds and an average summarization ratio of 16.39\%. Each video summary in Instruct-V2Xum is paired with a textual summary that references specific frame indexes, facilitating the generation of aligned video and textual summaries. In addition, we propose a new video summarization framework named V2Xum-LLM. V2Xum-LLM, specifically V2Xum-LLaMA in this study, is the first framework that unifies different video summarization tasks into one large language model's (LLM) text decoder and achieves task-controllable video summarization with temporal prompts and task instructions. Experiments show that V2Xum-LLaMA outperforms strong baseline models on multiple video summarization tasks. Furthermore, we propose an enhanced evaluation metric for V2V and V2VT summarization tasks.</p></details> |  |

Utilizing the power of advanced deep learning methodologies, our objective is to tackle the critical issue of distracted driving-a significant factor contributing to road accidents. Our strategy employs a dual approach: leveraging Graph-Based Change-Point Detection for pinpointing actions in time alongside a Video Large Language Model (Video-LLM) for precisely categorizing activities. Through careful prompt engineering, we customize the Video-LLM to adeptly handle driving activities' nuances, ensuring its classification efficacy even with sparse data. Engineered to be lightweight, our framework is optimized for consumer-grade GPUs, making it vastly applicable in practical scenarios. We subjected our method to rigorous testing on the SynDD2 dataset, a complex benchmark for distracted driving behaviors, where it demonstrated commendable performance-achieving 57.5% accuracy in event classification and 51% in event detection. These outcomes underscore the substantial promise of DeepLocalization in accurately identifying diverse driver behaviors and their temporal occurrences, all within the bounds of limited computational resources.</p></details> |  |

The primary focus of their research is to ensure safety, comfort, and efficiency. An autonomous vehicle has several modules responsible for one or more of the aforementioned items. Among these modules, the trajectory planner plays a pivotal role in the safety of the vehicle and the comfort of its passengers. The module is also responsible for respecting kinematic constraints and any applicable road constraints. In this paper, a novel online spatial-temporal graph trajectory planner is introduced to generate safe and comfortable trajectories. First, a spatial-temporal graph is constructed using the autonomous vehicle, its surrounding vehicles, and virtual nodes along the road with respect to the vehicle itself. Next, the graph is forwarded into a sequential network to obtain the desired states. To support the planner, a simple behavioral layer is also presented that determines kinematic constraints for the planner. Furthermore, a novel potential function is also proposed to train the network. Finally, the proposed planner is tested on three different complex driving tasks, and the performance is compared with two frequently used methods. The results show that the proposed planner generates safe and feasible trajectories while achieving similar or longer distances in the forward direction and comparable comfort ride.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is the accepted version and published in the "Early Access" area of IEEE Xplore for the IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles on 16 April 2024.

We motivate our work by the inadequacy of existing methods for capturing the evolving graph spectra, which are also computationally expensive due to the temporal aspect along with the graph vertex domain. We view the problem as an optimization over the Laplacian of the continuous time dynamic graph. Additionally, we propose pseudo-spectrum relaxations that decompose the transformation process, making it highly computationally efficient. The EFT method adeptly captures the evolving graph's structural and positional properties, making it effective for downstream tasks on evolving graphs. Hence, as a reference implementation, we develop a simple neural model induced with EFT for capturing evolving graph spectra. We empirically validate our theoretical findings on a number of large-scale and standard temporal graph benchmarks and demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a full conference paper in the International Conference on Learning Representations 2024</p></details> |

Deep learning (DL) approaches have gained colossal success in traffic forecasting but still face challenges in capturing the intricacies of traffic dynamics. In this paper, we identify and address this challenges by emphasizing that spatial features are inherently dynamic and change over time. A novel in-depth feature representation, called Dynamic Spatio-Temporal (Dyn-ST) features, is introduced, which encapsulates spatial characteristics across varying times. Moreover, a Dynamic Spatio-Temporal Graph Transformer Network (DST-GTN) is proposed by capturing Dyn-ST features and other dynamic adjacency relations between intersections. The DST-GTN can model dynamic ST relationships between nodes accurately and refine the representation of global and local ST characteristics by adopting adaptive weights in low-pass and all-pass filters, enabling the extraction of Dyn-ST features from traffic time-series data. Through numerical experiments on public datasets, the DST-GTN achieves state-of-the-art performance for a range of traffic forecasting tasks and demonstrates enhanced stability.</p></details> |  |

Existing event-based lip-reading solutions integrate different frame rate branches to learn spatio-temporal features of varying granularities. However, aggregating events into event frames inevitably leads to the loss of fine-grained temporal information within frames. To remedy this drawback, we propose a novel framework termed Multi-view Temporal Granularity aligned Aggregation (MTGA). Specifically, we first present a novel event representation method, namely time-segmented voxel graph list, where the most significant local voxels are temporally connected into a graph list. Then we design a spatio-temporal fusion module based on temporal granularity alignment, where the global spatial features extracted from event frames, together with the local relative spatial and temporal features contained in voxel graph list are effectively aligned and integrated. Finally, we design a temporal aggregation module that incorporates positional encoding, which enables the capture of local absolute spatial and global temporal information. Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms both the event-based and video-based lip-reading counterparts. Our code will be publicly available.</p></details> |  |

Hence, increasing the learning capacity of such streaming models (i.e., by adding more parameters) to improve the predictive power may not be viable for real-world tasks. In this work, we propose a new loss, Streaming Anchor Loss (SAL), to better utilize the given learning capacity by encouraging the model to learn more from essential frames. More specifically, our SAL and its focal variations dynamically modulate the frame-wise cross entropy loss based on the importance of the corresponding frames so that a higher loss penalty is assigned for frames within the temporal proximity of semantically critical events. Therefore, our loss ensures that the model training focuses on predicting the relatively rare but task-relevant frames. Experimental results with standard lightweight convolutional and recurrent streaming networks on three different speech based detection tasks demonstrate that SAL enables the model to learn the overall task more effectively with improved accuracy and latency, without any additional data, model parameters, or architectural changes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at IEEE ICASSP 2024, please see https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10447222</p></details> |

| **[Probabilistic Feature Augmentation for AIS-Based Multi-Path Long-Term Vessel Trajectory Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18948v5)** | 2024-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Maritime transportation is paramount in achieving global economic growth, entailing concurrent ecological obligations in sustainability and safeguarding endangered marine species, most notably preserving large whale populations. In this regard, the Automatic Identification System (AIS) data plays a significant role by offering real-time streaming data on vessel movement, allowing enhanced traffic monitoring. This study explores using AIS data to prevent vessel-to-whale collisions by forecasting long-term vessel trajectories from engineered AIS data sequences. For such a task, we have developed an encoder-decoder model architecture using Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory Networks (Bi-LSTM) to predict the next 12 hours of vessel trajectories using 1 to 3 hours of AIS data as input. We feed the model with probabilistic features engineered from historical AIS data that refer to each trajectory's potential route and destination. The model then predicts the vessel's trajectory, considering these additional features by leveraging convolutional layers for spatial feature learning and a position-aware attention mechanism that increases the importance of recent timesteps of a sequence during temporal feature learning. The probabilistic features have an F1 Score of approximately 85% and 75% for each feature type, respectively, demonstrating their effectiveness in augmenting information to the neural network. We test our model on the Gulf of St. Lawrence, a region known to be the habitat of North Atlantic Right Whales (NARW). Our model achieved a high R2 score of over 98% using various techniques and features. It stands out among other approaches as it can make complex decisions during turnings and path selection. Our study highlights the potential of data engineering and trajectory forecasting models for marine life species preservation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Non-iterative Optimization of Trajectory and Radio Resource for Aerial Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01314v1)** | 2024-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We address a joint trajectory planning, user association, resource allocation, and power control problem to maximize proportional fairness in the aerial IoT network, considering practical end-to-end quality-of-service (QoS) and communication schedules. Though the problem is rather ancient, apart from the fact that the previous approaches have never considered user- and time-specific QoS, we point out a prevalent mistake in coordinate optimization approaches adopted by the majority of the literature. Coordinate optimization approaches, which repetitively optimize radio resources for a fixed trajectory and vice versa, generally converge to local optima when all variables are differentiable. However, these methods often stagnate at a non-stationary point, significantly degrading the network utility in mixed-integer problems such as joint trajectory and radio resource optimization. We detour this problem by converting the formulated problem into the Markov decision process (MDP). Exploiting the beneficial characteristics of the MDP, we design a non-iterative framework that cooperatively optimizes trajectory and radio resources without initial trajectory choice. The proposed framework can incorporate various trajectory planning algorithms such as the genetic algorithm, tree search, and reinforcement learning. Extensive comparisons with diverse baselines verify that the proposed framework significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art method, nearly achieving the global optimum. Our implementation code is available at https://github.com/hslyu/dbspf.</p></details> |  |

The model, termed MFTraj, harnesses historical trajectory data combined with a novel dynamic geometric graph-based behavior-aware module. At its core, an adaptive structure-aware interactive graph convolutional network captures both positional and behavioral features of road users, preserving spatial-temporal intricacies.

Evaluations on the Argoverse, NGSIM, HighD, and MoCAD datasets underscore MFTraj's robustness and adaptability, outperforming numerous benchmarks even in data-challenged scenarios without the need for additional information such as HD maps or vectorized maps. Importantly, it maintains competitive performance even in scenarios with substantial missing data, on par with most existing state-of-the-art models. The results and methodology suggest a significant advancement in autonomous driving trajectory prediction, paving the way for safer and more efficient autonomous systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IJCAI 2024</p></details> |
| **[Trajectory Planning for Autonomous Vehicle Using Iterative Reward Prediction in Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12079v3)** | 2024-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional trajectory planning methods for autonomous vehicles have several limitations. For example, heuristic and explicit simple rules limit generalizability and hinder complex motions. These limitations can be addressed using reinforcement learning-based trajectory planning. However, reinforcement learning suffers from unstable learning and existing reinforcement learning-based trajectory planning methods do not consider the uncertainties. Thus, this paper, proposes a reinforcement learning-based trajectory planning method for autonomous vehicles. The proposed method involves an iterative reward prediction approach that iteratively predicts expectations of future states. These predicted states are then used to forecast rewards and integrated into the learning process to enhance stability. Additionally, a method is proposed that utilizes uncertainty propagation to make the reinforcement learning agent aware of uncertainties.The proposed method was evaluated using the CARLA simulator. Compared to the baseline methods, the proposed method reduced the collision rate by 60.17%, and increased the average reward by 30.82 times.

Human behavior typically follows a pattern of normalcy in day-to-day activities. This is marked by recurring activities within specific time periods. In this paper, we model this behavior using Reeb graphs where any deviation from usual day-to-day activities is encoded as nodes in the Reeb graph. The complexity of the proposed algorithm is linear with respect to the number of time points in a given trajectory. We demonstrate the usage of ReeSPOT and how it captures the critically significant spatial and temporal deviations using the nodes of the Reeb graph. Our case study presented in this paper includes realistic human movement scenarios: visiting uncommon locations, taking odd routes at infrequent times, uncommon time visits, and uncommon stay durations. We analyze the Reeb graph to interpret the topological structure of the GPS trajectories. Potential applications of ReeSPOT include urban planning, security surveillance, and behavioral research.</p></details> |  |

State-of-the-art human trajectory prediction methods are limited by their focus on collision avoidance and short-term planning, and their inability to model complex interactions of humans with the environment. In contrast, our approach overcomes these limitations by predicting sequences of human interactions with the environment and using this information to guide trajectory predictions over a horizon of up to 60s. We leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to predict interactions with the environment by conditioning the LLM prediction on rich contextual information about the scene. This information is given as a 3D Dynamic Scene Graph that encodes the geometry, semantics, and traversability of the environment into a hierarchical representation. We then ground these interaction sequences into multi-modal spatio-temporal distributions over human positions using a probabilistic approach based on continuous-time Markov Chains. To evaluate our approach, we introduce a new semi-synthetic dataset of long-term human trajectories in complex indoor environments, which also includes annotations of human-object interactions. We show in thorough experimental evaluations that our approach achieves a 54% lower average negative log-likelihood (NLL) and a 26.5% lower Best-of-20 displacement error compared to the best non-privileged baselines for a time horizon of 60s.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures.

Previous methods either oversimplify object shapes, which results in a sacrifice of feasible space or rely on discrete sampling, which suffers from the "tunnel effect". To address these limitations, we propose a novel hierarchical trajectory generation pipeline, which utilizes the Swept Volume Signed Distance Field (SVSDF) to guide trajectory optimization for Continuous Collision Avoidance (CCA). Our interdisciplinary approach, blending techniques from graphics and robotics, exhibits outstanding effectiveness in solving this problem. We formulate the computation of the SVSDF as a Generalized Semi-Infinite Programming model, and we solve for the numerical solutions at query points implicitly, thereby eliminating the need for explicit reconstruction of the surface. Our algorithm has been validated in a variety of complex scenarios and applies to robots of various dynamics, including both rigid and deformable shapes. It demonstrates exceptional universality and superior CCA performance compared to typical algorithms.

Each UAV collects sensing data from the GUs and then forwards the sensing data to the remote BS. The GUs first backscatter their data to the UAVs and then all UAVs forward data to the BS by the nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA) transmissions. We formulate a multi-stage stochastic optimization problem to minimize the long-term time-averaged age-of-information (AoI) by jointly optimizing the GUs' access control, the UAVs' beamforming, and trajectory planning strategies. To solve this problem, we first model the dynamics of the GUs' AoI statuses by virtual queueing systems, and then propose the AoI-aware sensing scheduling and trajectory optimization (AoI-STO) algorithm. This allows us to transform the multi-stage AoI minimization problem into a series of per-slot control problems by using the Lyapunov optimization framework. In each time slot, the GUs' access control, the UAVs' beamforming, and mobility control strategies are updated by using the block coordinate descent (BCD) method according to the instant GUs' AoI statuses. Simulation results reveal that the proposed AoI-STO algorithm can reduce the overall AoI by more than 50%. The GUs' scheduling fairness is also improved greatly by adapting the GUs' access control compared with typical baseline schemes.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by IEEE TVT</p></details> |

Despite increased attention to this issue, most approaches in trajectory prediction do not consider all of these factors sufficiently. This paper describes a method SemanticFormer to predict multimodal trajectories by reasoning over a semantic traffic scene graph using a hybrid approach. We extract high-level information in the form of semantic meta-paths from a knowledge graph which is then processed by a novel pipeline based on multiple attention mechanisms to predict accurate trajectories. The proposed architecture comprises a hierarchical heterogeneous graph encoder, which can capture spatio-temporal and relational information across agents and between agents and road elements, and a predictor that fuses the different encodings and decodes trajectories with probabilities. Finally, a refinement module evaluates permitted meta-paths of trajectories and speed profiles to obtain final predicted trajectories.

| **[G2LTraj: A Global-to-Local Generation Approach for Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19330v1)** | 2024-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting future trajectories of traffic agents accurately holds substantial importance in various applications such as autonomous driving. Previous methods commonly infer all future steps of an agent either recursively or simultaneously. However, the recursive strategy suffers from the accumulated error, while the simultaneous strategy overlooks the constraints among future steps, resulting in kinematically infeasible predictions. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose G2LTraj, a plug-and-play global-to-local generation approach for trajectory prediction. Specifically, we generate a series of global key steps that uniformly cover the entire future time range. Subsequently, the local intermediate steps between the adjacent key steps are recursively filled in. In this way, we prevent the accumulated error from propagating beyond the adjacent key steps. Moreover, to boost the kinematical feasibility, we not only introduce the spatial constraints among key steps but also strengthen the temporal constraints among the intermediate steps. Finally, to ensure the optimal granularity of key steps, we design a selectable granularity strategy that caters to each predicted trajectory. Our G2LTraj significantly improves the performance of seven existing trajectory predictors across the ETH, UCY and nuScenes datasets. Experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness.

Yet, many recent deep learning methods suffer from a degraded performance on the challenging scenarios, mainly because these scenarios appear less frequently in the training data. To address such a long-tail issue, existing methods force challenging scenarios closer together in the feature space during training to trigger information sharing among them for more robust learning. These methods, however, primarily rely on the motion patterns to characterize scenarios, omitting more informative contextual information, such as interactions and scene layout. We argue that exploiting such information not only improves prediction accuracy but also scene compliance of the generated trajectories. In this paper, we propose to incorporate richer training dynamics information into a prototypical contrastive learning framework. More specifically, we propose a two-stage process. First, we generate rich contextual features using a baseline encoder-decoder framework. These features are split into clusters based on the model's output errors, using the training dynamics information, and a prototype is computed within each cluster. Second, we retrain the model using the prototypes in a contrastive learning framework. We conduct empirical evaluations of our approach using two large-scale naturalistic datasets and show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance by improving accuracy and scene compliance on the long-tail samples. Furthermore, we perform experiments on a subset of the clusters to highlight the additional benefit of our approach in reducing training bias.</p></details> | <details><summary>2024 ...</summary><p>2024 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV)</p></details> |

Firstly, we extract spatial features from fighter trajectory data using CNN, aggregate spatial features of multiple fighters using the social-pooling module to capture geographic information and positional relationships in the trajectories, and use the attention mechanism to capture mutated trajectory features in air combat; subsequently, we extract temporal features by using the memory nature of LSTM to capture long-term temporal dependence in the trajectories; and finally, we merge the temporal and spatial features to predict the flight trajectories of enemy fighters. Extensive simulation experiments verify that the proposed method improves the trajectory prediction accuracy compared to the original CNN-LSTM method, with the improvements of 32% and 34% in ADE and FDE indicators.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Non-autoregressive Multi-Horizon Flight Trajectory Prediction Framework with Gray Code Representation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.01658v3)** | 2024-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Flight Trajectory Prediction (FTP) is an essential task in Air Traffic Control (ATC), which can assist air traffic controllers in managing airspace more safely and efficiently. Existing approaches generally perform multi-horizon FTP tasks in an autoregressive manner, thereby suffering from error accumulation and low-efficiency problems. In this paper, a novel framework, called FlightBERT++, is proposed to i) forecast multi-horizon flight trajectories directly in a non-autoregressive way, and ii) improve the limitation of the binary encoding (BE) representation in the FlightBERT framework. Specifically, the proposed framework is implemented by a generalized encoder-decoder architecture, in which the encoder learns the temporal-spatial patterns from historical observations and the decoder predicts the flight status for the future horizons. Compared to conventional architecture, an innovative horizon-aware contexts generator is dedicatedly designed to consider the prior horizon information, which further enables non-autoregressive multi-horizon prediction. Additionally, the Gray code representation and the differential prediction paradigm are designed to cope with the high-bit misclassifications of the BE representation, which significantly reduces the outliers in the predictions. Moreover, a differential prompted decoder is proposed to enhance the capability of the differential predictions by leveraging the stationarity of the differential sequence. Extensive experiments are conducted to validate the proposed framework on a real-world flight trajectory dataset.

| **[Micro-Macro Spatial-Temporal Graph-based Encoder-Decoder for Map-Constrained Trajectory Recovery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19141v1)** | 2024-04-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recovering intermediate missing GPS points in a sparse trajectory, while adhering to the constraints of the road network, could offer deep insights into users' moving behaviors in intelligent transportation systems. Although recent studies have demonstrated the advantages of achieving map-constrained trajectory recovery via an end-to-end manner, they still face two significant challenges. Firstly, existing methods are mostly sequence-based models. It is extremely hard for them to comprehensively capture the micro-semantics of individual trajectory, including the information of each GPS point and the movement between two GPS points. Secondly, existing approaches ignore the impact of the macro-semantics, i.e., the road conditions and the people's shared travel preferences reflected by a group of trajectories. To address the above challenges, we propose a Micro-Macro Spatial-Temporal Graph-based Encoder-Decoder (MM-STGED). Specifically, we model each trajectory as a graph to efficiently describe the micro-semantics of trajectory and design a novel message-passing mechanism to learn trajectory representations. Additionally, we extract the macro-semantics of trajectories and further incorporate them into a well-designed graph-based decoder to guide trajectory recovery. Extensive experiments conducted on sparse trajectories with three different sampling intervals that are respectively constructed from two real-world trajectory datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed model.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted as a regular paper at IEEE TKDE</p></details> |

This paper seeks to compute trajectory plans for which a robot is guaranteed to reach a goal and to avoid obstacles in the specific near-danger case, also known as a narrow gap, where the agent starts near the goal, but must navigate through tight obstacles that block its path. The proposed method builds off of a common approach of using a simplified planning model to generate plans, which are then tracked using a high-fidelity tracking model and controller. Existing safe planning approaches use reachability analysis to overapproximate the error between these models, but this introduces additional numerical approximation error and thereby conservativeness that prevents goal-reaching. The present work instead proposes a Piecewise Affine Reach-avoid Computation (PARC) method to tightly approximate the reachable set of the planning model. PARC significantly reduces conservativeness through a careful choice of the planning model and set representation, along with an effective approach to handling time-varying tracking errors. The utility of this method is demonstrated through extensive numerical experiments in which PARC outperforms state-of-the-art reach-avoid methods in near-danger goal-reaching. Furthermore, in a simulated demonstration, PARC enables the generation of provably-safe extreme vehicle dynamics drift parking maneuvers. A preliminary hardware demo on a TurtleBot3 also validates the method.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The first two authors contributed equally to the work.

Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) leveraging environmental information to achieve three-dimension collision-free trajectory planning is the prerequisite to ensure airspace security. However, the timely information of surrounding situation is difficult to acquire by UAVs, which further brings security risks. As a mature technology leveraged in traditional civil aviation, the automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast (ADS-B) realizes continuous surveillance of the information of aircrafts. Consequently, we leverage ADS-B for surveillance and information broadcasting, and divide the aerial airspace into multiple sub-airspaces to improve flight safety in UAV trajectory planning. In detail, we propose the secure sub-airspaces planning (SSP) algorithm and particle swarm optimization rapidly-exploring random trees (PSO-RRT) algorithm for the UAV trajectory planning in law-altitude airspace. The performance of the proposed algorithm is verified by simulations and the results show that SSP reduces both the maximum number of UAVs in the sub-airspace and the length of the trajectory, and PSO-RRT reduces the cost of UAV trajectory in the sub-airspace.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory Optimization for Adaptive Informative Path Planning with Multimodal Sensing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18374v1)** | 2024-04-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the problem of an autonomous agent equipped with multiple sensors, each with different sensing precision and energy costs. The agent's goal is to explore the environment and gather information subject to its resource constraints in unknown, partially observable environments. The challenge lies in reasoning about the effects of sensing and movement while respecting the agent's resource and dynamic constraints. We formulate the problem as a trajectory optimization problem and solve it using a projection-based trajectory optimization approach where the objective is to reduce the variance of the Gaussian process world belief. Our approach outperforms previous approaches in long horizon trajectories by achieving an overall variance reduction of up to 85% and reducing the root-mean square error in the environment belief by 50%. This approach was developed in support of rover path planning for the NASA VIPER Mission.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE International Conference on Control, Decision and Information Technologies</p></details> |
| **[Compressed Deepfake Video Detection Based on 3D Spatiotemporal Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18149v1)** | 2024-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The misuse of deepfake technology by malicious actors poses a potential threat to nations, societies, and individuals. However, existing methods for detecting deepfakes primarily focus on uncompressed videos, such as noise characteristics, local textures, or frequency statistics. When applied to compressed videos, these methods experience a decrease in detection performance and are less suitable for real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose a deepfake video detection method based on 3D spatiotemporal trajectories. Specifically, we utilize a robust 3D model to construct spatiotemporal motion features, integrating feature details from both 2D and 3D frames to mitigate the influence of large head rotation angles or insufficient lighting within frames. Furthermore, we separate facial expressions from head movements and design a sequential analysis method based on phase space motion trajectories to explore the feature differences between genuine and fake faces in deepfake videos. We conduct extensive experiments to validate the performance of our proposed method on several compressed deepfake benchmarks. The robustness of the well-designed features is verified by calculating the consistent distribution of facial landmarks before and after video compression.Our method yields satisfactory results and showcases its potential for practical applications.</p></details> |  |

Developing models for this task requires rich datasets containing diverse sets of samples. However, the existing naturalistic trajectory prediction datasets are generally imbalanced in favor of simpler samples and lack challenging scenarios. Such a long-tail effect causes prediction models to underperform on the tail portion of the data distribution containing safety-critical scenarios. Previous methods tackle the long-tail problem using methods such as contrastive learning and class-conditioned hypernetworks. These approaches, however, are not modular and cannot be applied to many machine learning architectures. In this work, we propose a modular model-agnostic framework for trajectory prediction that leverages a specialized mixture of experts. In our approach, each expert is trained with a specialized skill with respect to a particular part of the data. To produce predictions, we utilise a router network that selects the best expert by generating relative confidence scores. We conduct experimentation on common pedestrian trajectory prediction datasets and show that our method improves performance on long-tail scenarios. We further conduct ablation studies to highlight the contribution of different proposed components.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces an innovative model that infuses cognitive insights into trajectory prediction, focusing on perceived safety and dynamic decision-making. Distinct from traditional approaches, our model excels in analyzing interactions and behavior patterns in mixed autonomy traffic scenarios. It represents a significant leap forward, achieving marked performance improvements on several key datasets. Specifically, it surpasses existing benchmarks with gains of 16.2% on the Next Generation Simulation (NGSIM), 27.4% on the Highway Drone (HighD), and 19.8% on the Macao Connected Autonomous Driving (MoCAD) dataset. Our proposed model shows exceptional proficiency in handling corner cases, essential for real-world applications. Moreover, its robustness is evident in scenarios with missing or limited data, outperforming most of the state-of-the-art baselines. This adaptability and resilience position our model as a viable tool for real-world autonomous driving systems, heralding a new standard in vehicle trajectory prediction for enhanced safety and efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IJCAI 2024</p></details> |

Further, it allows automated analysis of recorded motion data. Many clustering algorithms for trajectories build upon distance metrics that are based on pointwise Euclidean distances. However, our work indicates that focusing on salient characteristics is often sufficient. We present a novel distance measure for motion plans consisting of state and control trajectories that is based on a compressed representation built from their main features. This approach allows a flexible choice of feature classes relevant to the respective task. The distance measure is used in agglomerative hierarchical clustering. We compare our method with the widely used dynamic time warping algorithm on test sets of motion plans for the Furuta pendulum and the Manutec robot arm and on real-world data from a human motion dataset. The proposed method demonstrates slight advantages in clustering and strong advantages in runtime, especially for long trajectories.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in: 2023 IEEE-RAS 22nd International Conference on Humanoid Robots (Humanoids).

| **[Neural Interaction Energy for Multi-Agent Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16579v1)** | 2024-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Maintaining temporal stability is crucial in multi-agent trajectory prediction. Insufficient regularization to uphold this stability often results in fluctuations in kinematic states, leading to inconsistent predictions and the amplification of errors. In this study, we introduce a framework called Multi-Agent Trajectory prediction via neural interaction Energy (MATE). This framework assesses the interactive motion of agents by employing neural interaction energy, which captures the dynamics of interactions and illustrates their influence on the future trajectories of agents. To bolster temporal stability, we introduce two constraints: inter-agent interaction constraint and intra-agent motion constraint. These constraints work together to ensure temporal stability at both the system and agent levels, effectively mitigating prediction fluctuations inherent in multi-agent systems. Comparative evaluations against previous methods on four diverse datasets highlight the superior prediction accuracy and generalization capabilities of our model.</p></details> |  |

This task is of major importance across multiple disciplines, in which also sequences like trajectories can be considered as a group. As groups become more diverse in heterogeneity and size, detecting group anomalies becomes challenging, especially without supervision. Though Recurrent Neural Networks are well established deep sequence models, their performance can decrease with increasing sequence lengths. Hence, this paper introduces GADformer, a BERT-based model for attention-driven GAD on trajectories in unsupervised and semi-supervised settings. We demonstrate how group anomalies can be detected by attention-based GAD. We also introduce the Block-Attention-anomaly-Score (BAS) to enhance model transparency by scoring attention patterns. In addition to that, synthetic trajectory generation allows various ablation studies. In extensive experiments we investigate our approach versus related works in their robustness for trajectory noise and novelties on synthetic data and three real world datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted at International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN) 2024, Yokohama, Japan</p></details> |

They generate 3D box candidates from the first-stage dense detector, followed by different temporal aggregation methods. However, these approaches require per-frame objects or whole point clouds, posing challenges related to memory bank utilization. Moreover, point clouds and trajectory features are combined solely based on concatenation, which may neglect effective interactions between them. In this paper, we propose a point-trajectory transformer with long short-term memory for efficient temporal 3D object detection. To this end, we only utilize point clouds of current-frame objects and their historical trajectories as input to minimize the memory bank storage requirement. Furthermore, we introduce modules to encode trajectory features, focusing on long short-term and future-aware perspectives, and then effectively aggregate them with point cloud features. We conduct extensive experiments on the large-scale Waymo dataset to demonstrate that our approach performs well against state-of-the-art methods.

Based on this representation, we extend the kinodynamic A* and the corridor-constrained trajectory optimization algorithms to efficiently tackle static and dynamic obstacles with arbitrary shapes. Collision avoidance between communicating robots is integrated by sharing planned trajectories and projecting them onto the SOGM. The simulation results show that our method achieves competitive performance against state-of-the-art methods in dynamic environments with different numbers and shapes of obstacles.

However, current systems fall short of matching human-level of intelligence in terms of adapting to novel tools. Prior works based on affordance often make strong assumptions about the environments and cannot scale to more complex, contact-rich tasks. In this work, we tackle this challenge and explore how agents can learn to use previously unseen tools to manipulate deformable objects. We propose to learn a generative model of the tool-use trajectories as a sequence of tool point clouds, which generalizes to different tool shapes. Given any novel tool, we first generate a tool-use trajectory and then optimize the sequence of tool poses to align with the generated trajectory. We train a single model on four different challenging deformable object manipulation tasks, using demonstration data from only one tool per task. The model generalizes to various novel tools, significantly outperforming baselines. We further test our trained policy in the real world with unseen tools, where it achieves the performance comparable to human.

As a part of ITS, Vehicle Trajectory Prediction (VTP) aims to forecast a vehicle's future positions based on its past and current movements. VTP is a pivotal element for road safety, aiding in applications such as traffic management, accident prevention, work-zone safety, and energy optimization. While most works in this field focus on autonomous driving, with the growing number of surveillance cameras, another sub-field emerges for surveillance VTP with its own set of challenges. In this paper, we introduce VT-Former, a novel transformer-based VTP approach for highway safety and surveillance. In addition to utilizing transformers to capture long-range temporal patterns, a new Graph Attentive Tokenization (GAT) module has been proposed to capture intricate social interactions among vehicles. This study seeks to explore both the advantages and the limitations inherent in combining transformer architecture with graphs for VTP. Our investigation, conducted across three benchmark datasets from diverse surveillance viewpoints, showcases the State-of-the-Art (SotA) or comparable performance of VT-Former in predicting vehicle trajectories.

However, NeRF heavily relies on precise camera poses. While recent works like BARF have introduced camera pose optimization within NeRF, their applicability is limited to simple trajectory scenes. Existing methods struggle while tackling complex trajectories involving large rotations. To address this limitation, we propose CT-NeRF, an incremental reconstruction optimization pipeline using only RGB images without pose and depth input. In this pipeline, we first propose a local-global bundle adjustment under a pose graph connecting neighboring frames to enforce the consistency between poses to escape the local minima caused by only pose consistency with the scene structure. Further, we instantiate the consistency between poses as a reprojected geometric image distance constraint resulting from pixel-level correspondences between input image pairs. Through the incremental reconstruction, CT-NeRF enables the recovery of both camera poses and scene structure and is capable of handling scenes with complex trajectories. We evaluate the performance of CT-NeRF on two real-world datasets, NeRFBuster and Free-Dataset, which feature complex trajectories. Results show CT-NeRF outperforms existing methods in novel view synthesis and pose estimation accuracy.</p></details> |  |

The trajectory-based alignment, typically modeled as a classic hand-eye calibration, significantly influences the accuracy of evaluation metrics. However, traditional calibration methods are susceptible to the quality of the input poses. Few studies have taken this into account when evaluating VO/VIO trajectories that usually suffer from noise and drift. To fill this gap, we propose a novel spatiotemporal hand-eye calibration algorithm that fully leverages multiple constraints from screw theory for enhanced accuracy and robustness. Experimental results show that our algorithm has better performance and is less noise-prone than state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 9 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

However, existing trajectory generation methods are still in their infancy due to the inherent diversity and unpredictability of human activities, grappling with issues such as fidelity, flexibility, and generalizability. To overcome these obstacles, we propose ControlTraj, a Controllable Trajectory generation framework with the topology-constrained diffusion model. Distinct from prior approaches, ControlTraj utilizes a diffusion model to generate high-fidelity trajectories while integrating the structural constraints of road network topology to guide the geographical outcomes. Specifically, we develop a novel road segment autoencoder to extract fine-grained road segment embedding. The encoded features, along with trip attributes, are subsequently merged into the proposed geographic denoising UNet architecture, named GeoUNet, to synthesize geographic trajectories from white noise. Through experimentation across three real-world data settings, ControlTraj demonstrates its ability to produce human-directed, high-fidelity trajectory generation with adaptability to unexplored geographical contexts.</p></details> |  |

Numerous methods exist that target different tasks involving trajectories such as travel-time estimation, trajectory recovery, and trajectory prediction. However, most methods target only one specific task and cannot be applied universally. Existing efforts to create a universal trajectory model often involve adding prediction modules for adapting to different tasks, while also struggle with incomplete or sparse trajectories. To address these shortcomings, we propose the Universal Vehicle Trajectory Model (UVTM) designed to support different tasks based on incomplete or sparse trajectories without the need for retraining or extra prediction modules. To addresses task adaptability on incomplete trajectories, UVTM divide the spatio-temporal features of trajectories into three distinct domains. Each domain can be masked and generated independently to suit the input and output needs of specific tasks. To handle sparse trajectories effectively, UVTM is pre-trained by reconstructing densely sampled trajectories from sparsely sampled ones, allowing it to extract detailed spatio-temporal information from sparse trajectories. Experiments involving three representative trajectory-related tasks on two real-world vehicle trajectory datasets provide insight into the intended properties performance of UVTM and offer evidence that UVTM is capable of meeting its objectives.</p></details> |  |

These data offer us vital insights to understand the movements of individuals and populations, benefiting a broad range of applications from transportation planning to epidemic modeling. However, improper release of trajectory data is increasing concerns on individual privacy. Previous attempts either lack strong privacy guarantees, or fail to preserve sufficient basic characteristics of the original data. In this paper, we propose DPTraj-PM, a method to synthesize trajectory dataset under the differential privacy (DP) framework while ensures high data utility. Based on the assumption that an individual's trajectory could be mainly determined by the initial trajectory segment (which depicts the starting point and the initial direction) and the next location point, DPTraj-PM discretizes the raw trajectories into neighboring cells, and models them by combining a prefix tree structure and an m-order Markov process. After adding noise to the model under differential privacy, DPTraj-PM generates a synthetic dataset from the noisy model to enable a wider spectrum of data mining and modeling tasks. The output traces crafted by DPTraj-PM not only preserves the patterns and variability in individuals' mobility behaviors, but also protects individual privacy. Experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate that DPTraj-PM substantially outperforms the state-of-the-art techniques in terms of data utility.

Current distillation techniques often dichotomize into two distinct aspects: i) ODE Trajectory Preservation; and ii) ODE Trajectory Reformulation. However, these approaches suffer from severe performance degradation or domain shifts. To address these limitations, we propose Hyper-SD, a novel framework that synergistically amalgamates the advantages of ODE Trajectory Preservation and Reformulation, while maintaining near-lossless performance during step compression. Firstly, we introduce Trajectory Segmented Consistency Distillation to progressively perform consistent distillation within pre-defined time-step segments, which facilitates the preservation of the original ODE trajectory from a higher-order perspective. Secondly, we incorporate human feedback learning to boost the performance of the model in a low-step regime and mitigate the performance loss incurred by the distillation process. Thirdly, we integrate score distillation to further improve the low-step generation capability of the model and offer the first attempt to leverage a unified LoRA to support the inference process at all steps. Extensive experiments and user studies demonstrate that Hyper-SD achieves SOTA performance from 1 to 8 inference steps for both SDXL and SD1.5. For example, Hyper-SDXL surpasses SDXL-Lightning by +0.68 in CLIP Score and +0.51 in Aes Score in the 1-step inference.</p></details> |  |

We consider the case of SGD without replacement, the variant typically used to optimize large-scale neural networks. We analyze this algorithm in a more realistic regime than typically considered in theoretical works on SGD, as, e.g., we allow the product of the learning rate and Hessian to be $O(1)$ and we do not specify any model architecture, learning task, or loss (objective) function. Our core theoretical result is that optimizing with SGD without replacement is locally equivalent to making an additional step on a novel regularizer. This implies that the expected trajectories of SGD without replacement can be decoupled in (i) following SGD with replacement (in which batches are sampled i.i.d.) along the directions of high curvature, and (ii) regularizing the trace of the noise covariance along the flat ones. As a consequence, SGD without replacement travels flat areas and may escape saddles significantly faster than SGD with replacement. On several vision tasks, the novel regularizer penalizes a weighted trace of the Fisher Matrix, thus encouraging sparsity in the spectrum of the Hessian of the loss in line with empirical observations from prior work. We also propose an explanation for why SGD does not train at the edge of stability (as opposed to GD).</p></details> | 69 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Social Force Embedded Mixed Graph Convolutional Network for Multi-class Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13378v1)** | 2024-04-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate prediction of agent motion trajectories is crucial for autonomous driving, contributing to the reduction of collision risks in human-vehicle interactions and ensuring ample response time for other traffic participants. Current research predominantly focuses on traditional deep learning methods, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs). These methods leverage relative distances to forecast the motion trajectories of a single class of agents. However, in complex traffic scenarios, the motion patterns of various types of traffic participants exhibit inherent randomness and uncertainty. Relying solely on relative distances may not adequately capture the nuanced interaction patterns between different classes of road users. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-class trajectory prediction method named the social force embedded mixed graph convolutional network (SFEM-GCN). SFEM-GCN comprises three graph topologies: the semantic graph (SG), position graph (PG), and velocity graph (VG). These graphs encode various of social force relationships among different classes of agents in complex scenes. Specifically, SG utilizes one-hot encoding of agent-class information to guide the construction of graph adjacency matrices based on semantic information. PG and VG create adjacency matrices to capture motion interaction relationships between different classes agents. These graph structures are then integrated into a mixed graph, where learning is conducted using a spatiotemporal graph convolutional neural network (ST-GCNN).

However, imitating trajectories that inadequately represent the original expert data can result in undesirable behaviors, particularly in safety-critical scenarios. We propose a trajectory augmentation method designed to maintain similarity with expert trajectory data. To accomplish this, we first cluster trajectories to identify minority yet safety-critical groups. Then, we combine the trajectories within the same cluster through geometrical transformation to create new trajectories. These trajectories are then added to the training dataset, provided that they meet our specified safety-related criteria. Our experiments exhibit that training an imitation learning model using these augmented trajectories can significantly improve closed-loop performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to 35th IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium, 2024</p></details> |

However, it presents unique challenges, due to the complex roadway layout at intersections, involvement of traffic signal controls, and interactions among different types of road users. To address these issues, we present in this paper a novel model called Knowledge-Informed Generative Adversarial Network (KI-GAN), which integrates both traffic signal information and multi-vehicle interactions to predict vehicle trajectories accurately. Additionally, we propose a specialized attention pooling method that accounts for vehicle orientation and proximity at intersections. Based on the SinD dataset, our KI-GAN model is able to achieve an Average Displacement Error (ADE) of 0.05 and a Final Displacement Error (FDE) of 0.12 for a 6-second observation and 6-second prediction cycle. When the prediction window is extended to 9 seconds, the ADE and FDE values are further reduced to 0.11 and 0.26, respectively. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed KI-GAN model in vehicle trajectory prediction under complex scenarios at signalized intersections, which represents a significant advancement in the target field.</p></details> | <details><summary>2024 ...</summary><p>2024 CVPR AICity Workshop</p></details> |

While many models have been developed towards this end, effectively capturing and predicting the variability inherent to human behavior still remains an open challenge. This paper proposes TrajFlow - a new approach for probabilistic trajectory prediction based on Normalizing Flows. We reformulate the problem of capturing distributions over trajectories into capturing distributions over abstracted trajectory features using an autoencoder, simplifying the learning task of the Normalizing Flows. TrajFlow outperforms state-of-the-art behavior prediction models in capturing full trajectory distributions in two synthetic benchmarks with known true distributions, and is competitive on the naturalistic datasets ETH/UCY, rounD, and nuScenes. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of TrajFlow in probabilistic prediction of human behavior.</p></details> |  |

This paper addresses two issues: the lack of labeled data and the difficulty of explaining the predictions of a neural network. To this end, we present a framework called uTRAND, that shifts the problem of anomalous trajectory prediction from the pixel space to a semantic-topological domain. The framework detects and tracks all types of traffic agents in bird's-eye-view videos of traffic cameras mounted at an intersection. By conceptualizing the intersection as a patch-based graph, it is shown that the framework learns and models the normal behaviour of traffic agents without costly manual labeling. Furthermore, uTRAND allows to formulate simple rules to classify anomalous trajectories in a way suited for human interpretation. We show that uTRAND outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches on a dataset of anomalous trajectories collected in a real-world setting, while producing explainable detection results.</p></details> |  |

The trajectory prediction models based on the neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Previous attack methods have achieved high attack success rates but overlook the adaptability to realistic scenarios and the concealment of the deceits. To address this problem, we propose a speed-adaptive stealthy adversarial attack method named SA-Attack. This method searches the sensitive region of trajectory prediction models and generates the adversarial trajectories by using the vehicle-following method and incorporating information about forthcoming trajectories. Our method has the ability to adapt to different speed scenarios by reconstructing the trajectory from scratch. Fusing future trajectory trends and curvature constraints can guarantee the smoothness of adversarial trajectories, further ensuring the stealthiness of attacks. The empirical study on the datasets of nuScenes and Apolloscape demonstrates the attack performance of our proposed method. Finally, we also demonstrate the adaptability and stealthiness of SA-Attack for different speed scenarios.

The system utilizes information presently accessible to customers through smartphones and retail apps: motion data, store map, and purchase records. The approach eliminates the need for additional hardware installations/maintenance and ensures customers maintain full control of their data. Specifically, RetailOpt first employs inertial navigation to recover relative trajectories from smartphone motion data. The store map and purchase records are then cross-referenced to identify a list of visited shelves, providing anchors to localize the relative trajectories in a store through continuous and discrete optimization. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our system through systematic experiments in five diverse environments. The proposed system, if successful, would produce accurate customer movement data, essential for a broad range of retail applications, including customer behavior analysis and in-store navigation. The potential application could also extend to other domains such as entertainment and assistive technologies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Acting upon Imagination: when to trust imagined trajectories in model based reinforcement learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.05716v5)** | 2024-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) aims to learn model(s) of the environment dynamics that can predict the outcome of its actions. Forward application of the model yields so called imagined trajectories (sequences of action, predicted state-reward) used to optimize the set of candidate actions that maximize expected reward. The outcome, an ideal imagined trajectory or plan, is imperfect and typically MBRL relies on model predictive control (MPC) to overcome this by continuously re-planning from scratch, incurring thus major computational cost and increasing complexity in tasks with longer receding horizon. We propose uncertainty estimation methods for online evaluation of imagined trajectories to assess whether further planned actions can be trusted to deliver acceptable reward. These methods include comparing the error after performing the last action with the standard expected error and using model uncertainty to assess the deviation from expected outcomes. Additionally, we introduce methods that exploit the forward propagation of the dynamics model to evaluate if the remainder of the plan aligns with expected results and assess the remainder of the plan in terms of the expected reward. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed uncertainty estimation methods by applying them to avoid unnecessary trajectory replanning in a shooting MBRL setting. Results highlight significant reduction on computational costs without sacrificing performance.</p></details> |  |

In scenarios where online interactions are impractical, offline RL, which trains the agent using pre-collected datasets, has become popular. While this new paradigm presents remarkable effectiveness across various real-world domains, like healthcare and energy management, there is a growing demand to enable agents to rapidly and completely eliminate the influence of specific trajectories from both the training dataset and the trained agents. To meet this problem, this paper advocates Trajdeleter, the first practical approach to trajectory unlearning for offline RL agents. The key idea of Trajdeleter is to guide the agent to demonstrate deteriorating performance when it encounters states associated with unlearning trajectories. Simultaneously, it ensures the agent maintains its original performance level when facing other remaining trajectories. Additionally, we introduce Trajauditor, a simple yet efficient method to evaluate whether Trajdeleter successfully eliminates the specific trajectories of influence from the offline RL agent. Extensive experiments conducted on six offline RL algorithms and three tasks demonstrate that Trajdeleter requires only about 1.5% of the time needed for retraining from scratch. It effectively unlearns an average of 94.8% of the targeted trajectories yet still performs well in actual environment interactions after unlearning. The replication package and agent parameters are available online.</p></details> | 22 pages |

To effectively utilize this data, it is essential to accurately match the geolocation data to the road segments. However, this matching is often not trivial due to the low sampling rate and errors exacerbated by multipath effects in urban environments. Traditionally, statistical modeling techniques such as Hidden-Markov models incorporating domain knowledge into the matching process have been extensively used for map-matching tasks. However, rule-based map-matching tasks are noise-sensitive and inefficient in processing large-scale trajectory data. Deep learning techniques directly learn the relationship between observed data and road networks from the data, often without the need for hand-crafted rules or domain knowledge. This renders them an efficient approach for map-matching large-scale datasets and makes them more robust to the noise. This paper introduces a sequence-to-sequence deep-learning model, specifically the transformer-based encoder-decoder model, to perform as a surrogate for map-matching algorithms. The encoder-decoder architecture initially encodes the series of noisy GPS points into a representation that automatically captures autoregressive behavior and spatial correlations between GPS points. Subsequently, the decoder associates data points with the road network features and thus transforms these representations into a sequence of road segments. The model is trained and evaluated using GPS traces collected in Manhattan, New York. Achieving an accuracy of 76%, transformer-based encoder-decoder models extensively employed in natural language processing presented a promising performance for translating noisy GPS data to the navigated routes in urban road networks.</p></details> | 14 pages, 10 figures |

The primary focus of their research is to ensure safety, comfort, and efficiency. An autonomous vehicle has several modules responsible for one or more of the aforementioned items. Among these modules, the trajectory planner plays a pivotal role in the safety of the vehicle and the comfort of its passengers. The module is also responsible for respecting kinematic constraints and any applicable road constraints. In this paper, a novel online spatial-temporal graph trajectory planner is introduced to generate safe and comfortable trajectories. First, a spatial-temporal graph is constructed using the autonomous vehicle, its surrounding vehicles, and virtual nodes along the road with respect to the vehicle itself. Next, the graph is forwarded into a sequential network to obtain the desired states. To support the planner, a simple behavioral layer is also presented that determines kinematic constraints for the planner. Furthermore, a novel potential function is also proposed to train the network. Finally, the proposed planner is tested on three different complex driving tasks, and the performance is compared with two frequently used methods. The results show that the proposed planner generates safe and feasible trajectories while achieving similar or longer distances in the forward direction and comparable comfort ride.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is the accepted version and published in the "Early Access" area of IEEE Xplore for the IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles on 16 April 2024.

The motion planning of the proposed robot system presents challenges arising from the nonholonomic constraints of the trailer, system underactuation, and hybrid interaction through the cable. To tackle these challenges, we develop a hybrid dynamics model that accounts for the cable's taut/slack status. Since it is computationally intense to directly optimize the trajectory, we first propose a search algorithm to compute a sub-optimal trajectory as the initial solution. Then, a novel collision avoidance constraint based on the geometric shapes of objects is proposed to formulate the trajectory optimization problem for the hybrid system. The proposed trajectory planning method is implemented on a Unitree A1 quadruped robot with a customized cable-trailer and validated through experiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 8 figures, submitted to 2024 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)</p></details> |

The field of motion prediction has seen large progress recently with state-of-the-Art (sotA) models achieving impressive results on large-scale public benchmarks. However, recent work revealed that learning-based methods are prone to predict off-road trajectories in challenging scenarios. These can be created by perturbing existing scenarios with additional turns in front of the target vehicle while the motion history is left unchanged. We argue that this indicates that SotA models do not consider the map information sufficiently and demonstrate how this can be solved by representing model inputs and outputs in a Frenet frame defined by lane centreline sequences. To this end, we present a general wrapper that leverages a Frenet representation of the scene, and that can be applied to SotA models without changing their architecture. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in a comprehensive benchmark using two SotA motion prediction models. Our experiments show that this reduces the off-road rate on challenging scenarios by more than 90% without sacrificing average performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[S4TP: Social-Suitable and Safety-Sensitive Trajectory Planning for Autonomous Vehicles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11946v1)** | 2024-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In public roads, autonomous vehicles (AVs) face the challenge of frequent interactions with human-driven vehicles (HDVs), which render uncertain driving behavior due to varying social characteristics among humans. To effectively assess the risks prevailing in the vicinity of AVs in social interactive traffic scenarios and achieve safe autonomous driving, this article proposes a social-suitable and safety-sensitive trajectory planning (S4TP) framework. Specifically, S4TP integrates the Social-Aware Trajectory Prediction (SATP) and Social-Aware Driving Risk Field (SADRF) modules. SATP utilizes Transformers to effectively encode the driving scene and incorporates an AV's planned trajectory during the prediction decoding process. SADRF assesses the expected surrounding risk degrees during AVs-HDVs interactions, each with different social characteristics, visualized as two-dimensional heat maps centered on the AV. SADRF models the driving intentions of the surrounding HDVs and predicts trajectories based on the representation of vehicular interactions. S4TP employs an optimization-based approach for motion planning, utilizing the predicted HDVs'trajectories as input. With the integration of SADRF, S4TP executes real-time online optimization of the planned trajectory of AV within lowrisk regions, thus improving the safety and the interpretability of the planned trajectory. We have conducted comprehensive tests of the proposed method using the SMARTS simulator. Experimental results in complex social scenarios, such as unprotected left turn intersections, merging, cruising, and overtaking, validate the superiority of our proposed S4TP in terms of safety and rationality. S4TP achieves a pass rate of 100% across all scenarios, surpassing the current state-of-the-art methods Fanta of 98.25% and Predictive-Decision of 94.75%.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages,4 figures, published to IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles</p></details> |

However, providing suitable assistance in real-world walking scenarios which involve changing terrain remains challenging. Recent research suggests that forecasting the lower limb joint's angles could provide target trajectories for exoskeletons and prostheses, and the performance could be improved with visual information. In this letter, We share a real-world dataset of 10 healthy subjects walking through five common types of terrain with stride-level label. We design a network called Sandwich Fusion Transformer for Image and Kinematics (SFTIK), which predicts the thigh angle of the ensuing stride given the terrain images at the beginning of the preceding and the ensuing stride and the IMU time series during the preceding stride. We introduce width-level patchify, tailored for egocentric terrain images, to reduce the computational demands. We demonstrate the proposed sandwich input and fusion mechanism could significantly improve the forecasting performance. Overall, the SFTIK outperforms baseline methods, achieving a computational efficiency of 3.31 G Flops, and root mean square error (RMSE) of 3.445 \textpm \ 0.804\textdegree \ and Pearson's correlation coefficient (PCC) of 0.971 \textpm\ 0.025. The results demonstrate that SFTIK could forecast the thigh's angle accurately with low computational cost, which could serve as a terrain adaptive trajectory planning method for hip exoskeletons.

This paper presents a first such comparison study of the variants Potential-Quick RRT* (PQ-RRT*), Informed RRT* (IRRT*), RRT*, and RRT, in maritime single-query nonholonomic motion planning. Additionally, the practicalities of using these algorithms in maritime environments are discussed and outlined. We also contend that these algorithms are beneficial not only for trajectory planning in Collision Avoidance Systems (CAS) but also for CAS verification when used as vessel behavior generators. Optimal RRT variants tend to produce more distance-optimal paths but require more computational time due to complex tree wiring and nearest neighbor searches. Our findings, supported by Welch`s t-test at a significance level of Alpha = 0.05, indicate that PQ-RRT* slightly outperform IRRT* and RRT* in achieving shorter trajectory length but at the expense of higher tuning complexity and longer run-times. Based on the results, we argue that these RRT algorithms are better suited for smaller-scale problems or environments with low obstacle congestion ratio. This is attributed to the curse of dimensionality, and trade-off with available memory and computational resources.</p></details> |  |

Due to the sensitive nature of the location data, directly sharing user trajectories suffers from privacy leakage issues. Local differential privacy (LDP), which perturbs sensitive data on the user side before it is shared or analyzed, emerges as a promising solution for private trajectory stream collection and analysis. Unfortunately, existing stream release approaches often neglect the rich spatial-temporal context information within trajectory streams, resulting in suboptimal utility and limited types of downstream applications. To this end, we propose RetraSyn, a novel real-time trajectory synthesis framework, which is able to perform on-the-fly trajectory synthesis based on the mobility patterns privately extracted from users' trajectory streams. Thus, the downstream trajectory analysis can be performed on the high-utility synthesized data with privacy protection. We also take the genuine behaviors of real-world mobile travelers into consideration, ensuring authenticity and practicality. The key components of RetraSyn include the global mobility model, dynamic mobility update mechanism, real-time synthesis, and adaptive allocation strategy. We conduct extensive experiments on multiple real-world and synthetic trajectory datasets under various location-based utility metrics, encompassing both streaming and historical scenarios. The empirical results demonstrate the superiority and versatility of our proposed framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICDE 2024.

Despite the recent advances in data-driven approaches, grasping remains an unsolved problem. Most of the works on this task are relying on priors and heavy constraints to avoid the exploration problem. Novelty Search (NS) refers to evolutionary algorithms that replace selection of best performing individuals with selection of the most novel ones. Such methods have already shown promising results on hard exploration problems. In this work, we introduce a new NS-based method that can generate large datasets of grasping trajectories in a platform-agnostic manner. Inspired by the hierarchical learning paradigm, our method decouples approach and prehension to make the behavioral space smoother. Experiments conducted on 3 different robot-gripper setups and on several standard objects shows that our method outperforms state-of-the-art for generating diverse repertoire of grasping trajectories, getting a higher successful run ratio, as well as a better diversity for both approach and prehension.

Yet, existing models often fail to fully leverage the non-verbal social cues human subconsciously communicate when navigating the space. To address this, we introduce Social-Transmotion, a generic Transformer-based model that exploits diverse and numerous visual cues to predict human behavior. We translate the idea of a prompt from Natural Language Processing (NLP) to the task of human trajectory prediction, where a prompt can be a sequence of x-y coordinates on the ground, bounding boxes in the image plane, or body pose keypoints in either 2D or 3D. This, in turn, augments trajectory data, leading to enhanced human trajectory prediction. Using masking technique, our model exhibits flexibility and adaptability by capturing spatiotemporal interactions between agents based on the available visual cues. We delve into the merits of using 2D versus 3D poses, and a limited set of poses. Additionally, we investigate the spatial and temporal attention map to identify which keypoints and time-steps in the sequence are vital for optimizing human trajectory prediction. Our approach is validated on multiple datasets, including JTA, JRDB, Pedestrians and Cyclists in Road Traffic, and ETH-UCY.

If the opposing vehicles do not react to the ego vehicle, they can be predicted accurately. However, if there is interaction between the vehicles, the prediction loses its validity. For high interaction, instead of a planning approach that reacts exclusively to the fixed prediction, a trajectory planning approach is required that incorporates the interaction with the opposing vehicles. This paper demonstrates the limitations of a widely used conventional sampling-based approach within a highly interactive blocking scenario. We show that high success rates are achieved for less aggressive blocking behavior but that the collision rate increases with more significant interaction. We further propose a novel Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based trajectory planning approach for racing that explicitly exploits the interaction with the opposing vehicle without requiring a prediction. In contrast to the conventional approach, the RL-based approach achieves high success rates even for aggressive blocking behavior. Furthermore, we propose a novel safety layer (SL) that intervenes when the trajectory generated by the RL-based approach is infeasible. In that event, the SL generates a sub-optimal but feasible trajectory, avoiding termination of the scenario due to a not found valid solution.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, submitted to be published at the 27th IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems, September 24 - 27, 2024, Edmonton, Canada</p></details> |

In contrast to most existing works which assumed the target's location is known, we focus on a more challenging scenario where the exact location of the target to be sensed is unknown and random, while its distribution is known a priori and stored in a novel target location distribution map. Based on this map, the probability for the UAV to successfully sense the target can be expressed as a function of the UAV's trajectory. We aim to optimize the UAV's trajectory between two pre-determined locations to maximize the overall sensing probability during its flight, subject to a GBS-UAV communication quality constraint at each time instant and a maximum mission completion time constraint. Despite the non-convexity and NP-hardness of this problem, we devise three high-quality suboptimal solutions tailored for it with polynomial complexity.

In this paper, we propose offline trajectory generalization through world transformers for offline reinforcement learning (OTTO). Specifically, we use casual Transformers, a.k.a. World Transformers, to predict state dynamics and the immediate reward. Then we propose four strategies to use World Transformers to generate high-rewarded trajectory simulation by perturbing the offline data. Finally, we jointly use offline data with simulated data to train an offline RL algorithm. OTTO serves as a plug-in module and can be integrated with existing offline RL methods to enhance them with better generalization capability of transformers and high-rewarded data augmentation. Conducting extensive experiments on D4RL benchmark datasets, we verify that OTTO significantly outperforms state-of-the-art offline RL methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generating 6-D Trajectories for Omnidirectional Multirotor Aerial Vehicles in Cluttered Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10392v1)** | 2024-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As fully-actuated systems, omnidirectional multirotor aerial vehicles (OMAVs) have more flexible maneuverability and advantages in aggressive flight in cluttered environments than traditional underactuated MAVs. %Due to the high dimensionality of configuration space, making the designed trajectory generation algorithm efficient is challenging. This paper aims to achieve safe flight of OMAVs in cluttered environments. Considering existing static obstacles, an efficient optimization-based framework is proposed to generate 6-D $SE(3)$ trajectories for OMAVs. Given the kinodynamic constraints and the 3D collision-free region represented by a series of intersecting convex polyhedra, the proposed method finally generates a safe and dynamically feasible 6-D trajectory. First, we parameterize the vehicle's attitude into a free 3D vector using stereographic projection to eliminate the constraints inherent in the $SO(3)$ manifold, while the complete $SE(3)$ trajectory is represented as a 6-D polynomial in time without inherent constraints. The vehicle's shape is modeled as a cuboid attached to the body frame to achieve whole-body collision evaluation. Then, we formulate the origin trajectory generation problem as a constrained optimization problem. The original constrained problem is finally transformed into an unconstrained one that can be solved efficiently. To verify the proposed framework's performance, simulations and real-world experiments based on a tilt-rotor hexarotor aerial vehicle are carried out.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication.

Understanding the decision-making process not only contributes to fostering trust but might also reveal previously unknown decision criteria of complex models that could advance the state of medical research. The discovery of decision-relevant concepts from black box models is a particularly challenging task. This study proposes Concept Discovery through Latent Diffusion-based Counterfactual Trajectories (CDCT), a novel three-step framework for concept discovery leveraging the superior image synthesis capabilities of diffusion models. In the first step, CDCT uses a Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) to generate a counterfactual trajectory dataset. This dataset is used to derive a disentangled representation of classification-relevant concepts using a Variational Autoencoder (VAE). Finally, a search algorithm is applied to identify relevant concepts in the disentangled latent space. The application of CDCT to a classifier trained on the largest public skin lesion dataset revealed not only the presence of several biases but also meaningful biomarkers. Moreover, the counterfactuals generated within CDCT show better FID scores than those produced by a previously established state-of-the-art method, while being 12 times more resource-efficient. Unsupervised concept discovery holds great potential for the application of trustworthy AI and the further development of human knowledge in various domains. CDCT represents a further step in this direction.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR) 2024</p></details> |

In the past, All-Wheel-Steering(AWS) robots, incorporating modes such as rotation-free translation maneuvers, in-situ rotational maneuvers, and proportional steering, exhibited inefficient performance due to time-consuming mode switches. This inefficiency arises from wheel rotation constraints and inter-wheel cooperation requirements. The direct application of a holonomic moving strategy can lead to significant slip angles or even structural failure. Additionally, the limited steering range of AWS wheeled robots exacerbates nonlinearity issues, thereby complicating control processes. To address these challenges, we developed a novel planning method termed Constrained AWS(C-AWS), which integrates second-order discrete search with predictive control techniques. Experimental results demonstrate that our method adeptly generates feasible and smooth trajectories for C-AWS while adhering to steering angle constraints.</p></details> |  |

However, dynamically adjusting their position to offer favorable communication channels introduces operational challenges in terms of energy consumption, especially when integrating advanced communication technologies like reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) and full-duplex relays (FDRs). To this end, by recognizing the pivotal role of UAV mobility, the paper introduces an energy-aware trajectory design for UAV-mounted RISs and UAV-mounted FDRs using the decode and forward (DF) protocol, aiming to maximize the network minimum rate and enhance user fairness, while taking into consideration the available on-board energy. Specifically, this work highlights their distinct energy consumption characteristics and their associated integration challenges by developing appropriate energy consumption models for both UAV-mounted RISs and FDRs that capture the intricate relationship between key factors such as weight, and their operational characteristics. Furthermore, a joint time-division multiple access (TDMA) user scheduling-UAV trajectory optimization problem is formulated, considering the power dynamics of both systems, while assuring that the UAV energy is not depleted mid-air. Finally, simulation results underscore the importance of energy considerations in determining the optimal trajectory and scheduling and provide insights into the performance comparison of UAV-mounted RISs and FDRs in UAV-assisted wireless networks.</p></details> |  |

However, we observed that LCM struggles to generate images with both clarity and detailed intricacy. Consequently, we introduce Trajectory Consistency Distillation (TCD), which encompasses trajectory consistency function and strategic stochastic sampling. The trajectory consistency function diminishes the parameterisation and distillation errors by broadening the scope of the self-consistency boundary condition with trajectory mapping and endowing the TCD with the ability to accurately trace the entire trajectory of the Probability Flow ODE in semi-linear form with an Exponential Integrator. Additionally, strategic stochastic sampling provides explicit control of stochastic and circumvents the accumulated errors inherent in multi-step consistency sampling. Experiments demonstrate that TCD not only significantly enhances image quality at low NFEs but also yields more detailed results compared to the teacher model at high NFEs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://mhh0318.github.io/tcd</p></details> |

However, recent studies have raised concerns regarding the hallucination and flaws in their reasoning process. Substantial efforts are being made to improve the reliability and faithfulness of the generated rationales. Some approaches model reasoning as planning, while others focus on annotating for process supervision. Nevertheless, the planning-based search process often results in high latency due to the frequent assessment of intermediate reasoning states and the extensive exploration space. Additionally, supervising the reasoning process with human annotation is costly and challenging to scale for LLM training. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a framework to learn planning-based reasoning through Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) on collected trajectories, which are ranked according to synthesized process rewards. Our results on challenging logical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our learning framework, showing that our 7B model can surpass the strong counterparts like GPT-3.5-Turbo.</p></details> | 17 pages, 9 figures |

To bridge the gap of learning accurate representations with efficient and flexible mechanisms, we introduce Efflex, a comprehensive pipeline for transformative graph modeling and representation learning of the large-volume spatio-temporal trajectories. Efflex pioneers the incorporation of a multi-scale k-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm with feature fusion for graph construction, marking a leap in dimensionality reduction techniques by preserving essential data features. Moreover, the groundbreaking graph construction mechanism and the high-performance lightweight GCN increase embedding extraction speed by up to 36 times faster. We further offer Efflex in two versions, Efflex-L for scenarios demanding high accuracy, and Efflex-B for environments requiring swift data processing. Comprehensive experimentation with the Porto and Geolife datasets validates our approach, positioning Efflex as the state-of-the-art in the domain. Such enhancements in speed and accuracy highlight the versatility of Efflex, underscoring its wide-ranging potential for deployment in time-sensitive and computationally constrained applications.</p></details> |  |

Learning-based methods are currently showing impressive results in simulation-based challenges, with transformer-based architectures technologically leading the way. Ultimately, however, predictions are needed in the real world. In addition to the shifts from simulation to the real world, many vehicle- and country-specific shifts, i.e. differences in sensor systems, fusion and perception algorithms as well as traffic rules and laws, are on the agenda. Since models that can cover all system setups and design domains at once are not yet foreseeable, model adaptation plays a central role. Therefore, a simulation-based study on transfer learning techniques is conducted on basis of a transformer-based model.

| **[WildGraph: Realistic Graph-based Trajectory Generation for Wildlife](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08068v1)** | 2024-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory generation is an important task in movement studies; it circumvents the privacy, ethical, and technical challenges of collecting real trajectories from the target population. In particular, real trajectories in the wildlife domain are scarce as a result of ethical and environmental constraints of the collection process. In this paper, we consider the problem of generating long-horizon trajectories, akin to wildlife migration, based on a small set of real samples. We propose a hierarchical approach to learn the global movement characteristics of the real dataset and recursively refine localized regions. Our solution, WildGraph, discretizes the geographic path into a prototype network of H3 (https://www.uber.com/blog/h3/) regions and leverages a recurrent variational auto-encoder to probabilistically generate paths over the regions, based on occupancy. WildGraph successfully generates realistic months-long trajectories using a sample size as small as 60. Experiments performed on two wildlife migration datasets demonstrate that our proposed method improves the generalization of the generated trajectories in comparison to existing work while achieving superior or comparable performance in several benchmark metrics.

| **[On the Performance of Jerk-Constrained Time-Optimal Trajectory Planning for Industrial Manipulators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07889v1)** | 2024-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Jerk-constrained trajectories offer a wide range of advantages that collectively improve the performance of robotic systems, including increased energy efficiency, durability, and safety. In this paper, we present a novel approach to jerk-constrained time-optimal trajectory planning (TOTP), which follows a specified path while satisfying up to third-order constraints to ensure safety and smooth motion. One significant challenge in jerk-constrained TOTP is a non-convex formulation arising from the inclusion of third-order constraints. Approximating inequality constraints can be particularly challenging because the resulting solutions may violate the actual constraints. We address this problem by leveraging convexity within the proposed formulation to form conservative inequality constraints. We then obtain the desired trajectories by solving an $\boldsymbol n$-dimensional Sequential Linear Program (SLP) iteratively until convergence. Lastly, we evaluate in a real robot the performance of trajectories generated with and without jerk limits in terms of peak power, torque efficiency, and tracking capability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bi-level Trajectory Optimization on Uneven Terrains with Differentiable Wheel-Terrain Interaction Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03307v2)** | 2024-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Navigation of wheeled vehicles on uneven terrain necessitates going beyond the 2D approaches for trajectory planning. Specifically, it is essential to incorporate the full 6dof variation of vehicle pose and its associated stability cost in the planning process. To this end, most recent works aim to learn a neural network model to predict the vehicle evolution. However, such approaches are data-intensive and fraught with generalization issues. In this paper, we present a purely model-based approach that just requires the digital elevation information of the terrain. Specifically, we express the wheel-terrain interaction and 6dof pose prediction as a non-linear least squares (NLS) problem. As a result, trajectory planning can be viewed as a bi-level optimization. The inner optimization layer predicts the pose on the terrain along a given trajectory, while the outer layer deforms the trajectory itself to reduce the stability and kinematic costs of the pose. We improve the state-of-the-art in the following respects. First, we show that our NLS based pose prediction closely matches the output from a high-fidelity physics engine. This result coupled with the fact that we can query gradients of the NLS solver, makes our pose predictor, a differentiable wheel-terrain interaction model. We further leverage this differentiability to efficiently solve the proposed bi-level trajectory optimization problem. Finally, we perform extensive experiments, and comparison with a baseline to showcase the effectiveness of our approach in obtaining smooth, stable trajectories.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 7 figures, submitted to IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS 2024)</p></details> |

| **[VeTraSS: Vehicle Trajectory Similarity Search Through Graph Modeling and Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08021v1)** | 2024-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory similarity search plays an essential role in autonomous driving, as it enables vehicles to analyze the information and characteristics of different trajectories to make informed decisions and navigate safely in dynamic environments. Existing work on the trajectory similarity search task primarily utilizes sequence-processing algorithms or Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), which suffer from the inevitable issues of complicated architecture and heavy training costs. Considering the intricate connections between trajectories, using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for data modeling is feasible. However, most methods directly use existing mathematical graph structures as the input instead of constructing specific graphs from certain vehicle trajectory data. This ignores such data's unique and dynamic characteristics. To bridge such a research gap, we propose VeTraSS -- an end-to-end pipeline for Vehicle Trajectory Similarity Search. Specifically, VeTraSS models the original trajectory data into multi-scale graphs, and generates comprehensive embeddings through a novel multi-layer attention-based GNN. The learned embeddings can be used for searching similar vehicle trajectories. Extensive experiments on the Porto and Geolife datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of VeTraSS, where our model outperforms existing work and reaches the state-of-the-art. This demonstrates the potential of VeTraSS for trajectory analysis and safe navigation in self-driving vehicles in the real world.</p></details> |  |
| **[HPNet: Dynamic Trajectory Forecasting with Historical Prediction Attention](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06351v2)** | 2024-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting the trajectories of road agents is essential for autonomous driving systems. The recent mainstream methods follow a static paradigm, which predicts the future trajectory by using a fixed duration of historical frames. These methods make the predictions independently even at adjacent time steps, which leads to potential instability and temporal inconsistency. As successive time steps have largely overlapping historical frames, their forecasting should have intrinsic correlation, such as overlapping predicted trajectories should be consistent, or be different but share the same motion goal depending on the road situation. Motivated by this, in this work, we introduce HPNet, a novel dynamic trajectory forecasting method. Aiming for stable and accurate trajectory forecasting, our method leverages not only historical frames including maps and agent states, but also historical predictions. Specifically, we newly design a Historical Prediction Attention module to automatically encode the dynamic relationship between successive predictions. Besides, it also extends the attention range beyond the currently visible window benefitting from the use of historical predictions. The proposed Historical Prediction Attention together with the Agent Attention and Mode Attention is further formulated as the Triple Factorized Attention module, serving as the core design of HPNet.Experiments on the Argoverse and INTERACTION datasets show that HPNet achieves state-of-the-art performance, and generates accurate and stable future trajectories.

However, existing representations for motion, such as deformation models or time-dependent neural representations, are limited in the amount of motion they can generate-they cannot synthesize motion extending far beyond the bounding box used for volume rendering. The lack of a more flexible motion model contributes to the gap in realism between 4D generation methods and recent, near-photorealistic video generation models. Here, we propose TC4D: trajectory-conditioned text-to-4D generation, which factors motion into global and local components. We represent the global motion of a scene's bounding box using rigid transformation along a trajectory parameterized by a spline. We learn local deformations that conform to the global trajectory using supervision from a text-to-video model. Our approach enables the synthesis of scenes animated along arbitrary trajectories, compositional scene generation, and significant improvements to the realism and amount of generated motion, which we evaluate qualitatively and through a user study.

Here we test a diffusion probabilistic model on a specific dataset of corrupted images corresponding to incomplete Euclidean distance matrices of fBm at various memory exponents $H$. Our dataset implies uniqueness of the data imputation in the regime of low missing ratio, where the remaining partial graph is rigid, providing the ground truth for the inpainting. We find that the conditional diffusion generation stably reproduces the statistics of missing fBm-distributed distances for different values of $H$ exponent. Furthermore, while diffusion models have been recently shown to remember samples from the training database, we show that diffusion-based inpainting behaves qualitatively different from the database search with the increasing database size. Finally, we apply our fBm-trained diffusion model with $H=1/3$ for completion of chromosome distance matrices obtained in single-cell microscopy experiments, showing its superiority over the standard bioinformatics algorithms.

| **[Trajectory-Oriented Policy Optimization with Sparse Rewards](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02225v3)** | 2024-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mastering deep reinforcement learning (DRL) proves challenging in tasks featuring scant rewards. These limited rewards merely signify whether the task is partially or entirely accomplished, necessitating various exploration actions before the agent garners meaningful feedback. Consequently, the majority of existing DRL exploration algorithms struggle to acquire practical policies within a reasonable timeframe. To address this challenge, we introduce an approach leveraging offline demonstration trajectories for swifter and more efficient online RL in environments with sparse rewards. Our pivotal insight involves treating offline demonstration trajectories as guidance, rather than mere imitation, allowing our method to learn a policy whose distribution of state-action visitation marginally matches that of offline demonstrations. We specifically introduce a novel trajectory distance relying on maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) and cast policy optimization as a distance-constrained optimization problem. We then illustrate that this optimization problem can be streamlined into a policy-gradient algorithm, integrating rewards shaped by insights from offline demonstrations. The proposed algorithm undergoes evaluation across extensive discrete and continuous control tasks with sparse and misleading rewards. The experimental findings demonstrate the significant superiority of our proposed algorithm over baseline methods concerning diverse exploration and the acquisition of an optimal policy.</p></details> | 6 pages, 7 figures |
| **[TrajPRed: Trajectory Prediction with Region-based Relation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06971v1)** | 2024-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Forecasting human trajectories in traffic scenes is critical for safety within mixed or fully autonomous systems. Human future trajectories are driven by two major stimuli, social interactions, and stochastic goals. Thus, reliable forecasting needs to capture these two stimuli. Edge-based relation modeling represents social interactions using pairwise correlations from precise individual states. Nevertheless, edge-based relations can be vulnerable under perturbations. To alleviate these issues, we propose a region-based relation learning paradigm that models social interactions via region-wise dynamics of joint states, i.e., the changes in the density of crowds. In particular, region-wise agent joint information is encoded within convolutional feature grids. Social relations are modeled by relating the temporal changes of local joint information from a global perspective. We show that region-based relations are less susceptible to perturbations. In order to account for the stochastic individual goals, we exploit a conditional variational autoencoder to realize multi-goal estimation and diverse future prediction. Specifically, we perform variational inference via the latent distribution, which is conditioned on the correlation between input states and associated target goals. Sampling from the latent distribution enables the framework to reliably capture the stochastic behavior in test data. We integrate multi-goal estimation and region-based relation learning to model the two stimuli, social interactions, and stochastic goals, in a prediction framework. We evaluate our framework on the ETH-UCY dataset and Stanford Drone Dataset (SDD). We show that the diverse prediction better fits the ground truth when incorporating the relation module. Our framework outperforms the state-of-the-art models on SDD by $27.61\%$/$18.20\%$ of ADE/FDE metrics.</p></details> |  |

To capture complex spatial-temporal dynamics and social interactions, recent studies developed models based on advanced deep-learning methods. On the other hand, recent studies have explored the use of deep generative models to further account for trajectory uncertainties. However, the current approaches demonstrating indeterminacy involve inefficient and time-consuming practices such as sampling from trained models. To fill this gap, we proposed a novel model named Graph Recurrent Attentive Neural Process (GRANP) for vehicle trajectory prediction while efficiently quantifying prediction uncertainty. In particular, GRANP contains an encoder with deterministic and latent paths, and a decoder for prediction. The encoder, including stacked Graph Attention Networks, LSTM and 1D convolutional layers, is employed to extract spatial-temporal relationships. The decoder is used to learn a latent distribution and thus quantify prediction uncertainty. To reveal the effectiveness of our model, we evaluate the performance of GRANP on the highD dataset. Extensive experiments show that GRANP achieves state-of-the-art results and can efficiently quantify uncertainties. Additionally, we undertake an intuitive case study that showcases the interpretability of the proposed approach. The code is available at https://github.com/joy-driven/GRANP.</p></details> |  |

In this regard, the Automatic Identification System (AIS) data plays a significant role by offering real-time streaming data on vessel movement, allowing enhanced traffic monitoring. This study explores using AIS data to prevent vessel-to-whale collisions by forecasting long-term vessel trajectories from engineered AIS data sequences. For such a task, we have developed an encoder-decoder model architecture using Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory Networks (Bi-LSTM) to predict the next 12 hours of vessel trajectories using 1 to 3 hours of AIS data as input. We feed the model with probabilistic features engineered from historical AIS data that refer to each trajectory's potential route and destination. The model then predicts the vessel's trajectory, considering these additional features by leveraging convolutional layers for spatial feature learning and a position-aware attention mechanism that increases the importance of recent timesteps of a sequence during temporal feature learning. The probabilistic features have an F1 Score of approximately 85% and 75% for each feature type, respectively, demonstrating their effectiveness in augmenting information to the neural network. We test our model on the Gulf of St. Lawrence, a region known to be the habitat of North Atlantic Right Whales (NARW). Our model achieved a high R2 score of over 98% using various techniques and features. It stands out among other approaches as it can make complex decisions during turnings and path selection. Our study highlights the potential of data engineering and trajectory forecasting models for marine life species preservation.</p></details> |  |

Though the problem is rather ancient, apart from the fact that the previous approaches have never considered user- and time-specific QoS, we point out a prevalent mistake in coordinate optimization approaches adopted by the majority of the literature. Coordinate optimization approaches, which repetitively optimize radio resources for a fixed trajectory and vice versa, generally converge to local optima when all variables are differentiable. However, these methods often stagnate at a non-stationary point, significantly degrading the network utility in mixed-integer problems such as joint trajectory and radio resource optimization. We detour this problem by converting the formulated problem into the Markov decision process (MDP). Exploiting the beneficial characteristics of the MDP, we design a non-iterative framework that cooperatively optimizes trajectory and radio resources without initial trajectory choice. The proposed framework can incorporate various trajectory planning algorithms such as the genetic algorithm, tree search, and reinforcement learning. Extensive comparisons with diverse baselines verify that the proposed framework significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art method, nearly achieving the global optimum.

However, reinforcement learning suffers from unstable learning and existing reinforcement learning-based trajectory planning methods do not consider the uncertainties. Thus, this paper, proposes a reinforcement learning-based trajectory planning method for autonomous vehicles. The proposed method involves an iterative reward prediction approach that iteratively predicts expectations of future states. These predicted states are then used to forecast rewards and integrated into the learning process to enhance stability. Additionally, a method is proposed that utilizes uncertainty propagation to make the reinforcement learning agent aware of uncertainties.The proposed method was evaluated using the CARLA simulator. Compared to the baseline methods, the proposed method reduced the collision rate by 60.17%, and increased the average reward by 30.82 times.

Human behavior typically follows a pattern of normalcy in day-to-day activities. This is marked by recurring activities within specific time periods. In this paper, we model this behavior using Reeb graphs where any deviation from usual day-to-day activities is encoded as nodes in the Reeb graph. The complexity of the proposed algorithm is linear with respect to the number of time points in a given trajectory. We demonstrate the usage of ReeSPOT and how it captures the critically significant spatial and temporal deviations using the nodes of the Reeb graph. Our case study presented in this paper includes realistic human movement scenarios: visiting uncommon locations, taking odd routes at infrequent times, uncommon time visits, and uncommon stay durations. We analyze the Reeb graph to interpret the topological structure of the GPS trajectories. Potential applications of ReeSPOT include urban planning, security surveillance, and behavioral research.</p></details> |  |

State-of-the-art human trajectory prediction methods are limited by their focus on collision avoidance and short-term planning, and their inability to model complex interactions of humans with the environment. In contrast, our approach overcomes these limitations by predicting sequences of human interactions with the environment and using this information to guide trajectory predictions over a horizon of up to 60s. We leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to predict interactions with the environment by conditioning the LLM prediction on rich contextual information about the scene. This information is given as a 3D Dynamic Scene Graph that encodes the geometry, semantics, and traversability of the environment into a hierarchical representation. We then ground these interaction sequences into multi-modal spatio-temporal distributions over human positions using a probabilistic approach based on continuous-time Markov Chains. To evaluate our approach, we introduce a new semi-synthetic dataset of long-term human trajectories in complex indoor environments, which also includes annotations of human-object interactions. We show in thorough experimental evaluations that our approach achieves a 54% lower average negative log-likelihood (NLL) and a 26.5% lower Best-of-20 displacement error compared to the best non-privileged baselines for a time horizon of 60s.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures.

Previous methods either oversimplify object shapes, which results in a sacrifice of feasible space or rely on discrete sampling, which suffers from the "tunnel effect". To address these limitations, we propose a novel hierarchical trajectory generation pipeline, which utilizes the Swept Volume Signed Distance Field (SVSDF) to guide trajectory optimization for Continuous Collision Avoidance (CCA). Our interdisciplinary approach, blending techniques from graphics and robotics, exhibits outstanding effectiveness in solving this problem. We formulate the computation of the SVSDF as a Generalized Semi-Infinite Programming model, and we solve for the numerical solutions at query points implicitly, thereby eliminating the need for explicit reconstruction of the surface. Our algorithm has been validated in a variety of complex scenarios and applies to robots of various dynamics, including both rigid and deformable shapes. It demonstrates exceptional universality and superior CCA performance compared to typical algorithms. The code will be released at https://github.com/ZJU-FAST-Lab/Implicit-SVSDF-Planner for the benefit of the community.</p></details> | <details><summary>accec...</summary><p>accecpted by SIGGRAPH2024&TOG.

Each UAV collects sensing data from the GUs and then forwards the sensing data to the remote BS. The GUs first backscatter their data to the UAVs and then all UAVs forward data to the BS by the nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA) transmissions. We formulate a multi-stage stochastic optimization problem to minimize the long-term time-averaged age-of-information (AoI) by jointly optimizing the GUs' access control, the UAVs' beamforming, and trajectory planning strategies. To solve this problem, we first model the dynamics of the GUs' AoI statuses by virtual queueing systems, and then propose the AoI-aware sensing scheduling and trajectory optimization (AoI-STO) algorithm. This allows us to transform the multi-stage AoI minimization problem into a series of per-slot control problems by using the Lyapunov optimization framework. In each time slot, the GUs' access control, the UAVs' beamforming, and mobility control strategies are updated by using the block coordinate descent (BCD) method according to the instant GUs' AoI statuses. Simulation results reveal that the proposed AoI-STO algorithm can reduce the overall AoI by more than 50%. The GUs' scheduling fairness is also improved greatly by adapting the GUs' access control compared with typical baseline schemes.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by IEEE TVT</p></details> |

By employing a cutting-edge deep learning architecture that combines autoencoders and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), our approach autonomously pinpoints critical transitional points in continuous, unlabeled motion data, thus significantly reducing dependence on extensively labeled datasets. This innovative method dynamically adjusts motion trajectories using conditional variables, significantly enhancing the flexibility and accuracy of robotic actions under dynamic conditions while also reducing the computational overhead associated with traditional robotic programming methods. Our experimental validation demonstrates superior learning efficiency and adaptability compared to existing techniques, paving the way for advanced applications in industrial and service robotics.</p></details> |  |

Despite increased attention to this issue, most approaches in trajectory prediction do not consider all of these factors sufficiently. This paper describes a method SemanticFormer to predict multimodal trajectories by reasoning over a semantic traffic scene graph using a hybrid approach. We extract high-level information in the form of semantic meta-paths from a knowledge graph which is then processed by a novel pipeline based on multiple attention mechanisms to predict accurate trajectories. The proposed architecture comprises a hierarchical heterogeneous graph encoder, which can capture spatio-temporal and relational information across agents and between agents and road elements, and a predictor that fuses the different encodings and decodes trajectories with probabilities. Finally, a refinement module evaluates permitted meta-paths of trajectories and speed profiles to obtain final predicted trajectories. Evaluation of the nuScenes benchmark demonstrates improved performance compared to the state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures, submitted to RA-L</p></details> |

Supervised neural models represent the current state-of-the-art. Recent security applications require this task to be rapidly employed in environments that may differ from the data used to train such models for which there is little training data. We provide a neuro-symbolic rule-based framework to conduct error correction and detection of these models to support eventual deployment in security applications. We provide a suite of experiments on several recent and state-of-the-art models and show an accuracy improvement of 1.7% over the SOTA model in the case where all classes are present in training and when 40% of classes are omitted from training, we obtain a 5.2% improvement (zero-shot) and 23.9% (few-shot) improvement over the SOTA model without resorting to retraining of the base model.</p></details> |  |
| **[G2LTraj: A Global-to-Local Generation Approach for Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19330v1)** | 2024-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting future trajectories of traffic agents accurately holds substantial importance in various applications such as autonomous driving. Previous methods commonly infer all future steps of an agent either recursively or simultaneously. However, the recursive strategy suffers from the accumulated error, while the simultaneous strategy overlooks the constraints among future steps, resulting in kinematically infeasible predictions. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose G2LTraj, a plug-and-play global-to-local generation approach for trajectory prediction. Specifically, we generate a series of global key steps that uniformly cover the entire future time range. Subsequently, the local intermediate steps between the adjacent key steps are recursively filled in. In this way, we prevent the accumulated error from propagating beyond the adjacent key steps. Moreover, to boost the kinematical feasibility, we not only introduce the spatial constraints among key steps but also strengthen the temporal constraints among the intermediate steps. Finally, to ensure the optimal granularity of key steps, we design a selectable granularity strategy that caters to each predicted trajectory. Our G2LTraj significantly improves the performance of seven existing trajectory predictors across the ETH, UCY and nuScenes datasets. Experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness. Code will be available at https://github.com/Zhanwei-Z/G2LTraj.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IJCAI 2024</p></details> |

Yet, many recent deep learning methods suffer from a degraded performance on the challenging scenarios, mainly because these scenarios appear less frequently in the training data. To address such a long-tail issue, existing methods force challenging scenarios closer together in the feature space during training to trigger information sharing among them for more robust learning. These methods, however, primarily rely on the motion patterns to characterize scenarios, omitting more informative contextual information, such as interactions and scene layout. We argue that exploiting such information not only improves prediction accuracy but also scene compliance of the generated trajectories. In this paper, we propose to incorporate richer training dynamics information into a prototypical contrastive learning framework. More specifically, we propose a two-stage process. First, we generate rich contextual features using a baseline encoder-decoder framework. These features are split into clusters based on the model's output errors, using the training dynamics information, and a prototype is computed within each cluster. Second, we retrain the model using the prototypes in a contrastive learning framework. We conduct empirical evaluations of our approach using two large-scale naturalistic datasets and show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance by improving accuracy and scene compliance on the long-tail samples. Furthermore, we perform experiments on a subset of the clusters to highlight the additional benefit of our approach in reducing training bias.</p></details> | <details><summary>2024 ...</summary><p>2024 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV)</p></details> |

Firstly, we extract spatial features from fighter trajectory data using CNN, aggregate spatial features of multiple fighters using the social-pooling module to capture geographic information and positional relationships in the trajectories, and use the attention mechanism to capture mutated trajectory features in air combat; subsequently, we extract temporal features by using the memory nature of LSTM to capture long-term temporal dependence in the trajectories; and finally, we merge the temporal and spatial features to predict the flight trajectories of enemy fighters. Extensive simulation experiments verify that the proposed method improves the trajectory prediction accuracy compared to the original CNN-LSTM method, with the improvements of 32% and 34% in ADE and FDE indicators.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Non-autoregressive Multi-Horizon Flight Trajectory Prediction Framework with Gray Code Representation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.01658v3)** | 2024-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Flight Trajectory Prediction (FTP) is an essential task in Air Traffic Control (ATC), which can assist air traffic controllers in managing airspace more safely and efficiently. Existing approaches generally perform multi-horizon FTP tasks in an autoregressive manner, thereby suffering from error accumulation and low-efficiency problems. In this paper, a novel framework, called FlightBERT++, is proposed to i) forecast multi-horizon flight trajectories directly in a non-autoregressive way, and ii) improve the limitation of the binary encoding (BE) representation in the FlightBERT framework. Specifically, the proposed framework is implemented by a generalized encoder-decoder architecture, in which the encoder learns the temporal-spatial patterns from historical observations and the decoder predicts the flight status for the future horizons. Compared to conventional architecture, an innovative horizon-aware contexts generator is dedicatedly designed to consider the prior horizon information, which further enables non-autoregressive multi-horizon prediction. Additionally, the Gray code representation and the differential prediction paradigm are designed to cope with the high-bit misclassifications of the BE representation, which significantly reduces the outliers in the predictions. Moreover, a differential prompted decoder is proposed to enhance the capability of the differential predictions by leveraging the stationarity of the differential sequence. Extensive experiments are conducted to validate the proposed framework on a real-world flight trajectory dataset. The experimental results demonstrated that the proposed framework outperformed the competitive baselines in both FTP performance and computational efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>An ex...</summary><p>An extend version based on the AAAI version</p></details> |

Although recent studies have demonstrated the advantages of achieving map-constrained trajectory recovery via an end-to-end manner, they still face two significant challenges. Firstly, existing methods are mostly sequence-based models. It is extremely hard for them to comprehensively capture the micro-semantics of individual trajectory, including the information of each GPS point and the movement between two GPS points. Secondly, existing approaches ignore the impact of the macro-semantics, i.e., the road conditions and the people's shared travel preferences reflected by a group of trajectories. To address the above challenges, we propose a Micro-Macro Spatial-Temporal Graph-based Encoder-Decoder (MM-STGED). Specifically, we model each trajectory as a graph to efficiently describe the micro-semantics of trajectory and design a novel message-passing mechanism to learn trajectory representations. Additionally, we extract the macro-semantics of trajectories and further incorporate them into a well-designed graph-based decoder to guide trajectory recovery. Extensive experiments conducted on sparse trajectories with three different sampling intervals that are respectively constructed from two real-world trajectory datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed model.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted as a regular paper at IEEE TKDE</p></details> |

This paper seeks to compute trajectory plans for which a robot is guaranteed to reach a goal and to avoid obstacles in the specific near-danger case, also known as a narrow gap, where the agent starts near the goal, but must navigate through tight obstacles that block its path. The proposed method builds off of a common approach of using a simplified planning model to generate plans, which are then tracked using a high-fidelity tracking model and controller. Existing safe planning approaches use reachability analysis to overapproximate the error between these models, but this introduces additional numerical approximation error and thereby conservativeness that prevents goal-reaching. The present work instead proposes a Piecewise Affine Reach-avoid Computation (PARC) method to tightly approximate the reachable set of the planning model. PARC significantly reduces conservativeness through a careful choice of the planning model and set representation, along with an effective approach to handling time-varying tracking errors. The utility of this method is demonstrated through extensive numerical experiments in which PARC outperforms state-of-the-art reach-avoid methods in near-danger goal-reaching. Furthermore, in a simulated demonstration, PARC enables the generation of provably-safe extreme vehicle dynamics drift parking maneuvers. A preliminary hardware demo on a TurtleBot3 also validates the method.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The first two authors contributed equally to the work.

Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) leveraging environmental information to achieve three-dimension collision-free trajectory planning is the prerequisite to ensure airspace security. However, the timely information of surrounding situation is difficult to acquire by UAVs, which further brings security risks. As a mature technology leveraged in traditional civil aviation, the automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast (ADS-B) realizes continuous surveillance of the information of aircrafts. Consequently, we leverage ADS-B for surveillance and information broadcasting, and divide the aerial airspace into multiple sub-airspaces to improve flight safety in UAV trajectory planning. In detail, we propose the secure sub-airspaces planning (SSP) algorithm and particle swarm optimization rapidly-exploring random trees (PSO-RRT) algorithm for the UAV trajectory planning in law-altitude airspace. The performance of the proposed algorithm is verified by simulations and the results show that SSP reduces both the maximum number of UAVs in the sub-airspace and the length of the trajectory, and PSO-RRT reduces the cost of UAV trajectory in the sub-airspace.</p></details> |  |

The agent's goal is to explore the environment and gather information subject to its resource constraints in unknown, partially observable environments. The challenge lies in reasoning about the effects of sensing and movement while respecting the agent's resource and dynamic constraints. We formulate the problem as a trajectory optimization problem and solve it using a projection-based trajectory optimization approach where the objective is to reduce the variance of the Gaussian process world belief. Our approach outperforms previous approaches in long horizon trajectories by achieving an overall variance reduction of up to 85% and reducing the root-mean square error in the environment belief by 50%.

However, existing methods for detecting deepfakes primarily focus on uncompressed videos, such as noise characteristics, local textures, or frequency statistics. When applied to compressed videos, these methods experience a decrease in detection performance and are less suitable for real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose a deepfake video detection method based on 3D spatiotemporal trajectories. Specifically, we utilize a robust 3D model to construct spatiotemporal motion features, integrating feature details from both 2D and 3D frames to mitigate the influence of large head rotation angles or insufficient lighting within frames. Furthermore, we separate facial expressions from head movements and design a sequential analysis method based on phase space motion trajectories to explore the feature differences between genuine and fake faces in deepfake videos. We conduct extensive experiments to validate the performance of our proposed method on several compressed deepfake benchmarks. The robustness of the well-designed features is verified by calculating the consistent distribution of facial landmarks before and after video compression.Our method yields satisfactory results and showcases its potential for practical applications.</p></details> |  |

Developing models for this task requires rich datasets containing diverse sets of samples. However, the existing naturalistic trajectory prediction datasets are generally imbalanced in favor of simpler samples and lack challenging scenarios. Such a long-tail effect causes prediction models to underperform on the tail portion of the data distribution containing safety-critical scenarios. Previous methods tackle the long-tail problem using methods such as contrastive learning and class-conditioned hypernetworks. These approaches, however, are not modular and cannot be applied to many machine learning architectures. In this work, we propose a modular model-agnostic framework for trajectory prediction that leverages a specialized mixture of experts. In our approach, each expert is trained with a specialized skill with respect to a particular part of the data. To produce predictions, we utilise a router network that selects the best expert by generating relative confidence scores. We conduct experimentation on common pedestrian trajectory prediction datasets and show that our method improves performance on long-tail scenarios. We further conduct ablation studies to highlight the contribution of different proposed components.</p></details> |  |

Further, it allows automated analysis of recorded motion data. Many clustering algorithms for trajectories build upon distance metrics that are based on pointwise Euclidean distances. However, our work indicates that focusing on salient characteristics is often sufficient. We present a novel distance measure for motion plans consisting of state and control trajectories that is based on a compressed representation built from their main features. This approach allows a flexible choice of feature classes relevant to the respective task. The distance measure is used in agglomerative hierarchical clustering. We compare our method with the widely used dynamic time warping algorithm on test sets of motion plans for the Furuta pendulum and the Manutec robot arm and on real-world data from a human motion dataset.

Insufficient regularization to uphold this stability often results in fluctuations in kinematic states, leading to inconsistent predictions and the amplification of errors. In this study, we introduce a framework called Multi-Agent Trajectory prediction via neural interaction Energy (MATE). This framework assesses the interactive motion of agents by employing neural interaction energy, which captures the dynamics of interactions and illustrates their influence on the future trajectories of agents. To bolster temporal stability, we introduce two constraints: inter-agent interaction constraint and intra-agent motion constraint. These constraints work together to ensure temporal stability at both the system and agent levels, effectively mitigating prediction fluctuations inherent in multi-agent systems. Comparative evaluations against previous methods on four diverse datasets highlight the superior prediction accuracy and generalization capabilities of our model.</p></details> |  |

This task is of major importance across multiple disciplines, in which also sequences like trajectories can be considered as a group. As groups become more diverse in heterogeneity and size, detecting group anomalies becomes challenging, especially without supervision. Though Recurrent Neural Networks are well established deep sequence models, their performance can decrease with increasing sequence lengths. Hence, this paper introduces GADformer, a BERT-based model for attention-driven GAD on trajectories in unsupervised and semi-supervised settings. We demonstrate how group anomalies can be detected by attention-based GAD. We also introduce the Block-Attention-anomaly-Score (BAS) to enhance model transparency by scoring attention patterns. In addition to that, synthetic trajectory generation allows various ablation studies. In extensive experiments we investigate our approach versus related works in their robustness for trajectory noise and novelties on synthetic data and three real world datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted at International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN) 2024, Yokohama, Japan</p></details> |

They generate 3D box candidates from the first-stage dense detector, followed by different temporal aggregation methods. However, these approaches require per-frame objects or whole point clouds, posing challenges related to memory bank utilization. Moreover, point clouds and trajectory features are combined solely based on concatenation, which may neglect effective interactions between them. In this paper, we propose a point-trajectory transformer with long short-term memory for efficient temporal 3D object detection. To this end, we only utilize point clouds of current-frame objects and their historical trajectories as input to minimize the memory bank storage requirement. Furthermore, we introduce modules to encode trajectory features, focusing on long short-term and future-aware perspectives, and then effectively aggregate them with point cloud features.

The framework utilizes spatiotemporal occupancy grid maps (SOGM), which forecast the occupancy status of neighboring space in the near future, as the environment representation. Based on this representation, we extend the kinodynamic A* and the corridor-constrained trajectory optimization algorithms to efficiently tackle static and dynamic obstacles with arbitrary shapes.

| **[Learning Generalizable Tool-use Skills through Trajectory Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00156v4)** | 2024-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous systems that efficiently utilize tools can assist humans in completing many common tasks such as cooking and cleaning. However, current systems fall short of matching human-level of intelligence in terms of adapting to novel tools. Prior works based on affordance often make strong assumptions about the environments and cannot scale to more complex, contact-rich tasks. In this work, we tackle this challenge and explore how agents can learn to use previously unseen tools to manipulate deformable objects. We propose to learn a generative model of the tool-use trajectories as a sequence of tool point clouds, which generalizes to different tool shapes. Given any novel tool, we first generate a tool-use trajectory and then optimize the sequence of tool poses to align with the generated trajectory. We train a single model on four different challenging deformable object manipulation tasks, using demonstration data from only one tool per task. The model generalizes to various novel tools, significantly outperforming baselines. We further test our trained policy in the real world with unseen tools, where it achieves the performance comparable to human.

As a part of ITS, Vehicle Trajectory Prediction (VTP) aims to forecast a vehicle's future positions based on its past and current movements. VTP is a pivotal element for road safety, aiding in applications such as traffic management, accident prevention, work-zone safety, and energy optimization. While most works in this field focus on autonomous driving, with the growing number of surveillance cameras, another sub-field emerges for surveillance VTP with its own set of challenges. In this paper, we introduce VT-Former, a novel transformer-based VTP approach for highway safety and surveillance. In addition to utilizing transformers to capture long-range temporal patterns, a new Graph Attentive Tokenization (GAT) module has been proposed to capture intricate social interactions among vehicles. This study seeks to explore both the advantages and the limitations inherent in combining transformer architecture with graphs for VTP. Our investigation, conducted across three benchmark datasets from diverse surveillance viewpoints, showcases the State-of-the-Art (SotA) or comparable performance of VT-Former in predicting vehicle trajectories. This study underscores the potential of VT-Former and its architecture, opening new avenues for future research and exploration.</p></details> | <details><summary>Compl...</summary><p>Completely updated based on the reviews received for the paper</p></details> |

However, NeRF heavily relies on precise camera poses. While recent works like BARF have introduced camera pose optimization within NeRF, their applicability is limited to simple trajectory scenes. Existing methods struggle while tackling complex trajectories involving large rotations. To address this limitation, we propose CT-NeRF, an incremental reconstruction optimization pipeline using only RGB images without pose and depth input. In this pipeline, we first propose a local-global bundle adjustment under a pose graph connecting neighboring frames to enforce the consistency between poses to escape the local minima caused by only pose consistency with the scene structure. Further, we instantiate the consistency between poses as a reprojected geometric image distance constraint resulting from pixel-level correspondences between input image pairs. Through the incremental reconstruction, CT-NeRF enables the recovery of both camera poses and scene structure and is capable of handling scenes with complex trajectories. We evaluate the performance of CT-NeRF on two real-world datasets, NeRFBuster and Free-Dataset, which feature complex trajectories. Results show CT-NeRF outperforms existing methods in novel view synthesis and pose estimation accuracy.</p></details> |  |

The trajectory-based alignment, typically modeled as a classic hand-eye calibration, significantly influences the accuracy of evaluation metrics. However, traditional calibration methods are susceptible to the quality of the input poses. Few studies have taken this into account when evaluating VO/VIO trajectories that usually suffer from noise and drift. To fill this gap, we propose a novel spatiotemporal hand-eye calibration algorithm that fully leverages multiple constraints from screw theory for enhanced accuracy and robustness. Experimental results show that our algorithm has better performance and is less noise-prone than state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 9 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

However, existing trajectory generation methods are still in their infancy due to the inherent diversity and unpredictability of human activities, grappling with issues such as fidelity, flexibility, and generalizability. To overcome these obstacles, we propose ControlTraj, a Controllable Trajectory generation framework with the topology-constrained diffusion model. Distinct from prior approaches, ControlTraj utilizes a diffusion model to generate high-fidelity trajectories while integrating the structural constraints of road network topology to guide the geographical outcomes. Specifically, we develop a novel road segment autoencoder to extract fine-grained road segment embedding. The encoded features, along with trip attributes, are subsequently merged into the proposed geographic denoising UNet architecture, named GeoUNet, to synthesize geographic trajectories from white noise. Through experimentation across three real-world data settings, ControlTraj demonstrates its ability to produce human-directed, high-fidelity trajectory generation with adaptability to unexplored geographical contexts.</p></details> |  |
| **[UVTM: Universal Vehicle Trajectory Modeling with ST Feature Domain Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07232v3)** | 2024-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vehicle movement is frequently captured in the form of trajectories, i.e., sequences of timestamped locations. Numerous methods exist that target different tasks involving trajectories such as travel-time estimation, trajectory recovery, and trajectory prediction. However, most methods target only one specific task and cannot be applied universally. Existing efforts to create a universal trajectory model often involve adding prediction modules for adapting to different tasks, while also struggle with incomplete or sparse trajectories. To address these shortcomings, we propose the Universal Vehicle Trajectory Model (UVTM) designed to support different tasks based on incomplete or sparse trajectories without the need for retraining or extra prediction modules. To addresses task adaptability on incomplete trajectories, UVTM divide the spatio-temporal features of trajectories into three distinct domains. Each domain can be masked and generated independently to suit the input and output needs of specific tasks. To handle sparse trajectories effectively, UVTM is pre-trained by reconstructing densely sampled trajectories from sparsely sampled ones, allowing it to extract detailed spatio-temporal information from sparse trajectories. Experiments involving three representative trajectory-related tasks on two real-world vehicle trajectory datasets provide insight into the intended properties performance of UVTM and offer evidence that UVTM is capable of meeting its objectives.</p></details> |  |

These data offer us vital insights to understand the movements of individuals and populations, benefiting a broad range of applications from transportation planning to epidemic modeling. However, improper release of trajectory data is increasing concerns on individual privacy. Previous attempts either lack strong privacy guarantees, or fail to preserve sufficient basic characteristics of the original data. In this paper, we propose DPTraj-PM, a method to synthesize trajectory dataset under the differential privacy (DP) framework while ensures high data utility. Based on the assumption that an individual's trajectory could be mainly determined by the initial trajectory segment (which depicts the starting point and the initial direction) and the next location point, DPTraj-PM discretizes the raw trajectories into neighboring cells, and models them by combining a prefix tree structure and an m-order Markov process. After adding noise to the model under differential privacy, DPTraj-PM generates a synthetic dataset from the noisy model to enable a wider spectrum of data mining and modeling tasks. The output traces crafted by DPTraj-PM not only preserves the patterns and variability in individuals' mobility behaviors, but also protects individual privacy. Experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate that DPTraj-PM substantially outperforms the state-of-the-art techniques in terms of data utility. Our code is available at https://github.com/wnn5/DP-PrefixTreeMarkov.</p></details> |  |

Nevertheless, existing studies typically ignore the confounding effects of geospatial context, leading to the acquisition of spurious correlations and limited generalization capabilities. To bridge this gap, we initially formulate a Structural Causal Model (SCM) to decipher the trajectory representation learning process from a causal perspective. Building upon the SCM, we further present a Trajectory modeling framework (TrajCL) based on Causal Learning, which leverages the backdoor adjustment theory as an intervention tool to eliminate the spurious correlations between geospatial context and trajectories. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets verify that TrajCL markedly enhances performance in trajectory classification tasks while showcasing superior generalization and interpretability.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper has been accepted by IJCAI 2024</p></details> |

Current distillation techniques often dichotomize into two distinct aspects: i) ODE Trajectory Preservation; and ii) ODE Trajectory Reformulation. However, these approaches suffer from severe performance degradation or domain shifts. To address these limitations, we propose Hyper-SD, a novel framework that synergistically amalgamates the advantages of ODE Trajectory Preservation and Reformulation, while maintaining near-lossless performance during step compression. Firstly, we introduce Trajectory Segmented Consistency Distillation to progressively perform consistent distillation within pre-defined time-step segments, which facilitates the preservation of the original ODE trajectory from a higher-order perspective. Secondly, we incorporate human feedback learning to boost the performance of the model in a low-step regime and mitigate the performance loss incurred by the distillation process. Thirdly, we integrate score distillation to further improve the low-step generation capability of the model and offer the first attempt to leverage a unified LoRA to support the inference process at all steps. Extensive experiments and user studies demonstrate that Hyper-SD achieves SOTA performance from 1 to 8 inference steps for both SDXL and SD1.5. For example, Hyper-SDXL surpasses SDXL-Lightning by +0.68 in CLIP Score and +0.51 in Aes Score in the 1-step inference.</p></details> |  |

The base transcription algorithm for which we establish the refinement algorithm is a $\textit{direct multiple shooting technique}$ -- $\mathsf{QuITO}$ $\textsf{v.2}$ (Quasi-Interpolation based Trajectory Optimization). The mesh refinement technique consists of two steps -- localization of certain irregular regions in an optimal control trajectory via wavelets, followed by a targeted $h$-refinement approach around such regions of irregularity. Theoretical approximation guarantees on uniform grids are presented for optimal controls with certain regularity properties along with guarantees of localization of change points by wavelet transform. Numerical illustrations are provided for control profiles involving discontinuities to show the effectiveness of the localization and refinement strategy.

We consider the case of SGD without replacement, the variant typically used to optimize large-scale neural networks. We analyze this algorithm in a more realistic regime than typically considered in theoretical works on SGD, as, e.g., we allow the product of the learning rate and Hessian to be $O(1)$ and we do not specify any model architecture, learning task, or loss (objective) function. Our core theoretical result is that optimizing with SGD without replacement is locally equivalent to making an additional step on a novel regularizer. This implies that the expected trajectories of SGD without replacement can be decoupled in (i) following SGD with replacement (in which batches are sampled i.i.d.) along the directions of high curvature, and (ii) regularizing the trace of the noise covariance along the flat ones. As a consequence, SGD without replacement travels flat areas and may escape saddles significantly faster than SGD with replacement. On several vision tasks, the novel regularizer penalizes a weighted trace of the Fisher Matrix, thus encouraging sparsity in the spectrum of the Hessian of the loss in line with empirical observations from prior work. We also propose an explanation for why SGD does not train at the edge of stability (as opposed to GD).</p></details> | 69 pages, 6 figures |

Current research predominantly focuses on traditional deep learning methods, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs). These methods leverage relative distances to forecast the motion trajectories of a single class of agents. However, in complex traffic scenarios, the motion patterns of various types of traffic participants exhibit inherent randomness and uncertainty. Relying solely on relative distances may not adequately capture the nuanced interaction patterns between different classes of road users. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-class trajectory prediction method named the social force embedded mixed graph convolutional network (SFEM-GCN). SFEM-GCN comprises three graph topologies: the semantic graph (SG), position graph (PG), and velocity graph (VG). These graphs encode various of social force relationships among different classes of agents in complex scenes. Specifically, SG utilizes one-hot encoding of agent-class information to guide the construction of graph adjacency matrices based on semantic information. PG and VG create adjacency matrices to capture motion interaction relationships between different classes agents. These graph structures are then integrated into a mixed graph, where learning is conducted using a spatiotemporal graph convolutional neural network (ST-GCNN). To further enhance prediction performance, we adopt temporal convolutional networks (TCNs) to generate the predicted trajectory with fewer parameters. Experimental results on publicly available datasets demonstrate that SFEM-GCN surpasses state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and robustness.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages,3 figures, published to IEEE Transactions on Intelligent vehicles</p></details> |

Then, we combine the trajectories within the same cluster through geometrical transformation to create new trajectories. These trajectories are then added to the training dataset, provided that they meet our specified safety-related criteria. Our experiments exhibit that training an imitation learning model using these augmented trajectories can significantly improve closed-loop performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to 35th IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium, 2024</p></details> |

However, it presents unique challenges, due to the complex roadway layout at intersections, involvement of traffic signal controls, and interactions among different types of road users. To address these issues, we present in this paper a novel model called Knowledge-Informed Generative Adversarial Network (KI-GAN), which integrates both traffic signal information and multi-vehicle interactions to predict vehicle trajectories accurately. Additionally, we propose a specialized attention pooling method that accounts for vehicle orientation and proximity at intersections. Based on the SinD dataset, our KI-GAN model is able to achieve an Average Displacement Error (ADE) of 0.05 and a Final Displacement Error (FDE) of 0.12 for a 6-second observation and 6-second prediction cycle. When the prediction window is extended to 9 seconds, the ADE and FDE values are further reduced to 0.11 and 0.26, respectively. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed KI-GAN model in vehicle trajectory prediction under complex scenarios at signalized intersections, which represents a significant advancement in the target field.</p></details> | <details><summary>2024 ...</summary><p>2024 CVPR AICity Workshop</p></details> |

While many models have been developed towards this end, effectively capturing and predicting the variability inherent to human behavior still remains an open challenge. This paper proposes TrajFlow - a new approach for probabilistic trajectory prediction based on Normalizing Flows. We reformulate the problem of capturing distributions over trajectories into capturing distributions over abstracted trajectory features using an autoencoder, simplifying the learning task of the Normalizing Flows. TrajFlow outperforms state-of-the-art behavior prediction models in capturing full trajectory distributions in two synthetic benchmarks with known true distributions, and is competitive on the naturalistic datasets ETH/UCY, rounD, and nuScenes. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of TrajFlow in probabilistic prediction of human behavior.</p></details> |  |

This paper addresses two issues: the lack of labeled data and the difficulty of explaining the predictions of a neural network. To this end, we present a framework called uTRAND, that shifts the problem of anomalous trajectory prediction from the pixel space to a semantic-topological domain. The framework detects and tracks all types of traffic agents in bird's-eye-view videos of traffic cameras mounted at an intersection. By conceptualizing the intersection as a patch-based graph, it is shown that the framework learns and models the normal behaviour of traffic agents without costly manual labeling. Furthermore, uTRAND allows to formulate simple rules to classify anomalous trajectories in a way suited for human interpretation. We show that uTRAND outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches on a dataset of anomalous trajectories collected in a real-world setting, while producing explainable detection results.</p></details> |  |

The trajectory prediction models based on the neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Previous attack methods have achieved high attack success rates but overlook the adaptability to realistic scenarios and the concealment of the deceits. To address this problem, we propose a speed-adaptive stealthy adversarial attack method named SA-Attack. This method searches the sensitive region of trajectory prediction models and generates the adversarial trajectories by using the vehicle-following method and incorporating information about forthcoming trajectories. Our method has the ability to adapt to different speed scenarios by reconstructing the trajectory from scratch. Fusing future trajectory trends and curvature constraints can guarantee the smoothness of adversarial trajectories, further ensuring the stealthiness of attacks. The empirical study on the datasets of nuScenes and Apolloscape demonstrates the attack performance of our proposed method.

The system utilizes information presently accessible to customers through smartphones and retail apps: motion data, store map, and purchase records. The approach eliminates the need for additional hardware installations/maintenance and ensures customers maintain full control of their data. Specifically, RetailOpt first employs inertial navigation to recover relative trajectories from smartphone motion data. The store map and purchase records are then cross-referenced to identify a list of visited shelves, providing anchors to localize the relative trajectories in a store through continuous and discrete optimization. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our system through systematic experiments in five diverse environments. The proposed system, if successful, would produce accurate customer movement data, essential for a broad range of retail applications, including customer behavior analysis and in-store navigation. The potential application could also extend to other domains such as entertainment and assistive technologies.</p></details> |  |

Forward application of the model yields so called imagined trajectories (sequences of action, predicted state-reward) used to optimize the set of candidate actions that maximize expected reward. The outcome, an ideal imagined trajectory or plan, is imperfect and typically MBRL relies on model predictive control (MPC) to overcome this by continuously re-planning from scratch, incurring thus major computational cost and increasing complexity in tasks with longer receding horizon. We propose uncertainty estimation methods for online evaluation of imagined trajectories to assess whether further planned actions can be trusted to deliver acceptable reward. These methods include comparing the error after performing the last action with the standard expected error and using model uncertainty to assess the deviation from expected outcomes. Additionally, we introduce methods that exploit the forward propagation of the dynamics model to evaluate if the remainder of the plan aligns with expected results and assess the remainder of the plan in terms of the expected reward. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed uncertainty estimation methods by applying them to avoid unnecessary trajectory replanning in a shooting MBRL setting. Results highlight significant reduction on computational costs without sacrificing performance.</p></details> |  |

In scenarios where online interactions are impractical, offline RL, which trains the agent using pre-collected datasets, has become popular. While this new paradigm presents remarkable effectiveness across various real-world domains, like healthcare and energy management, there is a growing demand to enable agents to rapidly and completely eliminate the influence of specific trajectories from both the training dataset and the trained agents. To meet this problem, this paper advocates Trajdeleter, the first practical approach to trajectory unlearning for offline RL agents. The key idea of Trajdeleter is to guide the agent to demonstrate deteriorating performance when it encounters states associated with unlearning trajectories. Simultaneously, it ensures the agent maintains its original performance level when facing other remaining trajectories. Additionally, we introduce Trajauditor, a simple yet efficient method to evaluate whether Trajdeleter successfully eliminates the specific trajectories of influence from the offline RL agent. Extensive experiments conducted on six offline RL algorithms and three tasks demonstrate that Trajdeleter requires only about 1.5% of the time needed for retraining from scratch. It effectively unlearns an average of 94.8% of the targeted trajectories yet still performs well in actual environment interactions after unlearning. The replication package and agent parameters are available online.</p></details> | 22 pages |

To effectively utilize this data, it is essential to accurately match the geolocation data to the road segments. However, this matching is often not trivial due to the low sampling rate and errors exacerbated by multipath effects in urban environments. Traditionally, statistical modeling techniques such as Hidden-Markov models incorporating domain knowledge into the matching process have been extensively used for map-matching tasks. However, rule-based map-matching tasks are noise-sensitive and inefficient in processing large-scale trajectory data. Deep learning techniques directly learn the relationship between observed data and road networks from the data, often without the need for hand-crafted rules or domain knowledge. This renders them an efficient approach for map-matching large-scale datasets and makes them more robust to the noise. This paper introduces a sequence-to-sequence deep-learning model, specifically the transformer-based encoder-decoder model, to perform as a surrogate for map-matching algorithms. The encoder-decoder architecture initially encodes the series of noisy GPS points into a representation that automatically captures autoregressive behavior and spatial correlations between GPS points. Subsequently, the decoder associates data points with the road network features and thus transforms these representations into a sequence of road segments. The model is trained and evaluated using GPS traces collected in Manhattan, New York. Achieving an accuracy of 76%, transformer-based encoder-decoder models extensively employed in natural language processing presented a promising performance for translating noisy GPS data to the navigated routes in urban road networks.</p></details> | 14 pages, 10 figures |

The primary focus of their research is to ensure safety, comfort, and efficiency. An autonomous vehicle has several modules responsible for one or more of the aforementioned items. Among these modules, the trajectory planner plays a pivotal role in the safety of the vehicle and the comfort of its passengers. The module is also responsible for respecting kinematic constraints and any applicable road constraints. In this paper, a novel online spatial-temporal graph trajectory planner is introduced to generate safe and comfortable trajectories. First, a spatial-temporal graph is constructed using the autonomous vehicle, its surrounding vehicles, and virtual nodes along the road with respect to the vehicle itself. Next, the graph is forwarded into a sequential network to obtain the desired states. To support the planner, a simple behavioral layer is also presented that determines kinematic constraints for the planner. Furthermore, a novel potential function is also proposed to train the network. Finally, the proposed planner is tested on three different complex driving tasks, and the performance is compared with two frequently used methods. The results show that the proposed planner generates safe and feasible trajectories while achieving similar or longer distances in the forward direction and comparable comfort ride.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is the accepted version and published in the "Early Access" area of IEEE Xplore for the IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles on 16 April 2024.

The field of motion prediction has seen large progress recently with state-of-the-Art (sotA) models achieving impressive results on large-scale public benchmarks. However, recent work revealed that learning-based methods are prone to predict off-road trajectories in challenging scenarios. These can be created by perturbing existing scenarios with additional turns in front of the target vehicle while the motion history is left unchanged. We argue that this indicates that SotA models do not consider the map information sufficiently and demonstrate how this can be solved by representing model inputs and outputs in a Frenet frame defined by lane centreline sequences. To this end, we present a general wrapper that leverages a Frenet representation of the scene, and that can be applied to SotA models without changing their architecture. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in a comprehensive benchmark using two SotA motion prediction models. Our experiments show that this reduces the off-road rate on challenging scenarios by more than 90% without sacrificing average performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[S4TP: Social-Suitable and Safety-Sensitive Trajectory Planning for Autonomous Vehicles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11946v1)** | 2024-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In public roads, autonomous vehicles (AVs) face the challenge of frequent interactions with human-driven vehicles (HDVs), which render uncertain driving behavior due to varying social characteristics among humans. To effectively assess the risks prevailing in the vicinity of AVs in social interactive traffic scenarios and achieve safe autonomous driving, this article proposes a social-suitable and safety-sensitive trajectory planning (S4TP) framework. Specifically, S4TP integrates the Social-Aware Trajectory Prediction (SATP) and Social-Aware Driving Risk Field (SADRF) modules. SATP utilizes Transformers to effectively encode the driving scene and incorporates an AV's planned trajectory during the prediction decoding process. SADRF assesses the expected surrounding risk degrees during AVs-HDVs interactions, each with different social characteristics, visualized as two-dimensional heat maps centered on the AV. SADRF models the driving intentions of the surrounding HDVs and predicts trajectories based on the representation of vehicular interactions. S4TP employs an optimization-based approach for motion planning, utilizing the predicted HDVs'trajectories as input. With the integration of SADRF, S4TP executes real-time online optimization of the planned trajectory of AV within lowrisk regions, thus improving the safety and the interpretability of the planned trajectory. We have conducted comprehensive tests of the proposed method using the SMARTS simulator. Experimental results in complex social scenarios, such as unprotected left turn intersections, merging, cruising, and overtaking, validate the superiority of our proposed S4TP in terms of safety and rationality. S4TP achieves a pass rate of 100% across all scenarios, surpassing the current state-of-the-art methods Fanta of 98.25% and Predictive-Decision of 94.75%.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages,4 figures, published to IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles</p></details> |

However, providing suitable assistance in real-world walking scenarios which involve changing terrain remains challenging. Recent research suggests that forecasting the lower limb joint's angles could provide target trajectories for exoskeletons and prostheses, and the performance could be improved with visual information. In this letter, We share a real-world dataset of 10 healthy subjects walking through five common types of terrain with stride-level label. We design a network called Sandwich Fusion Transformer for Image and Kinematics (SFTIK), which predicts the thigh angle of the ensuing stride given the terrain images at the beginning of the preceding and the ensuing stride and the IMU time series during the preceding stride. We introduce width-level patchify, tailored for egocentric terrain images, to reduce the computational demands. We demonstrate the proposed sandwich input and fusion mechanism could significantly improve the forecasting performance. Overall, the SFTIK outperforms baseline methods, achieving a computational efficiency of 3.31 G Flops, and root mean square error (RMSE) of 3.445 \textpm \ 0.804\textdegree \ and Pearson's correlation coefficient (PCC) of 0.971 \textpm\ 0.025. The results demonstrate that SFTIK could forecast the thigh's angle accurately with low computational cost, which could serve as a terrain adaptive trajectory planning method for hip exoskeletons.

This paper presents a first such comparison study of the variants Potential-Quick RRT* (PQ-RRT*), Informed RRT* (IRRT*), RRT*, and RRT, in maritime single-query nonholonomic motion planning. Additionally, the practicalities of using these algorithms in maritime environments are discussed and outlined. We also contend that these algorithms are beneficial not only for trajectory planning in Collision Avoidance Systems (CAS) but also for CAS verification when used as vessel behavior generators. Optimal RRT variants tend to produce more distance-optimal paths but require more computational time due to complex tree wiring and nearest neighbor searches. Our findings, supported by Welch`s t-test at a significance level of Alpha = 0.05, indicate that PQ-RRT* slightly outperform IRRT* and RRT* in achieving shorter trajectory length but at the expense of higher tuning complexity and longer run-times. Based on the results, we argue that these RRT algorithms are better suited for smaller-scale problems or environments with low obstacle congestion ratio. This is attributed to the curse of dimensionality, and trade-off with available memory and computational resources.</p></details> |  |
| **[Real-Time Trajectory Synthesis with Local Differential Privacy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11450v1)** | 2024-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory streams are being generated from location-aware devices, such as smartphones and in-vehicle navigation systems. Due to the sensitive nature of the location data, directly sharing user trajectories suffers from privacy leakage issues. Local differential privacy (LDP), which perturbs sensitive data on the user side before it is shared or analyzed, emerges as a promising solution for private trajectory stream collection and analysis. Unfortunately, existing stream release approaches often neglect the rich spatial-temporal context information within trajectory streams, resulting in suboptimal utility and limited types of downstream applications. To this end, we propose RetraSyn, a novel real-time trajectory synthesis framework, which is able to perform on-the-fly trajectory synthesis based on the mobility patterns privately extracted from users' trajectory streams. Thus, the downstream trajectory analysis can be performed on the high-utility synthesized data with privacy protection. We also take the genuine behaviors of real-world mobile travelers into consideration, ensuring authenticity and practicality. The key components of RetraSyn include the global mobility model, dynamic mobility update mechanism, real-time synthesis, and adaptive allocation strategy. We conduct extensive experiments on multiple real-world and synthetic trajectory datasets under various location-based utility metrics, encompassing both streaming and historical scenarios. The empirical results demonstrate the superiority and versatility of our proposed framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICDE 2024.

Despite the recent advances in data-driven approaches, grasping remains an unsolved problem. Most of the works on this task are relying on priors and heavy constraints to avoid the exploration problem. Novelty Search (NS) refers to evolutionary algorithms that replace selection of best performing individuals with selection of the most novel ones. Such methods have already shown promising results on hard exploration problems. In this work, we introduce a new NS-based method that can generate large datasets of grasping trajectories in a platform-agnostic manner. Inspired by the hierarchical learning paradigm, our method decouples approach and prehension to make the behavioral space smoother. Experiments conducted on 3 different robot-gripper setups and on several standard objects shows that our method outperforms state-of-the-art for generating diverse repertoire of grasping trajectories, getting a higher successful run ratio, as well as a better diversity for both approach and prehension. Some of the generated solutions have been successfully deployed on a real robot, showing the exploitability of the obtained repertoires.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 6 figures.

Yet, existing models often fail to fully leverage the non-verbal social cues human subconsciously communicate when navigating the space. To address this, we introduce Social-Transmotion, a generic Transformer-based model that exploits diverse and numerous visual cues to predict human behavior. We translate the idea of a prompt from Natural Language Processing (NLP) to the task of human trajectory prediction, where a prompt can be a sequence of x-y coordinates on the ground, bounding boxes in the image plane, or body pose keypoints in either 2D or 3D. This, in turn, augments trajectory data, leading to enhanced human trajectory prediction. Using masking technique, our model exhibits flexibility and adaptability by capturing spatiotemporal interactions between agents based on the available visual cues. We delve into the merits of using 2D versus 3D poses, and a limited set of poses. Additionally, we investigate the spatial and temporal attention map to identify which keypoints and time-steps in the sequence are vital for optimizing human trajectory prediction. Our approach is validated on multiple datasets, including JTA, JRDB, Pedestrians and Cyclists in Road Traffic, and ETH-UCY.

The method utilizes swarming dynamics to simulate the motion of virtual agents along the stress produced in a loaded part. Agent trajectories are then used as print trajectories. With this approach, the complex global trajectory generation problem is subdivided into a set of sequential and computationally efficient quadratic programs. Through comprehensive evaluations in both simulation and experiments, we compare our method with state-of-the-art approaches. Our results highlight a remarkable improvement in computational efficiency, achieving a 115x faster computation speed than existing methods. This efficiency, combined with the possibility to tune the trajectories spacing to match the deposition process constraints, makes the potential integration of our approach into existing 3D printing processes seamless. Additionally, the open-hole tensile specimen produced on a conventional fused filament fabrication set-up with our algorithm achieve a notable ~10% improvement in specific modulus compared to existing trajectory optimization methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be submitted to IEEE Access</p></details> |

If the opposing vehicles do not react to the ego vehicle, they can be predicted accurately. However, if there is interaction between the vehicles, the prediction loses its validity. For high interaction, instead of a planning approach that reacts exclusively to the fixed prediction, a trajectory planning approach is required that incorporates the interaction with the opposing vehicles. This paper demonstrates the limitations of a widely used conventional sampling-based approach within a highly interactive blocking scenario. We show that high success rates are achieved for less aggressive blocking behavior but that the collision rate increases with more significant interaction. We further propose a novel Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based trajectory planning approach for racing that explicitly exploits the interaction with the opposing vehicle without requiring a prediction. In contrast to the conventional approach, the RL-based approach achieves high success rates even for aggressive blocking behavior. Furthermore, we propose a novel safety layer (SL) that intervenes when the trajectory generated by the RL-based approach is infeasible. In that event, the SL generates a sub-optimal but feasible trajectory, avoiding termination of the scenario due to a not found valid solution.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, submitted to be published at the 27th IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems, September 24 - 27, 2024, Edmonton, Canada</p></details> |

In contrast to most existing works which assumed the target's location is known, we focus on a more challenging scenario where the exact location of the target to be sensed is unknown and random, while its distribution is known a priori and stored in a novel target location distribution map. Based on this map, the probability for the UAV to successfully sense the target can be expressed as a function of the UAV's trajectory. We aim to optimize the UAV's trajectory between two pre-determined locations to maximize the overall sensing probability during its flight, subject to a GBS-UAV communication quality constraint at each time instant and a maximum mission completion time constraint. Despite the non-convexity and NP-hardness of this problem, we devise three high-quality suboptimal solutions tailored for it with polynomial complexity. Numerical results show that our proposed designs outperform various benchmark schemes.</p></details> | <details><summary>to ap...</summary><p>to appear in IEEE Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC) Spring, 2024</p></details> |

In practice, this is achieved by subgrouping, whereby clusters with similar patient characteristics are identified and then receive customized treatment plans with the goal of targeting subgroup-specific disease dynamics. In this paper, we propose a novel mixture hidden Markov model for subgrouping patient trajectories from chronic diseases. Our model is probabilistic and carefully designed to capture different trajectory phases of chronic diseases (i.e., "severe", "moderate", and "mild") through tailored latent states. We demonstrate our subgrouping framework based on a longitudinal study across 847 patients with non-specific low back pain. Here, our subgrouping framework identifies 8 subgroups. Further, we show that our subgrouping framework outperforms common baselines in terms of cluster validity indices.

| **[Offline Trajectory Generalization for Offline Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10393v1)** | 2024-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Offline reinforcement learning (RL) aims to learn policies from static datasets of previously collected trajectories. Existing methods for offline RL either constrain the learned policy to the support of offline data or utilize model-based virtual environments to generate simulated rollouts. However, these methods suffer from (i) poor generalization to unseen states; and (ii) trivial improvement from low-qualified rollout simulation. In this paper, we propose offline trajectory generalization through world transformers for offline reinforcement learning (OTTO). Specifically, we use casual Transformers, a.k.a. World Transformers, to predict state dynamics and the immediate reward. Then we propose four strategies to use World Transformers to generate high-rewarded trajectory simulation by perturbing the offline data. Finally, we jointly use offline data with simulated data to train an offline RL algorithm. OTTO serves as a plug-in module and can be integrated with existing offline RL methods to enhance them with better generalization capability of transformers and high-rewarded data augmentation. Conducting extensive experiments on D4RL benchmark datasets, we verify that OTTO significantly outperforms state-of-the-art offline RL methods.</p></details> |  |

This paper aims to achieve safe flight of OMAVs in cluttered environments. Considering existing static obstacles, an efficient optimization-based framework is proposed to generate 6-D $SE(3)$ trajectories for OMAVs. Given the kinodynamic constraints and the 3D collision-free region represented by a series of intersecting convex polyhedra, the proposed method finally generates a safe and dynamically feasible 6-D trajectory. First, we parameterize the vehicle's attitude into a free 3D vector using stereographic projection to eliminate the constraints inherent in the $SO(3)$ manifold, while the complete $SE(3)$ trajectory is represented as a 6-D polynomial in time without inherent constraints. The vehicle's shape is modeled as a cuboid attached to the body frame to achieve whole-body collision evaluation. Then, we formulate the origin trajectory generation problem as a constrained optimization problem. The original constrained problem is finally transformed into an unconstrained one that can be solved efficiently. To verify the proposed framework's performance, simulations and real-world experiments based on a tilt-rotor hexarotor aerial vehicle are carried out.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication.

Understanding the decision-making process not only contributes to fostering trust but might also reveal previously unknown decision criteria of complex models that could advance the state of medical research. The discovery of decision-relevant concepts from black box models is a particularly challenging task. This study proposes Concept Discovery through Latent Diffusion-based Counterfactual Trajectories (CDCT), a novel three-step framework for concept discovery leveraging the superior image synthesis capabilities of diffusion models. In the first step, CDCT uses a Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) to generate a counterfactual trajectory dataset. This dataset is used to derive a disentangled representation of classification-relevant concepts using a Variational Autoencoder (VAE). Finally, a search algorithm is applied to identify relevant concepts in the disentangled latent space. The application of CDCT to a classifier trained on the largest public skin lesion dataset revealed not only the presence of several biases but also meaningful biomarkers. Moreover, the counterfactuals generated within CDCT show better FID scores than those produced by a previously established state-of-the-art method, while being 12 times more resource-efficient. Unsupervised concept discovery holds great potential for the application of trustworthy AI and the further development of human knowledge in various domains. CDCT represents a further step in this direction.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR) 2024</p></details> |

In the past, All-Wheel-Steering(AWS) robots, incorporating modes such as rotation-free translation maneuvers, in-situ rotational maneuvers, and proportional steering, exhibited inefficient performance due to time-consuming mode switches. This inefficiency arises from wheel rotation constraints and inter-wheel cooperation requirements. The direct application of a holonomic moving strategy can lead to significant slip angles or even structural failure. Additionally, the limited steering range of AWS wheeled robots exacerbates nonlinearity issues, thereby complicating control processes. To address these challenges, we developed a novel planning method termed Constrained AWS(C-AWS), which integrates second-order discrete search with predictive control techniques. Experimental results demonstrate that our method adeptly generates feasible and smooth trajectories for C-AWS while adhering to steering angle constraints.</p></details> |  |

However, dynamically adjusting their position to offer favorable communication channels introduces operational challenges in terms of energy consumption, especially when integrating advanced communication technologies like reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) and full-duplex relays (FDRs). To this end, by recognizing the pivotal role of UAV mobility, the paper introduces an energy-aware trajectory design for UAV-mounted RISs and UAV-mounted FDRs using the decode and forward (DF) protocol, aiming to maximize the network minimum rate and enhance user fairness, while taking into consideration the available on-board energy. Specifically, this work highlights their distinct energy consumption characteristics and their associated integration challenges by developing appropriate energy consumption models for both UAV-mounted RISs and FDRs that capture the intricate relationship between key factors such as weight, and their operational characteristics. Furthermore, a joint time-division multiple access (TDMA) user scheduling-UAV trajectory optimization problem is formulated, considering the power dynamics of both systems, while assuring that the UAV energy is not depleted mid-air. Finally, simulation results underscore the importance of energy considerations in determining the optimal trajectory and scheduling and provide insights into the performance comparison of UAV-mounted RISs and FDRs in UAV-assisted wireless networks.</p></details> |  |

However, we observed that LCM struggles to generate images with both clarity and detailed intricacy. Consequently, we introduce Trajectory Consistency Distillation (TCD), which encompasses trajectory consistency function and strategic stochastic sampling. The trajectory consistency function diminishes the parameterisation and distillation errors by broadening the scope of the self-consistency boundary condition with trajectory mapping and endowing the TCD with the ability to accurately trace the entire trajectory of the Probability Flow ODE in semi-linear form with an Exponential Integrator. Additionally, strategic stochastic sampling provides explicit control of stochastic and circumvents the accumulated errors inherent in multi-step consistency sampling. Experiments demonstrate that TCD not only significantly enhances image quality at low NFEs but also yields more detailed results compared to the teacher model at high NFEs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://mhh0318.github.io/tcd</p></details> |

However, recent studies have raised concerns regarding the hallucination and flaws in their reasoning process. Substantial efforts are being made to improve the reliability and faithfulness of the generated rationales. Some approaches model reasoning as planning, while others focus on annotating for process supervision. Nevertheless, the planning-based search process often results in high latency due to the frequent assessment of intermediate reasoning states and the extensive exploration space. Additionally, supervising the reasoning process with human annotation is costly and challenging to scale for LLM training. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a framework to learn planning-based reasoning through Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) on collected trajectories, which are ranked according to synthesized process rewards. Our results on challenging logical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our learning framework, showing that our 7B model can surpass the strong counterparts like GPT-3.5-Turbo.</p></details> | 17 pages, 9 figures |

Since models that can cover all system setups and design domains at once are not yet foreseeable, model adaptation plays a central role.

In particular, real trajectories in the wildlife domain are scarce as a result of ethical and environmental constraints of the collection process. In this paper, we consider the problem of generating long-horizon trajectories, akin to wildlife migration, based on a small set of real samples. We propose a hierarchical approach to learn the global movement characteristics of the real dataset and recursively refine localized regions. Our solution, WildGraph, discretizes the geographic path into a prototype network of H3 (https://www.uber.com/blog/h3/) regions and leverages a recurrent variational auto-encoder to probabilistically generate paths over the regions, based on occupancy. WildGraph successfully generates realistic months-long trajectories using a sample size as small as 60. Experiments performed on two wildlife migration datasets demonstrate that our proposed method improves the generalization of the generated trajectories in comparison to existing work while achieving superior or comparable performance in several benchmark metrics.

| **[On the Performance of Jerk-Constrained Time-Optimal Trajectory Planning for Industrial Manipulators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07889v1)** | 2024-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Jerk-constrained trajectories offer a wide range of advantages that collectively improve the performance of robotic systems, including increased energy efficiency, durability, and safety. In this paper, we present a novel approach to jerk-constrained time-optimal trajectory planning (TOTP), which follows a specified path while satisfying up to third-order constraints to ensure safety and smooth motion. One significant challenge in jerk-constrained TOTP is a non-convex formulation arising from the inclusion of third-order constraints. Approximating inequality constraints can be particularly challenging because the resulting solutions may violate the actual constraints. We address this problem by leveraging convexity within the proposed formulation to form conservative inequality constraints. We then obtain the desired trajectories by solving an $\boldsymbol n$-dimensional Sequential Linear Program (SLP) iteratively until convergence. Lastly, we evaluate in a real robot the performance of trajectories generated with and without jerk limits in terms of peak power, torque efficiency, and tracking capability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bi-level Trajectory Optimization on Uneven Terrains with Differentiable Wheel-Terrain Interaction Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03307v2)** | 2024-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Navigation of wheeled vehicles on uneven terrain necessitates going beyond the 2D approaches for trajectory planning. Specifically, it is essential to incorporate the full 6dof variation of vehicle pose and its associated stability cost in the planning process. To this end, most recent works aim to learn a neural network model to predict the vehicle evolution. However, such approaches are data-intensive and fraught with generalization issues. In this paper, we present a purely model-based approach that just requires the digital elevation information of the terrain. Specifically, we express the wheel-terrain interaction and 6dof pose prediction as a non-linear least squares (NLS) problem. As a result, trajectory planning can be viewed as a bi-level optimization. The inner optimization layer predicts the pose on the terrain along a given trajectory, while the outer layer deforms the trajectory itself to reduce the stability and kinematic costs of the pose. We improve the state-of-the-art in the following respects. First, we show that our NLS based pose prediction closely matches the output from a high-fidelity physics engine. This result coupled with the fact that we can query gradients of the NLS solver, makes our pose predictor, a differentiable wheel-terrain interaction model. We further leverage this differentiability to efficiently solve the proposed bi-level trajectory optimization problem. Finally, we perform extensive experiments, and comparison with a baseline to showcase the effectiveness of our approach in obtaining smooth, stable trajectories.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 7 figures, submitted to IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS 2024)</p></details> |

The handover requirements can naturally be handled by a path-following-based model predictive controller, where the path progress serves as a progress measure of the handover. Moreover, the deviations from the path are used to follow human motion by adapting the path deviation bounds with a handover location prediction. A Gaussian process regression model, which is trained on known handover trajectories, is employed for this prediction.

| **[VeTraSS: Vehicle Trajectory Similarity Search Through Graph Modeling and Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08021v1)** | 2024-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory similarity search plays an essential role in autonomous driving, as it enables vehicles to analyze the information and characteristics of different trajectories to make informed decisions and navigate safely in dynamic environments. Existing work on the trajectory similarity search task primarily utilizes sequence-processing algorithms or Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), which suffer from the inevitable issues of complicated architecture and heavy training costs. Considering the intricate connections between trajectories, using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for data modeling is feasible. However, most methods directly use existing mathematical graph structures as the input instead of constructing specific graphs from certain vehicle trajectory data. This ignores such data's unique and dynamic characteristics. To bridge such a research gap, we propose VeTraSS -- an end-to-end pipeline for Vehicle Trajectory Similarity Search. Specifically, VeTraSS models the original trajectory data into multi-scale graphs, and generates comprehensive embeddings through a novel multi-layer attention-based GNN. The learned embeddings can be used for searching similar vehicle trajectories. Extensive experiments on the Porto and Geolife datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of VeTraSS, where our model outperforms existing work and reaches the state-of-the-art. This demonstrates the potential of VeTraSS for trajectory analysis and safe navigation in self-driving vehicles in the real world.</p></details> |  |
| **[HPNet: Dynamic Trajectory Forecasting with Historical Prediction Attention](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06351v2)** | 2024-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting the trajectories of road agents is essential for autonomous driving systems. The recent mainstream methods follow a static paradigm, which predicts the future trajectory by using a fixed duration of historical frames. These methods make the predictions independently even at adjacent time steps, which leads to potential instability and temporal inconsistency. As successive time steps have largely overlapping historical frames, their forecasting should have intrinsic correlation, such as overlapping predicted trajectories should be consistent, or be different but share the same motion goal depending on the road situation. Motivated by this, in this work, we introduce HPNet, a novel dynamic trajectory forecasting method. Aiming for stable and accurate trajectory forecasting, our method leverages not only historical frames including maps and agent states, but also historical predictions. Specifically, we newly design a Historical Prediction Attention module to automatically encode the dynamic relationship between successive predictions. Besides, it also extends the attention range beyond the currently visible window benefitting from the use of historical predictions. The proposed Historical Prediction Attention together with the Agent Attention and Mode Attention is further formulated as the Triple Factorized Attention module, serving as the core design of HPNet.Experiments on the Argoverse and INTERACTION datasets show that HPNet achieves state-of-the-art performance, and generates accurate and stable future trajectories.

| **[TC4D: Trajectory-Conditioned Text-to-4D Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17920v2)** | 2024-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent techniques for text-to-4D generation synthesize dynamic 3D scenes using supervision from pre-trained text-to-video models. However, existing representations for motion, such as deformation models or time-dependent neural representations, are limited in the amount of motion they can generate-they cannot synthesize motion extending far beyond the bounding box used for volume rendering. The lack of a more flexible motion model contributes to the gap in realism between 4D generation methods and recent, near-photorealistic video generation models. Here, we propose TC4D: trajectory-conditioned text-to-4D generation, which factors motion into global and local components. We represent the global motion of a scene's bounding box using rigid transformation along a trajectory parameterized by a spline. We learn local deformations that conform to the global trajectory using supervision from a text-to-video model. Our approach enables the synthesis of scenes animated along arbitrary trajectories, compositional scene generation, and significant improvements to the realism and amount of generated motion, which we evaluate qualitatively and through a user study.

| **[Diffusion-based inpainting of incomplete Euclidean distance matrices of trajectories generated by a fractional Brownian motion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07029v1)** | 2024-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fractional Brownian trajectories (fBm) feature both randomness and strong scale-free correlations, challenging generative models to reproduce the intrinsic memory characterizing the underlying process. Here we test a diffusion probabilistic model on a specific dataset of corrupted images corresponding to incomplete Euclidean distance matrices of fBm at various memory exponents $H$. Our dataset implies uniqueness of the data imputation in the regime of low missing ratio, where the remaining partial graph is rigid, providing the ground truth for the inpainting. We find that the conditional diffusion generation stably reproduces the statistics of missing fBm-distributed distances for different values of $H$ exponent. Furthermore, while diffusion models have been recently shown to remember samples from the training database, we show that diffusion-based inpainting behaves qualitatively different from the database search with the increasing database size. Finally, we apply our fBm-trained diffusion model with $H=1/3$ for completion of chromosome distance matrices obtained in single-cell microscopy experiments, showing its superiority over the standard bioinformatics algorithms.

| **[Trajectory-Oriented Policy Optimization with Sparse Rewards](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02225v3)** | 2024-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mastering deep reinforcement learning (DRL) proves challenging in tasks featuring scant rewards. These limited rewards merely signify whether the task is partially or entirely accomplished, necessitating various exploration actions before the agent garners meaningful feedback. Consequently, the majority of existing DRL exploration algorithms struggle to acquire practical policies within a reasonable timeframe. To address this challenge, we introduce an approach leveraging offline demonstration trajectories for swifter and more efficient online RL in environments with sparse rewards. Our pivotal insight involves treating offline demonstration trajectories as guidance, rather than mere imitation, allowing our method to learn a policy whose distribution of state-action visitation marginally matches that of offline demonstrations. We specifically introduce a novel trajectory distance relying on maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) and cast policy optimization as a distance-constrained optimization problem. We then illustrate that this optimization problem can be streamlined into a policy-gradient algorithm, integrating rewards shaped by insights from offline demonstrations. The proposed algorithm undergoes evaluation across extensive discrete and continuous control tasks with sparse and misleading rewards. The experimental findings demonstrate the significant superiority of our proposed algorithm over baseline methods concerning diverse exploration and the acquisition of an optimal policy.</p></details> | 6 pages, 7 figures |
| **[TrajPRed: Trajectory Prediction with Region-based Relation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06971v1)** | 2024-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Forecasting human trajectories in traffic scenes is critical for safety within mixed or fully autonomous systems. Human future trajectories are driven by two major stimuli, social interactions, and stochastic goals. Thus, reliable forecasting needs to capture these two stimuli. Edge-based relation modeling represents social interactions using pairwise correlations from precise individual states. Nevertheless, edge-based relations can be vulnerable under perturbations. To alleviate these issues, we propose a region-based relation learning paradigm that models social interactions via region-wise dynamics of joint states, i.e., the changes in the density of crowds. In particular, region-wise agent joint information is encoded within convolutional feature grids. Social relations are modeled by relating the temporal changes of local joint information from a global perspective. We show that region-based relations are less susceptible to perturbations. In order to account for the stochastic individual goals, we exploit a conditional variational autoencoder to realize multi-goal estimation and diverse future prediction. Specifically, we perform variational inference via the latent distribution, which is conditioned on the correlation between input states and associated target goals. Sampling from the latent distribution enables the framework to reliably capture the stochastic behavior in test data. We integrate multi-goal estimation and region-based relation learning to model the two stimuli, social interactions, and stochastic goals, in a prediction framework. We evaluate our framework on the ETH-UCY dataset and Stanford Drone Dataset (SDD). We show that the diverse prediction better fits the ground truth when incorporating the relation module. Our framework outperforms the state-of-the-art models on SDD by $27.61\%$/$18.20\%$ of ADE/FDE metrics.</p></details> |  |
| **[GRANP: A Graph Recurrent Attentive Neural Process Model for Vehicle Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08004v1)** | 2024-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As a vital component in autonomous driving, accurate trajectory prediction effectively prevents traffic accidents and improves driving efficiency. To capture complex spatial-temporal dynamics and social interactions, recent studies developed models based on advanced deep-learning methods. On the other hand, recent studies have explored the use of deep generative models to further account for trajectory uncertainties. However, the current approaches demonstrating indeterminacy involve inefficient and time-consuming practices such as sampling from trained models. To fill this gap, we proposed a novel model named Graph Recurrent Attentive Neural Process (GRANP) for vehicle trajectory prediction while efficiently quantifying prediction uncertainty. In particular, GRANP contains an encoder with deterministic and latent paths, and a decoder for prediction. The encoder, including stacked Graph Attention Networks, LSTM and 1D convolutional layers, is employed to extract spatial-temporal relationships. The decoder is used to learn a latent distribution and thus quantify prediction uncertainty. To reveal the effectiveness of our model, we evaluate the performance of GRANP on the highD dataset. Extensive experiments show that GRANP achieves state-of-the-art results and can efficiently quantify uncertainties. Additionally, we undertake an intuitive case study that showcases the interpretability of the proposed approach. The code is available at https://github.com/joy-driven/GRANP.</p></details> |  |

| **[FLAME: Factuality-Aware Alignment for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01525v1)** | 2024-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Alignment is a standard procedure to fine-tune pre-trained large language models (LLMs) to follow natural language instructions and serve as helpful AI assistants. We have observed, however, that the conventional alignment process fails to enhance the factual accuracy of LLMs, and often leads to the generation of more false facts (i.e. hallucination). In this paper, we study how to make the LLM alignment process more factual, by first identifying factors that lead to hallucination in both alignment steps:\ supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL). In particular, we find that training the LLM on new knowledge or unfamiliar texts can encourage hallucination. This makes SFT less factual as it trains on human labeled data that may be novel to the LLM. Furthermore, reward functions used in standard RL can also encourage hallucination, because it guides the LLM to provide more helpful responses on a diverse set of instructions, often preferring longer and more detailed responses. Based on these observations, we propose factuality-aware alignment, comprised of factuality-aware SFT and factuality-aware RL through direct preference optimization. Experiments show that our proposed factuality-aware alignment guides LLMs to output more factual responses while maintaining instruction-following capability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large language models can accurately predict searcher preferences](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10621v2)** | 2024-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Relevance labels, which indicate whether a search result is valuable to a searcher, are key to evaluating and optimising search systems. The best way to capture the true preferences of users is to ask them for their careful feedback on which results would be useful, but this approach does not scale to produce a large number of labels. Getting relevance labels at scale is usually done with third-party labellers, who judge on behalf of the user, but there is a risk of low-quality data if the labeller doesn't understand user needs. To improve quality, one standard approach is to study real users through interviews, user studies and direct feedback, find areas where labels are systematically disagreeing with users, then educate labellers about user needs through judging guidelines, training and monitoring. This paper introduces an alternate approach for improving label quality. It takes careful feedback from real users, which by definition is the highest-quality first-party gold data that can be derived, and develops an large language model prompt that agrees with that data. We present ideas and observations from deploying language models for large-scale relevance labelling at Bing, and illustrate with data from TREC. We have found large language models can be effective, with accuracy as good as human labellers and similar capability to pick the hardest queries, best runs, and best groups. Systematic changes to the prompts make a difference in accuracy, but so too do simple paraphrases. To measure agreement with real searchers needs high-quality ``gold'' labels, but with these we find that models produce better labels than third-party workers, for a fraction of the cost, and these labels let us train notably better rankers.</p></details> |  |

| **[Analyzing the Role of Semantic Representations in the Era of Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01502v1)** | 2024-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditionally, natural language processing (NLP) models often use a rich set of features created by linguistic expertise, such as semantic representations. However, in the era of large language models (LLMs), more and more tasks are turned into generic, end-to-end sequence generation problems. In this paper, we investigate the question: what is the role of semantic representations in the era of LLMs? Specifically, we investigate the effect of Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) across five diverse NLP tasks. We propose an AMR-driven chain-of-thought prompting method, which we call AMRCoT, and find that it generally hurts performance more than it helps. To investigate what AMR may have to offer on these tasks, we conduct a series of analysis experiments. We find that it is difficult to predict which input examples AMR may help or hurt on, but errors tend to arise with multi-word expressions, named entities, and in the final inference step where the LLM must connect its reasoning over the AMR to its prediction. We recommend focusing on these areas for future work in semantic representations for LLMs. Our code: https://github.com/causalNLP/amr_llm.</p></details> | NAACL 2024 |
| **[A Careful Examination of Large Language Model Performance on Grade School Arithmetic](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00332v2)** | 2024-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive success on many benchmarks for mathematical reasoning. However, there is growing concern that some of this performance actually reflects dataset contamination, where data closely resembling benchmark questions leaks into the training data, instead of true reasoning ability. To investigate this claim rigorously, we commission Grade School Math 1000 (GSM1k). GSM1k is designed to mirror the style and complexity of the established GSM8k benchmark, the gold standard for measuring elementary mathematical reasoning. We ensure that the two benchmarks are comparable across important metrics such as human solve rates, number of steps in solution, answer magnitude, and more. When evaluating leading open- and closed-source LLMs on GSM1k, we observe accuracy drops of up to 13%, with several families of models (e.g., Phi and Mistral) showing evidence of systematic overfitting across almost all model sizes. At the same time, many models, especially those on the frontier, (e.g., Gemini/GPT/Claude) show minimal signs of overfitting. Further analysis suggests a positive relationship (Spearman's r^2=0.32) between a model's probability of generating an example from GSM8k and its performance gap between GSM8k and GSM1k, suggesting that many models may have partially memorized GSM8k.</p></details> |  |

Very recently, with the advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), an increasing number of APR techniques have been proposed, facilitating software development and maintenance and demonstrating remarkable performance. However, due to ongoing explorations in the LLM-based APR field, it is challenging for researchers to understand the current achievements, challenges, and potential opportunities. This work provides the first systematic literature review to summarize the applications of LLMs in APR between 2020 and 2024. We analyze 127 relevant papers from LLMs, APR and their integration perspectives. First, we categorize existing popular LLMs that are applied to support APR and outline three types of utilization strategies for their deployment. Besides, we detail some specific repair scenarios that benefit from LLMs, e.g., semantic bugs and security vulnerabilities. Furthermore, we discuss several critical aspects of integrating LLMs into APR research, e.g., input forms and open science. Finally, we highlight a set of challenges remaining to be investigated and the potential guidelines for future research. Overall, our paper provides a systematic overview of the research landscape to the APR community, helping researchers gain a comprehensive understanding of achievements and promote future research.</p></details> |  |

Retrieval-augmented generation provided a solution for these models to update knowledge and enhance their performance. In contrast to previous retrieval-augmented LMs, which utilize specialized cross-attention mechanisms to help LLM encode retrieved text, BiomedRAG adopts a simpler approach by directly inputting the retrieved chunk-based documents into the LLM. This straightforward design is easily applicable to existing retrieval and language models, effectively bypassing noise information in retrieved documents, particularly in noise-intensive tasks. Moreover, we demonstrate the potential for utilizing the LLM to supervise the retrieval model in the biomedical domain, enabling it to retrieve the document that assists the LM in improving its predictions. Our experiments reveal that with the tuned scorer,\textsc{ BiomedRAG} attains superior performance across 5 biomedical NLP tasks, encompassing information extraction (triple extraction, relation extraction), text classification, link prediction, and question-answering, leveraging over 9 datasets. For instance, in the triple extraction task, \textsc{BiomedRAG} outperforms other triple extraction systems with micro-F1 scores of 81.42 and 88.83 on GIT and ChemProt corpora, respectively.</p></details> |  |

In addition, We also evaluated CPLLM for patient hospital readmission prediction and compared our method's performance with benchmark baselines. Our experiments have shown that our proposed method, CPLLM, surpasses all the tested models in terms of PR-AUC and ROC-AUC metrics, showing state-of-the-art results for diagnosis prediction and patient hospital readmission prediction.

Inspired by their success, large 3D point cloud-language models (3D-LLMs) also integrate point clouds into LLMs. However, directly aligning point clouds with LLM requires expensive training costs, typically in hundreds of GPU-hours on A100, which hinders the development of 3D-LLMs. In this paper, we introduce MiniGPT-3D, an efficient and powerful 3D-LLM that achieves multiple SOTA results while training for only 27 hours on one RTX 3090. Specifically, we propose to align 3D point clouds with LLMs using 2D priors from 2D-LLMs, which can leverage the similarity between 2D and 3D visual information. We introduce a novel four-stage training strategy for modality alignment in a cascaded way, and a mixture of query experts module to adaptively aggregate features with high efficiency. Moreover, we utilize parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods LoRA and Norm fine-tuning, resulting in only 47.8M learnable parameters, which is up to 260x fewer than existing methods. Extensive experiments show that MiniGPT-3D achieves SOTA on 3D object classification and captioning tasks, with significantly cheaper training costs. Notably, MiniGPT-3D gains an 8.12 increase on GPT-4 evaluation score for the challenging object captioning task compared to ShapeLLM-13B, while the latter costs 160 total GPU-hours on 8 A800. We are the first to explore the efficient 3D-LLM, offering new insights to the community.

These methods ask the LLM to generate feedback given the problem statement and a student's (buggy) submission. There are several issues with these types of methods. First, the generated feedback messages are often too direct in revealing the error in the submission and thus diminish valuable opportunities for the student to learn. Second, they do not consider the student's learning context, i.e., their previous submissions, current knowledge, etc. Third, they are not layered since existing methods use a single, shared prompt for all student submissions. In this paper, we explore using LLMs to generate a "feedback-ladder", i.e., multiple levels of feedback for the same problem-submission pair. We evaluate the quality of the generated feedback-ladder via a user study with students, educators, and researchers. We have observed diminishing effectiveness for higher-level feedback and higher-scoring submissions overall in the study. In practice, our method enables teachers to select an appropriate level of feedback to show to a student based on their personal learning context, or in a progressive manner to go more detailed if a higher-level feedback fails to correct the student's error.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published on the 17th EDM 2024 - Posters and Demos Track</p></details> |

To support training large diffusion models, this paper studies pipeline parallel training of diffusion models and proposes DiffusionPipe, a synchronous pipeline training system that advocates innovative pipeline bubble filling technique, catering to structural characteristics of diffusion models. State-of-the-art diffusion models typically include trainable (the backbone) and non-trainable (e.g., frozen input encoders) parts. We first unify optimal stage partitioning and pipeline scheduling of single and multiple backbones in representative diffusion models with a dynamic programming approach. We then propose to fill the computation of non-trainable model parts into idle periods of the pipeline training of the backbones by an efficient greedy algorithm, thus achieving high training throughput. Extensive experiments show that DiffusionPipe can achieve up to 1.41x speedup over pipeline parallel methods and 1.28x speedup over data parallel training on popular diffusion models.</p></details> |  |

However, despite the superior performance of DL-based approaches over rule-based ones in research, applying DL approaches to software vulnerability detection in practice remains a challenge due to the complex structure of source code, the black-box nature of DL, and the domain knowledge required to understand and validate the black-box results for addressing tasks after detection. Conventional DL models are trained by specific projects and, hence, excel in identifying vulnerabilities in these projects but not in others. These models with poor performance in vulnerability detection would impact the downstream tasks such as location and repair. More importantly, these models do not provide explanations for developers to comprehend detection results. In contrast, Large Language Models (LLMs) have made lots of progress in addressing these issues by leveraging prompting techniques. Unfortunately, their performance in identifying vulnerabilities is unsatisfactory. This paper contributes \textbf{\DLAP}, a \underline{\textbf{D}}eep \underline{\textbf{L}}earning \underline{\textbf{A}}ugmented LLMs \underline{\textbf{P}}rompting framework that combines the best of both DL models and LLMs to achieve exceptional vulnerability detection performance.

This task has suffered from a lack of training data due to object states' inherent ambiguity and variety. To avoid exhaustive annotation, learning from transcribed narrations in instructional videos would be intriguing. However, object states are less described in narrations compared to actions, making them less effective. In this work, we propose to extract the object state information from action information included in narrations, using large language models (LLMs). Our observation is that LLMs include world knowledge on the relationship between actions and their resulting object states, and can infer the presence of object states from past action sequences. The proposed LLM-based framework offers flexibility to generate plausible pseudo-object state labels against arbitrary categories. We evaluate our method with our newly collected Multiple Object States Transition (MOST) dataset including dense temporal annotation of 60 object state categories.

Traditional multimodal frameworks require laborious developer work to support rich multimodal commands where the user's multimodal command involves possibly exponential combinations of actions/function invocations. This paper presents ReactGenie, a programming framework that better separates multimodal input from the computational model to enable developers to create efficient and capable multimodal interfaces with ease. ReactGenie translates multimodal user commands into NLPL (Natural Language Programming Language), a programming language we created, using a neural semantic parser based on large-language models. The ReactGenie runtime interprets the parsed NLPL and composes primitives in the computational model to implement complex user commands. As a result, ReactGenie allows easy implementation and unprecedented richness in commands for end-users of multimodal apps. Our evaluation showed that 12 developers can learn and build a nontrivial ReactGenie application in under 2.5 hours on average. In addition, compared with a traditional GUI, end-users can complete tasks faster and with less task load using ReactGenie apps.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fine-Tuning and Prompt Engineering for Large Language Models-based Code Review Automation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00905v3)** | 2024-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Context: The rapid evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) has sparked significant interest in leveraging their capabilities for automating code review processes. Prior studies often focus on developing LLMs for code review automation, yet require expensive resources, which is infeasible for organizations with limited budgets and resources. Thus, fine-tuning and prompt engineering are the two common approaches to leveraging LLMs for code review automation. Objective: We aim to investigate the performance of LLMs-based code review automation based on two contexts, i.e., when LLMs are leveraged by fine-tuning and prompting. Fine-tuning involves training the model on a specific code review dataset, while prompting involves providing explicit instructions to guide the model's generation process without requiring a specific code review dataset. Method: We leverage model fine-tuning and inference techniques (i.e., zero-shot learning, few-shot learning and persona) on LLMs-based code review automation. In total, we investigate 12 variations of two LLMs-based code review automation (i.e., GPT- 3.5 and Magicoder), and compare them with the Guo et al.'s approach and three existing code review automation approaches. Results: The fine-tuning of GPT 3.5 with zero-shot learning helps GPT-3.5 to achieve 73.17% -74.23% higher EM than the Guo et al.'s approach. In addition, when GPT-3.5 is not fine-tuned, GPT-3.5 with few-shot learning achieves 46.38% - 659.09% higher EM than GPT-3.5 with zero-shot learning. Conclusions: Based on our results, we recommend that (1) LLMs for code review automation should be fine-tuned to achieve the highest performance; and (2) when data is not sufficient for model fine-tuning (e.g., a cold-start problem), few-shot learning without a persona should be used for LLMs for code review automation.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages.

To address the associated inefficiencies, we propose Disaggregated Multi-Tower (DMT), a modeling technique that consists of (1) Semantic-preserving Tower Transform (SPTT), a novel training paradigm that decomposes the monolithic global embedding lookup process into disjoint towers to exploit data center locality; (2) Tower Module (TM), a synergistic dense component attached to each tower to reduce model complexity and communication volume through hierarchical feature interaction; and (3) Tower Partitioner (TP), a feature partitioner to systematically create towers with meaningful feature interactions and load balanced assignments to preserve model quality and training throughput via learned embeddings. We show that DMT can achieve up to 1.9x speedup compared to the state-of-the-art baselines without losing accuracy across multiple generations of hardware at large data center scales.</p></details> |  |
| **[Context-Aware Clustering using Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00988v1)** | 2024-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the remarkable success of Large Language Models (LLMs) in text understanding and generation, their potential for text clustering tasks remains underexplored. We observed that powerful closed-source LLMs provide good quality clusterings of entity sets but are not scalable due to the massive compute power required and the associated costs. Thus, we propose CACTUS (Context-Aware ClusTering with aUgmented triplet losS), a systematic approach that leverages open-source LLMs for efficient and effective supervised clustering of entity subsets, particularly focusing on text-based entities. Existing text clustering methods fail to effectively capture the context provided by the entity subset. Moreover, though there are several language modeling based approaches for clustering, very few are designed for the task of supervised clustering. This paper introduces a novel approach towards clustering entity subsets using LLMs by capturing context via a scalable inter-entity attention mechanism. We propose a novel augmented triplet loss function tailored for supervised clustering, which addresses the inherent challenges of directly applying the triplet loss to this problem. Furthermore, we introduce a self-supervised clustering task based on text augmentation techniques to improve the generalization of our model. For evaluation, we collect ground truth clusterings from a closed-source LLM and transfer this knowledge to an open-source LLM under the supervised clustering framework, allowing a faster and cheaper open-source model to perform the same task. Experiments on various e-commerce query and product clustering datasets demonstrate that our proposed approach significantly outperforms existing unsupervised and supervised baselines under various external clustering evaluation metrics.</p></details> | 16 pages |
| **[Engineering Rank/Select Data Structures for Large-Alphabet Strings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14461v2)** | 2024-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-alphabet strings are common in scenarios such as information retrieval and natural-language processing. The efficient storage and processing of such strings usually introduces several challenges that are not witnessed in small-alphabets strings. This paper studies the efficient implementation of one of the most effective approaches for dealing with large-alphabet strings, namely the \emph{alphabet-partitioning} approach. The main contribution is a compressed data structure that supports the fundamental operations $rank$ and $select$ efficiently. We show experimental results that indicate that our implementation outperforms the current realizations of the alphabet-partitioning approach. In particular, the time for operation $select$ can be improved by about 80%, using only 11% more space than current alphabet-partitioning schemes. We also show the impact of our data structure on several applications, like the intersection of inverted lists (where improvements of up to 60% are achieved, using only 2% of extra space), the representation of run-length compressed strings, and the distributed-computation processing of $rank$ and $select$ operations. In the particular case of run-length compressed strings, our experiments on the Burrows-Wheeler transform of highly-repetitive texts indicate that by using only about 0.98--1.09 times the space of state-of-the-art RLFM-indexes (depending on the text), the process of counting the number of occurrences of a pattern in a text can be carried out 1.23--2.33 times faster.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large Language Models as Zero-shot Dialogue State Tracker through Function Calling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10466v3)** | 2024-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly prevalent in conversational systems due to their advanced understanding and generative capabilities in general contexts. However, their effectiveness in task-oriented dialogues (TOD), which requires not only response generation but also effective dialogue state tracking (DST) within specific tasks and domains, remains less satisfying. In this work, we propose a novel approach FnCTOD for solving DST with LLMs through function calling. This method improves zero-shot DST, allowing adaptation to diverse domains without extensive data collection or model tuning. Our experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves exceptional performance with both modestly sized open-source and also proprietary LLMs: with in-context prompting it enables various 7B or 13B parameter models to surpass the previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) achieved by ChatGPT, and improves ChatGPT's performance beating the SOTA by 5.6% average joint goal accuracy (JGA). Individual model results for GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 are boosted by 4.8% and 14%, respectively. We also show that by fine-tuning on a small collection of diverse task-oriented dialogues, we can equip modestly sized models, specifically a 13B parameter LLaMA2-Chat model, with function-calling capabilities and DST performance comparable to ChatGPT while maintaining their chat capabilities. We have made the code publicly available at https://github.com/facebookresearch/FnCTOD</p></details> | <details><summary>More ...</summary><p>More results in the next version.

| **[Characterising the Creative Process in Humans and Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00899v1)** | 2024-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models appear quite creative, often performing on par with the average human on creative tasks. However, research on LLM creativity has focused solely on \textit{products}, with little attention on the creative \textit{process}. Process analyses of human creativity often require hand-coded categories or exploit response times, which do not apply to LLMs. We provide an automated method to characterise how humans and LLMs explore semantic spaces on the Alternate Uses Task, and contrast with behaviour in a Verbal Fluency Task. We use sentence embeddings to identify response categories and compute semantic similarities, which we use to generate jump profiles. Our results corroborate earlier work in humans reporting both persistent (deep search in few semantic spaces) and flexible (broad search across multiple semantic spaces) pathways to creativity, where both pathways lead to similar creativity scores. LLMs were found to be biased towards either persistent or flexible paths, that varied across tasks. Though LLMs as a population match human profiles, their relationship with creativity is different, where the more flexible models score higher on creativity. Our dataset and scripts are available on \href{https://github.com/surabhisnath/Creative_Process}{GitHub}.</p></details> |  |
| **[Wake Vision: A Large-scale, Diverse Dataset and Benchmark Suite for TinyML Person Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00892v1)** | 2024-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine learning applications on extremely low-power devices, commonly referred to as tiny machine learning (TinyML), promises a smarter and more connected world. However, the advancement of current TinyML research is hindered by the limited size and quality of pertinent datasets. To address this challenge, we introduce Wake Vision, a large-scale, diverse dataset tailored for person detection -- the canonical task for TinyML visual sensing. Wake Vision comprises over 6 million images, which is a hundredfold increase compared to the previous standard, and has undergone thorough quality filtering. Using Wake Vision for training results in a 2.41\% increase in accuracy compared to the established benchmark. Alongside the dataset, we provide a collection of five detailed benchmark sets that assess model performance on specific segments of the test data, such as varying lighting conditions, distances from the camera, and demographic characteristics of subjects. These novel fine-grained benchmarks facilitate the evaluation of model quality in challenging real-world scenarios that are often ignored when focusing solely on overall accuracy. Through an evaluation of a MobileNetV2 TinyML model on the benchmarks, we show that the input resolution plays a more crucial role than the model width in detecting distant subjects and that the impact of quantization on model robustness is minimal, thanks to the dataset quality. These findings underscore the importance of a detailed evaluation to identify essential factors for model development. The dataset, benchmark suite, code, and models are publicly available under the CC-BY 4.0 license, enabling their use for commercial use cases.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Watermark for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.10226v4)** | 2024-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Potential harms of large language models can be mitigated by watermarking model output, i.e., embedding signals into generated text that are invisible to humans but algorithmically detectable from a short span of tokens. We propose a watermarking framework for proprietary language models. The watermark can be embedded with negligible impact on text quality, and can be detected using an efficient open-source algorithm without access to the language model API or parameters. The watermark works by selecting a randomized set of "green" tokens before a word is generated, and then softly promoting use of green tokens during sampling. We propose a statistical test for detecting the watermark with interpretable p-values, and derive an information-theoretic framework for analyzing the sensitivity of the watermark. We test the watermark using a multi-billion parameter model from the Open Pretrained Transformer (OPT) family, and discuss robustness and security.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages in the main body.

| **[On the Reliability of Watermarks for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04634v4)** | 2024-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As LLMs become commonplace, machine-generated text has the potential to flood the internet with spam, social media bots, and valueless content. Watermarking is a simple and effective strategy for mitigating such harms by enabling the detection and documentation of LLM-generated text. Yet a crucial question remains: How reliable is watermarking in realistic settings in the wild? There, watermarked text may be modified to suit a user's needs, or entirely rewritten to avoid detection. We study the robustness of watermarked text after it is re-written by humans, paraphrased by a non-watermarked LLM, or mixed into a longer hand-written document. We find that watermarks remain detectable even after human and machine paraphrasing. While these attacks dilute the strength of the watermark, paraphrases are statistically likely to leak n-grams or even longer fragments of the original text, resulting in high-confidence detections when enough tokens are observed. For example, after strong human paraphrasing the watermark is detectable after observing 800 tokens on average, when setting a 1e-5 false positive rate. We also consider a range of new detection schemes that are sensitive to short spans of watermarked text embedded inside a large document, and we compare the robustness of watermarking to other kinds of detectors.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages in the main body.

| **[Math Multiple Choice Question Generation via Human-Large Language Model Collaboration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00864v1)** | 2024-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiple choice questions (MCQs) are a popular method for evaluating students' knowledge due to their efficiency in administration and grading. Crafting high-quality math MCQs is a labor-intensive process that requires educators to formulate precise stems and plausible distractors. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have sparked interest in automating MCQ creation, but challenges persist in ensuring mathematical accuracy and addressing student errors. This paper introduces a prototype tool designed to facilitate collaboration between LLMs and educators for streamlining the math MCQ generation process. We conduct a pilot study involving math educators to investigate how the tool can help them simplify the process of crafting high-quality math MCQs. We found that while LLMs can generate well-formulated question stems, their ability to generate distractors that capture common student errors and misconceptions is limited. Nevertheless, a human-AI collaboration has the potential to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of MCQ generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>17th ...</summary><p>17th International Conference on Educational Data Mining (EDM 2024)</p></details> |

Interestingly, multi-turn querying reduces the output's string-based metric scores, but neural metrics suggest comparable or improved quality. Human evaluations indicate better fluency and naturalness compared to initial translations and even human references, all while maintaining quality. Ablation studies underscore the importance of anchoring the refinement to the source and a reasonable seed translation for quality considerations. We also discuss the challenges in evaluation and relation to human performance and translationese.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Framework for Real-time Safeguarding the Text Generation of Large Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19048v2)** | 2024-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly advanced natural language processing (NLP) tasks but also pose ethical and societal risks due to their propensity to generate harmful content. To address this, various approaches have been developed to safeguard LLMs from producing unsafe content. However, existing methods have limitations, including the need for training specific control models and proactive intervention during text generation, that lead to quality degradation and increased computational overhead. To mitigate those limitations, we propose LLMSafeGuard, a lightweight framework to safeguard LLM text generation in real-time. LLMSafeGuard integrates an external validator into the beam search algorithm during decoding, rejecting candidates that violate safety constraints while allowing valid ones to proceed. We introduce a similarity based validation approach, simplifying constraint introduction and eliminating the need for control model training. Additionally, LLMSafeGuard employs a context-wise timing selection strategy, intervening LLMs only when necessary. We evaluate LLMSafeGuard on two tasks, detoxification and copyright safeguarding, and demonstrate its superior performance over SOTA baselines. For instance, LLMSafeGuard reduces the average toxic score of. LLM output by 29.7% compared to the best baseline meanwhile preserving similar linguistic quality as natural output in detoxification task. Similarly, in the copyright task, LLMSafeGuard decreases the Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) by 56.2% compared to baselines. Moreover, our context-wise timing selection strategy reduces inference time by at least 24% meanwhile maintaining comparable effectiveness as validating each time step. LLMSafeGuard also offers tunable parameters to balance its effectiveness and efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient and Responsible Adaptation of Large Language Models for Robust Top-k Recommendations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00824v1)** | 2024-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conventional recommendation systems (RSs) are typically optimized to enhance performance metrics uniformly across all training samples. This makes it hard for data-driven RSs to cater to a diverse set of users due to the varying properties of these users. The performance disparity among various populations can harm the model's robustness with respect to sub-populations. While recent works have shown promising results in adapting large language models (LLMs) for recommendation to address hard samples, long user queries from millions of users can degrade the performance of LLMs and elevate costs, processing times and inference latency. This challenges the practical applicability of LLMs for recommendations. To address this, we propose a hybrid task allocation framework that utilizes the capabilities of both LLMs and traditional RSs. By adopting a two-phase approach to improve robustness to sub-populations, we promote a strategic assignment of tasks for efficient and responsible adaptation of LLMs. Our strategy works by first identifying the weak and inactive users that receive a suboptimal ranking performance by RSs. Next, we use an in-context learning approach for such users, wherein each user interaction history is contextualized as a distinct ranking task and given to an LLM. We test our hybrid framework by incorporating various recommendation algorithms -- collaborative filtering and learning-to-rank recommendation models -- and two LLMs -- both open and close-sourced. Our results on three real-world datasets show a significant reduction in weak users and improved robustness of RSs to sub-populations $(\approx12\%)$ and overall performance without disproportionately escalating costs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sifting out communities in large sparse networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00816v1)** | 2024-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Research data sets are growing to unprecedented sizes and network modeling is commonly used to extract complex relationships in diverse domains, such as genetic interactions involved in disease, logistics, and social communities. As the number of nodes increases in a network, an increasing sparsity of edges is a practical limitation due to memory restrictions. Moreover, many of these sparse networks exhibit very large numbers of nodes with no adjacent edges, as well as disjoint components of nodes with no edges connecting them. A prevalent aim in network modeling is the identification of clusters, or communities, of nodes that are highly interrelated. Several definitions of strong community structure have been introduced to facilitate this task, each with inherent assumptions and biases. We introduce an intuitive objective function for quantifying the quality of clustering results in large sparse networks. We utilize a two-step method for identifying communities which is especially well-suited for this domain as the first step efficiently divides the network into the disjoint components, while the second step optimizes clustering of the produced components based on the new objective. Using simulated networks, optimization based on the new objective function consistently yields significantly higher accuracy than those based on the modularity function, with the widest gaps appearing for the noisiest networks. Additionally, applications to benchmark problems illustrate the intuitive correctness of our approach. Finally, the practicality of our approach is demonstrated in real-world data in which we identify complex genetic interactions in large-scale networks comprised of tens of thousands of nodes. Based on these three different types of trials, our results clearly demonstrate the usefulness of our two-step procedure and the accuracy of our simple objective.</p></details> |  |

Among these challenges, one particularly pressing issue is Fact-Conflicting Hallucination (FCH), where LLMs generate content that directly contradicts established facts. Tackling FCH poses a formidable task due to two primary obstacles: Firstly, automating the construction and updating of benchmark datasets is challenging, as current methods rely on static benchmarks that don't cover the diverse range of FCH scenarios. Secondly, validating LLM outputs' reasoning process is inherently complex, especially with intricate logical relations involved. In addressing these obstacles, we propose an innovative approach leveraging logic programming to enhance metamorphic testing for detecting Fact-Conflicting Hallucinations (FCH). Our method gathers data from sources like Wikipedia, expands it with logical reasoning to create diverse test cases, assesses LLMs through structured prompts, and validates their coherence using semantic-aware assessment mechanisms. Our method generates test cases and detects hallucinations across six different LLMs spanning nine domains, revealing hallucination rates ranging from 24.7% to 59.8%. Key observations indicate that LLMs encounter challenges, particularly with temporal concepts, handling out-of-distribution knowledge, and exhibiting deficiencies in logical reasoning capabilities. The outcomes underscore the efficacy of logic-based test cases generated by our tool in both triggering and identifying hallucinations. These findings underscore the imperative for ongoing collaborative endeavors within the community to detect and address LLM hallucinations.</p></details> |  |

Although quantized weights offer storage efficiency and allow for faster inference, existing works have indicated that quantization might compromise performance and exacerbate biases in LLMs. This study investigates the confidence and calibration of quantized models, considering factors such as language model type and scale as contributors to quantization loss. Firstly, we reveal that quantization with GPTQ to 4-bit results in a decrease in confidence regarding true labels, with varying impacts observed among different language models. Secondly, we observe fluctuations in the impact on confidence across different scales. Finally, we propose an explanation for quantization loss based on confidence levels, indicating that quantization disproportionately affects samples where the full model exhibited low confidence levels in the first place.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NAACL 2024 Findings</p></details> |

To reduce such overreliance, there have been calls for LLMs to communicate their uncertainty to end users. However, there has been little empirical work examining how users perceive and act upon LLMs' expressions of uncertainty. We explore this question through a large-scale, pre-registered, human-subject experiment (N=404) in which participants answer medical questions with or without access to responses from a fictional LLM-infused search engine. Using both behavioral and self-reported measures, we examine how different natural language expressions of uncertainty impact participants' reliance, trust, and overall task performance. We find that first-person expressions (e.g., "I'm not sure, but...") decrease participants' confidence in the system and tendency to agree with the system's answers, while increasing participants' accuracy. An exploratory analysis suggests that this increase can be attributed to reduced (but not fully eliminated) overreliance on incorrect answers. While we observe similar effects for uncertainty expressed from a general perspective (e.g., "It's not clear, but..."), these effects are weaker and not statistically significant. Our findings suggest that using natural language expressions of uncertainty may be an effective approach for reducing overreliance on LLMs, but that the precise language used matters. This highlights the importance of user testing before deploying LLMs at scale.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to FAccT 2024.

| **[Addressing Topic Granularity and Hallucination in Large Language Models for Topic Modelling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00611v1)** | 2024-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) with their strong zero-shot topic extraction capabilities offer an alternative to probabilistic topic modelling and closed-set topic classification approaches. As zero-shot topic extractors, LLMs are expected to understand human instructions to generate relevant and non-hallucinated topics based on the given documents. However, LLM-based topic modelling approaches often face difficulties in generating topics with adherence to granularity as specified in human instructions, often resulting in many near-duplicate topics. Furthermore, methods for addressing hallucinated topics generated by LLMs have not yet been investigated. In this paper, we focus on addressing the issues of topic granularity and hallucinations for better LLM-based topic modelling. To this end, we introduce a novel approach that leverages Direct Preference Optimisation (DPO) to fine-tune open-source LLMs, such as Mistral-7B. Our approach does not rely on traditional human annotation to rank preferred answers but employs a reconstruction pipeline to modify raw topics generated by LLMs, thus enabling a fast and efficient training and inference framework. Comparative experiments show that our fine-tuning approach not only significantly improves the LLM's capability to produce more coherent, relevant, and precise topics, but also reduces the number of hallucinated topics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Investigating Automatic Scoring and Feedback using Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00602v1)** | 2024-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automatic grading and feedback have been long studied using traditional machine learning and deep learning techniques using language models. With the recent accessibility to high performing large language models (LLMs) like LLaMA-2, there is an opportunity to investigate the use of these LLMs for automatic grading and feedback generation. Despite the increase in performance, LLMs require significant computational resources for fine-tuning and additional specific adjustments to enhance their performance for such tasks. To address these issues, Parameter Efficient Fine-tuning (PEFT) methods, such as LoRA and QLoRA, have been adopted to decrease memory and computational requirements in model fine-tuning. This paper explores the efficacy of PEFT-based quantized models, employing classification or regression head, to fine-tune LLMs for automatically assigning continuous numerical grades to short answers and essays, as well as generating corresponding feedback. We conducted experiments on both proprietary and open-source datasets for our tasks. The results show that prediction of grade scores via finetuned LLMs are highly accurate, achieving less than 3% error in grade percentage on average. For providing graded feedback fine-tuned 4-bit quantized LLaMA-2 13B models outperform competitive base models and achieve high similarity with subject matter expert feedback in terms of high BLEU and ROUGE scores and qualitatively in terms of feedback. The findings from this study provide important insights into the impacts of the emerging capabilities of using quantization approaches to fine-tune LLMs for various downstream tasks, such as automatic short answer scoring and feedback generation at comparatively lower costs and latency.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Real, the Better: Aligning Large Language Models with Online Human Behaviors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00578v1)** | 2024-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model alignment is widely used and studied to avoid LLM producing unhelpful and harmful responses. However, the lengthy training process and predefined preference bias hinder adaptation to online diverse human preferences. To this end, this paper proposes an alignment framework, called Reinforcement Learning with Human Behavior (RLHB), to align LLMs by directly leveraging real online human behaviors. By taking the generative adversarial framework, the generator is trained to respond following expected human behavior; while the discriminator tries to verify whether the triplets of query, response, and human behavior come from real online environments. Behavior modeling in natural-language form and the multi-model joint training mechanism enable an active and sustainable online alignment. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of our proposed methods by both human and automatic evaluations.</p></details> | 11 pages, 6 figures |

Existing works have achieved promising progress, but two limitations remain to be solved: 1) Previous studies have been more focused on short sequential video emotion analysis while overlooking long sequential video. However, the emotions in short sequential videos only reflect instantaneous emotions, which may be deliberately guided or hidden. In contrast, long sequential videos can reveal authentic emotions; 2) Previous studies commonly utilize various signals such as facial, speech, and even sensitive biological signals (e.g., electrocardiogram). However, due to the increasing demand for privacy, developing Emotion AI without relying on sensitive signals is becoming important. To address the aforementioned limitations, in this paper, we construct a dataset for Emotion Analysis in Long-sequential and De-identity videos called EALD by collecting and processing the sequences of athletes' post-match interviews. In addition to providing annotations of the overall emotional state of each video, we also provide the Non-Facial Body Language (NFBL) annotations for each player. NFBL is an inner-driven emotional expression and can serve as an identity-free clue to understanding the emotional state. Moreover, we provide a simple but effective baseline for further research. More precisely, we evaluate the Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) with de-identification signals (e.g., visual, speech, and NFBLs) to perform emotion analysis. Our experimental results demonstrate that: 1) MLLMs can achieve comparable, even better performance than the supervised single-modal models, even in a zero-shot scenario; 2) NFBL is an important cue in long sequential emotion analysis.

| **[NumLLM: Numeric-Sensitive Large Language Model for Chinese Finance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00566v1)** | 2024-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, many works have proposed various financial large language models (FinLLMs) by pre-training from scratch or fine-tuning open-sourced LLMs on financial corpora. However, existing FinLLMs exhibit unsatisfactory performance in understanding financial text when numeric variables are involved in questions. In this paper, we propose a novel LLM, called numeric-sensitive large language model (NumLLM), for Chinese finance. We first construct a financial corpus from financial textbooks which is essential for improving numeric capability of LLMs during fine-tuning. After that, we train two individual low-rank adaptation (LoRA) modules by fine-tuning on our constructed financial corpus. One module is for adapting general-purpose LLMs to financial domain, and the other module is for enhancing the ability of NumLLM to understand financial text with numeric variables. Lastly, we merge the two LoRA modules into the foundation model to obtain NumLLM for inference. Experiments on financial question-answering benchmark show that NumLLM can boost the performance of the foundation model and can achieve the best overall performance compared to all baselines, on both numeric and non-numeric questions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Is Temperature the Creativity Parameter of Large Language Models?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00492v1)** | 2024-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are applied to all sorts of creative tasks, and their outputs vary from beautiful, to peculiar, to pastiche, into plain plagiarism. The temperature parameter of an LLM regulates the amount of randomness, leading to more diverse outputs; therefore, it is often claimed to be the creativity parameter. Here, we investigate this claim using a narrative generation task with a predetermined fixed context, model and prompt. Specifically, we present an empirical analysis of the LLM output for different temperature values using four necessary conditions for creativity in narrative generation: novelty, typicality, cohesion, and coherence. We find that temperature is weakly correlated with novelty, and unsurprisingly, moderately correlated with incoherence, but there is no relationship with either cohesion or typicality. However, the influence of temperature on creativity is far more nuanced and weak than suggested by the "creativity parameter" claim; overall results suggest that the LLM generates slightly more novel outputs as temperatures get higher. Finally, we discuss ideas to allow more controlled LLM creativity, rather than relying on chance via changing the temperature parameter.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be published in the Proceedings of the 15th International Conference on Computational Creativity (ICCC'24), 8 pages, 2 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

However, manual heuristic design is tedious and demands significant human intuition and experience. This paper introduces Evolution of Heuristic (EoH), a novel paradigm that leverages the synergy between Large Language Models (LLMs) and Evolutionary Computation (EC) for Automatic Heuristic Design (AHD). EoH represents heuristic ideas through linguistic descriptions, termed thoughts, generated by LLMs, which are then translated into executable code representations. The coevolution of thoughts and codes within an evolutionary framework offers superior AHD performance while mitigating computational expenses. Comprehensive evaluations on three types of combinatorial optimization benchmarks demonstrate EoH's outperformance against existing AHD methods. Notably, EoH surpasses FunSearch, a concurrent work focus on code evolution, identifying superior heuristics with significantly fewer computational budgets (i.e., queries to LLMs) on online bin packing problem.

While initial steps have been taken to evaluate the safety of general-knowledge LLMs, exposing some weaknesses, the safety of medical LLMs has not been sufficiently evaluated despite their high risks to personal health and safety, public health and safety, patient rights, and human rights. To address this gap, we conduct, to our knowledge, the first study of its kind to evaluate and improve the safety of medical LLMs. We find that 1) current medical LLMs do not meet standards of general or medical safety, as they readily comply with harmful requests and that 2) fine-tuning medical LLMs on safety demonstrations significantly improves their safety, reducing their tendency to comply with harmful requests. In addition, we present a definition of medical safety for LLMs and develop a benchmark dataset to evaluate and train for medical safety in LLMs. Poised at the intersection of research on machine learning safety and medical machine learning, this work casts light on the status quo of the safety of medical LLMs and motivates future work in this area, mitigating the risks of harm of LLMs in medicine.</p></details> |  |
| **[RAG-based Explainable Prediction of Road Users Behaviors for Automated Driving using Knowledge Graphs and Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00449v1)** | 2024-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prediction of road users' behaviors in the context of autonomous driving has gained considerable attention by the scientific community in the last years. Most works focus on predicting behaviors based on kinematic information alone, a simplification of the reality since road users are humans, and as such they are highly influenced by their surrounding context. In addition, a large plethora of research works rely on powerful Deep Learning techniques, which exhibit high performance metrics in prediction tasks but may lack the ability to fully understand and exploit the contextual semantic information contained in the road scene, not to mention their inability to provide explainable predictions that can be understood by humans. In this work, we propose an explainable road users' behavior prediction system that integrates the reasoning abilities of Knowledge Graphs (KG) and the expressiveness capabilities of Large Language Models (LLM) by using Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques. For that purpose, Knowledge Graph Embeddings (KGE) and Bayesian inference are combined to allow the deployment of a fully inductive reasoning system that enables the issuing of predictions that rely on legacy information contained in the graph as well as on current evidence gathered in real time by onboard sensors. Two use cases have been implemented following the proposed approach: 1) Prediction of pedestrians' crossing actions; 2) Prediction of lane change maneuvers. In both cases, the performance attained surpasses the current state of the art in terms of anticipation and F1-score, showing a promising avenue for future research in this field.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Dawn of AI-Native EDA: Opportunities and Challenges of Large Circuit Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07257v2)** | 2024-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Within the Electronic Design Automation (EDA) domain, AI-driven solutions have emerged as formidable tools, yet they typically augment rather than redefine existing methodologies. These solutions often repurpose deep learning models from other domains, such as vision, text, and graph analytics, applying them to circuit design without tailoring to the unique complexities of electronic circuits. Such an AI4EDA approach falls short of achieving a holistic design synthesis and understanding, overlooking the intricate interplay of electrical, logical, and physical facets of circuit data. This paper argues for a paradigm shift from AI4EDA towards AI-native EDA, integrating AI at the core of the design process. Pivotal to this vision is the development of a multimodal circuit representation learning technique, poised to provide a comprehensive understanding by harmonizing and extracting insights from varied data sources, such as functional specifications, RTL designs, circuit netlists, and physical layouts. We champion the creation of large circuit models (LCMs) that are inherently multimodal, crafted to decode and express the rich semantics and structures of circuit data, thus fostering more resilient, efficient, and inventive design methodologies. Embracing this AI-native philosophy, we foresee a trajectory that transcends the current innovation plateau in EDA, igniting a profound shift-left in electronic design methodology. The envisioned advancements herald not just an evolution of existing EDA tools but a revolution, giving rise to novel instruments of design tools that promise to radically enhance design productivity and inaugurate a new epoch where the optimization of circuit performance, power, and area (PPA) is achieved not incrementally, but through leaps that redefine the benchmarks of electronic systems' capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>The a...</summary><p>The authors are ordered alphabetically.

It is challenging to align personal interpretations with the intended meanings across different cultures. Our study investigates the important factors in appreciating art from a cross-cultural perspective. We explore the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) to bridge the cultural and language barriers in understanding Traditional Chinese Paintings (TCPs). We present CultiVerse, a visual analytics system that utilizes LLMs within a mixed-initiative framework, enhancing interpretative appreciation of TCP in a cross-cultural dialogue. CultiVerse addresses the challenge of translating the nuanced symbolism in art, which involves interpreting complex cultural contexts, aligning cross-cultural symbols, and validating cultural acceptance. CultiVerse integrates an interactive interface with the analytical capability of LLMs to explore a curated TCP dataset, facilitating the analysis of multifaceted symbolic meanings and the exploration of cross-cultural serendipitous discoveries. Empirical evaluations affirm that CultiVerse significantly improves cross-cultural understanding, offering deeper insights and engaging art appreciation.</p></details> |  |

However, the task of inferring state machines from network protocol implementations presents significant challenges. Traditional methods based on dynamic analysis often overlook crucial state transitions due to limited coverage, while static analysis faces difficulties with complex code structures and behaviors. To address these limitations, we propose an innovative state machine inference approach powered by Large Language Models (LLMs). Utilizing text-embedding technology, this method allows LLMs to dissect and analyze the intricacies of protocol implementation code. Through targeted prompt engineering, we systematically identify and infer the underlying state machines. Our evaluation across six protocol implementations demonstrates the method's high efficacy, achieving an accuracy rate exceeding 90% and successfully delineating differences on state machines among various implementations of the same protocol. Importantly, integrating this approach with protocol fuzzing has notably enhanced AFLNet's code coverage by 10% over RFCNLP, showcasing the considerable potential of LLMs in advancing network protocol security analysis. Our proposed method not only marks a significant step forward in accurate state machine inference but also opens new avenues for improving the security and reliability of protocol implementations.</p></details> |  |

LLMs have disrupted education and many other fields. For fear of students cheating, many have resorted to banning their use. These LLMs are also known for hallucinations. We conduct studies with ProCoT in two different courses with 65 students. The students in each course were asked to prompt an LLM of their choice with one question from a set of four and required to affirm or refute statements in the LLM output by using peer-reviewed references. The results show two things: (1) ProCoT stimulates creative/critical thinking and writing of students through engagement with LLMs when we compare the LLM-only output to ProCoT output and (2) ProCoT can prevent cheating because of clear limitations in existing LLMs, particularly ChatGPT, when we compare students' ProCoT output to LLM ProCoT output. We also discover that most students prefer to give answers in fewer words than LLMs, which are typically verbose. The average word counts for students in the first course, ChatGPT (v3.5), and Phind (v8) are 208, 391 and 383, respectively.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 figures |

Current methods for Multimodal Sarcasm Target Identification (MSTI) predominantly focus on superficial indicators in an end-to-end manner, overlooking the nuanced understanding of multimodal sarcasm conveyed through both the text and image. This paper proposes a versatile MSTI framework with a coarse-to-fine paradigm, by augmenting sarcasm explainability with reasoning and pre-training knowledge. Inspired by the powerful capacity of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) on multimodal reasoning, we first engage LMMs to generate competing rationales for coarser-grained pre-training of a small language model on multimodal sarcasm detection. We then propose fine-tuning the model for finer-grained sarcasm target identification. Our framework is thus empowered to adeptly unveil the intricate targets within multimodal sarcasm and mitigate the negative impact posed by potential noise inherently in LMMs. Experimental results demonstrate that our model far outperforms state-of-the-art MSTI methods, and markedly exhibits explainability in deciphering sarcasm as well.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 7 figures, and 18 tables</p></details> |

Moving beyond conventional methods that employ a static top-k strategy for activating experts, AdaMoLE dynamically adjusts the activation threshold using a dedicated threshold network, adaptively responding to the varying complexities of different tasks. By replacing a single LoRA in a layer with multiple LoRA experts and integrating a gating function with the threshold mechanism, AdaMoLE effectively selects and activates the most appropriate experts based on the input context. Our extensive evaluations across a variety of commonsense reasoning and natural language processing tasks show that AdaMoLE exceeds baseline performance. This enhancement highlights the advantages of AdaMoLE's adaptive selection of LoRA experts, improving model effectiveness without a corresponding increase in the expert count. The experimental validation not only confirms AdaMoLE as a robust approach for enhancing LLMs but also suggests valuable directions for future research in adaptive expert selection mechanisms, potentially broadening the scope for optimizing model performance across diverse language processing tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Distillation Matters: Empowering Sequential Recommenders to Match the Performance of Large Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00338v1)** | 2024-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Owing to their powerful semantic reasoning capabilities, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been effectively utilized as recommenders, achieving impressive performance. However, the high inference latency of LLMs significantly restricts their practical deployment. To address this issue, this work investigates knowledge distillation from cumbersome LLM-based recommendation models to lightweight conventional sequential models. It encounters three challenges: 1) the teacher's knowledge may not always be reliable; 2) the capacity gap between the teacher and student makes it difficult for the student to assimilate the teacher's knowledge; 3) divergence in semantic space poses a challenge to distill the knowledge from embeddings. To tackle these challenges, this work proposes a novel distillation strategy, DLLM2Rec, specifically tailored for knowledge distillation from LLM-based recommendation models to conventional sequential models. DLLM2Rec comprises: 1) Importance-aware ranking distillation, which filters reliable and student-friendly knowledge by weighting instances according to teacher confidence and student-teacher consistency; 2) Collaborative embedding distillation integrates knowledge from teacher embeddings with collaborative signals mined from the data. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed DLLM2Rec, boosting three typical sequential models with an average improvement of 47.97%, even enabling them to surpass LLM-based recommenders in some cases.</p></details> | 10 pages, 2 figures |

Such systems cannot actively reason and comprehend implicit user intention. In this work, we propose a new segmentation task -- reasoning segmentation. The task is designed to output a segmentation mask given a complex and implicit query text. Furthermore, we establish a benchmark comprising over one thousand image-instruction-mask data samples, incorporating intricate reasoning and world knowledge for evaluation purposes. Finally, we present LISA: large Language Instructed Segmentation Assistant, which inherits the language generation capabilities of multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs) while also possessing the ability to produce segmentation masks. We expand the original vocabulary with a <SEG> token and propose the embedding-as-mask paradigm to unlock the segmentation capability. Remarkably, LISA can handle cases involving complex reasoning and world knowledge. Also, it demonstrates robust zero-shot capability when trained exclusively on reasoning-free datasets. In addition, fine-tuning the model with merely 239 reasoning segmentation data samples results in further performance enhancement. Both quantitative and qualitative experiments show our method effectively unlocks new reasoning segmentation capabilities for multimodal LLMs. Code, models, and data are available at https://github.com/dvlab-research/LISA.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code,...</summary><p>Code, models, and data are available at https://github.com/dvlab-research/LISA</p></details> |

However, given the challenge of solving Nash equilibria for large population games, existing works with guaranteed polynomial complexities either focus on variants of zero-sum and potential games, or aim at solving (coarse) correlated equilibria, or require access to simulators, or rely on certain assumptions that are hard to verify. This work proposes MF-OML (Mean-Field Occupation-Measure Learning), an online mean-field reinforcement learning algorithm for computing approximate Nash equilibria of large population sequential symmetric games. MF-OML is the first fully polynomial multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm for provably solving Nash equilibria (up to mean-field approximation gaps that vanish as the number of players $N$ goes to infinity) beyond variants of zero-sum and potential games. When evaluated by the cumulative deviation from Nash equilibria, the algorithm is shown to achieve a high probability regret bound of $\tilde{O}(M^{3/4}+N^{-1/2}M)$ for games with the strong Lasry-Lions monotonicity condition, and a regret bound of $\tilde{O}(M^{11/12}+N^{- 1/6}M)$ for games with only the Lasry-Lions monotonicity condition, where $M$ is the total number of episodes and $N$ is the number of agents of the game. As a byproduct, we also obtain the first tractable globally convergent computational algorithm for computing approximate Nash equilibria of monotone mean-field games.</p></details> |  |

Despite the excellent performance achieved by off-the-shell VOS models, existing VOS benchmarks mainly focus on short-term videos lasting about 5 seconds, where objects remain visible most of the time. However, these benchmarks poorly represent practical applications, and the absence of long-term datasets restricts further investigation of VOS in realistic scenarios. Thus, we propose a novel benchmark named LVOS, comprising 720 videos with 296,401 frames and 407,945 high-quality annotations. Videos in LVOS last 1.14 minutes on average, approximately 5 times longer than videos in existing datasets. Each video includes various attributes, especially challenges deriving from the wild, such as long-term reappearing and cross-temporal similar objects. Compared to previous benchmarks, our LVOS better reflects VOS models' performance in real scenarios. Based on LVOS, we evaluate 20 existing VOS models under 4 different settings and conduct a comprehensive analysis. On LVOS, these models suffer a large performance drop, highlighting the challenge of achieving precise tracking and segmentation in real-world scenarios. Attribute-based analysis indicates that key factor to accuracy decline is the increased video length, emphasizing LVOS's crucial role. We hope our LVOS can advance development of VOS in real scenes. Data and code are available at https://lingyihongfd.github.io/lvos.github.io/.</p></details> | LVOS V2 |

The ability to flexibly adjust their attitudes is essential for underwater robots to effectively accomplish tasks in confined space. However, the highly coupled six degrees of freedom dynamics resulting from attitude changes and the complex turbulence within limited spatial areas present significant challenges. To address the problem of attitude control of underwater robots, this letter investigates large-range pitch angle tracking during station holding as well as simultaneous roll and yaw angle control to enable versatile attitude adjustments. Based on dynamic modeling, this letter proposes an adaptive integral sliding mode controller (AISMC) that integrates an integral module into traditional sliding mode control (SMC) and adaptively adjusts the switching gain for improved tracking accuracy, reduced chattering, and enhanced robustness. The stability of the closed-loop control system is established through Lyapunov analysis. Extensive experiments and comparison studies are conducted using a commercial remotely operated vehicle (ROV), the results of which demonstrate that AISMC achieves satisfactory performance in attitude tracking control in confined space with unknown disturbances, significantly outperforming both PID and SMC.</p></details> |  |

In this response, we provide counterexamples of the letter string analogies. In our tests, GPT-3 fails to solve simplest variations of the original tasks, whereas human performance remains consistently high across all modified versions.

Existing methods are mostly trained on synthetic datasets, which perform poorly in real scenes. In this work, to facilitate the development of real-world HDR video reconstruction, we present Real-HDRV, a large-scale real-world benchmark dataset for HDR video reconstruction, featuring various scenes, diverse motion patterns, and high-quality labels. Specifically, our dataset contains 500 LDRs-HDRs video pairs, comprising about 28,000 LDR frames and 4,000 HDR labels, covering daytime, nighttime, indoor, and outdoor scenes. To our best knowledge, our dataset is the largest real-world HDR video reconstruction dataset. Correspondingly, we propose an end-to-end network for HDR video reconstruction, where a novel two-stage strategy is designed to perform alignment sequentially. Specifically, the first stage performs global alignment with the adaptively estimated global offsets, reducing the difficulty of subsequent alignment. The second stage implicitly performs local alignment in a coarse-to-fine manner at the feature level using the adaptive separable convolution. Extensive experiments demonstrate that: (1) models trained on our dataset can achieve better performance on real scenes than those trained on synthetic datasets; (2) our method outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods.

We conduct a computational study and present comparative results showing the characteristics of the developed approaches. Furthermore, we apply our algorithm to related benchmark instances from the literature to show the efficacy. Finally, we solve very large-scale instances and derive insights on upper-bound improvements regarding fleet sizing and customer delay acceptance from a practical perspective.</p></details> |  |

However, harnessing them to learn complex low-level manipulation tasks, such as dexterous pen spinning, remains an open problem. We bridge this fundamental gap and present Eureka, a human-level reward design algorithm powered by LLMs. Eureka exploits the remarkable zero-shot generation, code-writing, and in-context improvement capabilities of state-of-the-art LLMs, such as GPT-4, to perform evolutionary optimization over reward code. The resulting rewards can then be used to acquire complex skills via reinforcement learning. Without any task-specific prompting or pre-defined reward templates, Eureka generates reward functions that outperform expert human-engineered rewards. In a diverse suite of 29 open-source RL environments that include 10 distinct robot morphologies, Eureka outperforms human experts on 83% of the tasks, leading to an average normalized improvement of 52%. The generality of Eureka also enables a new gradient-free in-context learning approach to reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), readily incorporating human inputs to improve the quality and the safety of the generated rewards without model updating. Finally, using Eureka rewards in a curriculum learning setting, we demonstrate for the first time, a simulated Shadow Hand capable of performing pen spinning tricks, adeptly manipulating a pen in circles at rapid speed.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2024.

| **[Retroformer: Retrospective Large Language Agents with Policy Gradient Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02151v2)** | 2024-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent months have seen the emergence of a powerful new trend in which large language models (LLMs) are augmented to become autonomous language agents capable of performing objective oriented multi-step tasks on their own, rather than merely responding to queries from human users. Most existing language agents, however, are not optimized using environment-specific rewards. Although some agents enable iterative refinement through verbal feedback, they do not reason and plan in ways that are compatible with gradient-based learning from rewards. This paper introduces a principled framework for reinforcing large language agents by learning a retrospective model, which automatically tunes the language agent prompts from environment feedback through policy gradient. Specifically, our proposed agent architecture learns from rewards across multiple environments and tasks, for fine-tuning a pre-trained language model which refines the language agent prompt by summarizing the root cause of prior failed attempts and proposing action plans. Experimental results on various tasks demonstrate that the language agents improve over time and that our approach considerably outperforms baselines that do not properly leverage gradients from the environment. This demonstrates that using policy gradient optimization to improve language agents, for which we believe our work is one of the first, seems promising and can be applied to optimize other models in the agent architecture to enhance agent performances over time.</p></details> |  |

However, the substantial requirements for computational power and storage have discouraged its widespread use. Moreover, increasing evidence of catastrophic forgetting and overparameterization in the Transformer architecture has motivated researchers to seek more efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods. Commonly known parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods like LoRA and BitFit are typically applied across all layers of the model. We propose a PEFT method, called Stratified Progressive Adaptation Fine-tuning (SPAFIT), based on the localization of different types of linguistic knowledge to specific layers of the model. Our experiments, conducted on nine tasks from the GLUE benchmark, show that our proposed SPAFIT method outperforms other PEFT methods while fine-tuning only a fraction of the parameters adjusted by other methods.</p></details> |  |

It undermines public trust in science and democracy, particularly on social media, where it can spread rapidly. High-quality and timely correction of misinformation that identifies and explains its (in)accuracies has been shown to effectively reduce false beliefs. Despite the wide acceptance of manual correction, it is difficult to be timely and scalable, a concern as technologies like large language models (LLMs) make misinformation easier to produce. LLMs also have versatile capabilities that could accelerate misinformation correction-however, they struggle due to a lack of recent information, a tendency to produce false content, and limitations in addressing multimodal information. We propose MUSE, an LLM augmented with access to and credibility evaluation of up-to-date information. By retrieving evidence as refutations or contexts, MUSE identifies and explains (in)accuracies in a piece of content-not presupposed to be misinformation-with references. It also describes images and conducts multimodal searches to verify and correct multimodal content. Fact-checking experts evaluate responses to social media content that are not presupposed to be (non-)misinformation but broadly include incorrect, partially correct, and correct posts, that may or may not be misleading. We propose and evaluate 13 dimensions of misinformation correction quality, ranging from the accuracy of identifications and factuality of explanations to the relevance and credibility of references. The results demonstrate MUSE's ability to promptly write high-quality responses to potential misinformation on social media-overall, MUSE outperforms GPT-4 by 37% and even high-quality responses from laypeople by 29%. This work reveals LLMs' potential to help combat real-world misinformation effectively and efficiently.</p></details> | 53 pages |
| **[Towards a Search Engine for Machines: Unified Ranking for Multiple Retrieval-Augmented Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00175v1)** | 2024-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces uRAG--a framework with a unified retrieval engine that serves multiple downstream retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems. Each RAG system consumes the retrieval results for a unique purpose, such as open-domain question answering, fact verification, entity linking, and relation extraction. We introduce a generic training guideline that standardizes the communication between the search engine and the downstream RAG systems that engage in optimizing the retrieval model. This lays the groundwork for us to build a large-scale experimentation ecosystem consisting of 18 RAG systems that engage in training and 18 unknown RAG systems that use the uRAG as the new users of the search engine. Using this experimentation ecosystem, we answer a number of fundamental research questions that improve our understanding of promises and challenges in developing search engines for machines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploring Concept Depth: How Large Language Models Acquire Knowledge at Different Layers?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07066v2)** | 2024-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performances across a wide range of tasks. However, the mechanisms by which these models encode tasks of varying complexities remain poorly understood. In this paper, we explore the hypothesis that LLMs process concepts of varying complexities in different layers, introducing the idea of "Concept Depth" to suggest that more complex concepts are typically acquired in deeper layers. Specifically, we categorize concepts based on their level of abstraction, defining them in the order of increasing complexity within factual, emotional, and inferential tasks. We conduct extensive probing experiments using layer-wise representations across various LLM families (Gemma, LLaMA, QWen) on various datasets spanning the three domains of tasks. Our findings reveal that models could efficiently conduct probing for simpler tasks in shallow layers, and more complex tasks typically necessitate deeper layers for accurate understanding. Additionally, we examine how external factors, such as adding noise to the input and quantizing the model weights, might affect layer-wise representations. Our findings suggest that these factors can impede the development of a conceptual understanding of LLMs until deeper layers are explored. We hope that our proposed concept and experimental insights will enhance the understanding of the mechanisms underlying LLMs. Our codes are available at https://github.com/Luckfort/CD.</p></details> | 12 pages |

Monostatic detection at the base station (BS) is considered. At the BS, we receive two signals: the communication-mode uplink signal to be decoded and the radar-mode signal to be detected. After self-interference cancellation (SIC), inspired by NOMA, successive interference cancellation (SuIC) is a natural strategy at the BS to retrieve both signals. However, the ordering of SuIC, usually based on some measure of channel strength, is not clear as the radar-mode target is unknown. The detection signal suffers a double path-loss making it vulnerable, but the uplink signal to be decoded originates at a user which has much lower power than the BS making it weak as well. Further, the intercell interference from a large network reduces the channel disparity between the two signals. We investigate the impact of both SuIC orders at the BS, i.e., decoding $1^{st}$ or detecting $1^{st}$ and highlight the importance of careful order selection. We find the existence of a threshold target distance before which detecting $1^{st}$ is superior and decoding $2^{nd}$ does not suffer much. After this distance, both decoding $1^{st}$ and detecting $2^{nd}$ is superior. Similarly, a threshold UE power exists after which the optimum SuIC order changes. We consider imperfections in SIC; this helps highlight the vulnerability of the decoding and detection in the setup.</p></details> |  |

Numerous companies depend on third-party vendors and service providers to carry out critical functions within their operations, encompassing tasks such as data handling and storage. However, this reliance introduces potential vulnerabilities, as these vendors' security measures and practices may not always align with the standards expected by regulatory bodies. Businesses are required, often under the penalty of law, to ensure compliance with the evolving regulatory rules. Interpreting and implementing these regulations pose challenges due to their complexity. Regulatory documents are extensive, demanding significant effort for interpretation, while vendor-drafted privacy policies often lack the detail required for full legal compliance, leading to ambiguity. To ensure a concise interpretation of the regulatory requirements and compliance of organizational privacy policy with said regulations, we propose a Large Language Model (LLM) and Semantic Web based approach for privacy compliance. In this paper, we develop the novel Privacy Policy Compliance Verification Knowledge Graph, PrivComp-KG. It is designed to efficiently store and retrieve comprehensive information concerning privacy policies, regulatory frameworks, and domain-specific knowledge pertaining to the legal landscape of privacy. Using Retrieval Augmented Generation, we identify the relevant sections in a privacy policy with corresponding regulatory rules. This information about individual privacy policies is populated into the PrivComp-KG. Combining this with the domain context and rules, the PrivComp-KG can be queried to check for compliance with privacy policies by each vendor against relevant policy regulations. We demonstrate the relevance of the PrivComp-KG, by verifying compliance of privacy policy documents for various organizations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Better & Faster Large Language Models via Multi-token Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19737v1)** | 2024-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models such as GPT and Llama are trained with a next-token prediction loss. In this work, we suggest that training language models to predict multiple future tokens at once results in higher sample efficiency. More specifically, at each position in the training corpus, we ask the model to predict the following n tokens using n independent output heads, operating on top of a shared model trunk. Considering multi-token prediction as an auxiliary training task, we measure improved downstream capabilities with no overhead in training time for both code and natural language models. The method is increasingly useful for larger model sizes, and keeps its appeal when training for multiple epochs. Gains are especially pronounced on generative benchmarks like coding, where our models consistently outperform strong baselines by several percentage points. Our 13B parameter models solves 12 % more problems on HumanEval and 17 % more on MBPP than comparable next-token models. Experiments on small algorithmic tasks demonstrate that multi-token prediction is favorable for the development of induction heads and algorithmic reasoning capabilities. As an additional benefit, models trained with 4-token prediction are up to 3 times faster at inference, even with large batch sizes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Selective Parallel Loading of Large-Scale Compressed Graphs with ParaGrapher](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19735v1)** | 2024-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Comprehensive evaluation is one of the basis of experimental science. In High-Performance Graph Processing, a thorough evaluation of contributions becomes more achievable by supporting common input formats over different frameworks. However, each framework creates its specific format, which may not support reading large-scale real-world graph datasets. This shows a demand for high-performance libraries capable of loading graphs to (i)~accelerate designing new graph algorithms, (ii)~to evaluate the contributions on a wide range of graph algorithms, and (iii)~to facilitate easy and fast comparison over different graph frameworks. To that end, we present ParaGrapher, a high-performance API and library for loading large-scale and compressed graphs. ParaGrapher supports different types of requests for accessing graphs in shared- and distributed-memory and out-of-core graph processing. We explain the design of ParaGrapher and present a performance model of graph decompression, which is used for evaluation of ParaGrapher over three storage types. Our evaluation shows that by decompressing compressed graphs in WebGraph format, ParaGrapher delivers up to 3.2 times speedup in loading and up to 5.2 times speedup in end-to-end execution in comparison to the binary and textual formats. ParaGrapher is available online on https://blogs.qub.ac.uk/DIPSA/ParaGrapher/.</p></details> |  |

Traditionally, developing these scenarios was a time-intensive process with limited flexibility to meet diverse educational needs. The proposed approach utilizes AI to efficiently generate detailed, clinically relevant scenarios that are tailored to specific educational objectives. This innovation has significantly reduced the time and resources required for scenario development, allowing for a broader variety of simulations. Preliminary feedback from educators and learners has shown enhanced engagement and improved knowledge acquisition, confirming the effectiveness of this AI-enhanced methodology in simulation-based learning.

Our model features a very simple transformer-based architecture; we patchify input posed images, pass the concatenated multi-view image tokens through a sequence of transformer blocks, and decode final per-pixel Gaussian parameters directly from these tokens for differentiable rendering. In contrast to previous LRMs that can only reconstruct objects, by predicting per-pixel Gaussians, GS-LRM naturally handles scenes with large variations in scale and complexity. We show that our model can work on both object and scene captures by training it on Objaverse and RealEstate10K respectively. In both scenarios, the models outperform state-of-the-art baselines by a wide margin. We also demonstrate applications of our model in downstream 3D generation tasks.

| **[How good are Large Language Models on African Languages?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07978v2)** | 2024-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in natural language processing have led to the proliferation of large language models (LLMs). These models have been shown to yield good performance, using in-context learning, even on tasks and languages they are not trained on. However, their performance on African languages is largely understudied relative to high-resource languages. We present an analysis of four popular large language models (mT0, Aya, LLaMa 2, and GPT-4) on six tasks (topic classification, sentiment classification, machine translation, summarization, question answering, and named entity recognition) across 60 African languages, spanning different language families and geographical regions. Our results suggest that all LLMs produce lower performance for African languages, and there is a large gap in performance compared to high-resource languages (such as English) for most tasks. We find that GPT-4 has an average to good performance on classification tasks, yet its performance on generative tasks such as machine translation and summarization is significantly lacking. Surprisingly, we find that mT0 had the best overall performance for cross-lingual QA, better than the state-of-the-art supervised model (i.e. fine-tuned mT5) and GPT-4 on African languages. Similarly, we find the recent Aya model to have comparable result to mT0 in almost all tasks except for topic classification where it outperform mT0. Overall, LLaMa 2 showed the worst performance, which we believe is due to its English and code-centric~(around 98%) pre-training corpus. Our findings confirms that performance on African languages continues to remain a hurdle for the current LLMs, underscoring the need for additional efforts to close this gap.</p></details> | Under review |

In this work, we introduce SwordsmanImp, the first Chinese multi-turn-dialogue-based dataset aimed at conversational implicature, sourced from dialogues in the Chinese sitcom $\textit{My Own Swordsman}$. It includes 200 carefully handcrafted questions, all annotated on which Gricean maxims have been violated. We test eight close-source and open-source LLMs under two tasks: a multiple-choice question task and an implicature explanation task. Our results show that GPT-4 attains human-level accuracy (94%) on multiple-choice questions. CausalLM demonstrates a 78.5% accuracy following GPT-4. Other models, including GPT-3.5 and several open-source models, demonstrate a lower accuracy ranging from 20% to 60% on multiple-choice questions. Human raters were asked to rate the explanation of the implicatures generated by LLMs on their reasonability, logic and fluency. While all models generate largely fluent and self-consistent text, their explanations score low on reasonability except for GPT-4, suggesting that most LLMs cannot produce satisfactory explanations of the implicatures in the conversation. Moreover, we find LLMs' performance does not vary significantly by Gricean maxims, suggesting that LLMs do not seem to process implicatures derived from different maxims differently.

Probing for Entailed Arithmetical Relationships](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19432v1)** | 2024-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Two major areas of interest in the era of Large Language Models regard questions of what do LLMs know, and if and how they may be able to reason (or rather, approximately reason). Since to date these lines of work progressed largely in parallel (with notable exceptions), we are interested in investigating the intersection: probing for reasoning about the implicitly-held knowledge. Suspecting the performance to be lacking in this area, we use a very simple set-up of comparisons between cardinalities associated with elements of various subjects (e.g. the number of legs a bird has versus the number of wheels on a tricycle). We empirically demonstrate that although LLMs make steady progress in knowledge acquisition and (pseudo)reasoning with each new GPT release, their capabilities are limited to statistical inference only. It is difficult to argue that pure statistical learning can cope with the combinatorial explosion inherent in many commonsense reasoning tasks, especially once arithmetical notions are involved. Further, we argue that bigger is not always better and chasing purely statistical improvements is flawed at the core, since it only exacerbates the dangerous conflation of the production of correct answers with genuine reasoning ability.</p></details> |  |

This research investigates the Telugu language proficiency of ChatGPT and Gemini, two leading LLMs. Through a designed set of 20 questions encompassing greetings, grammar, vocabulary, common phrases, task completion, and situational reasoning, the study delves into their strengths and weaknesses in handling Telugu. The analysis aims to identify the LLM that demonstrates a deeper understanding of Telugu grammatical structures, possesses a broader vocabulary, and exhibits superior performance in tasks like writing and reasoning. By comparing their ability to comprehend and use everyday Telugu expressions, the research sheds light on their suitability for real-world language interaction. Furthermore, the evaluation of adaptability and reasoning capabilities provides insights into how each LLM leverages Telugu to respond to dynamic situations. This comparative analysis contributes to the ongoing discussion on multilingual capabilities in AI and paves the way for future research in developing LLMs that can seamlessly integrate with Telugu-speaking communities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploring Multi-Lingual Bias of Large Code Models in Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19368v1)** | 2024-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code generation aims to synthesize code and fulfill functional requirements based on natural language (NL) specifications, which can greatly improve development efficiency. In the era of large language models (LLMs), large code models (LCMs) have been recently proposed to generate source code. LCMs can generate highly feasible solutions for programming problems described in natural language. Despite the effectiveness, we observe a noticeable multilingual bias in the generation performance of LCMs. Specifically, LCMs demonstrate proficiency in generating solutions when provided with instructions in English, yet may falter when faced with semantically equivalent instructions in other NLs such as Chinese. Moreover, the ability of LCMs to generate code exhibits variety across different programming languages (PLs), such as Python and C++. The observed phenomenon indicates the presence of multi-lingual bias within the generative capabilities of LCMs, which has remained unexplored. In this paper, we aim to investigate the multi-lingual bias that exists in current LCMs. First, we initiate our investigation by constructing the first multi-lingual evaluation benchmark X-HumanEval-X, enabling us to systematically evaluate the extent of multi-lingual bias that exists in current LCMs. In our large-scale experiments on nine popular LCMs, we observe a pronounced multi-lingual bias of LCMs in code generation, including multi-NL and multi-PL bias. Specifically, when using Chinese instructions, the code generation capabilities of LCMs decrease by at least 13% in terms of the Pass@1 metric. Furthermore, LCMs perform variously across different programming languages, e.g., the performance gap between Python and C++ reaches as high as 20.9%. ...</p></details> | 12 pages |

Despite their growing popularity in recent years, existing attempts, while effective at recognizing images within the same patent, fail to deliver practical value due to their limited generalizability in retrieving relevant prior art. Moreover, this task inherently involves the challenges posed by the abstract visual features of patent images, the skewed distribution of image classifications, and the semantic information of image descriptions. Therefore, we propose a language-informed, distribution-aware multimodal approach to patent image feature learning, which enriches the semantic understanding of patent image by integrating Large Language Models and improves the performance of underrepresented classes with our proposed distribution-aware contrastive losses. Extensive experiments on DeepPatent2 dataset show that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art or comparable performance in image-based patent retrieval with mAP +53.3%, Recall@10 +41.8%, and MRR@10 +51.9%. Furthermore, through an in-depth user analysis, we explore our model in aiding patent professionals in their image retrieval efforts, highlighting the model's real-world applicability and effectiveness.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages.

Our findings reveal that several large language models (e.g., GPT-4, Claude 3) are able to perform regression tasks with a performance rivaling (or even outperforming) that of traditional supervised methods such as Random Forest, Bagging, or Gradient Boosting. For example, on the challenging Friedman #2 regression dataset, Claude 3 outperforms many supervised methods such as AdaBoost, SVM, Random Forest, KNN, or Gradient Boosting. We then investigate how well the performance of large language models scales with the number of in-context exemplars. We borrow from the notion of regret from online learning and empirically show that LLMs are capable of obtaining a sub-linear regret.</p></details> | <details><summary>50 pa...</summary><p>50 pages, 48 figures, preprint; Fixed typos</p></details> |

However, existing models proposed in the spatial extremes literature often assume that extremal dependence persists across the entire domain. This is a strong limitation when modeling extremes over large geographical domains, and yet it has been mostly overlooked in the literature. We here develop a more realistic Bayesian framework based on a novel Gaussian scale mixture model, with the Gaussian process component defined by a stochastic partial differential equation yielding a sparse precision matrix, and the random scale component modeled as a low-rank Pareto-tailed or Weibull-tailed spatial process determined by compactly-supported basis functions. We show that our proposed model is approximately tail-stationary and that it can capture a wide range of extremal dependence structures. Its inherently sparse structure allows fast Bayesian computations in high spatial dimensions based on a customized Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm prioritizing calibration in the tail. We fit our model to analyze heavy monsoon rainfall data in Bangladesh. Our study shows that our model outperforms natural competitors and that it fits precipitation extremes well. We finally use the fitted model to draw inference on long-term return levels for marginal precipitation and spatial aggregates.</p></details> |  |
| **[Stick to Your Role! Context-dependence and Stability of Personal Value Expression in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14846v3)** | 2024-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The standard way to study Large Language Models (LLMs) with benchmarks or psychology questionnaires is to provide many different queries from similar minimal contexts (e.g. multiple choice questions). However, due to LLMs' highly context-dependent nature, conclusions from such minimal-context evaluations may be little informative about the model's behavior in deployment (where it will be exposed to many new contexts). We argue that context-dependence (specifically, value stability) should be studied a specific property of LLMs and used as another dimension of LLM comparison (alongside others such as cognitive abilities, knowledge, or model size). We present a case-study on the stability of value expression over different contexts (simulated conversations on different topics) as measured using a standard psychology questionnaire (PVQ) and on behavioral downstream tasks. Reusing methods from psychology, we study Rank-order stability on the population (interpersonal) level, and Ipsative stability on the individual (intrapersonal) level. We consider two settings (with and without instructing LLMs to simulate particular personas), two simulated populations, and three downstream tasks. We observe consistent trends in the stability of models and model families - Mixtral, Mistral, GPT-3.5 and Qwen families are more stable than LLaMa-2 and Phi. The consistency of these trends implies that some models exhibit higher value-stability than others, and that value stability can be estimated with the set of introduced methodological tools. When instructed to simulate particular personas, LLMs exhibit low Rank-Order stability, which further diminishes with conversation length. This highlights the need for future research on LLMs that coherently simulate different personas. This paper provides a foundational step in that direction, and, to our knowledge, it is the first study of value stability in LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The project website and code are available at https://sites.google.com/view/llmvaluestability</p></details> |
| **[ComPile: A Large IR Dataset from Production Sources](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15432v2)** | 2024-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code is increasingly becoming a core data modality of modern machine learning research impacting not only the way we write code with conversational agents like OpenAI's ChatGPT, Google's Bard, or Anthropic's Claude, the way we translate code from one language into another, but also the compiler infrastructure underlying the language. While modeling approaches may vary and representations differ, the targeted tasks often remain the same within the individual classes of models. Relying solely on the ability of modern models to extract information from unstructured code does not take advantage of 70 years of programming language and compiler development by not utilizing the structure inherent to programs in the data collection. This detracts from the performance of models working over a tokenized representation of input code and precludes the use of these models in the compiler itself. To work towards the first intermediate representation (IR) based models, we fully utilize the LLVM compiler infrastructure, shared by a number of languages, to generate a 182B token dataset of LLVM IR. We generated this dataset from programming languages built on the shared LLVM infrastructure, including Rust, Swift, Julia, and C/C++, by hooking into LLVM code generation either through the language's package manager or the compiler directly to extract the dataset of intermediate representations from production grade programs. Statistical analysis proves the utility of our dataset not only for large language model training, but also for the introspection into the code generation process itself with the dataset showing great promise for machine-learned compiler components.</p></details> |  |

However, the application of large language models in the Intellectual Property (IP) space is challenging due to the strong need for specialized knowledge, privacy protection, processing of extremely long text in this field. In this technical report, we present for the first time a low-cost, standardized procedure for training IP-oriented LLMs, meeting the unique requirements of the IP domain. Using this standard process, we have trained the PatentGPT series models based on open-source pretrained models. By evaluating them on the open-source IP-oriented benchmark MOZIP, our domain-specific LLMs outperforms GPT-4, indicating the effectiveness of the proposed training procedure and the expertise of the PatentGPT models in the IP demain. What is impressive is that our model significantly outperformed GPT-4 on the 2019 China Patent Agent Qualification Examination by achieving a score of 65, reaching the level of human experts. Additionally, the PatentGPT model, which utilizes the SMoE architecture, achieves performance comparable to that of GPT-4 in the IP domain and demonstrates a better cost-performance ratio on long-text tasks, potentially serving as an alternative to GPT-4 within the IP domain.</p></details> | 19 pages, 9 figures |

Natural language queries formed to extract information from a KB entail starting from specific nodes and reasoning over multiple edges of the corresponding KG to arrive at the correct set of answer nodes. Traditional approaches of question answering on KG are based on (a) semantic parsing (SP), where a logical form (e.g., S-expression, SPARQL query, etc.) is generated using node and edge embeddings and then reasoning over these representations or tuning language models to generate the final answer directly, or (b) information-retrieval based that works by extracting entities and relations sequentially. In this work, we evaluate the capability of (LLMs) to answer questions over KG that involve multiple hops. We show that depending upon the size and nature of the KG we need different approaches to extract and feed the relevant information to an LLM since every LLM comes with a fixed context window. We evaluate our approach on six KGs with and without the availability of example-specific sub-graphs and show that both the IR and SP-based methods can be adopted by LLMs resulting in an extremely competitive performance.</p></details> |  |

Understanding 3D referring expressions is challenging -- it requires the ability to both parse the 3D structure of the scene and correctly ground free-form language in the presence of distraction and clutter. We introduce Transcrib3D, an approach that brings together 3D detection methods and the emergent reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Transcrib3D uses text as the unifying medium, which allows us to sidestep the need to learn shared representations connecting multi-modal inputs, which would require massive amounts of annotated 3D data. As a demonstration of its effectiveness, Transcrib3D achieves state-of-the-art results on 3D reference resolution benchmarks, with a great leap in performance from previous multi-modality baselines. To improve upon zero-shot performance and facilitate local deployment on edge computers and robots, we propose self-correction for fine-tuning that trains smaller models, resulting in performance close to that of large models. We show that our method enables a real robot to perform pick-and-place tasks given queries that contain challenging referring expressions.

Our study involves a combination of between-subject prompt and historic consumption assessments, along with within-subject recommendation scenario evaluations. By examining conversation and survey response data from 160 active users, we find that LLMs offer strong recommendation explainability but lack overall personalization, diversity, and user trust. Our results also indicate that different personalized prompting techniques do not significantly affect user-perceived recommendation quality, but the number of movies a user has watched plays a more significant role. Furthermore, LLMs show a greater ability to recommend lesser-known or niche movies. Through qualitative analysis, we identify key conversational patterns linked to positive and negative user interaction experiences and conclude that providing personal context and examples is crucial for obtaining high-quality recommendations from LLMs.</p></details> |  |

Two recent commentaries have challenged these results, citing evidence from so-called `counterfactual' tasks in which the standard sequence of the alphabet is arbitrarily permuted so as to decrease similarity with materials that may have been present in the language model's training data. Here, we reply to these critiques, clarifying some misunderstandings about the test materials used in our original work, and presenting evidence that language models are also capable of generalizing to these new counterfactual task variants.</p></details> |  |

Despite these promising developments, MLLMs often generate outputs that are inconsistent with the visual content, a challenge known as hallucination, which poses substantial obstacles to their practical deployment and raises concerns regarding their reliability in real-world applications. This problem has attracted increasing attention, prompting efforts to detect and mitigate such inaccuracies. We review recent advances in identifying, evaluating, and mitigating these hallucinations, offering a detailed overview of the underlying causes, evaluation benchmarks, metrics, and strategies developed to address this issue. Additionally, we analyze the current challenges and limitations, formulating open questions that delineate potential pathways for future research. By drawing the granular classification and landscapes of hallucination causes, evaluation benchmarks, and mitigation methods, this survey aims to deepen the understanding of hallucinations in MLLMs and inspire further advancements in the field. Through our thorough and in-depth review, we contribute to the ongoing dialogue on enhancing the robustness and reliability of MLLMs, providing valuable insights and resources for researchers and practitioners alike.

However, existing 3D assets and generative models often lack authentic material properties. Manual assignment of materials using graphic software is a tedious and time-consuming task. In this paper, we exploit advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), particularly GPT-4V, to present a novel approach, Make-it-Real: 1) We demonstrate that GPT-4V can effectively recognize and describe materials, allowing the construction of a detailed material library. 2) Utilizing a combination of visual cues and hierarchical text prompts, GPT-4V precisely identifies and aligns materials with the corresponding components of 3D objects. 3) The correctly matched materials are then meticulously applied as reference for the new SVBRDF material generation according to the original diffuse map, significantly enhancing their visual authenticity. Make-it-Real offers a streamlined integration into the 3D content creation workflow, showcasing its utility as an essential tool for developers of 3D assets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://sunzey.github.io/Make-it-Real/</p></details> |

In this position piece we aim to shift the ML research community's priorities ever so slightly to a different modality: tabular data. Tabular data is the dominant modality in many fields, yet it is given hardly any research attention and significantly lags behind in terms of scale and power. We believe the time is now to start developing tabular foundation models, or what we coin a Large Tabular Model (LTM). LTMs could revolutionise the way science and ML use tabular data: not as single datasets that are analyzed in a vacuum, but contextualized with respect to related datasets. The potential impact is far-reaching: from few-shot tabular models to automating data science; from out-of-distribution synthetic data to empowering multidisciplinary scientific discovery. We intend to excite reflections on the modalities we study, and convince some researchers to study large tabular models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2024)</p></details> |

In the real world, spatial understanding is often an ill-posed problem. There are a number of powerful classical methods that accurately regress relative pose, however, these approaches often lack the ability to leverage data-derived priors to resolve ambiguities. In multi-robot systems, these challenges are exacerbated by the need for accurate and frequent position estimates of cooperating agents. To this end, we propose CoViS-Net, a cooperative, multi-robot, visual spatial foundation model that learns spatial priors from data. Unlike prior work evaluated primarily on offline datasets, we design our model specifically for online evaluation and real-world deployment on cooperative robots. Our model is completely decentralized, platform agnostic, executable in real-time using onboard compute, and does not require existing network infrastructure. In this work, we focus on relative pose estimation and local Bird's Eye View (BEV) prediction tasks. Unlike classical approaches, we show that our model can accurately predict relative poses without requiring camera overlap, and predict BEVs of regions not visible to the ego-agent. We demonstrate our model on a multi-robot formation control task outside the confines of the laboratory.</p></details> |  |

Inspired by human sensorimotor adaptation mechanisms, we aim to train encoder-decoder networks that can be commonly used to learn novel motor skills in a single movement category. To train the policy network, we develop the multitask reinforcement learning method, where the policy needs to cope with changes in goals or environments with different reward functions or physical parameters of the environment in dynamic movement generation tasks. Here, as a concrete task, we evaluated the proposed method with the ball heading task using a monopod robot model. The results showed that the proposed method could adapt to novel target positions or inexperienced ball restitution coefficients. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the acquired foundational policy network originally learned for heading motion, can be used to generate an entirely new overhead kicking skill.</p></details> | 11 pages, 6 figures |
| **[What AIs are not Learning (and Why): Bio-Inspired Foundation Models for Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04267v7)** | 2024-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>It is hard to make robots (including telerobots) that are useful, and harder to make autonomous robots that are robust and general. Current smart robots are created using manual programming, mathematical models, planning frameworks, and reinforcement learning. These methods do not lead to the leaps in performance and generality seen with deep learning, generative AI, and foundation models (FMs). Today's robots do not learn to provide home care, to be nursing assistants, or to do household chores nearly as well as people do. Addressing the aspirational opportunities of robot service applications requires improving how they are created. The high cost of bipedal multi-sensory robots ("bodies") is a significant obstacle for both research and deployment. A deeper issue is that mainstream FMs ("minds") do not support sensing, acting, and learning in context in the real world. They do not lead to robots that communicate well or collaborate. They do not lead to robots that try to learn by experimenting, by asking others, or by imitation learning as appropriate. They do not lead to robots that know enough to be deployed widely in service applications. This paper focuses on what human-compatible service robots need to know. It recommends developing experiential (aka "robotic") FMs for bootstrapping them.</p></details> | 15 pages |

Ontologies are a well-known strategy for addressing such challenges, though given the complexity of the phenomenon, there are risks of reintroducing the interoperability challenges at the level of ontology representations. In the interest of avoiding such pitfalls, we introduce and defend characterizations of digital twins within the context of the Common Core Ontologies, an extension of the widely-used Basic Formal Ontology. We provide a set of definitions and design patterns relevant to the domain of digital twins, highlighted by illustrative use cases of digital twins and their physical counterparts. In doing so, we provide a foundation on which to build more sophisticated ontological content related and connected to digital twins.</p></details> | 14 |

VFMs like CLIP, DINOv2, SAM are trained with distinct objectives, exhibiting unique characteristics for various downstream tasks. We find that despite their conceptual differences, these models can be effectively merged into a unified model through multi-teacher distillation. We name this approach AM-RADIO (Agglomerative Model -- Reduce All Domains Into One). This integrative approach not only surpasses the performance of individual teacher models but also amalgamates their distinctive features, such as zero-shot vision-language comprehension, detailed pixel-level understanding, and open vocabulary segmentation capabilities. In pursuit of the most hardware-efficient backbone, we evaluated numerous architectures in our multi-teacher distillation pipeline using the same training recipe. This led to the development of a novel architecture (E-RADIO) that exceeds the performance of its predecessors and is at least 7x faster than the teacher models. Our comprehensive benchmarking process covers downstream tasks including ImageNet classification, ADE20k semantic segmentation, COCO object detection and LLaVa-1.5 framework.

| **[Training a high-performance retinal foundation model with half-the-data and 400 times less compute](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00117v1)** | 2024-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Artificial Intelligence holds tremendous potential in medicine, but is traditionally limited by the lack of massive datasets to train models on. Foundation models, pre-trained models that can be adapted to downstream tasks with small datasets, could alleviate this problem. Researchers at Moorfields Eye Hospital (MEH) proposed RETFound-MEH, a foundation model for retinal imaging that was trained on 900,000 images, including private hospital data. Recently, data-efficient DERETFound was proposed that provides comparable performance while being trained on only 150,000 images that are all publicly available. However, both these models required very substantial resources to train initially and are resource-intensive in downstream use. We propose a novel Token Reconstruction objective that we use to train RETFound-Green, a retinal foundation model trained using only 75,000 publicly available images and 400 times less compute. We estimate the cost of training RETFound-MEH and DERETFound at $10,000 and $14,000, respectively, while RETFound-Green could be trained for less than $100, with equally reduced environmental impact. RETFound-Green is also far more efficient in downstream use: it can be downloaded 14 times faster, computes vector embeddings 2.7 times faster which then require 2.6 times less storage space. Despite this, RETFound-Green does not perform systematically worse. In fact, it performs best on 14 tasks, compared to six for DERETFound and two for RETFound-MEH. Our results suggest that RETFound-Green is a very efficient, high-performance retinal foundation model. We anticipate that our Token Reconstruction objective could be scaled up for even higher performance and be applied to other domains beyond retinal imaging.</p></details> |  |

To address this issue, we compare the performance of a foundational Vision Transformer (ViT) model with a baseline Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (CGAN) model for missing value imputation in time series of multispectral satellite imagery. We randomly mask time series of satellite images using real-world cloud masks and train each model to reconstruct the missing pixels. The ViT model is fine-tuned from a pretrained model, while the CGAN is trained from scratch. Using quantitative evaluation metrics such as structural similarity index and mean absolute error as well as qualitative visual analysis, we assess imputation accuracy and contextual preservation.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Essential Role of Causality in Foundation World Models for Embodied AI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06665v2)** | 2024-04-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in foundation models, especially in large multi-modal models and conversational agents, have ignited interest in the potential of generally capable embodied agents. Such agents will require the ability to perform new tasks in many different real-world environments. However, current foundation models fail to accurately model physical interactions and are therefore insufficient for Embodied AI. The study of causality lends itself to the construction of veridical world models, which are crucial for accurately predicting the outcomes of possible interactions. This paper focuses on the prospects of building foundation world models for the upcoming generation of embodied agents and presents a novel viewpoint on the significance of causality within these. We posit that integrating causal considerations is vital to facilitating meaningful physical interactions with the world. Finally, we demystify misconceptions about causality in this context and present our outlook for future research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Foundations of Multisensory Artificial Intelligence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18976v1)** | 2024-04-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Building multisensory AI systems that learn from multiple sensory inputs such as text, speech, video, real-world sensors, wearable devices, and medical data holds great promise for impact in many scientific areas with practical benefits, such as in supporting human health and well-being, enabling multimedia content processing, and enhancing real-world autonomous agents. By synthesizing a range of theoretical frameworks and application domains, this thesis aims to advance the machine learning foundations of multisensory AI. In the first part, we present a theoretical framework formalizing how modalities interact with each other to give rise to new information for a task. These interactions are the basic building blocks in all multimodal problems, and their quantification enables users to understand their multimodal datasets, design principled approaches to learn these interactions, and analyze whether their model has succeeded in learning. In the second part, we study the design of practical multimodal foundation models that generalize over many modalities and tasks, which presents a step toward grounding large language models to real-world sensory modalities. We introduce MultiBench, a unified large-scale benchmark across a wide range of modalities, tasks, and research areas, followed by the cross-modal attention and multimodal transformer architectures that now underpin many of today's multimodal foundation models. Scaling these architectures on MultiBench enables the creation of general-purpose multisensory AI systems, and we discuss our collaborative efforts in applying these models for real-world impact in affective computing, mental health, cancer prognosis, and robotics. Finally, we conclude this thesis by discussing how future work can leverage these ideas toward more general, interactive, and safe multisensory AI.</p></details> | <details><summary>CMU M...</summary><p>CMU Machine Learning Department PhD Thesis</p></details> |

This paper introduces a novel system that combines the Segment Anything model (SAM) -- a transformer-based visual foundation model -- with a robotic arm on a mobile platform. The design of integrating a depth camera on the robotic arm's end-effector ensures continuous object tracking, significantly mitigating environmental uncertainties. By deploying on a mobile platform, our grasping system has an enhanced mobility, playing a key role in dynamic environments where adaptability are critical. This synthesis enables dynamic object segmentation, tracking, and grasping. It also elevates user interaction, allowing the robot to intuitively respond to various modalities such as clicks, drawings, or voice commands, beyond traditional robotic systems. Empirical assessments in both simulated and real-world demonstrate the system's capabilities. This configuration opens avenues for wide-ranging applications, from industrial settings, agriculture, and household tasks, to specialized assignments and beyond.</p></details> |  |

In contrast to STL, MTL offers a suite of benefits that enhance both the training process and the inference efficiency. MTL's key advantages encompass streamlined model architecture, performance enhancement, and cross-domain generalizability. Over the past twenty years, MTL has become widely recognized as a flexible and effective approach in various fields, including CV, NLP, recommendation systems, disease prognosis and diagnosis, and robotics. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of the evolution of MTL, encompassing the technical aspects of cutting-edge methods from traditional approaches to deep learning and the latest trend of pretrained foundation models. Our survey methodically categorizes MTL techniques into five key areas: regularization, relationship learning, feature propagation, optimization, and pre-training. This categorization not only chronologically outlines the development of MTL but also dives into various specialized strategies within each category. Furthermore, the survey reveals how the MTL evolves from handling a fixed set of tasks to embracing a more flexible approach free from task or modality constraints. It explores the concepts of task-promptable and -agnostic training, along with the capacity for ZSL, which unleashes the untapped potential of this historically coveted learning paradigm. Overall, we hope this survey provides the research community with a comprehensive overview of the advancements in MTL from its inception in 1997 to the present in 2023.

However, a key hurdle in achieving this goal lies in the robots' ability to manipulate objects in their unstructured surrounding environments according to different tasks. The learning-based approach is considered an effective way to address generalization. The impressive performance of foundation models in the fields of computer vision and natural language suggests the potential of embedding foundation models into manipulation tasks as a viable path toward achieving general manipulation capability. However, we believe achieving general manipulation capability requires an overarching framework akin to auto driving. This framework should encompass multiple functional modules, with different foundation models assuming distinct roles in facilitating general manipulation capability. This survey focuses on the contributions of foundation models to robot learning for manipulation. We propose a comprehensive framework and detail how foundation models can address challenges in each module of the framework. What's more, we examine current approaches, outline challenges, suggest future research directions, and identify potential risks associated with integrating foundation models into this domain.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose Federated Proxy Fine-Tuning (FedPFT), a novel method enhancing FMs adaptation in downstream tasks through FL by two key modules. First, the sub-FM construction module employs a layer-wise compression approach, facilitating comprehensive FM fine-tuning across all layers by emphasizing those crucial neurons. Second, the sub-FM alignment module conducts a two-step distillations-layer-level and neuron-level-before and during FL fine-tuning respectively, to reduce error of gradient by accurately aligning sub-FM with FM under theoretical guarantees. Experimental results on seven commonly used datasets (i.e., four text and three vision) demonstrate the superiority of FedPFT.</p></details> | Accepted by IJCAI'24 |

Specifically, we formulate the video-based PAR as a vision-language fusion problem and adopt a pre-trained foundation model CLIP to extract the visual features. More importantly, we propose a novel spatiotemporal side-tuning strategy to achieve parameter-efficient optimization of the pre-trained vision foundation model. To better utilize the semantic information, we take the full attribute list that needs to be recognized as another input and transform the attribute words/phrases into the corresponding sentence via split, expand, and prompt operations. Then, the text encoder of CLIP is utilized for embedding processed attribute descriptions. The averaged visual tokens and text tokens are concatenated and fed into a fusion Transformer for multi-modal interactive learning. The enhanced tokens will be fed into a classification head for pedestrian attribute prediction. Extensive experiments on two large-scale video-based PAR datasets fully validated the effectiveness of our proposed framework.

However, large foundation models are typically trained on high-quality data, which poses a significant challenge, given the prevalence of poor-quality real-world data. This challenge is more pronounced for developing foundation models for physiological data; such data are often noisy, incomplete, or inconsistent. The present work aims to provide a toolset for developing foundation models on physiological data. We leverage a large dataset of photoplethysmography (PPG) signals from hospitalized intensive care patients. For this data, we propose SimQuality, a novel self-supervised learning task based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) as the backbone to enforce representations to be similar for good and poor quality signals that are from similar physiological states. We pre-trained the SimQuality on over 36 million 30-second PPG pairs and then fine-tuned and tested on six downstream tasks using external datasets. The results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach on all the downstream tasks, which are extremely important for heart monitoring on wearable devices. Our method indicates that CNNs can be an effective backbone for foundation models that are robust to training data quality.</p></details> |  |

These ``foundation'' models are often adapted to a variety of downstream tasks like classification, object detection, and segmentation with little-to-no training on the target dataset. In this work, we perform a robustness analysis of Visual Foundation Models (VFMs) for segmentation tasks and focus on robustness against real-world distribution shift inspired perturbations. We benchmark seven state-of-the-art segmentation architectures using 2 different perturbed datasets, MS COCO-P and ADE20K-P, with 17 different perturbations with 5 severity levels each. Our findings reveal several key insights: (1) VFMs exhibit vulnerabilities to compression-induced corruptions, (2) despite not outpacing all of unimodal models in robustness, multimodal models show competitive resilience in zero-shot scenarios, and (3) VFMs demonstrate enhanced robustness for certain object categories.

However, some studies have shown that although foundation models exhibit strong general feature extraction capabilities, their performance on specific tasks is still inferior to task-specific methods. In this paper, we explore a new perspective called ``Knowledge Decomposition'' to improve the performance on specific medical tasks, which deconstruct the foundation model into multiple lightweight expert models, each dedicated to a particular task, with the goal of improving specialization while concurrently mitigating resource expenditure. To accomplish the above objective, we design a novel framework named Low-Rank Knowledge Decomposition (LoRKD), which explicitly separates graidents by incorporating low-rank expert modules and the efficient knowledge separation convolution. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the decomposed models perform well in terms of performance and transferability, even surpassing the original foundation models.</p></details> | CVPR 2024 |

Traditional methods have been confined to specific rigid objects, such as those in Perspective-n-Point (PnP) problems, but deep learning has expanded our capability to reconstruct a wide range of object classes (e.g. C3DPO and PAUL) with resilience to noise, occlusions, and perspective distortions. All these techniques, however, have been limited by the fundamental need to establish correspondences across the 3D training data -- significantly limiting their utility to applications where one has an abundance of "in-correspondence" 3D data. Our approach harnesses the inherent permutation equivariance of transformers to manage varying number of points per 3D data instance, withstands occlusions, and generalizes to unseen categories. We demonstrate state of the art performance across 2D-3D lifting task benchmarks. Since our approach can be trained across such a broad class of structures we refer to it simply as a 3D Lifting Foundation Model (3D-LFM) -- the first of its kind.</p></details> | <details><summary>Visit...</summary><p>Visit the project page at https://3dlfm.github.io for links to additional media, code, and videos.

| **[Batched Low-Rank Adaptation of Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05677v3)** | 2024-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has recently gained attention for fine-tuning foundation models by incorporating trainable low-rank matrices, thereby reducing the number of trainable parameters. While LoRA offers numerous advantages, its applicability for real-time serving to a diverse and global user base is constrained by its incapability to handle multiple task-specific adapters efficiently. This imposes a performance bottleneck in scenarios requiring personalized, task-specific adaptations for each incoming request. To mitigate this constraint, we introduce Fast LoRA (FLoRA), a framework in which each input example in a minibatch can be associated with its unique low-rank adaptation weights, allowing for efficient batching of heterogeneous requests. We empirically demonstrate that FLoRA retains the performance merits of LoRA, showcasing competitive results on the MultiPL-E code generation benchmark spanning over 8 languages and a multilingual speech recognition task across 6 languages.</p></details> | 16 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Iris-SAM: Iris Segmentation Using a Foundation Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06497v2)** | 2024-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Iris segmentation is a critical component of an iris biometric system and it involves extracting the annular iris region from an ocular image. In this work, we develop a pixel-level iris segmentation model from a foundational model, viz., Segment Anything Model (SAM), that has been successfully used for segmenting arbitrary objects. The primary contribution of this work lies in the integration of different loss functions during the fine-tuning of SAM on ocular images. In particular, the importance of Focal Loss is borne out in the fine-tuning process since it strategically addresses the class imbalance problem (i.e., iris versus non-iris pixels). Experiments on ND-IRIS-0405, CASIA-Iris-Interval-v3, and IIT-Delhi-Iris datasets convey the efficacy of the trained model for the task of iris segmentation. For instance, on the ND-IRIS-0405 dataset, an average segmentation accuracy of 99.58% was achieved, compared to the best baseline performance of 89.75%.</p></details> |  |
| **[Prefix Text as a Yarn: Eliciting Non-English Alignment in Foundation Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16766v1)** | 2024-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While supervised fine-tuning (SFT) has been a straightforward approach for tailoring the output of foundation large language model (LLM) to specific preferences, concerns have been raised about the depth of this alignment, with some critiques suggesting it is merely "superficial". We critically examine this hypothesis within the scope of cross-lingual generation tasks, proposing that the effectiveness of SFT may be constrained by its reliance on prior tokens to guide cross-lingual generation. Based on this crucial insight, and in response to the challenges posed by the costly and limited availability of non-English data for SFT, we introduce a novel training-free alignment method named PreTTY, which employs minimal task-related prior tokens to bridge the foundation LLM and the SFT LLM, achieving comparable performance without training. Experiments on machine translation and part-of-speech tagging across eight languages demonstrate the efficacy of PreTTY in cross-lingual settings. Remarkably, by initiating the decoding process with only one or two prior tokens, foundation LLMs can achieve performance comparable to their SFT counterparts. This method presents a cost-effective alternative to SFT and advances the democratization of multilingual LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Semantic Segmentation Refiner for Ultrasound Applications with Zero-Shot Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16325v1)** | 2024-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the remarkable success of deep learning in medical imaging analysis, medical image segmentation remains challenging due to the scarcity of high-quality labeled images for supervision. Further, the significant domain gap between natural and medical images in general and ultrasound images in particular hinders fine-tuning models trained on natural images to the task at hand. In this work, we address the performance degradation of segmentation models in low-data regimes and propose a prompt-less segmentation method harnessing the ability of segmentation foundation models to segment abstract shapes. We do that via our novel prompt point generation algorithm which uses coarse semantic segmentation masks as input and a zero-shot prompt-able foundation model as an optimization target. We demonstrate our method on a segmentation findings task (pathologic anomalies) in ultrasound images. Our method's advantages are brought to light in varying degrees of low-data regime experiments on a small-scale musculoskeletal ultrasound images dataset, yielding a larger performance gain as the training set size decreases.</p></details> |  |

Therefore, pre-training foundation models on large quantities of available data and then transfer to low-data downstream tasks is a promising direction. However, how to design effective foundation models for molecular learning remains an open question, with existing approaches typically focusing on models with large parameter capacities. In this work, we propose $\texttt{MiniMol}$, a foundational model for molecular learning with 10 million parameters. $\texttt{MiniMol}$ is pre-trained on a mix of roughly 3300 sparsely defined graph- and node-level tasks of both quantum and biological nature. The pre-training dataset includes approximately 6 million molecules and 500 million labels. To demonstrate the generalizability of $\texttt{MiniMol}$ across tasks, we evaluate it on downstream tasks from the Therapeutic Data Commons (TDC) ADMET group showing significant improvements over the prior state-of-the-art foundation model across 17 tasks. $\texttt{MiniMol}$ will be a public and open-sourced model for future research.</p></details> |  |

In this work, a vision foundation model is introduced for crack segmentation. Two parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods, adapter and low-rank adaptation, are adopted to fine-tune the foundation model in semantic segmentation: the Segment Anything Model (SAM). The fine-tuned CrackSAM shows excellent performance on different scenes and materials. To test the zero-shot performance of the proposed method, two unique datasets related to road and exterior wall cracks are collected, annotated and open-sourced, for a total of 810 images. Comparative experiments are conducted with twelve mature semantic segmentation models. On datasets with artificial noise and previously unseen datasets, the performance of CrackSAM far exceeds that of all state-of-the-art models. CrackSAM exhibits remarkable superiority, particularly under challenging conditions such as dim lighting, shadows, road markings, construction joints, and other interference factors. These cross-scenario results demonstrate the outstanding zero-shot capability of foundation models and provide new ideas for developing vision models in civil engineering.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Integrated Data Processing Framework for Pretraining Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16358v2)** | 2024-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ability of the foundation models heavily relies on large-scale, diverse, and high-quality pretraining data. In order to improve data quality, researchers and practitioners often have to manually curate datasets from difference sources and develop dedicated data cleansing pipeline for each data repository. Lacking a unified data processing framework, this process is repetitive and cumbersome. To mitigate this issue, we propose a data processing framework that integrates a Processing Module which consists of a series of operators at different granularity levels, and an Analyzing Module which supports probing and evaluation of the refined data. The proposed framework is easy to use and highly flexible. In this demo paper, we first introduce how to use this framework with some example use cases and then demonstrate its effectiveness in improving the data quality with an automated evaluation with ChatGPT and an end-to-end evaluation in pretraining the GPT-2 model.

Current AI foundation models, although advanced by leveraging large and heterogeneous data, are often constrained by their size and data integration, limiting their effectiveness in addressing the full range of Earth system prediction challenges. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the Oak Ridge Base Foundation Model for Earth System Predictability (ORBIT), an advanced vision-transformer model that scales up to 113 billion parameters using a novel hybrid tensor-data orthogonal parallelism technique. As the largest model of its kind, ORBIT surpasses the current climate AI foundation model size by a thousandfold. Performance scaling tests conducted on the Frontier supercomputer have demonstrated that ORBIT achieves 230 to 707 PFLOPS, with scaling efficiency maintained at 78% to 96% across 24,576 AMD GPUs. These breakthroughs establish new advances in AI-driven climate modeling and demonstrate promise to significantly improve the Earth system predictability.</p></details> |  |

Recently, data-driven deep learning methods have also risen to prominence, offering innovative solutions across numerous scientific fields. While traditional algorithms excel in capturing the core aspects of specific problems, they often lack the flexibility needed for varying problem conditions due to the absence of specific data. Conversely, while data-driven approaches utilize vast datasets, they frequently fall short in domain-specific knowledge. To bridge these gaps, we introduce \textbf{FMint} (Foundation Model based on Initialization), a generative pre-trained model that synergizes the precision of human-designed algorithms with the adaptability of data-driven methods. This model is specifically engineered for high-accuracy simulation of dynamical systems. Starting from initial trajectories provided by conventional methods, FMint quickly delivers highly accurate solutions. It incorporates in-context learning and has been pre-trained on a diverse corpus of 500,000 dynamical systems, showcasing exceptional generalization across a broad spectrum of real-world applications. By effectively combining algorithmic rigor with data-driven flexibility, FMint sets the stage for the next generation of scientific foundation models, tackling complex problems with both efficiency and high accuracy.</p></details> |  |

Structured EHR foundation models, trained on coded medical records from millions of patients, demonstrated benefits including increased performance with fewer training labels, and improved robustness to distribution shifts. However, questions remain on the feasibility of sharing these models across different hospitals and their performance for local task adaptation. This multi-center study examined the adaptability of a recently released structured EHR foundation model ($FM_{SM}$), trained on longitudinal medical record data from 2.57M Stanford Medicine patients. Experiments were conducted using EHR data at The Hospital for Sick Children and MIMIC-IV. We assessed both adaptability via continued pretraining on local data, and task adaptability compared to baselines of training models from scratch at each site, including a local foundation model. We evaluated the performance of these models on 8 clinical prediction tasks. In both datasets, adapting the off-the-shelf $FM_{SM}$ matched the performance of GBM models locally trained on all data while providing a 13% improvement in settings with few task-specific training labels. With continued pretraining on local data, label efficiency substantially improved, such that $FM_{SM}$ required fewer than 1% of training examples to match the fully trained GBM's performance. Continued pretraining was also 60 to 90% more sample-efficient than training local foundation models from scratch. Our findings show that adapting shared EHR foundation models across hospitals provides improved prediction performance at less cost, underscoring the utility of base foundation models as modular components to streamline the development of healthcare AI.</p></details> | <details><summary>46 pa...</summary><p>46 pages, 5 figures, 3 tables, 14 appendices</p></details> |

Federated Learning is a promising solution for such forecasting by enabling collaborative model training without sharing raw data. However, it faces three main challenges that hinder its reliability: (1) data heterogeneity among devices due to geographic differences; (2) data homogeneity within individual devices and (3) communication overload from sending large model parameters for collaboration. To address these challenges, this paper propose Federated Prompt Learning for Weather Foundation Models on Devices (FedPoD), which enables devices to obtain highly customized models while maintaining communication efficiency. Concretely, our Adaptive Prompt Tuning leverages lightweight prompts guide frozen foundation model to generate more precise predictions, also conducts prompt-based multi-level communication to encourage multi-source knowledge fusion and regulate optimization. Additionally, Dynamic Graph Modeling constructs graphs from prompts, prioritizing collaborative training among devices with similar data distributions to against heterogeneity.

Automated readers of LFT results can yield many benefits including empowering blind people to independently learn about their health and accelerating data entry for large-scale monitoring (e.g., for pandemics such as Covid) by using only a single photograph per LFT test. Accordingly, we explore the abilities of modern foundation vision language models (VLMs) in interpreting such tests. To enable this analysis, we first create a new labeled dataset with hierarchical segmentations of each LFT test and its nested test result window. We call this dataset LFT-Grounding. Next, we benchmark eight modern VLMs in zero-shot settings for analyzing these images. We demonstrate that current VLMs frequently fail to correctly identify the type of LFT test, interpret the test results, locate the nested result window of the LFT tests, and recognize LFT tests when they partially obfuscated. To facilitate community-wide progress towards automated LFT reading, we publicly release our dataset at https://iamstuti.github.io/lft_grounding_foundation_models/.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Pixel-Wise Supervision for Medical Image Segmentation: From Traditional Models to Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13239v1)** | 2024-04-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical image segmentation plays an important role in many image-guided clinical approaches. However, existing segmentation algorithms mostly rely on the availability of fully annotated images with pixel-wise annotations for training, which can be both labor-intensive and expertise-demanding, especially in the medical imaging domain where only experts can provide reliable and accurate annotations. To alleviate this challenge, there has been a growing focus on developing segmentation methods that can train deep models with weak annotations, such as image-level, bounding boxes, scribbles, and points. The emergence of vision foundation models, notably the Segment Anything Model (SAM), has introduced innovative capabilities for segmentation tasks using weak annotations for promptable segmentation enabled by large-scale pre-training. Adopting foundation models together with traditional learning methods has increasingly gained recent interest research community and shown potential for real-world applications. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of recent progress on annotation-efficient learning for medical image segmentation utilizing weak annotations before and in the era of foundation models. Furthermore, we analyze and discuss several challenges of existing approaches, which we believe will provide valuable guidance for shaping the trajectory of foundational models to further advance the field of medical image segmentation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards a Foundation Model for Partial Differential Equations: Multi-Operator Learning and Extrapolation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12355v2)** | 2024-04-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models, such as large language models, have demonstrated success in addressing various language and image processing tasks. In this work, we introduce a multi-modal foundation model for scientific problems, named PROSE-PDE. Our model, designed for bi-modality to bi-modality learning, is a multi-operator learning approach which can predict future states of spatiotemporal systems while concurrently learning the underlying governing equations of the physical system. Specifically, we focus on multi-operator learning by training distinct one-dimensional time-dependent nonlinear constant coefficient partial differential equations, with potential applications to many physical applications including physics, geology, and biology. More importantly, we provide three extrapolation studies to demonstrate that PROSE-PDE can generalize physical features through the robust training of multiple operators and that the proposed model can extrapolate to predict PDE solutions whose models or data were unseen during the training. Furthermore, we show through systematic numerical experiments that the utilization of the symbolic modality in our model effectively resolves the well-posedness problems with training multiple operators and thus enhances our model's predictive capabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Foundation Model assisted Weakly Supervised LiDAR Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12861v1)** | 2024-04-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current point cloud semantic segmentation has achieved great advances when given sufficient labels. However, the dense annotation of LiDAR point clouds remains prohibitively expensive and time-consuming, unable to keep up with the continuously growing volume of data. In this paper, we propose annotating images with scattered points, followed by utilizing SAM (a Foundation model) to generate semantic segmentation labels for the images. Finally, by mapping the segmentation labels of the images to the LiDAR space using the intrinsic and extrinsic parameters of the camera and LiDAR, we obtain labels for point cloud semantic segmentation, and release Scatter-KITTI and Scatter-nuScenes, which are the first works to utilize image segmentation-based SAM for weakly supervised point cloud semantic segmentation. Furthermore, to mitigate the influence of erroneous pseudo labels obtained from sparse annotations on point cloud features, we propose a multi-modal weakly supervised network for LiDAR semantic segmentation, called MM-ScatterNet. This network combines features from both point cloud and image modalities, enhancing the representation learning of point clouds by introducing consistency constraints between multi-modal features and point cloud features. On the SemanticKITTI dataset, we achieve 66\% of fully supervised performance using only 0.02% of annotated data, and on the NuScenes dataset, we achieve 95% of fully supervised performance using only 0.1% labeled points.</p></details> |  |

In such tasks, selecting the right target to pick is as essential as inferring a correct configuration of the gripper. A common solution to this problem relies on semantic segmentation models, which often show poor generalization to unseen objects and require considerable time and massive data to be trained. To reduce the need for large datasets, some grasping pipelines exploit few-shot semantic segmentation models, which are capable of recognizing new classes given a few examples. However, this often comes at the cost of limited performance and fine-tuning is required to be effective in robot grasping scenarios. In this work, we propose to overcome all these limitations by combining the impressive generalization capability reached by foundation models with a high-performing few-shot classifier, working as a score function to select the segmentation that is closer to the support set. The proposed model is designed to be embedded in a grasp synthesis pipeline. The extensive experiments using one or five examples show that our novel approach overcomes existing performance limitations, improving the state of the art both in few-shot semantic segmentation on the Graspnet-1B (+10.5% mIoU) and Ocid-grasp (+1.6% AP) datasets, and real-world few-shot grasp synthesis (+21.7% grasp accuracy).

| **[ELEV-VISION-SAM: Integrated Vision Language and Foundation Model for Automated Estimation of Building Lowest Floor Elevation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12606v1)** | 2024-04-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Street view imagery, aided by advancements in image quality and accessibility, has emerged as a valuable resource for urban analytics research. Recent studies have explored its potential for estimating lowest floor elevation (LFE), offering a scalable alternative to traditional on-site measurements, crucial for assessing properties' flood risk and damage extent. While existing methods rely on object detection, the introduction of image segmentation has broadened street view images' utility for LFE estimation, although challenges still remain in segmentation quality and capability to distinguish front doors from other doors. To address these challenges in LFE estimation, this study integrates the Segment Anything model, a segmentation foundation model, with vision language models to conduct text-prompt image segmentation on street view images for LFE estimation. By evaluating various vision language models, integration methods, and text prompts, we identify the most suitable model for street view image analytics and LFE estimation tasks, thereby improving the availability of the current LFE estimation model based on image segmentation from 33% to 56% of properties. Remarkably, our proposed method significantly enhances the availability of LFE estimation to almost all properties in which the front door is visible in the street view image. Also the findings present the first baseline and comparison of various vision models of street view image-based LFE estimation. The model and findings not only contribute to advancing street view image segmentation for urban analytics but also provide a novel approach for image segmentation tasks for other civil engineering and infrastructure analytics tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[How to Benchmark Vision Foundation Models for Semantic Segmentation?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12172v1)** | 2024-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent vision foundation models (VFMs) have demonstrated proficiency in various tasks but require supervised fine-tuning to perform the task of semantic segmentation effectively. Benchmarking their performance is essential for selecting current models and guiding future model developments for this task. The lack of a standardized benchmark complicates comparisons. Therefore, the primary objective of this paper is to study how VFMs should be benchmarked for semantic segmentation. To do so, various VFMs are fine-tuned under various settings, and the impact of individual settings on the performance ranking and training time is assessed. Based on the results, the recommendation is to fine-tune the ViT-B variants of VFMs with a 16x16 patch size and a linear decoder, as these settings are representative of using a larger model, more advanced decoder and smaller patch size, while reducing training time by more than 13 times. Using multiple datasets for training and evaluation is also recommended, as the performance ranking across datasets and domain shifts varies. Linear probing, a common practice for some VFMs, is not recommended, as it is not representative of end-to-end fine-tuning. The benchmarking setup recommended in this paper enables a performance analysis of VFMs for semantic segmentation. The findings of such an analysis reveal that pretraining with promptable segmentation is not beneficial, whereas masked image modeling (MIM) with abstract representations is crucial, even more important than the type of supervision used.

The lack of human-annotated multi-modality aesthetic data further exacerbates this dilemma, resulting in MLLMs falling short of aesthetics perception capabilities. To address the above challenge, we first introduce a comprehensively annotated Aesthetic Multi-Modality Instruction Tuning (AesMMIT) dataset, which serves as the footstone for building multi-modality aesthetics foundation models. Specifically, to align MLLMs with human aesthetics perception, we construct a corpus-rich aesthetic critique database with 21,904 diverse-sourced images and 88K human natural language feedbacks, which are collected via progressive questions, ranging from coarse-grained aesthetic grades to fine-grained aesthetic descriptions. To ensure that MLLMs can handle diverse queries, we further prompt GPT to refine the aesthetic critiques and assemble the large-scale aesthetic instruction tuning dataset, i.e. AesMMIT, which consists of 409K multi-typed instructions to activate stronger aesthetic capabilities. Based on the AesMMIT database, we fine-tune the open-sourced general foundation models, achieving multi-modality Aesthetic Expert models, dubbed AesExpert. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed AesExpert models deliver significantly better aesthetic perception performances than the state-of-the-art MLLMs, including the most advanced GPT-4V and Gemini-Pro-Vision.

Driven by the motivation that Leveraging Stronger pre-trained models and Fewer trainable parameters for Superior generalizability, we introduce a robust fine-tuning approach, namely Rein, to parameter-efficiently harness VFMs for DGSS. Built upon a set of trainable tokens, each linked to distinct instances, Rein precisely refines and forwards the feature maps from each layer to the next layer within the backbone. This process produces diverse refinements for different categories within a single image. With fewer trainable parameters, Rein efficiently fine-tunes VFMs for DGSS tasks, surprisingly surpassing full parameter fine-tuning. Extensive experiments across various settings demonstrate that Rein significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Remarkably, with just an extra 1% of trainable parameters within the frozen backbone, Rein achieves a mIoU of 78.4% on the Cityscapes, without accessing any real urban-scene datasets.Code is available at https://github.com/w1oves/Rein.git.</p></details> |  |

However, in object detection and instance segmentation, two fundamental computer vision tasks heavily reliant on extensive human annotations, foundation models such as SAM and DINO struggle to achieve satisfactory performance. In this study, we reveal that the devil is in the object boundary, \textit{i.e.}, these foundation models fail to discern boundaries between individual objects. For the first time, we probe that CLIP, which has never accessed any instance-level annotations, can provide a highly beneficial and strong instance-level boundary prior in the clustering results of its particular intermediate layer. Following this surprising observation, we propose $\textbf{Zip}$ which $\textbf{Z}$ips up CL$\textbf{ip}$ and SAM in a novel classification-first-then-discovery pipeline, enabling annotation-free, complex-scene-capable, open-vocabulary object detection and instance segmentation. Our Zip significantly boosts SAM's mask AP on COCO dataset by 12.5% and establishes state-of-the-art performance in various settings, including training-free, self-training, and label-efficient finetuning.

Understanding the Suitability for Pixel-Level Classification Using Multispectral Imagery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11797v1)** | 2024-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models, i.e., very large deep learning models, have demonstrated impressive performances in various language and vision tasks that are otherwise difficult to reach using smaller-size models. The major success of GPT-type of language models is particularly exciting and raises expectations on the potential of foundation models in other domains including satellite remote sensing. In this context, great efforts have been made to build foundation models to test their capabilities in broader applications, and examples include Prithvi by NASA-IBM, Segment-Anything-Model, ViT, etc. This leads to an important question: Are foundation models always a suitable choice for different remote sensing tasks, and when or when not? This work aims to enhance the understanding of the status and suitability of foundation models for pixel-level classification using multispectral imagery at moderate resolution, through comparisons with traditional machine learning (ML) and regular-size deep learning models. Interestingly, the results reveal that in many scenarios traditional ML models still have similar or better performance compared to foundation models, especially for tasks where texture is less useful for classification. On the other hand, deep learning models did show more promising results for tasks where labels partially depend on texture (e.g., burn scar), while the difference in performance between foundation models and deep learning models is not obvious. The results conform with our analysis: The suitability of foundation models depend on the alignment between the self-supervised learning tasks and the real downstream tasks, and the typical masked autoencoder paradigm is not necessarily suitable for many remote sensing problems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Pretraining Billion-scale Geospatial Foundational Models on Frontier](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11706v1)** | 2024-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As AI workloads increase in scope, generalization capability becomes challenging for small task-specific models and their demand for large amounts of labeled training samples increases. On the contrary, Foundation Models (FMs) are trained with internet-scale unlabeled data via self-supervised learning and have been shown to adapt to various tasks with minimal fine-tuning. Although large FMs have demonstrated significant impact in natural language processing and computer vision, efforts toward FMs for geospatial applications have been restricted to smaller size models, as pretraining larger models requires very large computing resources equipped with state-of-the-art hardware accelerators. Current satellite constellations collect 100+TBs of data a day, resulting in images that are billions of pixels and multimodal in nature. Such geospatial data poses unique challenges opening up new opportunities to develop FMs. We investigate billion scale FMs and HPC training profiles for geospatial applications by pretraining on publicly available data. We studied from end-to-end the performance and impact in the solution by scaling the model size. Our larger 3B parameter size model achieves up to 30% improvement in top1 scene classification accuracy when comparing a 100M parameter model. Moreover, we detail performance experiments on the Frontier supercomputer, America's first exascale system, where we study different model and data parallel approaches using PyTorch's Fully Sharded Data Parallel library. Specifically, we study variants of the Vision Transformer architecture (ViT), conducting performance analysis for ViT models with size up to 15B parameters. By discussing throughput and performance bottlenecks under different parallelism configurations, we offer insights on how to leverage such leadership-class HPC resources when developing large models for geospatial imagery applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unifying Scene Representation and Hand-Eye Calibration with 3D Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11683v1)** | 2024-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Representing the environment is a central challenge in robotics, and is essential for effective decision-making. Traditionally, before capturing images with a manipulator-mounted camera, users need to calibrate the camera using a specific external marker, such as a checkerboard or AprilTag. However, recent advances in computer vision have led to the development of \emph{3D foundation models}. These are large, pre-trained neural networks that can establish fast and accurate multi-view correspondences with very few images, even in the absence of rich visual features. This paper advocates for the integration of 3D foundation models into scene representation approaches for robotic systems equipped with manipulator-mounted RGB cameras. Specifically, we propose the Joint Calibration and Representation (JCR) method. JCR uses RGB images, captured by a manipulator-mounted camera, to simultaneously construct an environmental representation and calibrate the camera relative to the robot's end-effector, in the absence of specific calibration markers. The resulting 3D environment representation is aligned with the robot's coordinate frame and maintains physically accurate scales. We demonstrate that JCR can build effective scene representations using a low-cost RGB camera attached to a manipulator, without prior calibration.</p></details> |  |

Our model is based on pretraining a patched-decoder style attention model on a large time-series corpus, and can work well across different forecasting history lengths, prediction lengths and temporal granularities.</p></details> |  |

Current CBIR systems face limitations due to their specialization to certain pathologies, limiting their utility. In response, we propose using vision foundation models as powerful and versatile off-the-shelf feature extractors for content-based medical image retrieval. By benchmarking these models on a comprehensive dataset of 1.6 million 2D radiological images spanning four modalities and 161 pathologies, we identify weakly-supervised models as superior, achieving a P@1 of up to 0.594. This performance not only competes with a specialized model but does so without the need for fine-tuning. Our analysis further explores the challenges in retrieving pathological versus anatomical structures, indicating that accurate retrieval of pathological features presents greater difficulty. Despite these challenges, our research underscores the vast potential of foundation models for CBIR in radiology, proposing a shift towards versatile, general-purpose medical image retrieval systems that do not require specific tuning.</p></details> |  |
| **[RemoteCLIP: A Vision Language Foundation Model for Remote Sensing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11029v4)** | 2024-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>General-purpose foundation models have led to recent breakthroughs in artificial intelligence. In remote sensing, self-supervised learning (SSL) and Masked Image Modeling (MIM) have been adopted to build foundation models. However, these models primarily learn low-level features and require annotated data for fine-tuning. Moreover, they are inapplicable for retrieval and zero-shot applications due to the lack of language understanding. To address these limitations, we propose RemoteCLIP, the first vision-language foundation model for remote sensing that aims to learn robust visual features with rich semantics and aligned text embeddings for seamless downstream application. To address the scarcity of pre-training data, we leverage data scaling which converts heterogeneous annotations into a unified image-caption data format based on Box-to-Caption (B2C) and Mask-to-Box (M2B) conversion. By further incorporating UAV imagery, we produce a 12 $\times$ larger pretraining dataset than the combination of all available datasets. RemoteCLIP can be applied to a variety of downstream tasks, including zero-shot image classification, linear probing, $\textit{k}$-NN classification, few-shot classification, image-text retrieval, and object counting in remote sensing images. Evaluation on 16 datasets, including a newly introduced RemoteCount benchmark to test the object counting ability, shows that RemoteCLIP consistently outperforms baseline foundation models across different model scales. Impressively, RemoteCLIP beats the state-of-the-art method by 9.14% mean recall on the RSITMD dataset and 8.92% on the RSICD dataset. For zero-shot classification, our RemoteCLIP outperforms the CLIP baseline by up to 6.39% average accuracy on 12 downstream datasets.

Analogous to the activation of two brain regions responsible for semantic and geometric reasoning during cognitive processes, modeling the complex relationship between objects, tasks, and grasps requires rich prior knowledge about objects and tasks. Existing methods typically limit the prior knowledge to a closed-set scope and cannot support the generalization to novel objects and tasks out of the training set. To address such a limitation, we propose FoundationGrasp, a foundation model-based TOG framework that leverages the open-ended knowledge from foundation models to learn generalizable TOG skills. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on the contributed Language and Vision Augmented TaskGrasp (LaViA-TaskGrasp) dataset, demonstrating the superiority of FoudationGrasp over existing methods when generalizing to novel object instances, object classes, and tasks out of the training set. Furthermore, the effectiveness of FoudationGrasp is validated in real-robot grasping and manipulation experiments on a 7 DoF robotic arm. Our code, data, appendix, and video are publicly available at https://sites.google.com/view/foundationgrasp.</p></details> |  |

However, the current task-driven nature of these copilots falls short in addressing the broader goals and complexities inherent in software engineering (SE). In this paper, we propose a paradigm shift towards goal-driven AI-powered pair programmers that collaborate with human developers in a more holistic and context-aware manner. We envision AI pair programmers that are goal-driven, human partners, SE-aware, and self-learning. These AI partners engage in iterative, conversation-driven development processes, aligning closely with human goals and facilitating informed decision-making. We discuss the desired attributes of such AI pair programmers and outline key challenges that must be addressed to realize this vision. Ultimately, our work represents a shift from AI-augmented SE to AI-transformed SE by replacing code completion with a collaborative partnership between humans and AI that enhances both productivity and software quality.</p></details> |  |

While foundation models have been useful in natural language processing and some vision tasks for some time, the foundation model developed with image segmentation in mind - Segment Anything Model (SAM) - has been developed only recently and has shown similar promise. However, there are still no systematic analyses or ``best-practice'' guidelines for optimal fine-tuning of SAM for medical image segmentation. This work summarizes existing fine-tuning strategies with various backbone architectures, model components, and fine-tuning algorithms across 18 combinations, and evaluates them on 17 datasets covering all common radiology modalities. Our study reveals that (1) fine-tuning SAM leads to slightly better performance than previous segmentation methods, (2) fine-tuning strategies that use parameter-efficient learning in both the encoder and decoder are superior to other strategies, (3) network architecture has a small impact on final performance, (4) further training SAM with self-supervised learning can improve final model performance. We also demonstrate the ineffectiveness of some methods popular in the literature and further expand our experiments into few-shot and prompt-based settings. Lastly, we released our code and MRI-specific fine-tuned weights, which consistently obtained superior performance over the original SAM, at https://github.com/mazurowski-lab/finetune-SAM.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code available at https://github.com/mazurowski-lab/finetune-SAM</p></details> |

| **[A Medical Data-Effective Learning Benchmark for Highly Efficient Pre-training of Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17542v2)** | 2024-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models, pre-trained on massive datasets, have achieved unprecedented generalizability. However, is it truly necessary to involve such vast amounts of data in pre-training, consuming extensive computational resources? This paper introduces data-effective learning, aiming to use data in the most impactful way to pre-train foundation models. This involves strategies that focus on data quality rather than quantity, ensuring the data used for training has high informational value. Data-effective learning plays a profound role in accelerating foundation model training, reducing computational costs, and saving data storage, which is very important as the volume of medical data in recent years has grown beyond many people's expectations. However, due to the lack of standards and comprehensive benchmarks, research on medical data-effective learning is poorly studied. To address this gap, our paper introduces a comprehensive benchmark specifically for evaluating data-effective learning in the medical field. This benchmark includes a dataset with millions of data samples from 31 medical centers (DataDEL), a baseline method for comparison (MedDEL), and a new evaluation metric (NormDEL) to objectively measure data-effective learning performance. Our extensive experimental results show the baseline MedDEL can achieve performance comparable to the original large dataset with only 5% of the data. Establishing such an open data-effective learning benchmark is crucial for the medical foundation model research community because it facilitates efficient data use, promotes collaborative breakthroughs, and fosters the development of cost-effective, scalable, and impactful healthcare solutions.</p></details> |  |

This is a vital and challenging skill for embodied agents. However, existing methods suffer from inefficient training and poor generalization. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that combines visual foundation models (VFM) and offline reinforcement learning (offline RL) to empower embodied visual tracking. We use a pre-trained VFM, such as ``Tracking Anything", to extract semantic segmentation masks with text prompts. We then train a recurrent policy network with offline RL, e.g., Conservative Q-Learning, to learn from the collected demonstrations without online agent-environment interactions. To further improve the robustness and generalization of the policy network, we also introduce a mask re-targeting mechanism and a multi-level data collection strategy. In this way, we can train a robust tracker within an hour on a consumer-level GPU, e.g., Nvidia RTX 3090. Such efficiency is unprecedented for RL-based visual tracking methods. We evaluate our tracker on several high-fidelity environments with challenging situations, such as distraction and occlusion. The results show that our agent outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of sample efficiency, robustness to distractors, and generalization to unseen scenarios and targets. We also demonstrate the transferability of the learned tracker from the virtual world to real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  |

The rapid advances in FMs serve as an important contextual backdrop for the vision of next-generation wireless networks, where federated learning (FL) is a key enabler of distributed network intelligence. Currently, the exploration of the interplay between FMs and FL is still in its nascent stage. Naturally, FMs are capable of boosting the performance of FL, and FL could also leverage decentralized data and computing resources to assist in the training of FMs. However, the exceptionally high requirements that FMs have for computing resources, storage, and communication overhead would pose critical challenges to FL-enabled wireless networks. In this article, we explore the extent to which FMs are suitable for FL over wireless networks, including a broad overview of research challenges and opportunities. In particular, we discuss multiple new paradigms for realizing future intelligent networks that integrate FMs and FL.

Nevertheless, directly predicting the coordinates of objects in 3D space from monocular images poses challenges. Therefore, an effective solution involves transforming monocular images into LiDAR-like representations and employing a LiDAR-based 3D object detector to predict the 3D coordinates of objects. The key step in this method is accurately converting the monocular image into a reliable point cloud form. In this paper, we present VFMM3D, an innovative approach that leverages the capabilities of Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) to accurately transform single-view images into LiDAR point cloud representations. VFMM3D utilizes the Segment Anything Model (SAM) and Depth Anything Model (DAM) to generate high-quality pseudo-LiDAR data enriched with rich foreground information. Specifically, the Depth Anything Model (DAM) is employed to generate dense depth maps. Subsequently, the Segment Anything Model (SAM) is utilized to differentiate foreground and background regions by predicting instance masks. These predicted instance masks and depth maps are then combined and projected into 3D space to generate pseudo-LiDAR points. Finally, any object detectors based on point clouds can be utilized to predict the 3D coordinates of objects. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on the challenging 3D object detection dataset KITTI. Our VFMM3D establishes a new state-of-the-art performance. Additionally, experimental results demonstrate the generality of VFMM3D, showcasing its seamless integration into various LiDAR-based 3D object detectors.</p></details> | 10 pages, 5 figures |

This approach has proven crucial in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP). However, the speech processing community lacks a similar setup to explore the paradigm systematically. In this work, we establish the Speech processing Universal PERformance Benchmark (SUPERB) to study the effectiveness of the paradigm for speech. We propose a unified multi-tasking framework to address speech processing tasks in SUPERB using a frozen foundation model followed by task-specialized, lightweight prediction heads. Combining our results with community submissions, we verify that the foundation model paradigm is promising for speech, and our multi-tasking framework is simple yet effective, as the best-performing foundation model shows competitive generalizability across most SUPERB tasks. For reproducibility and extensibility, we have developed a long-term maintained platform that enables deterministic benchmarking, allows for result sharing via an online leaderboard, and promotes collaboration through a community-driven benchmark database to support new development cycles.

However, current methodologies often treat these two tasks as separate entities, thereby failing to leverage shared knowledge. Moreover, the complexity and diversity of remote sensing image scenes pose additional challenges, as most algorithms are designed to model individual small datasets, thus lacking cross-scene generalization. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive remote sensing image building understanding model, termed RSBuilding, developed from the perspective of the foundation model. RSBuilding is designed to enhance cross-scene generalization and task universality. Specifically, we extract image features based on the prior knowledge of the foundation model and devise a multi-level feature sampler to augment scale information. To unify task representation and integrate image spatiotemporal clues, we introduce a cross-attention decoder with task prompts. Addressing the current shortage of datasets that incorporate annotations for both tasks, we have developed a federated training strategy to facilitate smooth model convergence even when supervision for some tasks is missing, thereby bolstering the complementarity of different tasks. Our model was trained on a dataset comprising up to 245,000 images and validated on multiple building extraction and change detection datasets. The experimental results substantiate that RSBuilding can concurrently handle two structurally distinct tasks and exhibits robust zero-shot generalization capabilities.</p></details> |  |

This approach has seen massive success for various kinds of data, e.g. images, language, audio, and holds the promise of improving performance in various downstream tasks (e.g. encoding or decoding brain data). However, there has been limited progress taking this approach for modelling brain signals, such as Magneto-/electroencephalography (M/EEG). Here we propose two classes of deep learning foundational models that can be trained using forecasting of unlabelled MEG. First, we consider a modified Wavenet; and second, we consider a modified Transformer-based (GPT2) model. The modified GPT2 includes a novel application of tokenisation and embedding methods, allowing a model developed initially for the discrete domain of language to be applied to continuous multichannel time series data. We also extend the forecasting framework to include condition labels as inputs, enabling better modelling (encoding) of task data. We compare the performance of these deep learning models with standard linear autoregressive (AR) modelling on MEG data. This shows that GPT2-based models provide better modelling capabilities than Wavenet and linear AR models, by better reproducing the temporal, spatial and spectral characteristics of real data and evoked activity in task data. We show how the GPT2 model scales well to multiple subjects, while adapting its model to each subject through subject embedding. Finally, we show how such a model can be useful in downstream decoding tasks through data simulation.

However, an attacker could perform data poisoning attacks by manipulating some support samples such that the classifier makes the attacker-desired, arbitrary prediction for a testing input. Empirical defenses cannot provide formal robustness guarantees, leading to a cat-and-mouse game between the attacker and defender. Existing certified defenses are designed for traditional supervised learning, resulting in sub-optimal performance when extended to few-shot classification. In our work, we propose FCert, the first certified defense against data poisoning attacks to few-shot classification. We show our FCert provably predicts the same label for a testing input under arbitrary data poisoning attacks when the total number of poisoned support samples is bounded. We perform extensive experiments on benchmark few-shot classification datasets with foundation models released by OpenAI, Meta, and Google in both vision and text domains. Our experimental results show our FCert: 1) maintains classification accuracy without attacks, 2) outperforms existing state-of-the-art certified defenses for data poisoning attacks, and 3) is efficient and general.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy, 2024</p></details> |

Previous methods focus on using diffusion models as expressive decoders robust to quantization errors in the conditioning signals, yet achieving competitive results in this manner requires costly training of the diffusion model and long inference times due to the iterative generative process. In this work we formulate the removal of quantization error as a denoising task, using diffusion to recover lost information in the transmitted image latent. Our approach allows us to perform less than 10\% of the full diffusion generative process and requires no architectural changes to the diffusion model, enabling the use of foundation models as a strong prior without additional fine tuning of the backbone. Our proposed codec outperforms previous methods in quantitative realism metrics, and we verify that our reconstructions are qualitatively preferred by end users, even when other methods use twice the bitrate.</p></details> |  |

Subsequent efforts have been made to introduce region-level visual learning into CLIP's pretraining but face scalability challenges due to the lack of large-scale region-level datasets. Drawing inspiration from supervised fine-tuning (SFT) in natural language processing such as instruction tuning, we explore the potential of fine-grained SFT in enhancing the generation of vision foundation models after their pretraining. Thus a two-stage method ViSFT (Vision SFT) is proposed to unleash the fine-grained knowledge of vision foundation models. In ViSFT, the vision foundation model is enhanced by performing visual joint learning on some in-domain tasks and then tested on out-of-domain benchmarks.

However, low-resource problems are under-explored in computer vision. In this paper, we address this gap and explore the challenges of low-resource image tasks with vision foundation models. We first collect a benchmark of genuinely low-resource image data, covering historic maps, circuit diagrams, and mechanical drawings. These low-resource settings all share three challenges: data scarcity, fine-grained differences, and the distribution shift from natural images to the specialized domain of interest. While existing foundation models have shown impressive generalizability, we find they cannot transfer well to our low-resource tasks. To begin to tackle the challenges of low-resource vision, we introduce one simple baseline per challenge. Specifically, we i) enlarge the data space by generative models, ii) adopt the best sub-kernels to encode local regions for fine-grained difference discovery and iii) learn attention for specialized domains. Experiments on our three low-resource tasks demonstrate our proposals already provide a better baseline than transfer learning, data augmentation, and fine-grained methods. This highlights the unique characteristics and challenges of low-resource vision for foundation models that warrant further investigation.

In response to this challenge, this study introduces Me-LLaMA, a novel medical LLM family that includes foundation models - Me-LLaMA 13/70B, along with their chat-enhanced versions - Me-LLaMA 13/70B-chat, developed through continual pre-training and instruction tuning of LLaMA2 using large medical datasets. Our methodology leverages a comprehensive domain-specific data suite, including a large-scale, continual pre-training dataset with 129B tokens, an instruction tuning dataset with 214k samples, and a new medical evaluation benchmark (MIBE) across six critical medical tasks with 12 datasets. Our extensive evaluation using the MIBE shows that Me-LLaMA models achieve overall better performance than existing open-source medical LLMs in zero-shot, few-shot and supervised learning abilities. With task-specific instruction tuning, Me-LLaMA models outperform ChatGPT on 7 out of 8 datasets and GPT-4 on 5 out of 8 datasets. In addition, we investigated the catastrophic forgetting problem, and our results show that Me-LLaMA models outperform other open-source medical LLMs in mitigating this issue.

Specifically, the prompt mechanism conveniently allows users to integrate image prior information into the model, making it possible to apply models without any training. Therefore, we propose a method based on foundation models and zero training to solve the tasks of photoacoustic (PA) image segmentation. We employed the segment anything model (SAM) by setting simple prompts and integrating the model's outputs with prior knowledge of the imaged objects to accomplish various tasks, including: (1) removing the skin signal in three-dimensional PA image rendering; (2) dual speed-of-sound reconstruction, and (3) segmentation of finger blood vessels. Through these demonstrations, we have concluded that deep learning can be directly applied in PA imaging without the requirement for network design and training. This potentially allows for a hands-on, convenient approach to achieving efficient and accurate segmentation of PA images. This letter serves as a comprehensive tutorial, facilitating the mastery of the technique through the provision of code and sample datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Measuring Geographic Diversity of Foundation Models with a Natural Language--based Geo-guessing Experiment on GPT-4](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07612v1)** | 2024-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative AI based on foundation models provides a first glimpse into the world represented by machines trained on vast amounts of multimodal data ingested by these models during training. If we consider the resulting models as knowledge bases in their own right, this may open up new avenues for understanding places through the lens of machines. In this work, we adopt this thinking and select GPT-4, a state-of-the-art representative in the family of multimodal large language models, to study its geographic diversity regarding how well geographic features are represented. Using DBpedia abstracts as a ground-truth corpus for probing, our natural language--based geo-guessing experiment shows that GPT-4 may currently encode insufficient knowledge about several geographic feature types on a global level. On a local level, we observe not only this insufficiency but also inter-regional disparities in GPT-4's geo-guessing performance on UNESCO World Heritage Sites that carry significance to both local and global populations, and the inter-regional disparities may become smaller as the geographic scale increases. Morever, whether assessing the geo-guessing performance on a global or local level, we find inter-model disparities in GPT-4's geo-guessing performance when comparing its unimodal and multimodal variants. We hope this work can initiate a discussion on geographic diversity as an ethical principle within the GIScience community in the face of global socio-technical challenges.</p></details> | <details><summary>Short...</summary><p>Short paper accepted by AGILE 2024 conference (https://agile-gi.eu/conference-2024)</p></details> |

Industrial metaverses not only visualize the process of productivity in a dynamic and evolutional way, but also provide an immersive laboratory experimental environment for optimizing and remodeling the process. Besides, the customized user needs that are hidden in social media data can be discovered by social computing technologies, which introduces an input channel for building the whole social manufacturing process including industrial metaverses. This makes the fusion of multi-source data cross Cyber-Physical-Social Systems (CPSS) the foundational and key challenge. This work firstly proposes a multi-source-data-fusion-driven operational architecture for industrial metaverses on the basis of conducting a comprehensive literature review on the state-of-the-art multi-source data fusion methods. The advantages and disadvantages of each type of method are analyzed by considering the fusion mechanisms and application scenarios. Especially, we combine the strengths of deep learning and knowledge graphs in scalability and parallel computation to enable our proposed framework the ability of prescriptive optimization and evolution. This integration can address the shortcomings of deep learning in terms of explainability and fact fabrication, as well as overcoming the incompleteness and the challenges of construction and maintenance inherent in knowledge graphs. The effectiveness of the proposed architecture is validated through a parallel weaving case study. In the end, we discuss the challenges and future directions of multi-source data fusion cross CPSS for industrial metaverses and social manufacturing in Industries 5.0.</p></details> |  |

However, the conventional systems primarily focus on delivering diagnostic results through text report generation or medical image classification, positioning them as standalone decision-makers rather than helpers and ignoring radiologists' expertise. This study introduces an innovative paradigm to create an assistive co-pilot system for empowering radiologists by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and medical image analysis tools. Specifically, we develop a collaborative framework to integrate LLMs and quantitative medical image analysis results generated by foundation models with radiologists in the loop, achieving efficient and safe generation of radiology reports and effective utilization of computational power of AI and the expertise of medical professionals. This approach empowers radiologists to generate more precise and detailed diagnostic reports, enhancing patient outcomes while reducing the burnout of clinicians. Our methodology underscores the potential of AI as a supportive tool in medical diagnostics, promoting a harmonious integration of technology and human expertise to advance the field of radiology.</p></details> |  |

Segment-Anything(SAM), among others, is the state-of-the-art image segmentation foundation model demonstrating strong zero/few-shot generalization. Despite the success, recent studies reveal the weakness of SAM under strong distribution shift. In particular, SAM performs awkwardly on corrupted natural images, camouflaged images, medical images, etc. Motivated by the observations, we aim to develop a self-training based strategy to adapt SAM to target distribution. Given the unique challenges of large source dataset, high computation cost and incorrect pseudo label, we propose a weakly supervised self-training architecture with anchor regularization and low-rank finetuning to improve the robustness and computation efficiency of adaptation. We validate the effectiveness on 5 types of downstream segmentation tasks including natural clean/corrupted images, medical images, camouflaged images and robotic images. Our proposed method is task-agnostic in nature and outperforms pre-trained SAM and state-of-the-art domain adaptation methods on almost all downstream tasks with the same testing prompt inputs.</p></details> | 20 pages, 12 figures |
| **[Towards Foundation Models for Knowledge Graph Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04562v2)** | 2024-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models in language and vision have the ability to run inference on any textual and visual inputs thanks to the transferable representations such as a vocabulary of tokens in language. Knowledge graphs (KGs) have different entity and relation vocabularies that generally do not overlap. The key challenge of designing foundation models on KGs is to learn such transferable representations that enable inference on any graph with arbitrary entity and relation vocabularies. In this work, we make a step towards such foundation models and present ULTRA, an approach for learning universal and transferable graph representations. ULTRA builds relational representations as a function conditioned on their interactions. Such a conditioning strategy allows a pre-trained ULTRA model to inductively generalize to any unseen KG with any relation vocabulary and to be fine-tuned on any graph. Conducting link prediction experiments on 57 different KGs, we find that the zero-shot inductive inference performance of a single pre-trained ULTRA model on unseen graphs of various sizes is often on par or better than strong baselines trained on specific graphs. Fine-tuning further boosts the performance.</p></details> | ICLR 2024 |
| **[Playing to Vision Foundation Model's Strengths in Stereo Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06261v1)** | 2024-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Stereo matching has become a key technique for 3D environment perception in intelligent vehicles. For a considerable time, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have remained the mainstream choice for feature extraction in this domain. Nonetheless, there is a growing consensus that the existing paradigm should evolve towards vision foundation models (VFM), particularly those developed based on vision Transformers (ViTs) and pre-trained through self-supervision on extensive, unlabeled datasets. While VFMs are adept at extracting informative, general-purpose visual features, specifically for dense prediction tasks, their performance often lacks in geometric vision tasks. This study serves as the first exploration of a viable approach for adapting VFMs to stereo matching. Our ViT adapter, referred to as ViTAS, is constructed upon three types of modules: spatial differentiation, patch attention fusion, and cross-attention. The first module initializes feature pyramids, while the latter two aggregate stereo and multi-scale contextual information into fine-grained features, respectively. ViTAStereo, which combines ViTAS with cost volume-based stereo matching back-end processes, achieves the top rank on the KITTI Stereo 2012 dataset and outperforms the second-best network StereoBase by approximately 7.9% in terms of the percentage of error pixels, with a tolerance of 3 pixels. Additional experiments across diverse scenarios further demonstrate its superior generalizability compared to all other state-of-the-art approaches. We believe this new paradigm will pave the way for the next generation of stereo matching networks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Feature Re-Embedding: Towards Foundation Model-Level Performance in Computational Pathology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17228v3)** | 2024-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiple instance learning (MIL) is the most widely used framework in computational pathology, encompassing sub-typing, diagnosis, prognosis, and more. However, the existing MIL paradigm typically requires an offline instance feature extractor, such as a pre-trained ResNet or a foundation model. This approach lacks the capability for feature fine-tuning within the specific downstream tasks, limiting its adaptability and performance. To address this issue, we propose a Re-embedded Regional Transformer (R$^2$T) for re-embedding the instance features online, which captures fine-grained local features and establishes connections across different regions. Unlike existing works that focus on pre-training powerful feature extractor or designing sophisticated instance aggregator, R$^2$T is tailored to re-embed instance features online. It serves as a portable module that can seamlessly integrate into mainstream MIL models. Extensive experimental results on common computational pathology tasks validate that: 1) feature re-embedding improves the performance of MIL models based on ResNet-50 features to the level of foundation model features, and further enhances the performance of foundation model features; 2) the R$^2$T can introduce more significant performance improvements to various MIL models; 3) R$^2$T-MIL, as an R$^2$T-enhanced AB-MIL, outperforms other latest methods by a large margin.The code is available at: https://github.com/DearCaat/RRT-MIL.</p></details> | Accepted by CVPR2024 |

While research in Deepfake detection has grown rapidly in response, many detection methods struggle with unseen Deepfakes generated by new synthesis techniques. To address this generalisation challenge, we propose a novel Deepfake detection approach by adapting rich information encoded inside the Foundation Models with rich information encoded inside, specifically using the image encoder from CLIP which has demonstrated strong zero-shot capability for downstream tasks. Inspired by the recent advances of parameter efficient fine-tuning, we propose a novel side-network-based decoder to extract spatial and temporal cues from the given video clip, with the promotion of the Facial Component Guidance (FCG) to guidencourage the spatial feature to include features of key facial parts for more robust and general Deepfake detection. Through extensive cross-dataset evaluations, our approach exhibits superior effectiveness in identifying unseen Deepfake samples, achieving notable performance improvementsuccess even with limited training samples and manipulation types. Our model secures an average performance enhancement of 0.9% AUROC in cross-dataset assessments comparing with state-of-the-art methods, especiallytablishing a significant lead of achieving 4.4% improvement on the challenging DFDC dataset.</p></details> |  |

Yet, challenges persist, including generalization across scenarios, maintaining reliability, and ensuring real-time responsiveness. This paper introduces a perception framework grounded in foundation models for universal object detection and tracking, moving beyond specific training categories. Integral to our approach is a multi-layered tracker integrated with the foundation detector, ensuring continuous target visibility, even when faced with motion blur, abrupt light shifts, and occlusions. Complementing this, we introduce a model-free controller tailored for resilient quadrotor visual tracking. Our system operates efficiently on limited hardware, relying solely on an onboard camera and an inertial measurement unit. Through extensive validation in diverse challenging indoor and outdoor environments, we demonstrate our system's effectiveness and adaptability. In conclusion, our research represents a step forward in quadrotor visual tracking, moving from task-specific methods to more versatile and adaptable operations.</p></details> |  |

However, clinical adoption of computational models has been hampered by the lack of generalization due to large batch effects, small dataset sizes, and poor performance in transfer learning from natural images. To address these challenges, we introduce DinoBloom, the first foundation model for single cell images in hematology, utilizing a tailored DINOv2 pipeline. Our model is built upon an extensive collection of 13 diverse, publicly available datasets of peripheral blood and bone marrow smears, the most substantial open-source cohort in hematology so far, comprising over 380,000 white blood cell images. To assess its generalization capability, we evaluate it on an external dataset with a challenging domain shift. We show that our model outperforms existing medical and non-medical vision models in (i) linear probing and k-nearest neighbor evaluations for cell-type classification on blood and bone marrow smears and (ii) weakly supervised multiple instance learning for acute myeloid leukemia subtyping by a large margin. A family of four DinoBloom models (small, base, large, and giant) can be adapted for a wide range of downstream applications, be a strong baseline for classification problems, and facilitate the assessment of batch effects in new datasets. All models are available at github.com/marrlab/DinoBloom.</p></details> |  |

Temperature Network Meets Large Foundation Models via DRO](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04575v1)** | 2024-04-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The temperature parameter plays a profound role during training and/or inference with large foundation models (LFMs) such as large language models (LLMs) and CLIP models. Particularly, it adjusts the logits in the softmax function in LLMs, which is crucial for next token generation, and it scales the similarities in the contrastive loss for training CLIP models. A significant question remains: Is it viable to learn a neural network to predict a personalized temperature of any input data for enhancing LFMs"? In this paper, we present a principled framework for learning a small yet generalizable temperature prediction network (TempNet) to improve LFMs. Our solution is composed of a novel learning framework with a robust loss underpinned by constrained distributionally robust optimization (DRO), and a properly designed TempNet with theoretical inspiration. TempNet can be trained together with a large foundation model from scratch or learned separately given a pretrained foundation model. It is not only useful for predicting personalized temperature to promote the training of LFMs but also generalizable and transferable to new tasks. Our experiments on LLMs and CLIP models demonstrate that TempNet greatly improves the performance of existing solutions or models, e.g. Table 1.

For example, a recent study found them useful for planning problems: plan generation, language translation, model construction, multi-agent planning, interactive planning, heuristics optimization, tool integration, and brain-inspired planning. Besides APS, there are many seemingly related tasks involving the generation of a series of actions with varying guarantees of their executability to achieve intended goals, which we collectively call planning-like (PL) tasks like business processes, programs, workflows, and guidelines, where researchers have considered using FMs. However, previous works have primarily focused on pre-trained, off-the-shelf FMs and optionally fine-tuned them. This paper discusses the need for a comprehensive FM for PL tasks from scratch and explores its design considerations. We argue that such an FM will open new and efficient avenues for PL problem-solving, just like LLMs are creating for APS.</p></details> |  |

Foundation models include large language models (LLMs) that show promising performance on a range of diverse tasks unrelated to their training. We show that these models are highly applicable to the data discovery and data exploration domain. When carefully used, they have superior capability on three representative tasks: table-class detection, column-type annotation and join-column prediction. On all three tasks, we show that a foundation-model-based approach outperforms the task-specific models and so the state of the art. Further, our approach often surpasses human-expert task performance. We investigate the fundamental characteristics of this approach including generalizability to several foundation models and the impact of non-determinism on the outputs. All in all, this suggests a future direction in which disparate data management tasks can be unified under foundation models.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in VLDB 2024</p></details> |

Organizations increasingly face such threats in an evolving cyber threat landscape. Understanding and establishing foundations for cyber resilience provide a quantitative and systematic approach to cyber risk assessment, mitigation policy evaluation, and risk-informed defense design. A systems-scientific view toward cyber risks provides holistic and system-level solutions. This chapter starts with a systemic view toward cyber risks and presents the confluence of game theory, control theory, and learning theories, which are three major pillars for the design of cyber resilience mechanisms to counteract increasingly sophisticated and evolving threats in our networks and organizations. Game and control theoretic methods provide a set of modeling frameworks to capture the strategic and dynamic interactions between defenders and attackers. Control and learning frameworks together provide a feedback-driven mechanism that enables autonomous and adaptive responses to threats. Game and learning frameworks offer a data-driven approach to proactively reason about adversarial behaviors and resilient strategies. The confluence of the three lays the theoretical foundations for the analysis and design of cyber resilience. This chapter presents various theoretical paradigms, including dynamic asymmetric games, moving horizon control, conjectural learning, and meta-learning, as recent advances at the intersection. This chapter concludes with future directions and discussions of the role of neurosymbolic learning and the synergy between foundation models and game models in cyber resilience.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bootstrapping SparseFormers from Vision Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01987v2)** | 2024-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recently proposed SparseFormer architecture provides an alternative approach to visual understanding by utilizing a significantly lower number of visual tokens via adjusting RoIs, greatly reducing computational costs while still achieving promising performance. However, training SparseFormers from scratch is still expensive, and scaling up the number of parameters can be challenging. In this paper, we propose to bootstrap SparseFormers from ViT-based vision foundation models in a simple and efficient way. Since the majority of SparseFormer blocks are the standard transformer ones, we can inherit weights from large-scale pre-trained vision transformers and freeze them as much as possible. Therefore, we only need to train the SparseFormer-specific lightweight focusing transformer to adjust token RoIs and fine-tune a few early pre-trained blocks to align the final token representation. In such a way, we can bootstrap SparseFormer architectures from various large-scale pre-trained models (e.g., IN-21K pre-trained AugRegs or CLIPs) using a rather smaller amount of training samples (e.g., IN-1K) and without labels or captions within just a few hours. As a result, the bootstrapped unimodal SparseFormer (from AugReg-ViT-L/16-384) can reach 84.9% accuracy on IN-1K with only 49 tokens, and the multimodal SparseFormer from CLIPs also demonstrates notable zero-shot performance with highly reduced computational cost without seeing any caption during the bootstrapping procedure. In addition, CLIP-bootstrapped SparseFormers, which align the output space with language without seeing a word, can serve as efficient vision encoders in multimodal large language models.

It promotes the development of healthcare artificial intelligence (AI) models, breaking the contradiction between limited AI models and diverse healthcare practices. Much more widespread healthcare scenarios will benefit from the development of a healthcare foundation model (HFM), improving their advanced intelligent healthcare services. Despite the impending widespread deployment of HFMs, there is currently a lack of clear understanding about how they work in the healthcare field, their current challenges, and where they are headed in the future. To answer these questions, a comprehensive and deep survey of the challenges, opportunities, and future directions of HFMs is presented in this survey. It first conducted a comprehensive overview of the HFM including the methods, data, and applications for a quick grasp of the current progress. Then, it made an in-depth exploration of the challenges present in data, algorithms, and computing infrastructures for constructing and widespread application of foundation models in healthcare. This survey also identifies emerging and promising directions in this field for future development. We believe that this survey will enhance the community's comprehension of the current progress of HFM and serve as a valuable source of guidance for future development in this field.

However, current state-of-the-art models employ spatio-temporal transformers trained on limited amounts of data, hindering generalizability adaptation to downstream tasks. The benefits of vision foundation models present a potential solution to improve the VSP process. However, adapting image foundation models to the video domain presents significant challenges in modeling scene dynamics and capturing temporal information. To address these challenges, and as the first initiative to design a VSP model based on video foundation models, we introduce SalFoM, a novel encoder-decoder video transformer architecture. Our model employs UnMasked Teacher (UMT) as feature extractor and presents a heterogeneous decoder which features a locality-aware spatio-temporal transformer and integrates local and global spatio-temporal information from various perspectives to produce the final saliency map. Our qualitative and quantitative experiments on the challenging VSP benchmark datasets of DHF1K, Hollywood-2 and UCF-Sports demonstrate the superiority of our proposed model in comparison with the state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | 15 pages, 4 figures |

Zero-shot object 6D pose estimation methods address this challenge by leveraging additional task-specific supervision provided by large-scale, photo-realistic synthetic datasets. However, their performance heavily depends on the quality and diversity of rendered data and they require extensive training. In this work, we show how to tackle the same task but without training on specific data. We propose FreeZe, a novel solution that harnesses the capabilities of pre-trained geometric and vision foundation models. FreeZe leverages 3D geometric descriptors learned from unrelated 3D point clouds and 2D visual features learned from web-scale 2D images to generate discriminative 3D point-level descriptors. We then estimate the 6D pose of unseen objects by 3D registration based on RANSAC. We also introduce a novel algorithm to solve ambiguous cases due to geometrically symmetric objects that is based on visual features. We comprehensively evaluate FreeZe across the seven core datasets of the BOP Benchmark, which include over a hundred 3D objects and 20,000 images captured in various scenarios. FreeZe consistently outperforms all state-of-the-art approaches, including competitors extensively trained on synthetic 6D pose estimation data.

In this paper, we propose for the first time the use of Transformer neural networks, with a Masked Auto-Encoder architecture, as Foundation Models for SHM. We demonstrate the ability of these models to learn generalizable representations from multiple large datasets through self-supervised pre-training, which, coupled with task-specific fine-tuning, allows them to outperform state-of-the-art traditional methods on diverse tasks, including Anomaly Detection (AD) and Traffic Load Estimation (TLE). We then extensively explore model size versus accuracy trade-offs and experiment with Knowledge Distillation (KD) to improve the performance of smaller Transformers, enabling their embedding directly into the SHM edge nodes. We showcase the effectiveness of our foundation models using data from three operational viaducts. For AD, we achieve a near-perfect 99.9% accuracy with a monitoring time span of just 15 windows. In contrast, a state-of-the-art method based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA) obtains its first good result (95.03% accuracy) only considering 120 windows. On two different TLE tasks, our models obtain state-of-the-art performance on multiple evaluation metrics (R$^2$ score, MAE% and MSE%). On the first benchmark, we achieve an R$^2$ score of 0.97 and 0.85 for light and heavy vehicle traffic, respectively, while the best previous approach stops at 0.91 and 0.84.

A case study is presented featuring a vehicle classification application using acoustic and seismic sensing. The work is motivated by the success of foundation models in the areas of natural language processing and computer vision, leading to generalizations of the FM concept to other domains as well, where significant amounts of unlabeled data exist that can be used for self-supervised pre-training. One such domain is IoT applications. Foundation models for selected sensing modalities in the IoT domain can be pre-trained in an environment-agnostic fashion using available unlabeled sensor data and then fine-tuned to the deployment at hand using a small amount of labeled data. The paper shows that the pre-training/fine-tuning approach improves the robustness of downstream inference and facilitates adaptation to different environmental conditions. More specifically, we present a case study in a real-world setting to evaluate a simple (vibration-based) FM-like model, called FOCAL, demonstrating its superior robustness and adaptation, compared to conventional supervised deep neural networks (DNNs). We also demonstrate its superior convergence over supervised solutions. Our findings highlight the advantages of vibration-based FMs (and FM-inspired selfsupervised models in general) in terms of inference robustness, runtime efficiency, and model adaptation (via fine-tuning) in resource-limited IoT settings.</p></details> |  |

Foundation model based agents derive their autonomy from the capabilities of foundation models, which enable them to autonomously break down a given goal into a set of manageable tasks and orchestrate task execution to meet the goal. Despite the huge efforts put into building foundation model based agents, the architecture design of the agents has not yet been systematically explored. Also, while there are significant benefits of using agents for planning and execution, there are serious considerations regarding responsible AI related software quality attributes, such as security and accountability. Therefore, this paper presents a pattern-oriented reference architecture that serves as guidance when designing foundation model based agents. We evaluate the completeness and utility of the proposed reference architecture by mapping it to the architecture of two real-world agents.</p></details> |  |

Moreover, it requires a delicate integration of controller and estimator designs to achieve the desired system behavior. To establish a general controller synthesis framework, we explore the Decision Transformer (DT) architecture. Specifically, we first frame the control task as predicting the current optimal action based on past observations, actions, and rewards, eliminating the need for a separate estimator design. Then, we leverage the pre-trained language models, i.e., the Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) series, to initialize DT and subsequently train it for control tasks using low-rank adaptation (LoRA). Our comprehensive experiments across five distinct control tasks, ranging from maneuvering aerospace systems to controlling partial differential equations (PDEs), demonstrate DT's capability to capture the parameter-agnostic structures intrinsic to control tasks. DT exhibits remarkable zero-shot generalization abilities for completely new tasks and rapidly surpasses expert performance levels with a minimal amount of demonstration data. These findings highlight the potential of DT as a foundational controller for general control applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to CDC 2024</p></details> |
| **[A Novel Benchmark for Few-Shot Semantic Segmentation in the Era of Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11311v2)** | 2024-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, the rapid evolution of computer vision has seen the emergence of various foundation models, each tailored to specific data types and tasks. In this study, we explore the adaptation of these models for few-shot semantic segmentation. Specifically, we conduct a comprehensive comparative analysis of four prominent foundation models: DINO V2, Segment Anything, CLIP, Masked AutoEncoders, and of a straightforward ResNet50 pre-trained on the COCO dataset. We also include 5 adaptation methods, ranging from linear probing to fine tuning. Our findings show that DINO V2 outperforms other models by a large margin, across various datasets and adaptation methods. On the other hand, adaptation methods provide little discrepancy in the obtained results, suggesting that a simple linear probing can compete with advanced, more computationally intensive, alternatives</p></details> |  |
| **[Zero-shot Safety Prediction for Autonomous Robots with Foundation World Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00462v2)** | 2024-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A world model creates a surrogate world to train a controller and predict safety violations by learning the internal dynamic model of systems. However, the existing world models rely solely on statistical learning of how observations change in response to actions, lacking precise quantification of how accurate the surrogate dynamics are, which poses a significant challenge in safety-critical systems. To address this challenge, we propose foundation world models that embed observations into meaningful and causally latent representations. This enables the surrogate dynamics to directly predict causal future states by leveraging a training-free large language model. In two common benchmarks, this novel model outperforms standard world models in the safety prediction task and has a performance comparable to supervised learning despite not using any data. We evaluate its performance with a more specialized and system-relevant metric by comparing estimated states instead of aggregating observation-wide error.</p></details> |  |
| **[IsoBench: Benchmarking Multimodal Foundation Models on Isomorphic Representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01266v2)** | 2024-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current foundation models exhibit impressive capabilities when prompted either with text only or with both image and text inputs. But do their capabilities change depending on the input modality? In this work, we propose $\textbf{IsoBench}$, a benchmark dataset containing problems from four major areas: math, science, algorithms, and games. Each example is presented with multiple $\textbf{isomorphic representations}$ of inputs, such as visual, textual, and mathematical presentations. IsoBench provides fine-grained feedback to diagnose performance gaps caused by the form of the representation. Across various foundation models, we observe that on the same problem, models have a consistent preference towards textual representations. Most prominently, when evaluated on all IsoBench problems, Claude-3 Opus performs 28.7 points worse when provided with images instead of text; similarly, GPT-4 Turbo is 18.7 points worse and Gemini Pro is 14.9 points worse. Finally, we present two prompting techniques, $\textit{IsoCombination}$ and $\textit{IsoScratchPad}$, which improve model performance by considering combinations of, and translations between, different input representations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Foundation Models for Time Series Analysis: A Tutorial and Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14735v2)** | 2024-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series analysis stands as a focal point within the data mining community, serving as a cornerstone for extracting valuable insights crucial to a myriad of real-world applications. Recent advancements in Foundation Models (FMs) have fundamentally reshaped the paradigm of model design for time series analysis, boosting various downstream tasks in practice. These innovative approaches often leverage pre-trained or fine-tuned FMs to harness generalized knowledge tailored specifically for time series analysis. In this survey, we aim to furnish a comprehensive and up-to-date overview of FMs for time series analysis. While prior surveys have predominantly focused on either the application or the pipeline aspects of FMs in time series analysis, they have often lacked an in-depth understanding of the underlying mechanisms that elucidate why and how FMs benefit time series analysis. To address this gap, our survey adopts a model-centric classification, delineating various pivotal elements of time-series FMs, including model architectures, pre-training techniques, adaptation methods, and data modalities. Overall, this survey serves to consolidate the latest advancements in FMs pertinent to time series analysis, accentuating their theoretical underpinnings, recent strides in development, and avenues for future research exploration.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quantifying Self-diagnostic Atomic Knowledge in Chinese Medical Foundation Model: A Computational Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11722v3)** | 2024-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation Models (FMs) have the potential to revolutionize the way users self-diagnose through search engines by offering direct and efficient suggestions. Recent studies primarily focused on the quality of FMs evaluated by GPT-4 or their ability to pass medical exams, no studies have quantified the extent of self-diagnostic atomic knowledge stored in FMs' memory, which is the basis of foundation models to provide factual and reliable suggestions. In this paper, we first constructed a benchmark of Self-diagnostic Atomic Knowledge (SdAK), including the most common types of atomic knowledge involved in self-diagnostic queries, with 17 atomic types and a total of 14, 048 pieces of atomic knowledge. Then, we evaluated both generic and open-source Chinese medical FMs on the benchmark. The experimental results showcase that generic FMs perform better than medical FMs in terms of self-diagnostic atomic knowledge. Error analysis revealed that both generic and medical FMs are sycophantic, e.g., always catering to users' claims when it comes to unknown knowledge. We further explored different types of data commonly adopted for fine-tuning medical FMs, i.e., real-world, semi-distilled, and distilled data, and found that distilled data can benefit FMs most.
