| **[Spatial Transformers for Radio Map Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01211v2)** | 2024-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Radio map estimation (RME) involves spatial interpolation of radio measurements to predict metrics such as the received signal strength at locations where no measurements were collected. The most popular estimators nowadays project the measurement locations to a regular grid and complete the resulting measurement tensor with a convolutional deep neural network. Unfortunately, these approaches suffer from poor spatial resolution and require a great number of parameters. The first contribution of this paper addresses these limitations by means of an attention-based estimator named Spatial TransfOrmer for Radio Map estimation (STORM). This scheme not only outperforms the existing estimators, but also exhibits lower computational complexity, translation equivariance, rotation equivariance, and full spatial resolution. The second contribution is an extended transformer architecture that allows STORM to perform active sensing, by which the next measurement location is selected based on the previous measurements. This is particularly useful for minimization of drive tests (MDT) in cellular networks, where operators request user equipment to collect measurements. Finally, STORM is extensively validated by experiments with one ray-tracing and two real-measurement datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[ESC-MISR: Enhancing Spatial Correlations for Multi-Image Super-Resolution in Remote Sensing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04706v1)** | 2024-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-Image Super-Resolution (MISR) is a crucial yet challenging research task in the remote sensing community. In this paper, we address the challenging task of Multi-Image Super-Resolution in Remote Sensing (MISR-RS), aiming to generate a High-Resolution (HR) image from multiple Low-Resolution (LR) images obtained by satellites. Recently, the weak temporal correlations among LR images have attracted increasing attention in the MISR-RS task. However, existing MISR methods treat the LR images as sequences with strong temporal correlations, overlooking spatial correlations and imposing temporal dependencies. To address this problem, we propose a novel end-to-end framework named Enhancing Spatial Correlations in MISR (ESC-MISR), which fully exploits the spatial-temporal relations of multiple images for HR image reconstruction. Specifically, we first introduce a novel fusion module named Multi-Image Spatial Transformer (MIST), which emphasizes parts with clearer global spatial features and enhances the spatial correlations between LR images. Besides, we perform a random shuffle strategy for the sequential inputs of LR images to attenuate temporal dependencies and capture weak temporal correlations in the training stage. Compared with the state-of-the-art methods, our ESC-MISR achieves 0.70dB and 0.76dB cPSNR improvements on the two bands of the PROBA-V dataset respectively, demonstrating the superiority of our method.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Nonparametric Clustering Stopping Rule Based on Spatial Median](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18730v2)** | 2024-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we introduce a nonparametric clustering stopping rule algorithm based on the spatial median. Our proposed method aims to achieve the balance between the homogeneity within the clusters and the heterogeneity between clusters. The proposed algorithm maximises the ratio of the variation between clusters and the variation within clusters while adjusting for the number of clusters and number of observations. The proposed algorithm is robust against distributional assumptions and the presence of outliers. Simulations have been used to validate the algorithm. We further evaluated the stability and the efficacy of the proposed algorithm using three real-world datasets. Moreover, we compared the performance of our model with 13 other traditional algorithms for determining the number of clusters. We found that the proposed algorithm outperformed 11 of the algorithms considered for comparison in terms of clustering number determination. The finding demonstrates that the proposed method provides a reliable alternative to determine the number of clusters for multivariate data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Smoothing of Headland Path Edges and Headland-to-Mainfield Lane Transitions Based on a Spatial Domain Transformation and Linear Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05979v2)** | 2024-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Within the context of in-field path planning and under the assumption of nonholonomic vehicle models this paper addresses two tasks: smoothing of headland path edges and smoothing of headland-to-mainfield lane transitions. Both tasks are solved by a two-step hierarchical algorithm. The first step differs for the two tasks generating either a piecewise-affine or a Dubins reference path. The second step leverages a transformation of vehicle dynamics from the time domain into the spatial domain and linear programming. Benefits such as a hyperparameter-free objective function and spatial constraints useful for area coverage gaps avoidance and precision path planning are discussed. The method, which is a deterministic optimisation-based method, is evaluated on 5 real-world fields solving 19 instances of the first task and 84 instances of the second task.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 11 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |
| **[TexLiverNet: Leveraging Medical Knowledge and Spatial-Frequency Perception for Enhanced Liver Tumor Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04595v1)** | 2024-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Integrating textual data with imaging in liver tumor segmentation is essential for enhancing diagnostic accuracy. However, current multi-modal medical datasets offer only general text annotations, lacking lesion-specific details critical for extracting nuanced features, especially for fine-grained segmentation of tumor boundaries and small lesions. To address these limitations, we developed datasets with lesion-specific text annotations for liver tumors and introduced the TexLiverNet model. TexLiverNet employs an agent-based cross-attention module that integrates text features efficiently with visual features, significantly reducing computational costs. Additionally, enhanced spatial and adaptive frequency domain perception is proposed to precisely delineate lesion boundaries, reduce background interference, and recover fine details in small lesions. Comprehensive evaluations on public and private datasets demonstrate that TexLiverNet achieves superior performance compared to current state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Structured Estimator for large Covariance Matrices in the Presence of Pairwise and Spatial Covariates](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04520v1)** | 2024-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the problem of estimating a high-dimensional covariance matrix from a small number of observations when covariates on pairs of variables are available and the variables can have spatial structure. This is motivated by the problem arising in demography of estimating the covariance matrix of the total fertility rate (TFR) of 195 different countries when only 11 observations are available. We construct an estimator for high-dimensional covariance matrices by exploiting information about pairwise covariates, such as whether pairs of variables belong to the same cluster, or spatial structure of the variables, and interactions between the covariates. We reformulate the problem in terms of a mixed effects model. This requires the estimation of only a small number of parameters, which are easy to interpret and which can be selected using standard procedures. The estimator is consistent under general conditions, and asymptotically normal. It works if the mean and variance structure of the data is already specified or if some of the data are missing. We assess its performance under our model assumptions, as well as under model misspecification, using simulations. We find that it outperforms several popular alternatives. We apply it to the TFR dataset and draw some conclusions.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 5 figures, submitted to the Annals of Applied Statistics</p></details> |
| **[Spatially Non-Stationary XL-MIMO Channel Estimation: A Three-Layer Generalized Approximate Message Passing Method](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02633v4)** | 2024-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, channel estimation problem for extremely large-scale multi-input multi-output (XL-MIMO) systems is investigated with the considerations of the spherical wavefront effect and the spatially non-stationary (SnS) property. Due to the diversities of SnS characteristics among different propagation paths, the concurrent channel estimation of multiple paths becomes intractable. To address this challenge, we propose a two-phase channel estimation scheme. In the first phase, the angles of departure (AoDs) on the user side are estimated, and a carefully designed pilot transmission scheme enables the decomposition of the received signal from different paths. In the second phase, the subchannel estimation corresponding to different paths is formulated as a three-layer Bayesian inference problem. Specifically, the first layer captures block sparsity in the angular domain, the second layer promotes SnS property in the antenna domain, and the third layer decouples the subchannels from the observed signals. To efficiently facilitate Bayesian inference, we propose a novel three-layer generalized approximate message passing (TL-GAMP) algorithm based on structured variational massage passing and belief propagation rules. Simulation results validate the convergence and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, showcasing its robustness to different channel scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>A rev...</summary><p>A revised manuscript has been submitted to the IEEE journal for possible publication</p></details> |
| **[DiMSUM: Diffusion Mamba -- A Scalable and Unified Spatial-Frequency Method for Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04168v1)** | 2024-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a novel state-space architecture for diffusion models, effectively harnessing spatial and frequency information to enhance the inductive bias towards local features in input images for image generation tasks. While state-space networks, including Mamba, a revolutionary advancement in recurrent neural networks, typically scan input sequences from left to right, they face difficulties in designing effective scanning strategies, especially in the processing of image data. Our method demonstrates that integrating wavelet transformation into Mamba enhances the local structure awareness of visual inputs and better captures long-range relations of frequencies by disentangling them into wavelet subbands, representing both low- and high-frequency components. These wavelet-based outputs are then processed and seamlessly fused with the original Mamba outputs through a cross-attention fusion layer, combining both spatial and frequency information to optimize the order awareness of state-space models which is essential for the details and overall quality of image generation. Besides, we introduce a globally-shared transformer to supercharge the performance of Mamba, harnessing its exceptional power to capture global relationships. Through extensive experiments on standard benchmarks, our method demonstrates superior results compared to DiT and DIFFUSSM, achieving faster training convergence and delivering high-quality outputs. The codes and pretrained models are released at https://github.com/VinAIResearch/DiMSUM.git.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2024.

| **[GIS Copilot: Towards an Autonomous GIS Agent for Spatial Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03205v2)** | 2024-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in Generative AI offer promising capabilities for spatial analysis. Despite their potential, the integration of generative AI with established GIS platforms remains underexplored. In this study, we propose a framework for integrating LLMs directly into existing GIS platforms, using QGIS as an example. Our approach leverages the reasoning and programming capabilities of LLMs to autonomously generate spatial analysis workflows and code through an informed agent that has comprehensive documentation of key GIS tools and parameters. The implementation of this framework resulted in the development of a "GIS Copilot" that allows GIS users to interact with QGIS using natural language commands for spatial analysis. The GIS Copilot was evaluated based on three complexity levels: basic tasks that require one GIS tool and typically involve one data layer to perform simple operations; intermediate tasks involving multi-step processes with multiple tools, guided by user instructions; and advanced tasks which involve multi-step processes that require multiple tools but not guided by user instructions, necessitating the agent to independently decide on and executes the necessary steps. The evaluation reveals that the GIS Copilot demonstrates strong potential in automating foundational GIS operations, with a high success rate in tool selection and code generation for basic and intermediate tasks, while challenges remain in achieving full autonomy for more complex tasks. This study contributes to the emerging vision of Autonomous GIS, providing a pathway for non-experts to engage with geospatial analysis with minimal prior expertise. While full autonomy is yet to be achieved, the GIS Copilot demonstrates significant potential for simplifying GIS workflows and enhancing decision-making processes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Series ridge regression for spatial data on $\mathbb{R}^d$](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02773v5)** | 2024-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper develops a general asymptotic theory of series estimators for spatial data collected at irregularly spaced locations within a sampling region $R_n \subset \mathbb{R}^d$. We employ a stochastic sampling design that can flexibly generate irregularly spaced sampling sites, encompassing both pure increasing and mixed increasing domain frameworks. Specifically, we focus on a spatial trend regression model and a nonparametric regression model with spatially dependent covariates. For these models, we investigate $L^2$-penalized series estimation of the trend and regression functions. We establish uniform and $L^2$ convergence rates and multivariate central limit theorems for general series estimators as main results. Additionally, we show that spline and wavelet series estimators achieve optimal uniform and $L^2$ convergence rates and propose methods for constructing confidence intervals for these estimators. Finally, we demonstrate that our dependence structure conditions on the underlying spatial processes include a broad class of random fields, including L\'evy-driven continuous autoregressive and moving average random fields.</p></details> | 54 pages |
| **[A Subsampling Based Neural Network for Spatial Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03620v1)** | 2024-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The application of deep neural networks in geospatial data has become a trending research problem in the present day. A significant amount of statistical research has already been introduced, such as generalized least square optimization by incorporating spatial variance-covariance matrix, considering basis functions in the input nodes of the neural networks, and so on. However, for lattice data, there is no available literature about the utilization of asymptotic analysis of neural networks in regression for spatial data. This article proposes a consistent localized two-layer deep neural network-based regression for spatial data. We have proved the consistency of this deep neural network for bounded and unbounded spatial domains under a fixed sampling design of mixed-increasing spatial regions. We have proved that its asymptotic convergence rate is faster than that of \cite{zhan2024neural}'s neural network and an improved generalization of \cite{shen2023asymptotic}'s neural network structure. We empirically observe the rate of convergence of discrepancy measures between the empirical probability distribution of observed and predicted data, which will become faster for a less smooth spatial surface. We have applied our asymptotic analysis of deep neural networks to the estimation of the monthly average temperature of major cities in the USA from its satellite image. This application is an effective showcase of non-linear spatial regression. We demonstrate our methodology with simulated lattice data in various scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fine-Grained Spatial and Verbal Losses for 3D Visual Grounding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03405v1)** | 2024-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D visual grounding consists of identifying the instance in a 3D scene which is referred by an accompanying language description. While several architectures have been proposed within the commonly employed grounding-by-selection framework, the utilized losses are comparatively under-explored. In particular, most methods rely on a basic supervised cross-entropy loss on the predicted distribution over candidate instances, which fails to model both spatial relations between instances and the internal fine-grained word-level structure of the verbal referral. Sparse attempts to additionally supervise verbal embeddings globally by learning the class of the referred instance from the description or employing verbo-visual contrast to better separate instance embeddings do not fundamentally lift the aforementioned limitations. Responding to these shortcomings, we introduce two novel losses for 3D visual grounding: a visual-level offset loss on regressed vector offsets from each instance to the ground-truth referred instance and a language-related span loss on predictions for the word-level span of the referred instance in the description. In addition, we equip the verbo-visual fusion module of our new 3D visual grounding architecture AsphaltNet with a top-down bidirectional attentive fusion block, which enables the supervisory signals from our two losses to propagate to the respective converse branches of the network and thus aid the latter to learn context-aware instance embeddings and grounding-aware verbal embeddings. AsphaltNet proposes novel auxiliary losses to aid 3D visual grounding with competitive results compared to the state-of-the-art on the ReferIt3D benchmark.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at WACV 2025</p></details> |
| **[Blind Estimation of Sub-band Acoustic Parameters from Ambisonics Recordings using Spectro-Spatial Covariance Features](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03172v1)** | 2024-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Estimating frequency-varying acoustic parameters is essential for enhancing immersive perception in realistic spatial audio creation. In this paper, we propose a unified framework that blindly estimates reverberation time (T60), direct-to-reverberant ratio (DRR), and clarity (C50) across 10 frequency bands using first-order Ambisonics (FOA) speech recordings as inputs. The proposed framework utilizes a novel feature named Spectro-Spatial Covariance Vector (SSCV), efficiently representing temporal, spectral as well as spatial information of the FOA signal. Our models significantly outperform existing single-channel methods with only spectral information, reducing estimation errors by more than half for all three acoustic parameters. Additionally, we introduce FOA-Conv3D, a novel back-end network for effectively utilising the SSCV feature with a 3D convolutional encoder. FOA-Conv3D outperforms the convolutional neural network (CNN) and recurrent convolutional neural network (CRNN) backends, achieving lower estimation errors and accounting for a higher proportion of variance (PoV) for all 3 acoustic parameters.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ICASSP2025</p></details> |
| **[What Roles can Spatial Modulation and Space Shift Keying Play in LEO Satellite-Assisted Communication?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17553v3)** | 2024-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, the rapid evolution of satellite communications play a pivotal role in addressing the ever-increasing demand for global connectivity, among which the Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites attract a great amount of attention due to their low latency and high data throughput capabilities. Based on this, we explore spatial modulation (SM) and space shift keying (SSK) designs as pivotal techniques to enhance spectral efficiency (SE) and bit-error rate (BER) performance in the LEO satellite-assisted multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. The various performance analysis of these designs are presented in this paper, revealing insightful findings and conclusions through analytical methods and Monte Carlo simulations with perfect and imperfect channel state information (CSI) estimation. The results provide a comprehensive analysis of the merits and trade-offs associated with the investigated schemes, particularly in terms of BER, computational complexity, and SE. This analysis underscores the potential of both schemes as viable candidates for future 6G LEO satellite-assisted wireless communication systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[TRANSPOSE: Transitional Approaches for Spatially-Aware LFI Resilient FSM Encoding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02798v1)** | 2024-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Finite state machines (FSMs) regulate sequential circuits, including access to sensitive information and privileged CPU states. Courtesy of contemporary research on laser attacks, laser-based fault injection (LFI) is becoming even more precise where an adversary can thwart chip security by altering individual flip-flop (FF) values. Different laser models, e.g., bit flip, bit set, and bit reset, have been developed to appreciate LFI on practical targets. As traditional approaches may incorporate substantial overhead, state-based SPARSE and transition-based TAMED countermeasures were proposed in our prior work to improve FSM resiliency efficiently. TAMED overcame SPARSE's limitation of being too conservative, and generating multiple LFI resilient encodings for contemporary LFI models on demand. SPARSE, however, incorporated design layout information into its vulnerability estimation which makes its vulnerability estimation metric more accurate. In this paper, we extend TAMED by proposing a transition-based encoding CAD framework (TRANSPOSE), that incorporates spatial transitional vulnerability metrics to quantify design susceptibility of FSMs based on both the bit flip model and the set-reset models. TRANSPOSE also incorporates floorplan optimization into its framework to accommodate secure spatial inter-distance of FF-sensitive regions. All TRANSPOSE approaches are demonstrated on 5 multifarious benchmarks and outperform existing FSM encoding schemes/frameworks in terms of security and overhead.</p></details> | 14 pages, 11 figures |
| **[CollaMamba: Efficient Collaborative Perception with Cross-Agent Spatial-Temporal State Space Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07714v3)** | 2024-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>By sharing complementary perceptual information, multi-agent collaborative perception fosters a deeper understanding of the environment. Recent studies on collaborative perception mostly utilize CNNs or Transformers to learn feature representation and fusion in the spatial dimension, which struggle to handle long-range spatial-temporal features under limited computing and communication resources. Holistically modeling the dependencies over extensive spatial areas and extended temporal frames is crucial to enhancing feature quality. To this end, we propose a resource efficient cross-agent spatial-temporal collaborative state space model (SSM), named CollaMamba. Initially, we construct a foundational backbone network based on spatial SSM. This backbone adeptly captures positional causal dependencies from both single-agent and cross-agent views, yielding compact and comprehensive intermediate features while maintaining linear complexity. Furthermore, we devise a history-aware feature boosting module based on temporal SSM, extracting contextual cues from extended historical frames to refine vague features while preserving low overhead. Extensive experiments across several datasets demonstrate that CollaMamba outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving higher model accuracy while reducing computational and communication overhead by up to 71.9% and 1/64, respectively. This work pioneers the exploration of the Mamba's potential in collaborative perception. The source code will be made available.</p></details> |  |
| **[Is A Picture Worth A Thousand Words? Delving Into Spatial Reasoning for Vision Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14852v2)** | 2024-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across a wide range of tasks and domains. Despite this promise, spatial understanding and reasoning -- a fundamental component of human cognition -- remains under-explored. We propose SpatialEval, a novel benchmark that covers diverse aspects of spatial reasoning such as relationship understanding, navigation, and counting. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of competitive language and vision-language models. Our findings reveal several counter-intuitive insights that have been overlooked in the literature: (1) Spatial reasoning poses significant challenges where competitive models can fall behind random guessing; (2) Despite additional visual input, VLMs often under-perform compared to their LLM counterparts; (3) When both textual and visual information is available, multi-modal language models become less reliant on visual information if sufficient textual clues are provided. Additionally, we demonstrate that leveraging redundancy between vision and text can significantly enhance model performance. We hope our study will inform the development of multimodal models to improve spatial intelligence and further close the gap with human intelligence.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |
| **[SPACE: 3D Spatial Co-operation and Exploration Framework for Robust Mapping and Coverage with Multi-Robot Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02524v1)** | 2024-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In indoor environments, multi-robot visual (RGB-D) mapping and exploration hold immense potential for application in domains such as domestic service and logistics, where deploying multiple robots in the same environment can significantly enhance efficiency. However, there are two primary challenges: (1) the "ghosting trail" effect, which occurs due to overlapping views of robots impacting the accuracy and quality of point cloud reconstruction, and (2) the oversight of visual reconstructions in selecting the most effective frontiers for exploration. Given these challenges are interrelated, we address them together by proposing a new semi-distributed framework (SPACE) for spatial cooperation in indoor environments that enables enhanced coverage and 3D mapping. SPACE leverages geometric techniques, including "mutual awareness" and a "dynamic robot filter," to overcome spatial mapping constraints. Additionally, we introduce a novel spatial frontier detection system and map merger, integrated with an adaptive frontier assigner for optimal coverage balancing the exploration and reconstruction objectives. In extensive ROS-Gazebo simulations, SPACE demonstrated superior performance over state-of-the-art approaches in both exploration and mapping metrics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Grid-Based Projection of Spatial Data into Knowledge Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02309v1)** | 2024-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Spatial Knowledge Graphs (SKG) are experiencing growing adoption as a means to model real-world entities, proving especially invaluable in domains like crisis management and urban planning. Considering that RDF specifications offer limited support for effectively managing spatial information, it's common practice to include text-based serializations of geometrical features, such as polygons and lines, as string literals in knowledge graphs. Consequently, Spatial Knowledge Graphs (SKGs) often rely on geo-enabled RDF Stores capable of parsing, interpreting, and indexing such serializations. In this paper, we leverage grid cells as the foundational element of SKGs and demonstrate how efficiently the spatial characteristics of real-world entities and their attributes can be encoded within knowledge graphs. Furthermore, we introduce a novel methodology for representing street networks in knowledge graphs, diverging from the conventional practice of individually capturing each street segment. Instead, our approach is based on tessellating the street network using grid cells and creating a simplified representation that could be utilized for various routing and navigation tasks, solely relying on RDF specifications.</p></details> |  |
| **[ManiBox: Enhancing Spatial Grasping Generalization via Scalable Simulation Data Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01850v1)** | 2024-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning a precise robotic grasping policy is crucial for embodied agents operating in complex real-world manipulation tasks. Despite significant advancements, most models still struggle with accurate spatial positioning of objects to be grasped. We first show that this spatial generalization challenge stems primarily from the extensive data requirements for adequate spatial understanding. However, collecting such data with real robots is prohibitively expensive, and relying on simulation data often leads to visual generalization gaps upon deployment. To overcome these challenges, we then focus on state-based policy generalization and present \textbf{ManiBox}, a novel bounding-box-guided manipulation method built on a simulation-based teacher-student framework. The teacher policy efficiently generates scalable simulation data using bounding boxes, which are proven to uniquely determine the objects' spatial positions. The student policy then utilizes these low-dimensional spatial states to enable zero-shot transfer to real robots. Through comprehensive evaluations in simulated and real-world environments, ManiBox demonstrates a marked improvement in spatial grasping generalization and adaptability to diverse objects and backgrounds. Further, our empirical study into scaling laws for policy performance indicates that spatial volume generalization scales positively with data volume. For a certain level of spatial volume, the success rate of grasping empirically follows Michaelis-Menten kinetics relative to data volume, showing a saturation effect as data increases. Our videos and code are available in https://thkkk.github.io/manibox.</p></details> |  |
| **[FedASTA: Federated adaptive spatial-temporal attention for traffic flow prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13090v2)** | 2024-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mobile devices and the Internet of Things (IoT) devices nowadays generate a large amount of heterogeneous spatial-temporal data. It remains a challenging problem to model the spatial-temporal dynamics under privacy concern. Federated learning (FL) has been proposed as a framework to enable model training across distributed devices without sharing original data which reduce privacy concern. Personalized federated learning (PFL) methods further address data heterogenous problem. However, these methods don't consider natural spatial relations among nodes. For the sake of modeling spatial relations, Graph Neural Netowork (GNN) based FL approach have been proposed. But dynamic spatial-temporal relations among edge nodes are not taken into account. Several approaches model spatial-temporal dynamics in a centralized environment, while less effort has been made under federated setting. To overcome these challeges, we propose a novel Federated Adaptive Spatial-Temporal Attention (FedASTA) framework to model the dynamic spatial-temporal relations. On the client node, FedASTA extracts temporal relations and trend patterns from the decomposed terms of original time series. Then, on the server node, FedASTA utilize trend patterns from clients to construct adaptive temporal-spatial aware graph which captures dynamic correlation between clients. Besides, we design a masked spatial attention module with both static graph and constructed adaptive graph to model spatial dependencies among clients. Extensive experiments on five real-world public traffic flow datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-art performance in federated scenario. In addition, the experiments made in centralized setting show the effectiveness of our novel adaptive graph construction approach compared with other popular dynamic spatial-temporal aware methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Modeling Home Range and Intra-Specific Spatial Interaction in Wild Animal Populations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01694v1)** | 2024-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Interactions among individuals from the same-species of wild animals are an important component of population dynamics. An interaction can be either static (based on overlap of space use) or dynamic (based on movement). The goal of this work is to determine the level of static interactions between individuals from the same-species of wild animals using 95\% and 50\% home ranges, as well as to model their movement interactions, which could include attraction, avoidance (or repulsion), or lack of interaction, in order to gain new insights and improve our understanding of ecological processes. Home range estimation methods (minimum convex polygon, kernel density estimator, and autocorrelated kernel density estimator), inhomogeneous multitype (or cross-type) summary statistics, and envelope testing methods (pointwise and global envelope tests) were proposed to study the nature of the same-species wild-animal spatial interactions. Using GPS collar data, we applied the methods to quantify both static and dynamic interactions between black bears in southern Alabama, USA. In general, our findings suggest that the black bears in our dataset showed no significant preference to live together or apart, i.e., there was no significant deviation from independence toward association or avoidance (i.e., segregation) between the bears.</p></details> |  |

However, accurately capturing interactions across multiple spatial and temporal scales remains a significant challenge. We present a novel framework that jointly models spatial and temporal multiscale interactions in molecular dynamics. Our approach leverages Graph Fourier Transforms to decompose molecular structures into different spatial scales and employs Neural Ordinary Differential Equations to model the temporal dynamics in a curated manner influenced by the spatial modes. This unified framework links spatial structures with temporal evolution in a flexible manner, enabling more accurate and comprehensive simulations of molecular systems. We evaluate our model on the MD17 dataset, demonstrating consistent performance improvements over state-of-the-art baselines across multiple molecules, particularly under challenging conditions such as irregular timestep sampling and long-term prediction horizons. Ablation studies confirm the significant contributions of both spatial and temporal multiscale modeling components. Our method advances the simulation of complex molecular systems, potentially accelerating research in computational chemistry, drug discovery, and materials science.</p></details> |  |
| **[HEST-1k: A Dataset for Spatial Transcriptomics and Histology Image Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16192v2)** | 2024-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial transcriptomics enables interrogating the molecular composition of tissue with ever-increasing resolution and sensitivity. However, costs, rapidly evolving technology, and lack of standards have constrained computational methods in ST to narrow tasks and small cohorts. In addition, the underlying tissue morphology, as reflected by H&E-stained whole slide images (WSIs), encodes rich information often overlooked in ST studies. Here, we introduce HEST-1k, a collection of 1,229 spatial transcriptomic profiles, each linked to a WSI and extensive metadata. HEST-1k was assembled from 153 public and internal cohorts encompassing 26 organs, two species (Homo Sapiens and Mus Musculus), and 367 cancer samples from 25 cancer types. HEST-1k processing enabled the identification of 2.1 million expression--morphology pairs and over 76 million nuclei.

The inherent uncertainty and variability in such data often render deterministic models insufficient, prompting a shift towards probabilistic approaches, where diffusion-based generative models have emerged as effective solutions. In this paper, we present ProGen, a novel framework for probabilistic spatiotemporal time series forecasting that leverages Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs) and diffusion-based generative modeling techniques in the continuous domain. By integrating a novel denoising score model, graph neural networks, and a tailored SDE, ProGen provides a robust solution that effectively captures spatiotemporal dependencies while managing uncertainty. Our extensive experiments on four benchmark traffic datasets demonstrate that ProGen outperforms state-of-the-art deterministic and probabilistic models. This work contributes a continuous, diffusion-based generative approach to spatiotemporal forecasting, paving the way for future research in probabilistic modeling and stochastic processes.</p></details> |  |

We use the setting of spatially invariant systems as an idealization for which concrete and detailed results are given. Such estimators are known to have a degree of spatial localization in the sense that the estimator gains decay in space, with the spatial decay rates serving as a proxy for how far measurements need to be shared in an optimal distributed estimator. In particular, we examine the dependence of spatial decay rates on problem specifications such as system dynamics, measurement and process noise variances, as well as their spatial autocorrelations. We propose non-dimensional parameters that characterize the decay rates as a function of problem specifications. In particular, we find an interesting matching condition between the characteristic lengthscale of the dynamics and the measurement noise correlation lengthscale for which the optimal centralized estimator is completely decentralized. A new technique - termed the Branch Point Locus - is introduced to quantify spatial decay rates in terms of analyticity regions in the complex spatial frequency plane. Our results are illustrated through two case studies of systems with dynamics modeled by diffusion and the Swift-Hohenberg equation, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[Local Indicators of Mark Association for Spatial Marked Point Processes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01065v1)** | 2024-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The emergence of distinct local mark behaviours is becoming increasingly common in the applications of spatial marked point processes. This dynamic highlights the limitations of existing global mark correlation functions in accurately identifying the true patterns of mark associations/variations among points as distinct mark behaviours might dominate one another, giving rise to an incomplete understanding of mark associations. In this paper, we introduce a family of local indicators of mark association (LIMA) functions for spatial marked point processes. These functions are defined on general state spaces and can include marks that are either real-valued or function-valued. Unlike global mark correlation functions, which are often distorted by the existence of distinct mark behaviours, LIMA functions reliably identify all types of mark associations and variations among points. Additionally, they accurately determine the interpoint distances where individual points show significant mark associations. Through simulation studies, featuring various scenarios, and four real applications in forestry, criminology, and urban mobility, we study spatial marked point processes in $\R^2$ and on linear networks with either real-valued or function-valued marks, demonstrating that LIMA functions significantly outperform the existing global mark correlation functions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted for publication</p></details> |
| **[Spatially-Aware Diffusion Models with Cross-Attention for Global Field Reconstruction with Sparse Observations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00230v2)** | 2024-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have gained attention for their ability to represent complex distributions and incorporate uncertainty, making them ideal for robust predictions in the presence of noisy or incomplete data. In this study, we develop and enhance score-based diffusion models in field reconstruction tasks, where the goal is to estimate complete spatial fields from partial observations. We introduce a condition encoding approach to construct a tractable mapping mapping between observed and unobserved regions using a learnable integration of sparse observations and interpolated fields as an inductive bias. With refined sensing representations and an unraveled temporal dimension, our method can handle arbitrary moving sensors and effectively reconstruct fields. Furthermore, we conduct a comprehensive benchmark of our approach against a deterministic interpolation-based method across various static and time-dependent PDEs. Our study attempts to addresses the gap in strong baselines for evaluating performance across varying sampling hyperparameters, noise levels, and conditioning methods. Our results show that diffusion models with cross-attention and the proposed conditional encoding generally outperform other methods under noisy conditions, although the deterministic method excels with noiseless data. Additionally, both the diffusion models and the deterministic method surpass the numerical approach in accuracy and computational cost for the steady problem. We also demonstrate the ability of the model to capture possible reconstructions and improve the accuracy of fused results in covariance-based correction tasks using ensemble sampling.</p></details> |  |
| **[How to Bridge Spatial and Temporal Heterogeneity in Link Prediction? A Contrastive Method](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00612v1)** | 2024-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal Heterogeneous Networks play a crucial role in capturing the dynamics and heterogeneity inherent in various real-world complex systems, rendering them a noteworthy research avenue for link prediction. However, existing methods fail to capture the fine-grained differential distribution patterns and temporal dynamic characteristics, which we refer to as spatial heterogeneity and temporal heterogeneity. To overcome such limitations, we propose a novel \textbf{C}ontrastive Learning-based \textbf{L}ink \textbf{P}rediction model, \textbf{CLP}, which employs a multi-view hierarchical self-supervised architecture to encode spatial and temporal heterogeneity. Specifically, aiming at spatial heterogeneity, we develop a spatial feature modeling layer to capture the fine-grained topological distribution patterns from node- and edge-level representations, respectively. Furthermore, aiming at temporal heterogeneity, we devise a temporal information modeling layer to perceive the evolutionary dependencies of dynamic graph topologies from time-level representations. Finally, we encode the spatial and temporal distribution heterogeneity from a contrastive learning perspective, enabling a comprehensive self-supervised hierarchical relation modeling for the link prediction task. Extensive experiments conducted on four real-world dynamic heterogeneous network datasets verify that our \mymodel consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art models, demonstrating an average improvement of 10.10\%, 13.44\% in terms of AUC and AP, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[Human Action Recognition (HAR) Using Skeleton-based Spatial Temporal Relative Transformer Network: ST-RTR](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23806v2)** | 2024-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human Action Recognition (HAR) is an interesting research area in human-computer interaction used to monitor the activities of elderly and disabled individuals affected by physical and mental health. In the recent era, skeleton-based HAR has received much attention because skeleton data has shown that it can handle changes in striking, body size, camera views, and complex backgrounds. One key characteristic of ST-GCN is automatically learning spatial and temporal patterns from skeleton sequences. It has some limitations, as this method only works for short-range correlation due to its limited receptive field. Consequently, understanding human action requires long-range interconnection. To address this issue, we developed a spatial-temporal relative transformer ST-RTR model. The ST-RTR includes joint and relay nodes, which allow efficient communication and data transmission within the network. These nodes help to break the inherent spatial and temporal skeleton topologies, which enables the model to understand long-range human action better. Furthermore, we combine ST-RTR with a fusion model for further performance improvements. To assess the performance of the ST-RTR method, we conducted experiments on three skeleton-based HAR benchmarks: NTU RGB+D 60, NTU RGB+D 120, and UAV-Human. It boosted CS and CV by 2.11 % and 1.45% on NTU RGB+D 60, 1.25% and 1.05% on NTU RGB+D 120. On UAV-Human datasets, accuracy improved by 2.54%. The experimental outcomes explain that the proposed ST-RTR model significantly improves action recognition associated with the standard ST-GCN method.</p></details> |  |

Here, we provide theoretical conditions under which cooperation thrive in spatial PGGs on any population structure, which are accurate under weak selection. We find that PGGs can support cooperation across all kinds of model details and on almost all network structures in contrast to pairwise games. For example, a class of networks that would otherwise fail to produce cooperation, such as star graphs, are particularly conducive to cooperation in spatial PGGs. This fundamental advantage of spatial PGGs derives from reciprocity through second-order interactions, allowing local structures such as the clustering coefficient to play positive roles. We also verify the robustness of spatial PGGs on empirical networks where pairwise games cannot support cooperation, which implies that PGGs could be a universal interaction mode in real-world systems.</p></details> | 56 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Improving Traffic Flow Predictions with SGCN-LSTM: A Hybrid Model for Spatial and Temporal Dependencies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00282v1)** | 2024-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large amounts of traffic can lead to negative effects such as increased car accidents, air pollution, and significant time wasted. Understanding traffic speeds on any given road segment can be highly beneficial for traffic management strategists seeking to reduce congestion. While recent studies have primarily focused on modeling spatial dependencies by using graph convolutional networks (GCNs) over fixed weighted graphs, the relationships between nodes are often more complex, with edges that interact dynamically. This paper addresses both the temporal patterns in traffic data and the intricate spatial dependencies by introducing the Signal-Enhanced Graph Convolutional Network Long Short Term Memory (SGCN-LSTM) model for predicting traffic speeds across road networks. Extensive experiments on the PEMS-BAY road network traffic dataset demonstrate the SGCN-LSTM model's effectiveness, yielding significant improvements in Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) compared to benchmark models on the same dataset.</p></details> | 5 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Multi-modal Spatial Clustering for Spatial Transcriptomics Utilizing High-resolution Histology Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02534v1)** | 2024-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding the intricate cellular environment within biological tissues is crucial for uncovering insights into complex biological functions. While single-cell RNA sequencing has significantly enhanced our understanding of cellular states, it lacks the spatial context necessary to fully comprehend the cellular environment. Spatial transcriptomics (ST) addresses this limitation by enabling transcriptome-wide gene expression profiling while preserving spatial context. One of the principal challenges in ST data analysis is spatial clustering, which reveals spatial domains based on the spots within a tissue. Modern ST sequencing procedures typically include a high-resolution histology image, which has been shown in previous studies to be closely connected to gene expression profiles. However, current spatial clustering methods often fail to fully integrate high-resolution histology image features with gene expression data, limiting their ability to capture critical spatial and cellular interactions. In this study, we propose the spatial transcriptomics multi-modal clustering (stMMC) model, a novel contrastive learning-based deep learning approach that integrates gene expression data with histology image features through a multi-modal parallel graph autoencoder. We tested stMMC against four state-of-the-art baseline models: Leiden, GraphST, SpaGCN, and stLearn on two public ST datasets with 13 sample slices in total. The experiments demonstrated that stMMC outperforms all the baseline models in terms of ARI and NMI. An ablation study further validated the contributions of contrastive learning and the incorporation of histology image features.</p></details> | 9 pages |

Traditional methods usually break this task into multiple subtasks, each requiring complex transformations between different data representations. For instance, dense reconstruction through Structure-from-Motion (SfM) involves converting images into key points, optimizing camera parameters, and estimating structures. Afterward, accurate sparse reconstructions are required for further dense modeling, which is subsequently fed into task-specific neural networks. This multi-step process results in considerable processing time and increased engineering complexity. In this work, we present the Large Spatial Model (LSM), which processes unposed RGB images directly into semantic radiance fields. LSM simultaneously estimates geometry, appearance, and semantics in a single feed-forward operation, and it can generate versatile label maps by interacting with language at novel viewpoints. Leveraging a Transformer-based architecture, LSM integrates global geometry through pixel-aligned point maps. To enhance spatial attribute regression, we incorporate local context aggregation with multi-scale fusion, improving the accuracy of fine local details. To tackle the scarcity of labeled 3D semantic data and enable natural language-driven scene manipulation, we incorporate a pre-trained 2D language-based segmentation model into a 3D-consistent semantic feature field. An efficient decoder then parameterizes a set of semantic anisotropic Gaussians, facilitating supervised end-to-end learning. Extensive experiments across various tasks show that LSM unifies multiple 3D vision tasks directly from unposed images, achieving real-time semantic 3D reconstruction for the first time.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Website: https://largespatialmodel.github.io</p></details> |
| **[Decoupling Semantic Similarity from Spatial Alignment for Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23107v1)** | 2024-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>What representation do deep neural networks learn? How similar are images to each other for neural networks? Despite the overwhelming success of deep learning methods key questions about their internal workings still remain largely unanswered, due to their internal high dimensionality and complexity. To address this, one approach is to measure the similarity of activation responses to various inputs. Representational Similarity Matrices (RSMs) distill this similarity into scalar values for each input pair. These matrices encapsulate the entire similarity structure of a system, indicating which input leads to similar responses. While the similarity between images is ambiguous, we argue that the spatial location of semantic objects does neither influence human perception nor deep learning classifiers. Thus this should be reflected in the definition of similarity between image responses for computer vision systems. Revisiting the established similarity calculations for RSMs we expose their sensitivity to spatial alignment. In this paper, we propose to solve this through semantic RSMs, which are invariant to spatial permutation. We measure semantic similarity between input responses by formulating it as a set-matching problem. Further, we quantify the superiority of semantic RSMs over spatio-semantic RSMs through image retrieval and by comparing the similarity between representations to the similarity between predicted class probabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS2024</p></details> |

This study proposes a framework for quantitative fire pattern classification to support fire investigators, aiming for consistency and accuracy. The framework integrates four components. First, it leverages human-computer interaction to extract fire patterns from surfaces, combining investigator expertise with computational analysis. Second, it employs an aspect ratio-based random forest model to classify fire pattern shapes. Third, fire scene point cloud segmentation enables precise identification of fire-affected areas and the mapping of 2D fire patterns to 3D scenes. Lastly, spatial relationships between fire patterns and indoor elements support an interpretation of the fire scene. These components provide a method for fire pattern analysis that synthesizes qualitative and quantitative data. The framework's classification results achieve 93% precision on synthetic data and 83% on real fire patterns.</p></details> |  |

Most existing algorithms only perform pixel-level or feature-level fusion from different modalities in the spatial domain. They usually overlook the information in the frequency domain, and some of them suffer from inefficiency due to excessively complex structures. To tackle these challenges, this paper proposes an efficient Spatial-Frequency Domain Fusion (SFDFusion) network for infrared and visible image fusion. First, we propose a Dual-Modality Refinement Module (DMRM) to extract complementary information. This module extracts useful information from both the infrared and visible modalities in the spatial domain and enhances fine-grained spatial details. Next, to introduce frequency domain information, we construct a Frequency Domain Fusion Module (FDFM) that transforms the spatial domain to the frequency domain through Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and then integrates frequency domain information. Additionally, we design a frequency domain fusion loss to provide guidance for the fusion process. Extensive experiments on public datasets demonstrate that our method produces fused images with significant advantages in various fusion metrics and visual effects. Furthermore, our method demonstrates high efficiency in image fusion and good performance on downstream detection tasks, thereby satisfying the real-time demands of advanced visual tasks.</p></details> | accept in ECAI 2024 |

However, numerous benign conditions can cause increased uptake of radiopharmaceuticals, confounding differentiation from malignant tumors. Several studies have indicated that dual-time PET imaging holds promise in distinguishing between malignant and benign tumor processes. Nevertheless, the hour-long distribution period of radiopharmaceuticals post-injection complicates the determination of optimal timing for the second scan, presenting challenges in both practical applications and research. Notably, we have identified that delay time PET imaging can be framed as an image-to-image conversion problem. Motivated by this insight, we propose a novel spatial-temporal guided diffusion transformer probabilistic model (st-DTPM) to solve dual-time PET imaging prediction problem. Specifically, this architecture leverages the U-net framework that integrates patch-wise features of CNN and pixel-wise relevance of Transformer to obtain local and global information. And then employs a conditional DDPM model for image synthesis. Furthermore, on spatial condition, we concatenate early scan PET images and noisy PET images on every denoising step to guide the spatial distribution of denoising sampling. On temporal condition, we convert diffusion time steps and delay time to a universal time vector, then embed it to each layer of model architecture to further improve the accuracy of predictions. Experimental results demonstrated the superiority of our method over alternative approaches in preserving image quality and structural information, thereby affirming its efficacy in predictive task.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing methods can only predict up to four hours in the future, which doesn't quite meet real-world demands. we identify that the prediction horizon is limited to a few hours mainly due to the separation of temporal and spatial factors, which results in high complexity.

Extralonger notably extends the prediction horizon to a week on real-world benchmarks, demonstrating superior efficiency in the training time, inference time, and memory usage.

While diffusion models have been applied for both spatial and temporal SR, few studies have explored their use for joint spatial and temporal SR, particularly in medical imaging. In this work, we address this gap by proposing to use a Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) combined with a Vector Quantised GAN (VQGAN)-based encoder-decoder architecture for joint super resolution. We frame SR as an image denoising problem, focusing on improving both spatial and temporal resolution in medical images. Using the cardiac MRI dataset from the Data Science Bowl Cardiac Challenge, consisting of 2D cine images with a spatial resolution of 256x256 and 8-14 slices per time-step, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Our LDM model achieves Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) of 30.37, Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) of 0.7580, and Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity (LPIPS) of 0.2756, outperforming simple baseline method by 5% in PSNR, 6.5% in SSIM, 39% in LPIPS. Our LDM model generates images with high fidelity and perceptual quality with 15 diffusion steps. These results suggest that LDMs hold promise for advancing super resolution in medical imaging, potentially enhancing diagnostic accuracy and patient outcomes.

However, decoding intentions from MI remains challenging due to the inherent complexity of EEG signals relative to the small-sample size. To address this issue, we propose a spatial-spectral and temporal dual prototype network (SST-DPN). First, we design a lightweight attention mechanism to uniformly model the spatial-spectral relationships across multiple EEG electrodes, enabling the extraction of powerful spatial-spectral features. Then, we develop a multi-scale variance pooling module tailored for EEG signals to capture long-term temporal features. This module is parameter-free and computationally efficient, offering clear advantages over the widely used transformer models. Furthermore, we introduce dual prototype learning to optimize the feature space distribution and training process, thereby improving the model's generalization ability on small-sample MI datasets. Our experimental results show that the SST-DPN outperforms state-of-the-art models with superior classification accuracy (84.11% for dataset BCI4-2A, 86.65% for dataset BCI4-2B). Additionally, we use the BCI3-4A dataset with fewer training data to further validate the generalization ability of the proposed SST-DPN. We also achieve superior performance with 82.03% classification accuracy. Benefiting from the lightweight parameters and superior decoding accuracy, our SST-DPN shows great potential for practical MI-BCI applications.

| **[Spatial-Aware Conformal Prediction for Trustworthy Hyperspectral Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01236v2)** | 2024-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hyperspectral image (HSI) classification involves assigning unique labels to each pixel to identify various land cover categories. While deep classifiers have achieved high predictive accuracy in this field, they lack the ability to rigorously quantify confidence in their predictions. Quantifying the certainty of model predictions is crucial for the safe usage of predictive models, and this limitation restricts their application in critical contexts where the cost of prediction errors is significant. To support the safe deployment of HSI classifiers, we first provide a theoretical proof establishing the validity of the emerging uncertainty quantification technique, conformal prediction, in the context of HSI classification. We then propose a conformal procedure that equips any trained HSI classifier with trustworthy prediction sets, ensuring that these sets include the true labels with a user-specified probability (e.g., 95\%). Building on this foundation, we introduce Spatial-Aware Conformal Prediction (\texttt{SACP}), a conformal prediction framework specifically designed for HSI data. This method integrates essential spatial information inherent in HSIs by aggregating the non-conformity scores of pixels with high spatial correlation, which effectively enhances the efficiency of prediction sets.

| **[Constrained Transformer-Based Porous Media Generation to Spatial Distribution of Rock Properties](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21462v1)** | 2024-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pore-scale modeling of rock images based on information in 3D micro-computed tomography data is crucial for studying complex subsurface processes such as CO2 and brine multiphase flow during Geologic Carbon Storage (GCS). While deep learning models can generate 3D rock microstructures that match static rock properties, they have two key limitations: they don't account for the spatial distribution of rock properties that can have an important influence on the flow and transport characteristics (such as permeability and relative permeability) of the rock and they generate structures below the representative elementary volume (REV) scale for those transport properties. Addressing these issues is crucial for building a consistent workflow between pore-scale analysis and field-scale modeling. To address these challenges, we propose a two-stage modeling framework that combines a Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQVAE) and a transformer model for spatial upscaling and arbitrary-size 3D porous media reconstruction in an autoregressive manner. The VQVAE first compresses and quantizes sub-volume training images into low-dimensional tokens, while we train a transformer to spatially assemble these tokens into larger images following specific spatial order. By employing a multi-token generation strategy, our approach preserves both sub-volume integrity and spatial relationships among these sub-image patches. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our multi-token transformer generation approach and validate it using real data from a test well, showcasing its potential to generate models for the porous media at the well scale using only a spatial porosity model. The interpolated representative porous media that reflect field-scale geological properties accurately model transport properties, including permeability and multiphase flow relative permeability of CO2 and brine.</p></details> | 24 pages |

Although necessary to provide sustainable sources of energy and food, careful planning will be important to make informed decisions and avoid conflicts. This paper examines several techniques used for marine spatial planning, an approach for analyzing and planning the use of marine resources. Using open source software including QGIS and Python, the potential for developing wave-powered offshore aquaculture farms using the RM3 wave energy converter along the Northeast coast of the United States is assessed and several feasible sites are identified. The optimal site, located at 43.7{\deg}N, 68.9{\deg}W along the coast of Maine, has a total cost for a 5-pen farm of \$56.8M, annual fish yield of 676 tonnes, and a levelized cost of fish of \$9.23 per kilogram. Overall trends indicate that the cost greatly decreases with distance to shore due to the greater availability of wave energy and that conflicts and environmental constraints significantly limit the number of feasible sites in this region.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatial causal inference in the presence of preferential sampling to study the impacts of marine protected areas](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21213v1)** | 2024-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) have been established globally to conserve marine resources. Given their maintenance costs and impact on commercial fishing, it is critical to evaluate their effectiveness to support future conservation. In this paper, we use data collected from the Australian coast to estimate the effect of MPAs on biodiversity. Environmental studies such as these are often observational, and processes of interest exhibit spatial dependence, which presents challenges in estimating the causal effects. Spatial data can also be subject to preferential sampling, where the sampling locations are related to the response variable, further complicating inference and prediction. To address these challenges, we propose a spatial causal inference method that simultaneously accounts for unmeasured spatial confounders in both the sampling process and the treatment allocation. We prove the identifiability of key parameters in the model and the consistency of the posterior distributions of those parameters. We show via simulation studies that the causal effect of interest can be reliably estimated under the proposed model. The proposed method is applied to assess the effect of MPAs on fish biomass. We find evidence of preferential sampling and that properly accounting for this source of bias impacts the estimate of the causal effect.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bayes-Optimal Estimation in Generalized Linear Models via Spatial Coupling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08404v3)** | 2024-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the problem of signal estimation in a generalized linear model (GLM). GLMs include many canonical problems in statistical estimation, such as linear regression, phase retrieval, and 1-bit compressed sensing. Recent work has precisely characterized the asymptotic minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) for GLMs with i.i.d. Gaussian sensing matrices. However, in many models there is a significant gap between the MMSE and the performance of the best known feasible estimators. In this work, we address this issue by considering GLMs defined via spatially coupled sensing matrices. We propose an efficient approximate message passing (AMP) algorithm for estimation and prove that with a simple choice of spatially coupled design, the MSE of a carefully tuned AMP estimator approaches the asymptotic MMSE in the high-dimensional limit. To prove the result, we first rigorously characterize the asymptotic performance of AMP for a GLM with a generic spatially coupled design. This characterization is in terms of a deterministic recursion (`state evolution') that depends on the parameters defining the spatial coupling. Then, using a simple spatially coupled design and a judicious choice of functions for the AMP algorithm, we analyze the fixed points of the resulting state evolution and show that it achieves the asymptotic MMSE. Numerical results for phase retrieval and rectified linear regression show that spatially coupled designs can yield substantially lower MSE than i.i.d. Gaussian designs at finite dimensions when used with AMP algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>41 pa...</summary><p>41 pages, 4 figures.

This approach uses two distinct models: for temporal analysis, a recurrent convolutional network (CNN + RNN) is employed, associating VGG19 and a GRU to process video sequences. Regarding spatial analysis, it is performed using YOLOv7 to analyze individual images. These two analyses can be carried out either in parallel, with a final prediction that combines the results of both analyses, or in series, where the spatial analysis enriches the data before the temporal analysis. In this article, we will compare these two architectural configurations with each other, to evaluate the effectiveness of our hybrid approach in video anomaly detection.</p></details> |  |

While emergent communication literature shows success in developing various language properties, no research has shown the emergence of such positional references. This paper demonstrates how agents can communicate about spatial relationships within their observations. The results indicate that agents can develop a language capable of expressing the relationships between parts of their observation, achieving over 90% accuracy when trained in a referential game which requires such communication. Using a collocation measure, we demonstrate how the agents create such references. This analysis suggests that agents use a mixture of non-compositional and compositional messages to convey spatial relationships. We also show that the emergent language is interpretable by humans. The translation accuracy is tested by communicating with the receiver agent, where the receiver achieves over 78% accuracy using parts of this lexicon, confirming that the interpretation of the emergent language was successful.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2024. 18 pages, 3 figures</p></details> |

Poorly designed VLTs can result in discomfort, nausea, and reductions in task performance. Understanding the effectiveness of VLTs across various levels of interaction fidelity is crucial to enhance user experience and spatial awareness. The current study addressed a significant gap in VR design research and practice, as few previous efforts have been made to comprehensively evaluate the effectiveness of controller-based VLTs in virtual indoor environments. We conducted a user study in which participants navigated through two complex virtual environments, one focusing on exploratory tasks and the other on goal-oriented navigation. The findings offer insights into the trade-offs among spatial knowledge acquisition, wayfinding performance, cybersickness, and sense of presence, and have design implications for future VR interfaces.</p></details> |  |

While recent deep learning models have made significant advancements in SISR, they often encounter computational challenges that hinder their deployment in resource-limited or time-sensitive environments. To overcome these issues, we present Sebica, a lightweight network that incorporates spatial and efficient bidirectional channel attention mechanisms. Sebica significantly reduces computational costs while maintaining high reconstruction quality, achieving PSNR/SSIM scores of 28.29/0.7976 and 30.18/0.8330 on the Div2K and Flickr2K datasets, respectively. These results surpass most baseline lightweight models and are comparable to the highest-performing model, but with only 17% and 15% of the parameters and GFLOPs. Additionally, our small version of Sebica has only 7.9K parameters and 0.41 GFLOPS, representing just 3% of the parameters and GFLOPs of the highest-performing model, while still achieving PSNR and SSIM metrics of 28.12/0.7931 and 0.3009/0.8317, on the Flickr2K dataset respectively. In addition, Sebica demonstrates significant improvements in real-world applications, specifically in object detection tasks, where it enhances detection accuracy in traffic video scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 5 figures, 26 conferences</p></details> |

This paper presents a novel nonparametric density estimation procedure that utilizes bivariate penalized spline smoothing over triangulation for data scattered over irregular spatial domains. The approach is likelihood-based with a regularization term that addresses the roughness of the logarithm of density based on a second-order differential operator. The proposed method offers greater efficiency and flexibility in estimating density over complex domains and has been theoretically supported by establishing the asymptotic convergence rate under mild natural conditions. Through extensive simulation studies and a real-world application that analyzes motor vehicle theft data from Portland City, Oregon, we demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method over existing techniques detailed in the literature.</p></details> |  |
| **[Detection-Guided Deep Learning-Based Model with Spatial Regularization for Lung Nodule Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20154v1)** | 2024-10-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Lung cancer ranks as one of the leading causes of cancer diagnosis and is the foremost cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. The early detection of lung nodules plays a pivotal role in improving outcomes for patients, as it enables timely and effective treatment interventions. The segmentation of lung nodules plays a critical role in aiding physicians in distinguishing between malignant and benign lesions. However, this task remains challenging due to the substantial variation in the shapes and sizes of lung nodules, and their frequent proximity to lung tissues, which complicates clear delineation. In this study, we introduce a novel model for segmenting lung nodules in computed tomography (CT) images, leveraging a deep learning framework that integrates segmentation and classification processes. This model is distinguished by its use of feature combination blocks, which facilitate the sharing of information between the segmentation and classification components. Additionally, we employ the classification outcomes as priors to refine the size estimation of the predicted nodules, integrating these with a spatial regularization technique to enhance precision. Furthermore, recognizing the challenges posed by limited training datasets, we have developed an optimal transfer learning strategy that freezes certain layers to further improve performance. The results show that our proposed model can capture the target nodules more accurately compared to other commonly used models. By applying transfer learning, the performance can be further improved, achieving a sensitivity score of 0.885 and a Dice score of 0.814.</p></details> |  |

This significantly reduces users' involvement, learning, and creative capabilities, leading to a superficial understanding of spatial design. We conducted a Wizard-of-Oz study, where Novices and AI (acted by experimenters) worked together to finish spatial design tasks using various AI models. We identified typical function and workflow patterns adopted by the participants, leading to the understanding of the opportunities and challenges in the human-AI co-creation process. Based on insights gathered from this research, we proposed some design implications of the novice-AI collaboration system that aims to democratize spatial design through a progressive, iterative co-creation process.</p></details> | <details><summary>draft...</summary><p>draft submission to CHI 2025</p></details> |

Users can interact with VR apps through interactable GUI elements (IGEs) on the stereoscopic three-dimensional (3D) graphical user interface (GUI). The accurate recognition of these IGEs is instrumental, serving as the foundation of many software engineering tasks, including automated testing and effective GUI search. The most recent IGE detection approaches for 2D mobile apps typically train a supervised object detection model based on a large-scale manually-labeled GUI dataset, usually with a pre-defined set of clickable GUI element categories like buttons and spinners. Such approaches can hardly be applied to IGE detection in VR apps, due to a multitude of challenges including complexities posed by open-vocabulary and heterogeneous IGE categories, intricacies of context-sensitive interactability, and the necessities of precise spatial perception and visual-semantic alignment for accurate IGE detection results. Thus, it is necessary to embark on the IGE research tailored to VR apps. In this paper, we propose the first zero-shot cOntext-sensitive inteRactable GUI ElemeNT dEtection framework for virtual Reality apps, named Orienter. By imitating human behaviors, Orienter observes and understands the semantic contexts of VR app scenes first, before performing the detection. The detection process is iterated within a feedback-directed validation and reflection loop. Specifically, Orienter contains three components, including (1) Semantic context comprehension, (2) Reflection-directed IGE candidate detection, and (3) Context-sensitive interactability classification. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Orienter is more effective than the state-of-the-art GUI element detection approaches.</p></details> |  |

Time-frequency masks and relative directions of the speakers regarding a fixed spatial grid can be used to estimate the beamformer's parameters. To some degree, speaker-independence is achieved by ensuring a greater amount of spatial partitions than speech sources. In this work, we analyze how to encode both mask and positioning into such a grid to enable joint estimation of both quantities. We propose mask-weighted spatial likelihood coding and show that it achieves considerable performance in both tasks compared to baseline encodings optimized for either localization or mask estimation. In the same setup, we demonstrate superiority for joint estimation of both quantities. Conclusively, we propose a universal approach which can replace an upstream sound source localization system solely by adapting the training framework, making it highly relevant in performance-critical scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>\copy...</summary><p>\copyright 2024 IEEE.

Local anomalies are relevant, but often novel diseases involve familiar disease patterns in new spatial distributions. Therefore, established local anomaly detection approaches may fail to identify them as new. Here, we present a novel approach to detect the emergence of new disease phenotypes exhibiting distinct patterns of the spatial distribution of lesions. We first identify anomalies in lung CT data, and then compare their distribution in a continually acquired new patient cohorts with historic patient population observed over a long prior period. We evaluate how accumulated evidence collected in the stream of patients is able to detect the onset of an emerging disease. In a gram-matrix based representation derived from the intermediate layers of a three-dimensional convolutional neural network, newly emerging clusters indicate emerging diseases.</p></details> |  |

The high dimensionality of these systems implies that communications take place in the nearfield regime, which poses some questions as to their effective perfomrance even under simple line of sight configurations. In order to study these limitations, a uniform linear array (ULA) is considered here, the elements of which are three infinitesimal dipoles transmitting different signals in the three spatial dimensions. The receiver consists of a single element with three orthogonal infinitesimal dipoles and full channel state information is assumed to be available at both ends. A capacity analysis is presented when the number of elements of the ULA increases without bound while the interelement distance converges to zero, so that the total aperture length is kept asymptotically fixed. In particular, the total number of available spatial eigenmodes is shown to depend crucially on the receiver position in space, and closed form expressions are provided for the different achievability regions. From the analysis it can be concluded that the use of three orthogonal polarizations at the transmitter guarantees the almost universal availability of two spatial streams, whereas the use of only two polarizations results in a more extensive region where maximum multiplexing gain is available.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE Open Journal on Signal Processing</p></details> |

This approach, however, encounters significant limitations, \ie, feature deviation in the semantic domain and information loss in the spatial domain. The former struggles with large intra-class variance among pixel features from different images, while the latter fails to utilize the structured information of semantic objects effectively. This leads to blurred mask boundaries as well as a deficiency of fine-grained recognition capability. In this paper, we propose a novel Semantic and Spatial Adaptive Classifier (SSA-Seg) to address the above challenges. Specifically, we employ the coarse masks obtained from the fixed prototypes as a guide to adjust the fixed prototype towards the center of the semantic and spatial domains in the test image. The adapted prototypes in semantic and spatial domains are then simultaneously considered to accomplish classification decisions. In addition, we propose an online multi-domain distillation learning strategy to improve the adaption process. Experimental results on three publicly available benchmarks show that the proposed SSA-Seg significantly improves the segmentation performance of the baseline models with only a minimal increase in computational cost.

However, most current systems assume a static environment, which limits the system's applicability in real-world scenarios where environments frequently change due to human intervention or the robot's own actions. In this work, we present DynaMem, a new approach to open-world mobile manipulation that uses a dynamic spatio-semantic memory to represent a robot's environment. DynaMem constructs a 3D data structure to maintain a dynamic memory of point clouds, and answers open-vocabulary object localization queries using multimodal LLMs or open-vocabulary features generated by state-of-the-art vision-language models. Powered by DynaMem, our robots can explore novel environments, search for objects not found in memory, and continuously update the memory as objects move, appear, or disappear in the scene. We run extensive experiments on the Stretch SE3 robots in three real and nine offline scenes, and achieve an average pick-and-drop success rate of 70% on non-stationary objects, which is more than a 2x improvement over state-of-the-art static systems.

Yet, their performance is constrained by the reliance on extensive data for training on a specific task, thereby limiting their adaptability to new urban domains with varied task demands. Although transfer learning has been proposed to remedy this problem by leveraging knowledge across domains, the cross-task generalization still remains under-explored in spatio-temporal graph transfer learning due to the lack of a unified framework. To bridge the gap, we propose Spatio-Temporal Graph Prompting (STGP), a prompt-based framework capable of adapting to multi-diverse tasks in a data-scarce domain. Specifically, we first unify different tasks into a single template and introduce a task-agnostic network architecture that aligns with this template. This approach enables capturing dependencies shared across tasks. Furthermore, we employ learnable prompts to achieve domain and task transfer in a two-stage prompting pipeline, facilitating the prompts to effectively capture domain knowledge and task-specific properties. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that STGP outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in three tasks-forecasting, kriging, and extrapolation-achieving an improvement of up to 10.7%.</p></details> |  |

While convolutional neural networks are widely used in learning ice layer patterns from raw echogram images captured by airborne snow radar sensors, noise in the echogram images prevents researchers from getting high-quality results. Instead, we focus on geometric deep learning using graph neural networks, aiming to build a spatio-temporal graph neural network that learns from thickness information of the top ice layers and predicts for deeper layers. In this paper, we developed a novel multi-branch spatio-temporal graph neural network that used the GraphSAGE framework for spatio features learning and a temporal convolution operation to capture temporal changes, enabling different branches of the network to be more specialized and focusing on a single learning task. We found that our proposed multi-branch network can consistently outperform the current fused spatio-temporal graph neural network in both accuracy and efficiency.</p></details> |  |

Current state-of-the-art methods typically adopt dual-path networks to separately modeling spatial features and temporal features. However, the uncertain compatibility of the two networks brings a challenge for spatio-temporal features fusion and violate the spatio-temporal coherence and coupling of human motions by nature.

Specifically, UnityGraph is a hypervariate graph based network. The flexibility of the hypergraph allows us to consider the observed motions as graph nodes. We then leverage hyperedges to bridge these nodes for exploring spatio-temporal features. This perspective considers spatio-temporal dynamics unitedly and reformulates multi-person motion prediction into a problem on a single graph. Leveraging the dynamic message passing based on this hypergraph, our model dynamically learns from both types of relations to generate targeted messages that reflect the relevance among nodes. Extensive experiments on several datasets demonstrates that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, confirming its effectiveness and innovative design.</p></details> | <details><summary>13pag...</summary><p>13pages, 12 figures. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2411.03729</p></details> |

HD EEG devices improve the spatial resolution of EEG by placing more electrodes on the scalp, which meet the requirements of clinical diagnostic applications such as epilepsy focus localization. However, this technique faces challenges, such as high acquisition costs and limited usage scenarios. In this paper, spatio-temporal adaptive diffusion models (STAD) are proposed to pioneer the use of diffusion models for achieving spatial SR reconstruction from low-resolution (LR, 64 channels or fewer) EEG to high-resolution (HR, 256 channels) EEG. Specifically, a spatio-temporal condition module is designed to extract the spatio-temporal features of LR EEG, which then used as conditional inputs to direct the reverse denoising process. Additionally, a multi-scale Transformer denoising module is constructed to leverage multi-scale convolution blocks and cross-attention-based diffusion Transformer blocks for conditional guidance to generate subject-adaptive SR EEG. Experimental results demonstrate that the STAD significantly enhances the spatial resolution of LR EEG and quantitatively outperforms existing methods. Furthermore, STAD demonstrate their value by applying synthetic SR EEG to classification and source localization tasks, indicating their potential to Substantially boost the spatial resolution of EEG.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods struggle to address the complex, temporally dynamic nature of endoscopic scenes. This paper presents ST-Endo4DGS, a novel framework that models the spatio-temporal volume of dynamic endoscopic scenes using unbiased 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS) primitives, parameterized by anisotropic ellipses with flexible 4D rotations. This approach enables precise representation of deformable tissue dynamics, capturing intricate spatial and temporal correlations in real time. Additionally, we extend spherindrical harmonics to represent time-evolving appearance, achieving realistic adaptations to lighting and view changes. A new endoscopic normal alignment constraint (ENAC) further enhances geometric fidelity by aligning rendered normals with depth-derived geometry. Extensive evaluations show that ST-Endo4DGS outperforms existing methods in both visual quality and real-time performance, establishing a new state-of-the-art in dynamic scene reconstruction for endoscopic surgery.</p></details> |  |

Once estimated, we propose two methods for graph construction: one based on the Cartesian product, treating temporal instants homogeneously, and another spatio-temporal approach with distinct graphs per time step. We also propose two GCNN architectures: a standard GCNN with a normalized adjacency matrix and a higher-order polynomial GCNN. In addition to accuracy, we emphasize explainability by designing an inherently interpretable model and performing a thorough interpretability analysis, identifying key feature-time combinations that drive predictions. We evaluate XST-GCNN using real-world Electronic Health Record data from University Hospital of Fuenlabrada to predict Multidrug Resistance (MDR) in ICU patients, a critical healthcare challenge linked to high mortality and complex treatments. Our architecture outperforms traditional models, achieving a mean ROC-AUC score of 81.03 +- 2.43. Furthermore, the interpretability analysis provides actionable insights into clinical factors driving MDR predictions, enhancing model transparency. This work sets a benchmark for tackling complex inference tasks with heterogeneous MTS, offering a versatile, interpretable solution for real-world applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[STAA: Spatio-Temporal Attention Attribution for Real-Time Interpreting Transformer-based Video Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00630v1)** | 2024-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformer-based models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in various computer vision tasks, including image and video analysis. However, Transformer's complex architecture and black-box nature pose challenges for explainability, a crucial aspect for real-world applications and scientific inquiry. Current Explainable AI (XAI) methods can only provide one-dimensional feature importance, either spatial or temporal explanation, with significant computational complexity. This paper introduces STAA (Spatio-Temporal Attention Attribution), an XAI method for interpreting video Transformer models. Differ from traditional methods that separately apply image XAI techniques for spatial features or segment contribution analysis for temporal aspects, STAA offers both spatial and temporal information simultaneously from attention values in Transformers. The study utilizes the Kinetics-400 dataset, a benchmark collection of 400 human action classes used for action recognition research. We introduce metrics to quantify explanations. We also apply optimization to enhance STAA's raw output. By implementing dynamic thresholding and attention focusing mechanisms, we improve the signal-to-noise ratio in our explanations, resulting in more precise visualizations and better evaluation results. In terms of computational overhead, our method requires less than 3\% of the computational resources of traditional XAI methods, making it suitable for real-time video XAI analysis applications. STAA contributes to the growing field of XAI by offering a method for researchers and practitioners to analyze Transformer models.</p></details> |  |

Current state-of-the-art methods either require multiple independent stages of processing that employ motion cues or, in the case of end-to-end trainable networks, lack in segmentation accuracy, in part due to the difficulty of learning segmentation maps from videos with transient object presence. This limits the application of WSVOS for semantic annotation of surgical videos where multiple surgical tools frequently move in and out of the field of view, a problem that is more difficult than typically encountered in WSVOS. This paper introduces Video Spatio-Temporal Disentanglement Networks (VDST-Net), a framework to disentangle spatiotemporal information using semi-decoupled knowledge distillation to predict high-quality class activation maps (CAMs). A teacher network designed to resolve temporal conflicts when specifics about object location and timing in the video are not provided works with a student network that integrates information over time by leveraging temporal dependencies. We demonstrate the efficacy of our framework on a public reference dataset and on a more challenging surgical video dataset where objects are, on average, present in less than 60\% of annotated frames. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques and generates superior segmentation masks under video-level weak supervision.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV)</p></details> |

If these components are found, they can be modelled univariately. Blind source separation aims to recover the latent components by estimating the unmixing transformation based on the observed data only. The current methods for spatio-temporal blind source separation are restricted to linear unmixing, and nonlinear variants have not been implemented. In this paper, we extend identifiable variational autoencoder to the nonlinear nonstationary spatio-temporal blind source separation setting and demonstrate its performance using comprehensive simulation studies. Additionally, we introduce two alternative methods for the latent dimension estimation, which is a crucial task in order to obtain the correct latent representation. Finally, we illustrate the proposed methods using a meteorological application, where we estimate the latent dimension and the latent components, interpret the components, and show how nonstationarity can be accounted and prediction accuracy can be improved by using the proposed nonlinear blind source separation method as a preprocessing method.</p></details> |  |

This is because whole sequence segmentation is currently a tedious process and inaccurate. Conventional whole sequence segmentation approaches first estimate the motion field between frames, which is then used to propagate the mask along the temporal axis. However, the mask propagation results could be prone to error, especially for the basal and apex slices, where through-plane motion leads to significant morphology and structural change during the cardiac cycle. Inspired by recent advances in video object segmentation (VOS), based on spatio-temporal memory (STM) networks, we propose a continuous STM (CSTM) network for semi-supervised whole heart and whole sequence cMR segmentation. Our CSTM network takes full advantage of the spatial, scale, temporal and through-plane continuity prior of the underlying heart anatomy structures, to achieve accurate and fast 4D segmentation. Results of extensive experiments across multiple cMR datasets show that our method can improve the 4D cMR segmentation performance, especially for the hard-to-segment regions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to WACV 2025</p></details> |
| **[Identifying Spatio-Temporal Drivers of Extreme Events](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24075v1)** | 2024-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The spatio-temporal relations of impacts of extreme events and their drivers in climate data are not fully understood and there is a need of machine learning approaches to identify such spatio-temporal relations from data. The task, however, is very challenging since there are time delays between extremes and their drivers, and the spatial response of such drivers is inhomogeneous. In this work, we propose a first approach and benchmarks to tackle this challenge. Our approach is trained end-to-end to predict spatio-temporally extremes and spatio-temporally drivers in the physical input variables jointly. By enforcing the network to predict extremes from spatio-temporal binary masks of identified drivers, the network successfully identifies drivers that are correlated with extremes. We evaluate our approach on three newly created synthetic benchmarks, where two of them are based on remote sensing or reanalysis climate data, and on two real-world reanalysis datasets.

Recently, transformer based models have shown remarkable potential in weather forecasting achieving state-of-the-art results. However, transformers are discrete and physics-agnostic models which limit their ability to learn the continuous spatio-temporal features of the dynamical weather system. We address this issue with STC-ViT, a Spatio-Temporal Continuous Vision Transformer for weather forecasting. STC-ViT incorporates the continuous time Neural ODE layers with multi-head attention mechanism to learn the continuous weather evolution over time. The attention mechanism is encoded as a differentiable function in the transformer architecture to model the complex weather dynamics. Further, we define a customised physics informed loss for STC-ViT which penalize the model's predictions for deviating away from physical laws. We evaluate STC-ViT against operational Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) model and several deep learning based weather forecasting models. STC-ViT, trained on 1.5-degree 6-hourly data, demonstrates computational efficiency and competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art data-driven models trained on higher-resolution data for global forecasting.</p></details> |  |
| **[Causal Deciphering and Inpainting in Spatio-Temporal Dynamics via Diffusion Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19608v2)** | 2024-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal (ST) prediction has garnered a De facto attention in earth sciences, such as meteorological prediction, human mobility perception. However, the scarcity of data coupled with the high expenses involved in sensor deployment results in notable data imbalances. Furthermore, models that are excessively customized and devoid of causal connections further undermine the generalizability and interpretability. To this end, we establish a causal framework for ST predictions, termed CaPaint, which targets to identify causal regions in data and endow model with causal reasoning ability in a two-stage process. Going beyond this process, we utilize the back-door adjustment to specifically address the sub-regions identified as non-causal in the upstream phase. Specifically, we employ a novel image inpainting technique. By using a fine-tuned unconditional Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) as the generative prior, we in-fill the masks defined as environmental parts, offering the possibility of reliable extrapolation for potential data distributions. CaPaint overcomes the high complexity dilemma of optimal ST causal discovery models by reducing the data generation complexity from exponential to quasi-linear levels. Extensive experiments conducted on five real-world ST benchmarks demonstrate that integrating the CaPaint concept allows models to achieve improvements ranging from 4.3% to 77.3%. Moreover, compared to traditional mainstream ST augmenters, CaPaint underscores the potential of diffusion models in ST enhancement, offering a novel paradigm for this field.

| **[An Overtaking Trajectory Planning Framework Based on Spatio-temporal Topology and Reachable Set Analysis Ensuring Time Efficiency](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22643v1)** | 2024-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating overtaking trajectories in high-speed scenarios presents significant challenges and is typically addressed through hierarchical planning methods. However, this method has two primary drawbacks. First, heuristic algorithms can only provide a single initial solution, which may lead to local optima and consequently diminish the quality of the solution. Second, the time efficiency of trajectory refinement based on numerical optimization is insufficient. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes an overtaking trajectory planning framework based on spatio-temporal topology and reachable set analysis (SROP), to improve trajectory quality and time efficiency. Specifically, this paper introduces topological classes to describe trajectories representing different overtaking behaviors, which support the spatio-temporal topological search method employed by the upper-layer planner to identify diverse initial paths. This approach helps prevent getting stuck in local optima, enhancing the overall solution quality by considering multiple initial solutions from distinct topologies. Moreover, the reachable set method is integrated into the lower-layer planner for parallel trajectory evaluation. This method enhances planning efficiency by decoupling vehicle model constraints from the optimization process, enabling parallel computation while ensuring control feasibility. Simulation results show that the proposed method improves the smoothness of generated trajectories by 66.8% compared to state-of-the-art methods, highlighting its effectiveness in enhancing trajectory quality. Additionally, this method reduces computation time by 62.9%, demonstrating its efficiency.</p></details> |  |

| **[A Hierarchical Framework with Spatio-Temporal Consistency Learning for Emergence Detection in Complex Adaptive Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10300v2)** | 2024-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Emergence, a global property of complex adaptive systems (CASs) constituted by interactive agents, is prevalent in real-world dynamic systems, e.g., network-level traffic congestions. Detecting its formation and evaporation helps to monitor the state of a system, allowing to issue a warning signal for harmful emergent phenomena. Since there is no centralized controller of CAS, detecting emergence based on each agent's local observation is desirable but challenging. Existing works are unable to capture emergence-related spatial patterns, and fail to model the nonlinear relationships among agents. This paper proposes a hierarchical framework with spatio-temporal consistency learning to solve these two problems by learning the system representation and agent representations, respectively. Spatio-temporal encoders composed of spatial and temporal transformers are designed to capture agents' nonlinear relationships and the system's complex evolution. Agents' and the system's representations are learned to preserve the spatio-temporal consistency by minimizing the spatial and temporal dissimilarities in a self-supervised manner in the latent space. Our method achieves more accurate detection than traditional methods and deep learning methods on three datasets with well-known yet hard-to-detect emergent behaviors. Notably, our hierarchical framework is generic in incorporating other deep learning methods for agent-level and system-level detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, accepted by IEEE TNNLS</p></details> |
| **[DeepMIDE: A Multivariate Spatio-Temporal Method for Ultra-Scale Offshore Wind Energy Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20166v1)** | 2024-10-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To unlock access to stronger winds, the offshore wind industry is advancing with significantly larger and taller wind turbines. This massive upscaling motivates a departure from univariate wind forecasting methods that traditionally focused on a single representative height. To fill this gap, we propose DeepMIDE--a statistical deep learning method which jointly models the offshore wind speeds across space, time, and height. DeepMIDE is formulated as a multi-output integro-difference equation model with a multivariate, nonstationary, and state-dependent kernel characterized by a set of advection vectors that encode the physics of wind field formation and propagation. Embedded within DeepMIDE, an advanced deep learning architecture learns these advection vectors from high dimensional streams of exogenous weather information, which, along with other parameters, are plugged back into the statistical model for probabilistic multi-height space-time forecasting. Tested on real-world data from future offshore wind energy sites in the Northeastern United States, the wind speed and power forecasts from DeepMIDE are shown to outperform those from prevalent time series, spatio-temporal, and deep learning methods.</p></details> |  |

Computations are done through a Gaussian Markov random field approximation of the solution of the SPDE, which is constructed through a finite volume method. The new flexible non-separable model is compared to a flexible separable model both for reconstruction and forecasting, and evaluated in terms of root mean square errors and continuous rank probability scores. A simulation study demonstrates that the non-separable model performs better when the data is simulated from a non-separable model with diffusion and advection. Further, we estimate surrogate models for emulating the output of a ocean model in Trondheimsfjorden, Norway, and simulate observations of autonomous underwater vehicles. The results show that the flexible non-separable model outperforms the flexible separable model for real-time prediction of unobserved locations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adaptive Spatio-temporal Estimation on the Graph Edges via Line Graph Transformation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00656v3)** | 2024-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal estimation of signals on graph edges is challenging because most conventional Graph Signal Processing techniques are defined on the graph nodes. Leveraging the Line Graph transform, the Line Graph Least Mean Square (LGLMS) algorithm is proposed to conduct adaptive estimation of time-varying edge signals by projecting the edge signals from edge space to node space. LGLMS is an adaptive algorithm analogous to the classical LMS algorithm but applied to graph edges. Unlike edge-specific methods, LGLMS retains all GSP concepts and techniques originally designed for graph nodes, without the need for redefinition on the edges. Experimenting with transportation graphs and meteorological graphs, with the signal observations having noisy and missing values, we confirmed that LGLMS is suitable for the online prediction of time-varying edge signals.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatio-temporal Multivariate Cluster Evolution Analysis for Detecting and Tracking Climate Impacts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16544v1)** | 2024-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent years have seen a growing concern about climate change and its impacts. While Earth System Models (ESMs) can be invaluable tools for studying the impacts of climate change, the complex coupling processes encoded in ESMs and the large amounts of data produced by these models, together with the high internal variability of the Earth system, can obscure important source-to-impact relationships. This paper presents a novel and efficient unsupervised data-driven approach for detecting statistically-significant impacts and tracing spatio-temporal source-impact pathways in the climate through a unique combination of ideas from anomaly detection, clustering and Natural Language Processing (NLP). Using as an exemplar the 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines, we demonstrate that the proposed approach is capable of detecting known post-eruption impacts/events. We additionally describe a methodology for extracting meaningful sequences of post-eruption impacts/events by using NLP to efficiently mine frequent multivariate cluster evolutions, which can be used to confirm or discover the chain of physical processes between a climate source and its impact(s).</p></details> |  |

Similar to Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), high-quality benchmark datasets are of great importance to the advances of SNNs. However, our analysis indicates that many prevalent neuromorphic datasets lack strong temporal correlation, preventing SNNs from fully exploiting their spatio-temporal representation capabilities. Meanwhile, the integration of event and frame modalities offers more comprehensive visual spatio-temporal information. Yet, the SNN-based cross-modality fusion remains underexplored. In this work, we present a neuromorphic dataset called DVS-SLR that can better exploit the inherent spatio-temporal properties of SNNs. Compared to existing datasets, it offers advantages in terms of higher temporal correlation, larger scale, and more varied scenarios. In addition, our neuromorphic dataset contains corresponding frame data, which can be used for developing SNN-based fusion methods. By virtue of the dual-modal feature of the dataset, we propose a Cross-Modality Attention (CMA) based fusion method. The CMA model efficiently utilizes the unique advantages of each modality, allowing for SNNs to learn both temporal and spatial attention scores from the spatio-temporal features of event and frame modalities, subsequently allocating these scores across modalities to enhance their synergy. Experimental results demonstrate that our method not only improves recognition accuracy but also ensures robustness across diverse scenarios.</p></details> |  |

Inevitably, the issue of missing data caused by various disturbances threatens the reliability of data acquisition. Recent studies of diffusion probability models have demonstrated the superiority of deep generative models in imputation tasks by precisely capturing the spatio-temporal correlation of traffic data. One drawback of diffusion models is their slow sampling/denoising process. In this work, we aim to accelerate the imputation process while retaining the performance. We propose a fast conditional diffusion model for spatiotemporal traffic data imputation (FastSTI). To speed up the process yet, obtain better performance, we propose the application of a high-order pseudo-numerical solver. Our method further revs the imputation by introducing a predefined alignment strategy of variance schedule during the sampling process. Evaluating FastSTI on two types of real-world traffic datasets (traffic speed and flow) with different missing data scenarios proves its ability to impute higher-quality samples in only six sampling steps, especially under high missing rates (60\% $\sim$ 90\%). The experimental results illustrate a speed-up of $\textbf{8.3} \times$ faster than the current state-of-the-art model while achieving better performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems for publication.

Existing techniques are often cumbersome, computationally heavy and generally suffer from limitations in wavenumber/frequency response. To address these challenges, we propose Wave (from) Polarized Light Learning (WPLL), a learning based remote sensing method for laboratory implementation, capable of inferring surface elevation and slope maps in high resolution. The method uses the polarization properties of light reflected from the water surface. The WPLL uses a deep neural network (DNN) model that approximates the water surface slopes from the polarized light intensities. Once trained on simple monochromatic wave trains, the WPLL is capable of producing high-resolution and accurate 2D reconstruction of the water surface slopes and elevation in a variety of irregular wave fields. The method's robustness is demonstrated by showcasing its high wavenumber/frequency response, its ability to reconstruct wave fields propagating at arbitrary angles relative to the camera optical axis, and its computational efficiency. This developed methodology is an accurate and cost-effective near-real time remote sensing tool for laboratory water surface waves measurements, setting the path for upscaling to open sea application for research, monitoring, and short-time forecasting.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 17 figures, 5 tables, under review in Applied Ocean Research Journal</p></details> |

To make the cooperation safe for the humans involved, the systems have to follow protocols with rigid real-time and real-space properties, but they also need to be capable of making competitive and collaborative decisions with varying rewards and penalties. Due to these tough requirements, the construction of system control software is often very difficult. This calls for applying a model-based engineering approach, which allows one to formally express the time and space properties and use them as guidance for the whole engineering process from requirement definition via system design to software development. Moreover, it is beneficial, if one can verify with acceptable effort, that the time and space requirements are preserved throughout the development steps. This paper focuses on modelling spatio-temporal properties and their model-checking and simulation using different analysis tools in combination with the methods and tool extensions proposed here.

We propose novel approaches to improve mesh-agnostic spatio-temporal prediction of transient flow fields using Graph U-Nets, enabling accurate prediction on diverse mesh configurations. Key enhancements to the Graph U-Net architecture, including the Gaussian-mixture-model convolutional operator and noise injection approaches, provide increased flexibility in modeling node dynamics: the former reduces prediction error by 95\% compared to conventional convolutional operators, while the latter improves long-term prediction robustness, resulting in an error reduction of 86\%. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these enhancements in both transductive and inductive learning settings, showcasing the adaptability of Graph U-Nets to various flow conditions and mesh structures. This work contributes to the field of reduced-order modeling for computational fluid dynamics by establishing Graph U-Nets as a viable and flexible alternative to convolutional neural networks, capable of accurately and efficiently predicting complex fluid flow phenomena across diverse scenarios.</p></details> |  |

This study aims to develop a methodology for analyzing the occupancy rate from large-scale datasets to identify gaps between supply and demand in public transportation. Leveraging the spatio-temporal granularity of data from Automatic People Counting (APC) and relying on the Generalized Linear Mixed Effects Model and the Generalized Mixed-Effect Random Forest, in this study we propose a methodology for analyzing factors determining undercrowding. The results of the model are examined at both the segment and ride levels. Initially, the analysis focuses on identifying segments more likely associated with undercrowding, understanding factors influencing the probability of undercrowding, and exploring their relationships. Subsequently, the analysis extends to the temporal distribution of undercrowding, encompassing its impact on the entire journey. The proposed methodology is applied to analyze APC data, provided by the company responsible for public transport management in Milan, on a radial route of the surface transportation network.</p></details> | Pre-print version |

Although spatio-temporal graph neural networks have achieved success in modeling various static spatio-temporal forecasting scenarios, real-world spatio-temporal data are typically received in a streaming manner, and the network continuously expands with the installation of new sensors. Thus, spatio-temporal forecasting in streaming scenarios faces dual challenges: the inefficiency of retraining models over newly arrived data and the detrimental effects of catastrophic forgetting over long-term history. To address these challenges, we propose a novel prompt tuning-based continuous forecasting method, following two fundamental tuning principles guided by empirical and theoretical analysis: expand and compress, which effectively resolve the aforementioned problems with lightweight tuning parameters. Specifically, we integrate the base spatio-temporal graph neural network with a continuous prompt pool, utilizing stored prompts (i.e., few learnable parameters) in memory, and jointly optimize them with the base spatio-temporal graph neural network. This method ensures that the model sequentially learns from the spatio-temporal data stream to accomplish tasks for corresponding periods. Extensive experimental results on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate the multi-faceted superiority of our method over the state-of-the-art baselines, including effectiveness, efficiency, universality, etc.</p></details> |  |

Accurate forecasting of nuclear radiation levels is crucial for informed decision-making by both individuals and governments. However, this task is challenging due to the imbalanced distribution of monitoring stations over a wide spatial range and the non-stationary radiation variation patterns. In this study, we introduce NRFormer, an innovative framework tailored for national-wide prediction of nuclear radiation variations. By integrating a non-stationary temporal attention module, an imbalance-aware spatial attention module, and a radiation propagation prompting module, NRFormer collectively captures complex spatio-temporal dynamics of nuclear radiation. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed framework against seven baselines.

In the human language system, experimental studies have observed clusters for syntactic and semantic categories, but the mechanisms underlying this functional organization remain unclear. Here, building on work from the vision literature, we develop TopoLM, a transformer language model with an explicit two-dimensional spatial representation of model units. By combining a next-token prediction objective with a spatial smoothness loss, representations in this model assemble into clusters that correspond to semantically interpretable groupings of text and closely match the functional organization in the brain's language system. TopoLM successfully predicts the emergence of the spatio-functional organization of a cortical language system as well as the organization of functional clusters selective for fine-grained linguistic features empirically observed in human cortex. Our results suggest that the functional organization of the human language system is driven by a unified spatial objective, and provide a functionally and spatially aligned model of language processing in the brain.</p></details> |  |

However, the restricted capturing devices and transmission bandwidth lead to the low resolution of ODVs. Video super-resolution (VSR) methods are proposed to enhance the resolution of videos, but ODV projection distortions in the application are not well addressed directly applying such methods. To achieve better super-resolution reconstruction quality, we propose a novel Spatio-Temporal Distortion Aware Network (STDAN) oriented to ODV characteristics. Specifically, a spatio-temporal distortion modulation module is introduced to improve spatial ODV projection distortions and exploit the temporal correlation according to intra and inter alignments. Next, we design a multi-frame reconstruction and fusion mechanism to refine the consistency of reconstructed ODV frames. Furthermore, we incorporate latitude-saliency adaptive maps in the loss function to concentrate on important viewpoint regions with higher texture complexity and human-watching interest. In addition, we collect a new ODV-SR dataset with various scenarios. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed STDAN achieves superior super-resolution performance on ODVs and outperforms state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[MoChat: Joints-Grouped Spatio-Temporal Grounding LLM for Multi-Turn Motion Comprehension and Description](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11404v1)** | 2024-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite continuous advancements in deep learning for understanding human motion, existing models often struggle to accurately identify action timing and specific body parts, typically supporting only single-round interaction. Such limitations in capturing fine-grained motion details reduce their effectiveness in motion understanding tasks. In this paper, we propose MoChat, a multimodal large language model capable of spatio-temporal grounding of human motion and understanding multi-turn dialogue context. To achieve these capabilities, we group the spatial information of each skeleton frame based on human anatomical structure and then apply them with Joints-Grouped Skeleton Encoder, whose outputs are combined with LLM embeddings to create spatio-aware and temporal-aware embeddings separately. Additionally, we develop a pipeline for extracting timestamps from skeleton sequences based on textual annotations, and construct multi-turn dialogues for spatially grounding. Finally, various task instructions are generated for jointly training. Experimental results demonstrate that MoChat achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple metrics in motion understanding tasks, making it as the first model capable of fine-grained spatio-temporal grounding of human motion.</p></details> |  |
| **[Echo State Networks for Spatio-Temporal Area-Level Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10641v1)** | 2024-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal area-level datasets play a critical role in official statistics, providing valuable insights for policy-making and regional planning. Accurate modeling and forecasting of these datasets can be extremely useful for policymakers to develop informed strategies for future planning. Echo State Networks (ESNs) are efficient methods for capturing nonlinear temporal dynamics and generating forecasts. However, ESNs lack a direct mechanism to account for the neighborhood structure inherent in area-level data. Ignoring these spatial relationships can significantly compromise the accuracy and utility of forecasts. In this paper, we incorporate approximate graph spectral filters at the input stage of the ESN, thereby improving forecast accuracy while preserving the model's computational efficiency during training. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach using Eurostat's tourism occupancy dataset and show how it can support more informed decision-making in policy and planning contexts.</p></details> | 23 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Get Rid of Task Isolation: A Continuous Multi-task Spatio-Temporal Learning Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10524v1)** | 2024-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatiotemporal learning has become a pivotal technique to enable urban intelligence. Traditional spatiotemporal models mostly focus on a specific task by assuming a same distribution between training and testing sets. However, given that urban systems are usually dynamic, multi-sourced with imbalanced data distributions, current specific task-specific models fail to generalize to new urban conditions and adapt to new domains without explicitly modeling interdependencies across various dimensions and types of urban data. To this end, we argue that there is an essential to propose a Continuous Multi-task Spatio-Temporal learning framework (CMuST) to empower collective urban intelligence, which reforms the urban spatiotemporal learning from single-domain to cooperatively multi-dimensional and multi-task learning. Specifically, CMuST proposes a new multi-dimensional spatiotemporal interaction network (MSTI) to allow cross-interactions between context and main observations as well as self-interactions within spatial and temporal aspects to be exposed, which is also the core for capturing task-level commonality and personalization. To ensure continuous task learning, a novel Rolling Adaptation training scheme (RoAda) is devised, which not only preserves task uniqueness by constructing data summarization-driven task prompts, but also harnesses correlated patterns among tasks by iterative model behavior modeling. We further establish a benchmark of three cities for multi-task spatiotemporal learning, and empirically demonstrate the superiority of CMuST via extensive evaluations on these datasets. The impressive improvements on both few-shot streaming data and new domain tasks against existing SOAT methods are achieved. Code is available at https://github.com/DILab-USTCSZ/CMuST.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |
| **[Graph Masked Autoencoder for Spatio-Temporal Graph Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10915v1)** | 2024-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Effective spatio-temporal prediction frameworks play a crucial role in urban sensing applications, including traffic analysis, human mobility behavior modeling, and citywide crime prediction. However, the presence of data noise and label sparsity in spatio-temporal data presents significant challenges for existing neural network models in learning effective and robust region representations. To address these challenges, we propose a novel spatio-temporal graph masked autoencoder paradigm that explores generative self-supervised learning for effective spatio-temporal data augmentation. Our proposed framework introduces a spatial-temporal heterogeneous graph neural encoder that captures region-wise dependencies from heterogeneous data sources, enabling the modeling of diverse spatial dependencies. In our spatio-temporal self-supervised learning paradigm, we incorporate a masked autoencoding mechanism on node representations and structures. This mechanism automatically distills heterogeneous spatio-temporal dependencies across regions over time, enhancing the learning process of dynamic region-wise spatial correlations. To validate the effectiveness of our STGMAE framework, we conduct extensive experiments on various spatio-temporal mining tasks. We compare our approach against state-of-the-art baselines. The results of these evaluations demonstrate the superiority of our proposed framework in terms of performance and its ability to address the challenges of spatial and temporal data noise and sparsity in practical urban sensing scenarios.</p></details> | 12 pages |

Our focus lies in the parametric estimation of its intensity function, incorporating both spatial factors (such as altitude) and spatio-temporal covariates (such as field temperature, precipitation, etc.). The events are observed in France over a span of three years. Spatio-temporal covariates are observed with resolution $0.1^\circ \times 0.1^\circ$ ($\approx 100$km$^2$) and six-hour periods. This results in an extensive dataset, further characterized by a significant excess of zeroes (i.e., spatio-temporal cells with no observed events). We reexamine composite likelihood methods commonly employed for spatial point processes, especially in situations where covariates are piecewise constant. Additionally, we extend these methods to account for zero-deflated subsampling, a strategy involving dependent subsampling, with a focus on selecting more cells in regions where events are observed. A simulation study is conducted to illustrate these novel methodologies, followed by their application to the dataset of lightning strikes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Gridded Transformer Neural Processes for Large Unstructured Spatio-Temporal Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06731v2)** | 2024-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many important problems require modelling large-scale spatio-temporal datasets, with one prevalent example being weather forecasting. Recently, transformer-based approaches have shown great promise in a range of weather forecasting problems. However, these have mostly focused on gridded data sources, neglecting the wealth of unstructured, off-the-grid data from observational measurements such as those at weather stations. A promising family of models suitable for such tasks are neural processes (NPs), notably the family of transformer neural processes (TNPs). Although TNPs have shown promise on small spatio-temporal datasets, they are unable to scale to the quantities of data used by state-of-the-art weather and climate models. This limitation stems from their lack of efficient attention mechanisms. We address this shortcoming through the introduction of gridded pseudo-token TNPs which employ specialised encoders and decoders to handle unstructured observations and utilise a processor containing gridded pseudo-tokens that leverage efficient attention mechanisms. Our method consistently outperforms a range of strong baselines on various synthetic and real-world regression tasks involving large-scale data, while maintaining competitive computational efficiency. The real-life experiments are performed on weather data, demonstrating the potential of our approach to bring performance and computational benefits when applied at scale in a weather modelling pipeline.</p></details> |  |

Enhanced by anthropogenic activities and global warming, cyanobacterial blooms are expected to increase in frequency and global distribution. Early warning systems (EWS) for cyanobacterial blooms development allow timely implementation of management measures, reducing the risks associated to these blooms. In this paper, we propose an effective EWS for cyanobacterial bloom forecasting, which uses 6 years of incomplete high-frequency spatio-temporal data from multiparametric probes, including phycocyanin (PC) fluorescence as a proxy for cyanobacteria. A probe agnostic and replicable method is proposed to pre-process the data and to generate time series specific for cyanobacterial bloom forecasting. Using these pre-processed data, six different non-site/species-specific predictive models were compared including the autoregressive and multivariate versions of Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Long-Term Short-Term (LSTM) neural networks. Results were analyzed for seven forecasting time horizons ranging from 4 to 28 days evaluated with a hybrid system that combined regression metrics (MSE, R2, MAPE) for PC values, classification metrics (Accuracy, F1, Kappa) for a proposed alarm level of 10 ug PC/L, and a forecasting-specific metric to measure prediction improvement over the displaced signal (skill). The multivariate version of LSTM showed the best and most consistent results across all forecasting horizons and metrics, achieving accuracies of up to 90% in predicting the proposed PC alarm level. Additionally, positive skill values indicated its outstanding effectiveness to forecast cyanobacterial blooms from 16 to 28 days in advance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning from Spatio-temporal Correlation for Semi-Supervised LiDAR Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06893v1)** | 2024-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We address the challenges of the semi-supervised LiDAR segmentation (SSLS) problem, particularly in low-budget scenarios. The two main issues in low-budget SSLS are the poor-quality pseudo-labels for unlabeled data, and the performance drops due to the significant imbalance between ground-truth and pseudo-labels. This imbalance leads to a vicious training cycle. To overcome these challenges, we leverage the spatio-temporal prior by recognizing the substantial overlap between temporally adjacent LiDAR scans. We propose a proximity-based label estimation, which generates highly accurate pseudo-labels for unlabeled data by utilizing semantic consistency with adjacent labeled data. Additionally, we enhance this method by progressively expanding the pseudo-labels from the nearest unlabeled scans, which helps significantly reduce errors linked to dynamic classes. Additionally, we employ a dual-branch structure to mitigate performance degradation caused by data imbalance. Experimental results demonstrate remarkable performance in low-budget settings (i.e., <= 5%) and meaningful improvements in normal budget settings (i.e., 5 - 50%). Finally, our method has achieved new state-of-the-art results on SemanticKITTI and nuScenes in semi-supervised LiDAR segmentation. With only 5% labeled data, it offers competitive results against fully-supervised counterparts. Moreover, it surpasses the performance of the previous state-of-the-art at 100% labeled data (75.2%) using only 20% of labeled data (76.0%) on nuScenes.

By leveraging real-time environmental data, JC\&S improves resource allocation, reduces latency, and enhances power efficiency, while also supporting simulations and predictive modeling. This makes it a key technology for reactive systems and digital twins. These systems can respond to environmental events in real-time, offering transformative potential in sectors like smart cities, healthcare, and Industry 5.0, where adaptive and multimodal interaction is critical to enhance real-time decision-making. In this work, we present a transformer-based architecture that processes temporal Channel State Information (CSI) data, specifically amplitude and phase, to generate 3D point clouds of indoor environments. The model utilizes a multi-head attention to capture complex spatio-temporal relationships in CSI data and is adaptable to different CSI configurations. We evaluate the architecture on the MM-Fi dataset, using two different protocols to capture human presence in indoor environments. The system demonstrates strong potential for accurate 3D reconstructions and effectively distinguishes between close and distant objects, advancing JC\&S applications for spatial sensing in future wireless networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 5 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

Different from the common penalty-based approach, this work promotes adherence to the underlying physical mechanism that facilitates statistical procedures. The motivating application concerns modeling fluorescence recovery after photobleaching, which is used for characterization of diffusion processes. We propose a physics-encoded regression model for handling spatio-temporally distributed data, which enables principled interpretability, parsimonious computation and efficient estimation by exploiting the structure of solutions of a governing evolution equation. The rate of convergence attaining the minimax optimality is theoretically demonstrated, generalizing the result obtained for the spatial regression. We conduct simulation studies to assess the performance of our proposed estimator and illustrate its usage in the aforementioned real data example.</p></details> |  |
| **[Language Model Empowered Spatio-Temporal Forecasting via Physics-Aware Reprogramming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14505v2)** | 2024-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal forecasting is pivotal in numerous real-world applications, including transportation planning, energy management, and climate monitoring. In this work, we aim to harness the reasoning and generalization abilities of Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) for more effective spatio-temporal forecasting, particularly in data-scarce scenarios. However, recent studies uncover that PLMs, which are primarily trained on textual data, often falter when tasked with modeling the intricate correlations in numerical time series, thereby limiting their effectiveness in comprehending spatio-temporal data. To bridge the gap, we propose RePST, a physics-aware PLM reprogramming framework tailored for spatio-temporal forecasting. Specifically, we first propose a physics-aware decomposer that adaptively disentangles spatially correlated time series into interpretable sub-components, which facilitates PLM to understand sophisticated spatio-temporal dynamics via a divide-and-conquer strategy. Moreover, we propose a selective discrete reprogramming scheme, which introduces an expanded spatio-temporal vocabulary space to project spatio-temporal series into discrete representations. This scheme minimizes the information loss during reprogramming and enriches the representations derived by PLMs. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that the proposed RePST outperforms twelve state-of-the-art baseline methods, particularly in data-scarce scenarios, highlighting the effectiveness and superior generalization capabilities of PLMs for spatio-temporal forecasting.</p></details> |  |

However, multimedia technology for contact interaction is less mature than non-contact multimedia technologies and requires further development. Specialized haptic media technologies, requiring low latency and bitrates, are essential to enable haptic interaction, necessitating haptic information compression. Existing vibrotactile signal compression methods, based on the perceptual model, do not consider the characteristics of fused tactile perception at multiple spatially distributed interaction points. In fact, differences in tactile perceptual importance are not limited to conventional frequency and time domains, but also encompass differences in the spatial locations on the skin unique to tactile perception. For the most frequently used tactile information, vibrotactile texture perception, we have developed a model to predict its perceptual importance at multiple points, based on self-supervised learning and Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Network. Current experimental results indicate that this model can effectively predict the perceptual importance of various points in multi-point tactile perception scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a conference paper at Eurohaptics 2024</p></details> |
| **[Fast spatio-temporally varying coefficient modeling with reluctant interaction selection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07229v1)** | 2024-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatially and temporally varying coefficient (STVC) models are currently attracting attention as a flexible tool to explore the spatio-temporal patterns in regression coefficients. However, these models often struggle with balancing computational efficiency and model flexibility. To address this challenge, this study develops a fast and flexible method for STVC modeling. For enhanced flexibility in modeling, we assume multiple processes in each varying coefficient, including purely spatial, purely temporal, and spatio-temporal interaction processes with or without time cyclicity. While considering multiple processes can be time consuming, we combine a pre-conditioning method with a model selection procedure, inspired by reluctant interaction modeling. This approach allows us to computationally efficiently select and specify the latent space-time structure. Monte Carlo experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms alternatives in terms of coefficient estimation accuracy and computational efficiency. Finally, we apply the proposed method to crime analysis using a sample size of 279,360, confirming that the proposed method provides reasonable estimates of varying coefficients. The STVC model is implemented in an R package spmoran.</p></details> |  |

Effective monitoring of transformer health is critical to maintain grid stability and performance. Thermal insulation ageing is a key transformer failure mode, which is generally tracked by monitoring the hotspot temperature (HST). However, HST measurement is complex, costly, and often estimated from indirect measurements. Existing HST models focus on space-agnostic thermal models, providing worst-case HST estimates. This article introduces a spatio-temporal model for transformer winding temperature and ageing estimation, which leverages physics-based partial differential equations (PDEs) with data-driven Neural Networks (NN) in a Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) configuration to improve prediction accuracy and acquire spatio-temporal resolution. The computational accuracy of the PINN model is improved through the implementation of the Residual-Based Attention (PINN-RBA) scheme that accelerates the PINN model convergence. The PINN-RBA model is benchmarked against self-adaptive attention schemes and classical vanilla PINN configurations. For the first time, PINN based oil temperature predictions are used to estimate spatio-temporal transformer winding temperature values, validated through PDE numerical solution and fiber optic sensor measurements. Furthermore, the spatio-temporal transformer ageing model is inferred, which supports transformer health management decision-making. Results are validated with a distribution transformer operating on a floating photovoltaic power plant.</p></details> | 23 pages, 18 figures |

This allows for modeling non-linearities and interactions among predictor variables in a flexible data-driven manner and for accounting for spatio-temporal variation that is not explained by observable predictor variables. We also show how estimation and prediction can be done in a computationally efficient manner. In an application to a large U.S. mortgage credit risk data set, we find that both predictive default probabilities for individual loans and predictive loan portfolio loss distributions obtained with our novel approach are more accurate compared to conventional independent linear hazard models and also linear spatio-temporal models. Using interpretability tools for machine learning models, we find that the likely reasons for this outperformance are strong interaction and non-linear effects in the predictor variables and the presence of large spatio-temporal frailty effects.</p></details> |  |

Severity is often measured by the Mayo Endoscopic Subscore (MES) and Ulcerative Colitis Endoscopic Index of Severity (UCEIS) score. However, expert MES/UCEIS annotation is time-consuming and susceptible to inter-rater variability, factors addressable by automation. Automation attempts with frame-level labels face challenges in fully-supervised solutions due to the prevalence of video-level labels in clinical trials. CNN-based weakly-supervised models (WSL) with end-to-end (e2e) training lack generalization to new disease scores and ignore spatio-temporal information crucial for accurate scoring. To address these limitations, we propose "Arges", a deep learning framework that utilizes a transformer with positional encoding to incorporate spatio-temporal information from frame features to estimate disease severity scores in endoscopy video. Extracted features are derived from a foundation model (ArgesFM), pre-trained on a large diverse dataset from multiple clinical trials (61M frames, 3927 videos). We evaluate four UC disease severity scores, including MES and three UCEIS component scores. Test set evaluation indicates significant improvements, with F1 scores increasing by 4.1% for MES and 18.8%, 6.6%, 3.8% for the three UCEIS component scores compared to state-of-the-art methods. Prospective validation on previously unseen clinical trial data further demonstrates the model's successful generalization.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 2 figures, 5 tables, accepted at MLMI, MICCAI</p></details> |
| **[Towards Unifying Diffusion Models for Probabilistic Spatio-Temporal Graph Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17360v2)** | 2024-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal graph learning is a fundamental problem in modern urban systems. Existing approaches tackle different tasks independently, tailoring their models to unique task characteristics. These methods, however, fall short of modeling intrinsic uncertainties in the spatio-temporal data. Meanwhile, their specialized designs misalign with the current research efforts toward unifying spatio-temporal graph learning solutions. In this paper, we propose to model these tasks in a unified probabilistic perspective, viewing them as predictions based on conditional information with shared dependencies. Based on this proposal, we introduce Unified Spatio-Temporal Diffusion Models (USTD) to address the tasks uniformly under the uncertainty-aware diffusion framework. USTD is holistically designed, comprising a shared spatio-temporal encoder and attention-based denoising decoders that are task-specific. The encoder, optimized by pre-training strategies, effectively captures conditional spatio-temporal patterns. The decoders, utilizing attention mechanisms, generate predictions by leveraging learned patterns. Opting for forecasting and kriging, the decoders are designed as Spatial Gated Attention (SGA) and Temporal Gated Attention (TGA) for each task, with different emphases on the spatial and temporal dimensions. Combining the advantages of deterministic encoders and probabilistic decoders, USTD achieves state-of-the-art performances compared to both deterministic and probabilistic baselines, while also providing valuable uncertainty estimates.</p></details> |  |

Our proposed method applies DETR to each frame and uses feature shift to incorporate temporal information. However, DETR's object queries in each frame may correspond to different objects, making a simple feature shift ineffective. To overcome this issue, we propose query matching across different frames, ensuring that queries for the same object are matched and used for the feature shift. Experimental results show that performance on the JHMDB21 dataset improves significantly when query features are shifted using the proposed query matching.</p></details> |  |

The algorithm is capable of safely tracking a time-varying safe region without the need for explicit change detection. Optimality guarantees are also provided for the algorithm when the optimization problem becomes stationary. We show that TVSafeOpt compares favorably against SafeOpt on synthetic data, both regarding safety and optimality. Evaluation on a realistic case study with gas compressors confirms that TVSafeOpt ensures safety when solving time-varying optimization problems with unknown reward and safety functions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |

Existing RGB-E tracking methods model event characteristics utilising attention mechanism of Transformer before integrating both modalities. Nevertheless, these methods involve aggregating the event stream into a single event frame, lacking the utilisation of the temporal information inherent in the event stream.Moreover, the traditional attention mechanism is well-suited for dense semantic features, while the attention mechanism for sparse event features require revolution. In this paper, we propose a dynamic event subframe splitting strategy to split the event stream into more fine-grained event clusters, aiming to capture spatio-temporal features that contain motion cues. Based on this, we design an event-based sparse attention mechanism to enhance the interaction of event features in temporal and spatial dimensions. The experimental results indicate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on the FE240 and COESOT datasets, providing an effective processing manner for the event data.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 8 figures, conference</p></details> |

This paper introduces SEA-ViT, an advanced deep learning model that integrates Vision Transformer (ViT) with bidirectional Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) to capture spatio-temporal covariance for predicting sea surface currents (U, V) using high-frequency radar (HF) data. The name SEA-ViT is derived from ``Sea Surface Currents Forecasting using Vision Transformer,'' highlighting the model's emphasis on ocean dynamics and its use of the ViT architecture to enhance forecasting capabilities. SEA-ViT is designed to unravel complex dependencies by leveraging a rich dataset spanning over 30 years and incorporating ENSO indices (El Ni\~no, La Ni\~na, and neutral phases) to address the intricate relationship between geographic coordinates and climatic variations. This development enhances the predictive capabilities for sea surface currents, supporting the efforts of the Geo-Informatics and Space Technology Development Agency (GISTDA) in Thailand's maritime regions.

Recently, several automated spatio-temporal forecasting methods have been proposed to automatically search the optimal neural network architecture for capturing complex spatio-temporal dependencies. However, the existing automated approaches suffer from expensive neural architecture search overhead, which hinders their practical use and the further exploration of diverse spatio-temporal operators in a finer granularity. In this paper, we propose AutoSTF, a decoupled automatic neural architecture search framework for cost-effective automated spatio-temporal forecasting. From the efficiency perspective, we first decouple the mixed search space into temporal space and spatial space and respectively devise representation compression and parameter-sharing schemes to mitigate the parameter explosion. The decoupled spatio-temporal search not only expedites the model optimization process but also leaves new room for more effective spatio-temporal dependency modeling. From the effectiveness perspective, we propose a multi-patch transfer module to jointly capture multi-granularity temporal dependencies and extend the spatial search space to enable finer-grained layer-wise spatial dependency search. Extensive experiments on eight datasets demonstrate the superiority of AutoSTF in terms of both accuracy and efficiency. Specifically, our proposed method achieves up to 13.48x speed-up compared to state-of-the-art automatic spatio-temporal forecasting methods while maintaining the best forecasting accuracy.</p></details> | 16 pages, 13 figures |
| **[Automated Spatio-Temporal Weather Modeling for Load Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16326v1)** | 2024-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Electricity is difficult to store, except at prohibitive cost, and therefore the balance between generation and load must be maintained at all times. Electricity is traditionally managed by anticipating demand and intermittent production (wind, solar) and matching flexible production (hydro, nuclear, coal and gas). Accurate forecasting of electricity load and renewable production is therefore essential to ensure grid performance and stability. Both are highly dependent on meteorological variables (temperature, wind, sunshine). These dependencies are complex and difficult to model. On the one hand, spatial variations do not have a uniform impact because population, industry, and wind and solar farms are not evenly distributed across the territory. On the other hand, temporal variations can have delayed effects on load (due to the thermal inertia of buildings). With access to observations from different weather stations and simulated data from meteorological models, we believe that both phenomena can be modeled together. In today's state-of-the-art load forecasting models, the spatio-temporal modeling of the weather is fixed. In this work, we aim to take advantage of the automated representation and spatio-temporal feature extraction capabilities of deep neural networks to improve spatio-temporal weather modeling for load forecasting. We compare our deep learning-based methodology with the state-of-the-art on French national load. This methodology could also be fully adapted to forecasting renewable energy production.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatio-Temporal Motion Retargeting for Quadruped Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11557v2)** | 2024-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work introduces a motion retargeting approach for legged robots, which aims to create motion controllers that imitate the fine behavior of animals. Our approach, namely spatio-temporal motion retargeting (STMR), guides imitation learning procedures by transferring motion from source to target, effectively bridging the morphological disparities by ensuring the feasibility of imitation on the target system. Our STMR method comprises two components: spatial motion retargeting (SMR) and temporal motion retargeting (TMR). On the one hand, SMR tackles motion retargeting at the kinematic level by generating kinematically feasible whole-body motions from keypoint trajectories. On the other hand, TMR aims to retarget motion at the dynamic level by optimizing motion in the temporal domain. We showcase the effectiveness of our method in facilitating Imitation Learning (IL) for complex animal movements through a series of simulation and hardware experiments. In these experiments, our STMR method successfully tailored complex animal motions from various media, including video captured by a hand-held camera, to fit the morphology and physical properties of the target robots. This enabled RL policy training for precise motion tracking, while baseline methods struggled with highly dynamic motion involving flying phases. Moreover, we validated that the control policy can successfully imitate six different motions in two quadruped robots with different dimensions and physical properties in real-world settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>34 pa...</summary><p>34 pages, 7 figures, videos available at https://terry97-guel.github.io/STMR-RL.github.io/</p></details> |

Traditional rPPG models often struggle with poor generalization capacity in unseen domains. Current solutions to this problem is to improve its generalization in the target domain through Domain Generalization (DG) or Domain Adaptation (DA). However, both traditional methods require access to both source domain data and target domain data, which cannot be implemented in scenarios with limited access to source data, and another issue is the privacy of accessing source domain data. In this paper, we propose the first Source-free Domain Adaptation benchmark for rPPG measurement (SFDA-rPPG), which overcomes these limitations by enabling effective domain adaptation without access to source domain data. Our framework incorporates a Three-Branch Spatio-Temporal Consistency Network (TSTC-Net) to enhance feature consistency across domains. Furthermore, we propose a new rPPG distribution alignment loss based on the Frequency-domain Wasserstein Distance (FWD), which leverages optimal transport to align power spectrum distributions across domains effectively and further enforces the alignment of the three branches. Extensive cross-domain experiments and ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method in source-free domain adaptation settings. Our findings highlight the significant contribution of the proposed FWD loss for distributional alignment, providing a valuable reference for future research and applications.

| **[EventAug: Multifaceted Spatio-Temporal Data Augmentation Methods for Event-based Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11813v1)** | 2024-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The event camera has demonstrated significant success across a wide range of areas due to its low time latency and high dynamic range. However, the community faces challenges such as data deficiency and limited diversity, often resulting in over-fitting and inadequate feature learning. Notably, the exploration of data augmentation techniques in the event community remains scarce. This work aims to address this gap by introducing a systematic augmentation scheme named EventAug to enrich spatial-temporal diversity. In particular, we first propose Multi-scale Temporal Integration (MSTI) to diversify the motion speed of objects, then introduce Spatial-salient Event Mask (SSEM) and Temporal-salient Event Mask (TSEM) to enrich object variants. Our EventAug can facilitate models learning with richer motion patterns, object variants and local spatio-temporal relations, thus improving model robustness to varied moving speeds, occlusions, and action disruptions. Experiment results show that our augmentation method consistently yields significant improvements across different tasks and backbones (e.g., a 4.87% accuracy gain on DVS128 Gesture). Our code will be publicly available for this community.</p></details> |  |

The proposed model can simplify the parameterization by using network structure in data, and can capture the asymmetric property in dynamic volatility by adopting a threshold structure. The proposed model assumes the conditional distribution is Poisson distribution. Asymptotic theory of maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) for the spatial model is derived when both sample size and network dimension are large. We obtain asymptotic statistical inferences via investigation of the weak dependence of components of the model and application of limit theorems for weakly dependent random fields. Simulation studies and a real data example are presented to support our methodology.</p></details> |  |

Current MOT trackers rely on accurate object detection results and precise matching of target reidentification (ReID). These methods focus on optimizing target spatial attributes while overlooking temporal cues in modelling object relationships, especially for challenging tracking conditions such as object deformation and blurring, etc. To address the above-mentioned issues, we propose a novel Spatio-Temporal Cohesion Multiple Object Tracking framework (STCMOT), which utilizes historical embedding features to model the representation of ReID and detection features in a sequential order. Concretely, a temporal embedding boosting module is introduced to enhance the discriminability of individual embedding based on adjacent frame cooperation. While the trajectory embedding is then propagated by a temporal detection refinement module to mine salient target locations in the temporal field. Extensive experiments on the VisDrone2019 and UAVDT datasets demonstrate our STCMOT sets a new state-of-the-art performance in MOTA and IDF1 metrics.

| **[Spatio-Temporal-Network Point Processes for Modeling Crime Events with Landmarks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10882v1)** | 2024-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-exciting point processes are widely used to model the contagious effects of crime events living within continuous geographic space, using their occurrence time and locations. However, in urban environments, most events are naturally constrained within the city's street network structure, and the contagious effects of crime are governed by such a network geography. Meanwhile, the complex distribution of urban infrastructures also plays an important role in shaping crime patterns across space. We introduce a novel spatio-temporal-network point process framework for crime modeling that integrates these urban environmental characteristics by incorporating self-attention graph neural networks. Our framework incorporates the street network structure as the underlying event space, where crime events can occur at random locations on the network edges. To realistically capture criminal movement patterns, distances between events are measured using street network distances. We then propose a new mark for a crime event by concatenating the event's crime category with the type of its nearby landmark, aiming to capture how the urban design influences the mixing structures of various crime types. A graph attention network architecture is adopted to learn the existence of mark-to-mark interactions. Extensive experiments on crime data from Valencia, Spain, demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in understanding the crime landscape and forecasting crime risks across regions.</p></details> |  |

While limiting the variety of training data can make training easier, it can also lead to a lack of knowledge and information for the model, resulting in a decrease in performance. To address this challenge, we presented an innovative paradigm that incorporates three separate forms of curriculum learning specifically targeting from spatial, temporal, and quantile perspectives. Furthermore, our framework incorporates a stacking fusion module to combine diverse information from three types of curriculum learning, resulting in a strong and thorough learning process. We demonstrated the effectiveness of this framework with extensive empirical evaluations, highlighting its better performance in addressing complex ST challenges. We provided thorough ablation studies to investigate the effectiveness of our curriculum and to explain how it contributes to the improvement of learning efficiency on ST data.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accept by sigspatial 2024</p></details> |

Specifically, we consider the global task as a conjunction of independent and collaborative tasks, defined over the absolute and relative states of agent pairs. Task dependencies in this form are then represented by a task graph, which we assume to be acyclic. From the given task graph, we provide an algorithmic approach to define a distributed sampled-data controller prioritizing the fulfilment of collaborative tasks as the primary objective, while fulfilling independent tasks unless they conflict with collaborative ones. Moreover, communication maintenance among collaborating agents is seamlessly enforced within the proposed control framework.

However, scalability and generalization challenges remain significant obstacles. Advanced models often rely on Graph Neural Networks to encode spatial and temporal correlations, but struggle with the increased complexity of large-scale datasets. The recursive GNN-based message passing schemes used in these models hinder their training and deployment in real-life urban sensing scenarios. Moreover, long-spanning large-scale spatio-temporal data introduce distribution shifts, necessitating improved generalization performance. To address these challenges, we propose a simple framework for spatio-temporal prediction - EasyST paradigm. It learns lightweight and robust Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) by effectively distilling knowledge from complex spatio-temporal GNNs. We ensure robust knowledge distillation by integrating the spatio-temporal information bottleneck with teacher-bounded regression loss, filtering out task-irrelevant noise and avoiding erroneous guidance. We further enhance the generalization ability of the student model by incorporating spatial and temporal prompts to provide downstream task contexts. Evaluation on three spatio-temporal datasets for urban computing tasks demonstrates that EasyST surpasses state-of-the-art approaches in terms of efficiency and accuracy. The implementation code is available at: https://github.com/HKUDS/EasyST.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CIKM'2024, full paper</p></details> |
| **[A general reduced-order neural operator for spatio-temporal predictive learning on complex spatial domains](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05508v1)** | 2024-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predictive learning for spatio-temporal processes (PL-STP) on complex spatial domains plays a critical role in various scientific and engineering fields, with its essence being the construction of operators between infinite-dimensional function spaces. This paper focuses on the unequal-domain mappings in PL-STP and categorising them into increase-domain and decrease-domain mapping. Recent advances in deep learning have revealed the great potential of neural operators (NOs) to learn operators directly from observational data. However, existing NOs require input space and output space to be the same domain, which pose challenges in ensuring predictive accuracy and stability for unequal-domain mappings. To this end, this study presents a general reduced-order neural operator named Reduced-Order Neural Operator on Riemannian Manifolds (RO-NORM), which consists of two parts: the unequal-domain encoder/decoder and the same-domain approximator. Motivated by the variable separation in classical modal decomposition, the unequal-domain encoder/decoder uses the pre-computed bases to reformulate the spatio-temporal function as a sum of products between spatial (or temporal) bases and corresponding temporally (or spatially) distributed weight functions, thus the original unequal-domain mapping can be converted into a same-domain mapping. Consequently, the same-domain approximator NORM is applied to model the transformed mapping. The performance of our proposed method has been evaluated on six benchmark cases, including parametric PDEs, engineering and biomedical applications, and compared with four baseline algorithms: DeepONet, POD-DeepONet, PCA-Net, and vanilla NORM. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of RO-NORM in prediction accuracy and training efficiency for PL-STP.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Spatio-Temporal Attention-Based Method for Detecting Student Classroom Behaviors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02523v4)** | 2024-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurately detecting student behavior from classroom videos is beneficial for analyzing their classroom status and improving teaching efficiency. However, low accuracy in student classroom behavior detection is a prevalent issue. To address this issue, we propose a Spatio-Temporal Attention-Based Method for Detecting Student Classroom Behaviors (BDSTA). Firstly, the SlowFast network is used to generate motion and environmental information feature maps from the video. Then, the spatio-temporal attention module is applied to the feature maps, including information aggregation, compression and stimulation processes. Subsequently, attention maps in the time, channel and space dimensions are obtained, and multi-label behavior classification is performed based on these attention maps. To solve the long-tail data problem that exists in student classroom behavior datasets, we use an improved focal loss function to assign more weight to the tail class data during training. Experimental results are conducted on a self-made student classroom behavior dataset named STSCB. Compared with the SlowFast model, the average accuracy of student behavior classification detection improves by 8.94\% using BDSTA.</p></details> |  |

However, the lack of publicly available spatio-temporal datasets on student behavior, as well as the high cost of manually labeling such datasets, pose significant challenges for researchers in this field. To address this issue, we proposed a method for extending the spatio-temporal behavior dataset in Student Classroom Scenarios (SCB-ST-Dataset4) through image dataset. Our SCB-ST-Dataset4 comprises 757265 images with 25810 labels, focusing on 3 behaviors: hand-raising, reading, writing. Our proposed method can rapidly generate spatio-temporal behavior datasets without requiring extra manual labeling. Furthermore, we proposed a Behavior Similarity Index (BSI) to explore the similarity of behaviors. We evaluated the dataset using the YOLOv5, YOLOv7, YOLOv8, and SlowFast algorithms, achieving a mean average precision (map) of up to 82.3%. Last, we fused multiple models to generate student behavior-related data from various perspectives. The experiment further demonstrates the effectiveness of our method. And SCB-ST-Dataset4 provides a robust foundation for future research in student behavior detection, potentially contributing to advancements in this field.

Developing techniques to identify and analyze communities in these time-varying graph structures is an important challenge. In this work, we generalize existing spectral clustering algorithms from static to dynamic graphs using canonical correlation analysis (CCA) to capture the temporal evolution of clusters. Based on this extended canonical correlation framework, we define the spatio-temporal graph Laplacian and investigate its spectral properties. We connect these concepts to dynamical systems theory via transfer operators, and illustrate the advantages of our method on benchmark graphs by comparison with existing methods. We show that the spatio-temporal graph Laplacian allows for a clear interpretation of cluster structure evolution over time for directed and undirected graphs.</p></details> |  |

A critical component of disease behavior is the velocity with which disease spreads, defined as the rate of change between time and space. In this paper, we propose a spatio-temporal modeling approach to determine the velocities of infectious disease spread. Our approach assumes that the locations and times of people infected can be considered as a spatio-temporal point pattern that arises as a realization of a spatio-temporal log-Gaussian Cox process. The intensity of this process is estimated using fast Bayesian inference by employing the integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA) and the Stochastic Partial Differential Equations (SPDE) approaches. The velocity is then calculated using finite differences that approximate the derivatives of the intensity function. Finally, the directions and magnitudes of the velocities can be mapped at specific times to examine better the spread of the disease throughout the region. We demonstrate our method by analyzing COVID-19 spread in Cali, Colombia, during the 2020-2021 pandemic.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 46 figures, Journal American Statistican, submitted on 3rd of September</p></details> |

A video tutorial for this library is available on YouTube. We consider two types of methods to estimate a non-homogeneous Poisson process in space and time. The methods approximate the arrival intensity function of the Poisson process by discretizing space and time, and estimating arrival intensity as a function of subregion and time interval. With such methods, it is typical that the dimension of the estimator is large relative to the amount of data, and therefore the performance of the estimator can be improved by using additional data. The first method uses additional data to add a regularization term to the likelihood function for calibrating the intensity of the Poisson process. The second method uses additional data to estimate arrival intensity as a function of covariates. We describe a Python package to perform various types of space and time discretization. We also describe two packages for the calibration of the models, one in Matlab and one in C++. We demonstrate the advantages of our methods compared to basic maximum likelihood estimation with simulated and real data. The experiments with real data calibrate models of the arrival process of emergencies to be handled by the Rio de Janeiro emergency medical service.</p></details> |  |

Recently, the forecasting models have employed multi-source data as the multi-modality input, thus improving the prediction accuracy. However, the prevailing methods usually suffer from the desynchronization of multi-source variables, the insufficient capability of capturing spatio-temporal dependency, and unsatisfactory performance in predicting extreme precipitation events. To fix these problems, we propose a short-term precipitation forecasting model based on spatio-temporal alignment attention, with SATA as the temporal alignment module and STAU as the spatio-temporal feature extractor to filter high-pass features from precipitation signals and capture multi-term temporal dependencies. Based on satellite and ERA5 data from the southwestern region of China, our model achieves improvements of 12.61\% in terms of RMSE, in comparison with the state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

Designing spatio-temporal forecasting models separately in a task-wise and city-wise manner to forecast demand and supply-demand gap in a ride-hailing system poses a burden for the expanding transportation network companies. Therefore, a multi-task learning architecture is proposed in this study by developing gated ensemble of spatio-temporal mixture of experts network (GESME-Net) with convolutional recurrent neural network (CRNN), convolutional neural network (CNN), and recurrent neural network (RNN) for simultaneously forecasting these spatio-temporal tasks in a city as well as across different cities. Furthermore, a task adaptation layer is integrated with the architecture for learning joint representation in multi-task learning and revealing the contribution of the input features utilized in prediction. The proposed architecture is tested with data from Didi Chuxing for: (i) simultaneously forecasting demand and supply-demand gap in Beijing, and (ii) simultaneously forecasting demand across Chengdu and Xian. In both scenarios, models from our proposed architecture outperformed the single-task and multi-task deep learning benchmarks and ensemble-based machine learning algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2012.08868</p></details> |

Although adopting a surrogate gradient (SG) makes the non-differentiability SNN trainable, achieving comparable accuracy for ANNs and keeping low-power features simultaneously is still tricky. In this paper, we proposed an energy-efficient spike-train level spiking neural network with spatio-temporal conversion, which has low computational cost and high accuracy. In the STCSNN, spatio-temporal conversion blocks (STCBs) are proposed to keep the low power features of SNNs and improve accuracy. However, STCSNN cannot adopt backpropagation algorithms directly due to the non-differentiability nature of spike trains. We proposed a suitable learning rule for STCSNNs by deducing the equivalent gradient of STCB. We evaluate the proposed STCSNN on static and neuromorphic datasets, including Fashion-Mnist, Cifar10, Cifar100, TinyImageNet, and DVS-Cifar10. The experiment results show that our proposed STCSNN outperforms the state-of-the-art accuracy on nearly all datasets, using fewer time steps and being highly energy-efficient.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Neurocomputing on 10 August 2024</p></details> |

It consists of a pyramid structure with a spatial information reuse strategy, a sequential pose initialization module, a gated hierarchical pose refinement module, and a temporal feature propagation module. First, spatial features are encoded using a point feature pyramid, with features reused in successive pose estimations to reduce computational overhead. Second, a sequential pose initialization method is introduced, leveraging the high-frequency sampling characteristic of LiDAR to initialize the LiDAR pose. Then, a gated hierarchical pose refinement mechanism refines poses from coarse to fine by selectively retaining or discarding motion information from different layers based on gate estimations. Finally, temporal feature propagation is proposed to incorporate the historical motion information from point cloud sequences, and address the spatial inconsistency issue when transmitting motion information embedded in point clouds between frames. Experimental results on the KITTI odometry dataset and Argoverse dataset demonstrate that DSLO outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving at least a 15.67\% improvement on RTE and a 12.64\% improvement on RRE, while also achieving a 34.69\% reduction in runtime compared to baseline methods.

However, existing methods encounter difficulties when applied to problems on unstructured grids and irregular domains. Spatial graph neural networks utilize local convolution in a neighborhood to potentially address these challenges, yet they often suffer from issues such as over-smoothing and over-squashing in deep architectures. Conversely, spectral graph neural networks leverage global convolution to capture extensive features and long-range dependencies in domain graphs, albeit at a high computational cost due to Eigenvalue decomposition. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach, referred to as Spatio-Spectral Graph Neural Operator (Sp$^2$GNO) that integrates spatial and spectral GNNs effectively. This framework mitigates the limitations of individual methods and enables the learning of solution operators across arbitrary geometries, thus catering to a wide range of real-world problems. Sp$^2$GNO demonstrates exceptional performance in solving both time-dependent and time-independent partial differential equations on regular and irregular domains. Our approach is validated through comprehensive benchmarks and practical applications drawn from computational mechanics and scientific computing literature.</p></details> |  |

These hybrid models typically arrange the spatial and temporal learning components in series. A pioneering effort to jointly model the spatio-temporal dependencies using only GNNs was the introduction of the Block Adjacency Matrix \(\mathbf{A_B}\) \cite{1}, which was constructed by diagonally concatenating adjacency matrices from graphs at different time steps. This approach resulted in a single graph encompassing complete spatio-temporal data; however, the graphs from different time steps remained disconnected, limiting GNN message-passing to spatially connected nodes only. Addressing this critical challenge, we propose a novel end-to-end learning architecture specifically designed to mend the temporal dependencies, resulting in a well-connected graph. Thus, we provide a framework for the learnable representation of spatio-temporal data as graphs. Our methodology demonstrates superior performance on benchmark datasets, such as SurgVisDom and C2D2, surpassing existing state-of-the-art graph models in terms of accuracy. Our model also achieves significantly lower computational complexity, having far fewer parameters than methods reliant on CLIP and 3D CNN architectures.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICONIP 2024</p></details> |

However, these networks often face challenges in training due to the high annotation cost. To address this, unsupervised and weakly-supervised methods have been developed to reduce the dependency on annotations. This work introduces a novel weakly-supervised method called Eigen-cluster VIS that, without requiring any mask annotations, achieves competitive accuracy compared to other VIS approaches. This method is based on two key innovations: a Temporal Eigenvalue Loss (TEL) and a clip-level Quality Cluster Coefficient (QCC). The TEL ensures temporal coherence by leveraging the eigenvalues of the Laplacian matrix derived from graph adjacency matrices. By minimizing the mean absolute error (MAE) between the eigenvalues of adjacent frames, this loss function promotes smooth transitions and stable segmentation boundaries over time, reducing temporal discontinuities and improving overall segmentation quality. The QCC employs the K-means method to ensure the quality of spatio-temporal clusters without relying on ground truth masks. Using the Davies-Bouldin score, the QCC provides an unsupervised measure of feature discrimination, allowing the model to self-evaluate and adapt to varying object distributions, enhancing robustness during the testing phase. These enhancements are computationally efficient and straightforward, offering significant performance gains without additional annotated data. The proposed Eigen-Cluster VIS method is evaluated on the YouTube-VIS 2019/2021 and OVIS datasets, demonstrating that it effectively narrows the performance gap between the fully-supervised and weakly-supervised VIS approaches.

TG-PhyNN leverages the power of GNNs for graph-based modeling while simultaneously incorporating physical constraints as a guiding principle during training. This is achieved through a two-step prediction strategy that enables the calculation of physical equation derivatives within the GNN architecture. Our findings demonstrate that TG-PhyNN significantly outperforms traditional forecasting models (e.g., GRU, LSTM, GAT) on real-world spatio-temporal datasets like PedalMe (traffic flow), COVID-19 spread, and Chickenpox outbreaks. These datasets are all governed by well-defined physical principles, which TG-PhyNN effectively exploits to offer more reliable and accurate forecasts in various domains where physical processes govern the dynamics of data. This paves the way for improved forecasting in areas like traffic flow prediction, disease outbreak prediction, and potentially other fields where physics plays a crucial role.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatio-Temporal Context Prompting for Zero-Shot Action Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15996v2)** | 2024-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal action detection encompasses the tasks of localizing and classifying individual actions within a video. Recent works aim to enhance this process by incorporating interaction modeling, which captures the relationship between people and their surrounding context. However, these approaches have primarily focused on fully-supervised learning, and the current limitation lies in the lack of generalization capability to recognize unseen action categories. In this paper, we aim to adapt the pretrained image-language models to detect unseen actions. To this end, we propose a method which can effectively leverage the rich knowledge of visual-language models to perform Person-Context Interaction. Meanwhile, our Context Prompting module will utilize contextual information to prompt labels, thereby enhancing the generation of more representative text features. Moreover, to address the challenge of recognizing distinct actions by multiple people at the same timestamp, we design the Interest Token Spotting mechanism which employs pretrained visual knowledge to find each person's interest context tokens, and then these tokens will be used for prompting to generate text features tailored to each individual. To evaluate the ability to detect unseen actions, we propose a comprehensive benchmark on J-HMDB, UCF101-24, and AVA datasets. The experiments show that our method achieves superior results compared to previous approaches and can be further extended to multi-action videos, bringing it closer to real-world applications.

| **[Marked Neural Spatio-Temporal Point Process Involving a Dynamic Graph Neural Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.03469v2)** | 2024-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal Point Processes (TPPs) have recently become increasingly interesting for learning dynamics in graph data. A reason for this is that learning on dynamic graph data is becoming more relevant, since data from many scientific fields, ranging from mathematics, biology, social sciences, and physics to computer science, is naturally related and inherently dynamic. In addition, TPPs provide a meaningful characterization of event streams and a prediction mechanism for future events. Therefore, (semi-)parameterized Neural TPPs have been introduced whose characterization can be (partially) learned and, thus, enable the representation of more complex phenomena. However, the research on modeling dynamic graphs with TPPs is relatively young, and only a few models for node attribute changes or evolving edges have been proposed yet. To allow for learning on fully dynamic graph streams, i.e., graphs that can change in their structure (addition/deletion of nodes/edge) and in their node/edge attributes, we propose a Marked Neural Spatio-Temporal Point Process (MNSTPP). It leverages a Dynamic Graph Neural Network to learn a Marked TPP that handles attributes and spatial data to model and predict any event in a graph stream.</p></details> |  |

Human-centric VAD, a specialized area within this domain, faces additional complexities, including variations in human behavior, potential biases in data, and substantial privacy concerns related to human subjects. These issues complicate the development of models that are both robust and generalizable. To address these challenges, recent advancements have focused on pose-based VAD, which leverages human pose as a high-level feature to mitigate privacy concerns, reduce appearance biases, and minimize background interference. In this paper, we introduce PoseWatch, a novel transformer-based architecture designed specifically for human-centric pose-based VAD. PoseWatch features an innovative Spatio-Temporal Pose and Relative Pose (ST-PRP) tokenization method that enhances the representation of human motion over time, which is also beneficial for broader human behavior analysis tasks. The architecture's core, a Unified Encoder Twin Decoders (UETD) transformer, significantly improves the detection of anomalous behaviors in video data. Extensive evaluations across multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that PoseWatch consistently outperforms existing methods, establishing a new state-of-the-art in pose-based VAD. This work not only demonstrates the efficacy of PoseWatch but also highlights the potential of integrating Natural Language Processing techniques with computer vision to advance human behavior analysis.</p></details> |  |

Traditional forecasting methods, however, struggle with the irregular traffic time series resulting from adaptive traffic signal controls, presenting challenges in asynchronous spatial dependency, irregular temporal dependency, and predicting variable-length sequences. To this end, we propose an Asynchronous Spatio-tEmporal graph convolutional nEtwoRk (ASeer) tailored for irregular traffic time series forecasting. Specifically, we first propose an Asynchronous Graph Diffusion Network to capture the spatial dependency between asynchronously measured traffic states regulated by adaptive traffic signals. After that, to capture the temporal dependency within irregular traffic state sequences, a personalized time encoding is devised to embed the continuous time signals. Then, we propose a Transformable Time-aware Convolution Network, which adapts meta-filters for time-aware convolution on the sequences with inconsistent temporal flow. Additionally, a Semi-Autoregressive Prediction Network, comprising a state evolution unit and a semi-autoregressive predictor, is designed to predict variable-length traffic sequences effectively and efficiently. Extensive experiments on a newly established benchmark demonstrate the superiority of ASeer compared with twelve competitive baselines across six metrics.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work is published in the research track of KDD 2024</p></details> |

However, existing methods are limited by their ability to handle large, complex datasets. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a hybrid approach that combines the strengths of open-source large and small-scale language models (LLMs and LMs) with traditional forecasting methods. We augment traditional methods with dynamic prompting and a grouped-query, multi-head attention mechanism to more effectively capture both intra-series and inter-series dependencies in evolving nonlinear time series data. In addition, we facilitate on-premises customization by fine-tuning smaller open-source LMs for time series trend analysis utilizing descriptions generated by open-source large LMs on consumer-grade hardware using Low-Rank Adaptation with Activation Memory Reduction (LoRA-AMR) technique to reduce computational overhead and activation storage memory demands while preserving inference latency. We combine language model processing for time series trend analysis with traditional time series representation learning method for cross-modal integration, achieving robust and accurate forecasts. The framework effectiveness is demonstrated through extensive experiments on various real-world datasets, outperforming existing methods by significant margins in terms of forecast accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper published at the Deployable AI (DAI) workshop at AAAI-2024</p></details> |

Although various neural networks with intricate architectures have been developed to address this problem, they still face two key challenges: i) Recent advancements in network designs for modeling spatio-temporal correlations are starting to see diminishing returns in performance enhancements. ii) Additionally, most models do not account for the spatio-temporal heterogeneity inherent in traffic data, i.e., traffic distribution varies significantly across different regions and traffic flow patterns fluctuate across various time slots. To tackle these challenges, we introduce the Spatio-Temporal Graph Transformer (STGormer), which effectively integrates attribute and structure information inherent in traffic data for learning spatio-temporal correlations, and a mixture-of-experts module for capturing heterogeneity along spaital and temporal axes. Specifically, we design two straightforward yet effective spatial encoding methods based on the graph structure and integrate time position encoding into the vanilla transformer to capture spatio-temporal traffic patterns. Additionally, a mixture-of-experts enhanced feedforward neural network (FNN) module adaptively assigns suitable expert layers to distinct patterns via a spatio-temporal gating network, further improving overall prediction accuracy. Experiments on real-world traffic datasets demonstrate that STGormer achieves state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  |

| **[Causally-Aware Spatio-Temporal Multi-Graph Convolution Network for Accurate and Reliable Traffic Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13293v1)** | 2024-08-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate and reliable prediction has profound implications to a wide range of applications. In this study, we focus on an instance of spatio-temporal learning problem--traffic prediction--to demonstrate an advanced deep learning model developed for making accurate and reliable forecast. Despite the significant progress in traffic prediction, limited studies have incorporated both explicit and implicit traffic patterns simultaneously to improve prediction performance. Meanwhile, the variability nature of traffic states necessitates quantifying the uncertainty of model predictions in a statistically principled way; however, extant studies offer no provable guarantee on the statistical validity of confidence intervals in reflecting its actual likelihood of containing the ground truth. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end traffic prediction framework that leverages three primary components to generate accurate and reliable traffic predictions: dynamic causal structure learning for discovering implicit traffic patterns from massive traffic data, causally-aware spatio-temporal multi-graph convolution network (CASTMGCN) for learning spatio-temporal dependencies, and conformal prediction for uncertainty quantification. CASTMGCN fuses several graphs that characterize different important aspects of traffic networks and an auxiliary graph that captures the effect of exogenous factors on the road network. On this basis, a conformal prediction approach tailored to spatio-temporal data is further developed for quantifying the uncertainty in node-wise traffic predictions over varying prediction horizons. Experimental results on two real-world traffic datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms several state-of-the-art models in prediction accuracy; moreover, it generates more efficient prediction regions than other methods while strictly satisfying the statistical validity in coverage.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatio-Temporal Road Traffic Prediction using Real-time Regional Knowledge](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12882v1)** | 2024-08-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For traffic prediction in transportation services such as car-sharing and ride-hailing, mid-term road traffic prediction (within a few hours) is considered essential. However, the existing road-level traffic prediction has mainly studied how significantly micro traffic events propagate to the adjacent roads in terms of short-term prediction. On the other hand, recent attempts have been made to incorporate regional knowledge such as POIs, road characteristics, and real-time social events to help traffic prediction. However, these studies lack in understandings of different modalities of road-level and region-level spatio-temporal correlations and how to combine such knowledge. This paper proposes a novel method that embeds real-time region-level knowledge using POIs, satellite images, and real-time LTE access traces via a regional spatio-temporal module that consists of dynamic convolution and temporal attention, and conducts bipartite spatial transform attention to convert into road-level knowledge. Then the model ingests this embedded knowledge into a road-level attention-based prediction model. Experimental results on real-world road traffic prediction show that our model outperforms the baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Geolocation Representation from Large Language Models are Generic Enhancers for Spatio-Temporal Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12116v1)** | 2024-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the geospatial domain, universal representation models are significantly less prevalent than their extensive use in natural language processing and computer vision. This discrepancy arises primarily from the high costs associated with the input of existing representation models, which often require street views and mobility data. To address this, we develop a novel, training-free method that leverages large language models (LLMs) and auxiliary map data from OpenStreetMap to derive geolocation representations (LLMGeovec). LLMGeovec can represent the geographic semantics of city, country, and global scales, which acts as a generic enhancer for spatio-temporal learning. Specifically, by direct feature concatenation, we introduce a simple yet effective paradigm for enhancing multiple spatio-temporal tasks including geographic prediction (GP), long-term time series forecasting (LTSF), and graph-based spatio-temporal forecasting (GSTF). LLMGeovec can seamlessly integrate into a wide spectrum of spatio-temporal learning models, providing immediate enhancements. Experimental results demonstrate that LLMGeovec achieves global coverage and significantly boosts the performance of leading GP, LTSF, and GSTF models.</p></details> |  |
| **[SOAP: Enhancing Spatio-Temporal Relation and Motion Information Capturing for Few-Shot Action Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16344v3)** | 2024-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High frame-rate (HFR) videos of action recognition improve fine-grained expression while reducing the spatio-temporal relation and motion information density. Thus, large amounts of video samples are continuously required for traditional data-driven training. However, samples are not always sufficient in real-world scenarios, promoting few-shot action recognition (FSAR) research. We observe that most recent FSAR works build spatio-temporal relation of video samples via temporal alignment after spatial feature extraction, cutting apart spatial and temporal features within samples. They also capture motion information via narrow perspectives between adjacent frames without considering density, leading to insufficient motion information capturing. Therefore, we propose a novel plug-and-play architecture for FSAR called Spatio-tempOral frAme tuPle enhancer (SOAP) in this paper. The model we designed with such architecture refers to SOAP-Net. Temporal connections between different feature channels and spatio-temporal relation of features are considered instead of simple feature extraction. Comprehensive motion information is also captured, using frame tuples with multiple frames containing more motion information than adjacent frames. Combining frame tuples of diverse frame counts further provides a broader perspective. SOAP-Net achieves new state-of-the-art performance across well-known benchmarks such as SthSthV2, Kinetics, UCF101, and HMDB51. Extensive empirical evaluations underscore the competitiveness, pluggability, generalization, and robustness of SOAP.

We formalize and explore an understudied cross-modal transfer setting we term Unsupervised Modality Adaptation (UMA), where the modality used in testing is not used in supervised training, i.e. zero labeled instances of the test modality are available during training. We develop three methods to perform UMA: Student-Teacher (ST), Contrastive Alignment (CA), and Cross-modal Transfer Through Time (C3T). Our extensive experiments on various camera+IMU datasets compare these methods to each other in the UMA setting, and to their empirical upper bound in the supervised setting. The results indicate C3T is the most robust and highest performing by at least a margin of 8%, and nears the supervised setting performance even in the presence of temporal noise. This method introduces a novel mechanism for aligning signals across time-varying latent vectors, extracted from the receptive field of temporal convolutions. Our findings suggest that C3T has significant potential for developing generalizable models for time-series sensor data, opening new avenues for multi-modal learning in various applications.</p></details> |  |

Traditional optimization methods reach their limits when confronted with the real-world complexity of VRPs, which involve numerous constraints and objectives. Recently, the ability of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) to solve combinatorial tasks, known as Neural Combinatorial Optimization (NCO), demonstrated promising results, offering new perspectives. In this study, we propose an NCO approach to solve a time-constrained capacitated VRP with a finite vehicle fleet size. The approach is based on an encoder-decoder architecture, formulated in line with the Policy Optimization with Multiple Optima (POMO) protocol and trained via a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm. We successfully trained the policy with multiple objectives (minimizing the total distance while maximizing vehicle utilization) and evaluated it on medium and large instances, benchmarking it against state-of-the-art heuristics. The method is able to find adequate and cost-efficient solutions, showing both flexibility and robust generalization. Finally, we provide a critical analysis of the solution generated by NCO and discuss the challenges and opportunities of this new branch of intelligent learning algorithms emerging in optimization science, focusing on freight transportation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Affil...</summary><p>Affiliation: German Aerospace Center (DLR), Institute of Transport Research, Rudower Chaussee 7, 12489 Berlin Correspondence: Elija.deineko@dlr.de</p></details> |

Consequently, recent research efforts have focused on developing pre-trained TS forecasting models. These models, whether built from scratch or adapted from large language models (LLMs), excel in zero/few-shot forecasting tasks. However, they are limited by slow performance, high computational demands, and neglect of cross-channel and exogenous correlations. To address this, we introduce Tiny Time Mixers (TTM), a compact model (starting from 1M parameters) with effective transfer learning capabilities, trained exclusively on public TS datasets. TTM, based on the light-weight TSMixer architecture, incorporates innovations like adaptive patching, diverse resolution sampling, and resolution prefix tuning to handle pre-training on varied dataset resolutions with minimal model capacity. Additionally, it employs multi-level modeling to capture channel correlations and infuse exogenous signals during fine-tuning. TTM outperforms existing popular benchmarks in zero/few-shot forecasting by (4-40%), while reducing computational requirements significantly. Moreover, TTMs are lightweight and can be executed even on CPU-only machines, enhancing usability and fostering wider adoption in resource-constrained environments. The model weights for reproducibility and research use are available at https://huggingface.co/ibm/ttm-research-r2/, while enterprise-use weights under the Apache license can be accessed as follows: the initial TTM-Q variant at https://huggingface.co/ibm-granite/granite-timeseries-ttm-r1, and the latest variants (TTM-B, TTM-E, TTM-A) weights are available at https://huggingface.co/ibm-granite/granite-timeseries-ttm-r2.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 38th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2024)</p></details> |

Current deep learning methods often fail to adequately capture long-range dependencies and complex inter-variable relationships, especially under real-time processing constraints. These limitations arise as many models are optimized for either short-term forecasting with limited receptive fields or long-term accuracy at the cost of efficiency. Additionally, dynamic and intricate interactions between variables in real-world data further complicate modeling efforts. To address these limitations, we propose EffiCANet, an Efficient Convolutional Attention Network designed to enhance forecasting accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency. EffiCANet integrates three key components: (1) a Temporal Large-kernel Decomposed Convolution (TLDC) module that captures long-term temporal dependencies while reducing computational overhead; (2) an Inter-Variable Group Convolution (IVGC) module that captures complex and evolving relationships among variables; and (3) a Global Temporal-Variable Attention (GTVA) mechanism that prioritizes critical temporal and inter-variable features. Extensive evaluations across nine benchmark datasets show that EffiCANet achieves the maximum reduction of 10.02% in MAE over state-of-the-art models, while cutting computational costs by 26.2% relative to conventional large-kernel convolution methods, thanks to its efficient decomposition strategy.</p></details> |  |

Traditional methods for extracting knowledge from these graphs often depend on feature engineering or deep learning. Feature engineering is limited by the manual and time-intensive nature of crafting features, while deep learning approaches suffer from high inference latency, making them impractical for real-time applications. This paper introduces Deep-Graph-Sprints (DGS), a novel deep learning architecture designed for efficient representation learning on CTDGs with low-latency inference requirements. We benchmark DGS against state-of-the-art (SOTA) feature engineering and graph neural network methods using five diverse datasets. The results indicate that DGS achieves competitive performance while inference speed improves between 4x and 12x compared to other deep learning approaches on our benchmark datasets. Our method effectively bridges the gap between deep representation learning and low-latency application requirements for CTDGs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Peri-midFormer: Periodic Pyramid Transformer for Time Series Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04554v1)** | 2024-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series analysis finds wide applications in fields such as weather forecasting, anomaly detection, and behavior recognition. Previous methods attempted to model temporal variations directly using 1D time series. However, this has been quite challenging due to the discrete nature of data points in time series and the complexity of periodic variation. In terms of periodicity, taking weather and traffic data as an example, there are multi-periodic variations such as yearly, monthly, weekly, and daily, etc. In order to break through the limitations of the previous methods, we decouple the implied complex periodic variations into inclusion and overlap relationships among different level periodic components based on the observation of the multi-periodicity therein and its inclusion relationships. This explicitly represents the naturally occurring pyramid-like properties in time series, where the top level is the original time series and lower levels consist of periodic components with gradually shorter periods, which we call the periodic pyramid. To further extract complex temporal variations, we introduce self-attention mechanism into the periodic pyramid, capturing complex periodic relationships by computing attention between periodic components based on their inclusion, overlap, and adjacency relationships. Our proposed Peri-midFormer demonstrates outstanding performance in five mainstream time series analysis tasks, including short- and long-term forecasting, imputation, classification, and anomaly detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>38th ...</summary><p>38th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2024)</p></details> |

A newly developed quantum Gibbs sampling algorithm by Chen, Kastoryano, and Gily\'en provides an efficient simulation of the detailed-balanced dissipative dynamics of non-commutative quantum systems. The running time of this algorithm depends on the mixing time of the corresponding quantum Markov chain, which has not been rigorously bounded except in the high-temperature regime. In this work, we establish a polylog(n) upper bound on its mixing time for various families of random n by n sparse Hamiltonians at any constant temperature. We further analyze how the choice of the jump operators for the algorithm and the spectral properties of these sparse Hamiltonians influence the mixing time. Our result places this method for Gibbs sampling on par with other efficient algorithms for preparing low-energy states of quantumly easy Hamiltonians.</p></details> | 31 pages, 1 figure |

The abundance of real-time video traffic is evident in the popularity of applications like video conferencing and video streaming of live events, which have increased significantly since the recent pandemic. We model the problem as a joint optimization of resource allocation for the clients and bandwidth sharing across the operators, with special attention to how the resource allocation impacts clients' perceived video quality. We propose an online policy as a solution, which involves dynamically sharing a portion of one operator's bandwidth with another operator. We provide strong theoretical optimality guarantees for the policy. We also use extensive simulations to demonstrate the policy's substantial performance improvements (of up to ninety percent), and identify insights into key system parameters (e.g., imbalance in arrival rates or channel conditions of the operators) that dictate the improvements.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2211.06666</p></details> |
| **[BendVLM: Test-Time Debiasing of Vision-Language Embeddings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04420v1)** | 2024-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language model (VLM) embeddings have been shown to encode biases present in their training data, such as societal biases that prescribe negative characteristics to members of various racial and gender identities. VLMs are being quickly adopted for a variety of tasks ranging from few-shot classification to text-guided image generation, making debiasing VLM embeddings crucial. Debiasing approaches that fine-tune the VLM often suffer from catastrophic forgetting. On the other hand, fine-tuning-free methods typically utilize a "one-size-fits-all" approach that assumes that correlation with the spurious attribute can be explained using a single linear direction across all possible inputs. In this work, we propose Bend-VLM, a nonlinear, fine-tuning-free approach for VLM embedding debiasing that tailors the debiasing operation to each unique input. This allows for a more flexible debiasing approach. Additionally, we do not require knowledge of the set of inputs a priori to inference time, making our method more appropriate for online, open-set tasks such as retrieval and text guided image generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Concatenator: A Bayesian Approach To Real Time Concatenative Musaicing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04366v1)** | 2024-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present ``The Concatenator,'' a real time system for audio-guided concatenative synthesis. Similarly to Driedger et al.'s ``musaicing'' (or ``audio mosaicing'') technique, we concatenate a set number of windows within a corpus of audio to re-create the harmonic and percussive aspects of a target audio stream. Unlike Driedger's NMF-based technique, however, we instead use an explicitly Bayesian point of view, where corpus window indices are hidden states and the target audio stream is an observation. We use a particle filter to infer the best hidden corpus states in real-time. Our transition model includes a tunable parameter to control the time-continuity of corpus grains, and our observation model allows users to prioritize how quickly windows change to match the target. Because the computational complexity of the system is independent of the corpus size, our system scales to corpora that are hours long, which is an important feature in the age of vast audio data collections. Within The Concatenator module itself, composers can vary grain length, fit to target, and pitch shift in real time while reacting to the sounds they hear, enabling them to rapidly iterate ideas. To conclude our work, we evaluate our system with extensive quantitative tests of the effects of parameters, as well as a qualitative evaluation with artistic insights. Based on the quality of the results, we believe the real-time capability unlocks new avenues for musical expression and control, suitable for live performance and modular synthesis integration, which furthermore represents an essential breakthrough in concatenative synthesis technology.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 6 figures, Accepted for Publication in The International Society for Music Information Retrieval Proceedings, 2024</p></details> |

Despite diverse modeling techniques, existing models are black boxes and fail to provide insights and explanations about their representations. In this paper, we present VQShape, a pre-trained, generalizable, and interpretable model for time-series representation learning and classification. By introducing a novel representation for time-series data, we forge a connection between the latent space of VQShape and shape-level features. Using vector quantization, we show that time-series from different domains can be described using a unified set of low-dimensional codes, where each code can be represented as an abstracted shape in the time domain. On classification tasks, we show that the representations of VQShape can be utilized to build interpretable classifiers, achieving comparable performance to specialist models. Additionally, in zero-shot learning, VQShape and its codebook can generalize to previously unseen datasets and domains that are not included in the pre-training process. The code and pre-trained weights are available at https://github.com/YunshiWen/VQShape.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS) 2024</p></details> |

Temporal difference (TD) learning, a common reinforcement learning technique, may reduce variance by generalising learning to the pattern of state transitions rather than terminal outcomes. However, in healthcare this method requires several strong assumptions about patient states, and there appears to be limited literature evaluating the performance of TD learning against traditional supervised learning methods for long-term health outcome prediction tasks. In this study, we define a framework for applying TD learning to real-time irregularly sampled time series data using a Semi-Markov Reward Process. We evaluate the model framework in predicting intensive care mortality and show that TD learning under this framework can result in improved model robustness compared to standard supervised learning methods. and that this robustness is maintained even when validated on external datasets. This approach may offer a more reliable method when learning to predict patient outcomes using high-variance irregular time series data.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be published in the Proceedings of the 4th Machine Learning for Health symposium, Proceedings of Machine Learning Research (PMLR)</p></details> |

A Graphical Search Problem (GSP), denoted $\Pi(G[X],\gamma)$, consists of finding $Y$, where $Y \subseteq X$ and $Y$ satisfies the predicate $\gamma$ in $G$. The subset $Y$ is a solution of the problem $\Pi(G[X],\gamma)$. A sub-solution of $\Pi(G[X],\gamma)$ is a subset $Y'$ such that $Y'$ is not a solution of $\Pi(G[X],\gamma)$, but $Y'$ is a solution of the problem $\Pi(H[X'],\gamma)$, where $X' \subset X$ and $H[X']$ is a contraction-minor of $G[X]$. Solutions and sub-solutions are the feasible sets of $\Pi(G[X],\gamma)$. Let $\mathcal{I}$ be the family of all the feasible sets of $\Pi(G[X],\gamma)$. A Hyper-greedoid is a set system $(X, \mathcal{I})$ satisfying the following axioms. A1: Accessibility: if $I \in \mathcal{I}$, there is an element $x \in I$ such that $I-x \in \mathcal{I}$ A2: Augmentability: If $I$ is a sub-solution, there is a polynomial time function $\kappa: \mathcal{I} \rightarrow \mathcal{I}$ and there is a element $x \in X-\kappa(I)$ such that $\kappa(I) \cup x \in \mathcal{I}$. That is, every sub-solution can be augmented using a polynomial time algorithm akin to Edmond Augmenting Path Algorithm. Given a graph $G$, the GSP MIS consists of finding an independent set of vertices of $G$. MIS satisfies axioms A1 and A2. Using the P-completeness of the Decision Problem associated to MIS, we prove that every GSP that satisfies A1 is solvable in Polynomial Time if and only if it satisfies A2. On the other hand, let HCP be the GSP that consists of finding a Hamiltonian cycle of the graph $G$. HCP satisfies A1, but does not satisfies A2. Since the Decision Problem associated with HCP is NP-Complete, we get $P \not = NP$.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generative Discrete Event Process Simulation for Hidden Markov Models to Predict Competitor Time-to-Market](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04266v1)** | 2024-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the challenge of predicting the time at which a competitor product, such as a novel high-capacity EV battery or a new car model, will be available to customers; as new information is obtained, this time-to-market estimate is revised. Our scenario is as follows: We assume that the product is under development at a Firm B, which is a competitor to Firm A; as they are in the same industry, Firm A has a relatively good understanding of the processes and steps required to produce the product. While Firm B tries to keep its activities hidden (think of stealth-mode for start-ups), Firm A is nevertheless able to gain periodic insights by observing what type of resources Firm B is using. We show how Firm A can build a model that predicts when Firm B will be ready to sell its product; the model leverages knowledge of the underlying processes and required resources to build a Parallel Discrete Simulation (PDES)-based process model that it then uses as a generative model to train a Hidden Markov Model (HMM). We study the question of how many resource observations Firm A requires in order to accurately assess the current state of development at Firm B. In order to gain general insights into the capabilities of this approach, we study the effect of different process graph densities, different densities of the resource-activity maps, etc., and also scaling properties as we increase the number resource counts. We find that in most cases, the HMM achieves a prediction accuracy of 70 to 80 percent after 20 (daily) observations of a production process that lasts 150 days on average and we characterize the effects of different problem instance densities on this prediction accuracy. Our results give insight into the level of market knowledge required for accurate and early time-to-market prediction.</p></details> |  |
| **[Age of Gossip With Time-Varying Topologies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04114v1)** | 2024-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider a gossiping network, where a source node sends updates to a network of $n$ gossiping nodes. Meanwhile, the connectivity topology of the gossiping network changes over time, among a finite number of connectivity ''states,'' such as the fully connected graph, the ring graph, the grid graph, etc. The transition of the connectivity graph among the possible options is governed by a finite state continuous time Markov chain (CTMC). When the CTMC is in a particular state, the associated graph topology of the gossiping network is in the way indicated by that state. We evaluate the impact of time-varying graph topologies on the freshness of information for nodes in the network. We use the version age of information metric to quantify the freshness of information at the nodes. Using a method similar to the first passage percolation method, we show that, if one of the states of the CTMC is the fully connected graph and the transition rates of the CTMC are constant, then the version age of a typical node in the network scales logarithmically with the number of nodes, as in the case if the network was always fully connected. That is, there is no loss in the age scaling, even if the network topology deviates from full connectivity, in this setting. We perform numerical simulations and analyze more generally how having different topologies and different CTMC rates (that might depend on the number of nodes) affect the average version age scaling of a node in the gossiping network.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reproducible Hybrid Time-Travel Retrieval in Evolving Corpora](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04051v1)** | 2024-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There are settings in which reproducibility of ranked lists is desirable, such as when extracting a subset of an evolving document corpus for downstream research tasks or in domains such as patent retrieval or in medical systematic reviews, with high reproducibility expectations. However, as global term statistics change when documents change or are added to a corpus, queries using typical ranked retrieval models are not even reproducible for the parts of the document corpus that have not changed. Thus, Boolean retrieval frequently remains the mechanism of choice in such settings. We present a hybrid retrieval system combining Lucene for fast retrieval with a column-store-based retrieval system maintaining a versioned and time-stamped index. The latter component allows re-execution of previously posed queries resulting in the same ranked list and further allows for time-travel queries over evolving collection, as web archives, while maintaining the original ranking. Thus, retrieval results in evolving document collections are fully reproducible even when document collections and thus term statistics change.</p></details> |  |
| **[Space-Time Spectral Element Tensor Network Approach for Time Dependent Convection Diffusion Reaction Equation with Variable Coefficients](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04026v1)** | 2024-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we present a new space-time Petrov-Galerkin-like method. This method utilizes a mixed formulation of Tensor Train (TT) and Quantized Tensor Train (QTT), designed for the spectral element discretization (Q1-SEM) of the time-dependent convection-diffusion-reaction (CDR) equation. We reformulate the assembly process of the spectral element discretized CDR to enhance its compatibility with tensor operations and introduce a low-rank tensor structure for the spectral element operators. Recognizing the banded structure inherent in the spectral element framework's discrete operators, we further exploit the QTT format of the CDR to achieve greater speed and compression. Additionally, we present a comprehensive approach for integrating variable coefficients of CDR into the global discrete operators within the TT/QTT framework. The effectiveness of the proposed method, in terms of memory efficiency and computational complexity, is demonstrated through a series of numerical experiments, including a semi-linear example.</p></details> |  |

Historically, discrete-time filters and smoothers have been the dominant approach, in which the estimated variables are states at discrete sample times. The paradigm of continuous-time state estimation proposes an alternative strategy by estimating variables that express the state as a continuous function of time, which can be evaluated at any query time. Not only can this benefit downstream tasks such as planning and control, but it also significantly increases estimator performance and flexibility, as well as reduces sensor preprocessing and interfacing complexity. Despite this, continuous-time methods remain underutilized, potentially because they are less well-known within robotics. To remedy this, this work presents a unifying formulation of these methods and the most exhaustive literature review to date, systematically categorizing prior work by methodology, application, state variables, historical context, and theoretical contribution to the field. By surveying splines and Gaussian processes together and contextualizing works from other research domains, this work identifies and analyzes open problems in continuous-time state estimation and suggests new research directions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Robotics (T-RO)</p></details> |
| **[$hp$-Version space-time discontinuous Galerkin methods for parabolic problems on prismatic meshes](http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.01212v3)** | 2024-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a new $hp$-version space-time discontinuous Galerkin (dG) finite element method for the numerical approximation of parabolic evolution equations on general spatial meshes consisting of polygonal/polyhedral (polytopic) elements, giving rise to prismatic space-time elements. A key feature of the proposed method is the use of space-time elemental polynomial bases of \emph{total} degree, say $p$, defined in the physical coordinate system, as opposed to standard dG-time-stepping methods whereby spatial elemental bases are tensorized with temporal basis functions. This approach leads to a fully discrete $hp$-dG scheme using less degrees of freedom for each time step, compared to standard dG time-stepping schemes employing tensorized space-time, with acceptable deterioration of the approximation properties. A second key feature of the new space-time dG method is the incorporation of very general spatial meshes consisting of possibly polygonal/polyhedral elements with \emph{arbitrary} number of faces. A priori error bounds are shown for the proposed method in various norms. An extensive comparison among the new space-time dG method, the (standard) tensorized space-time dG methods, the classical dG-time-stepping, and conforming finite element method in space, is presented in a series of numerical experiments.</p></details> |  |

Deep-learning based segmentation or tracking methods rely on large amount of high quality annotations to work effectively. In this work, we explore an alternative solution: using feature maps obtained from self-supervised representation learning (SSRL) on time arrow prediction (TAP) for the downstream supervised task of cell event recognition. We demonstrate through extensive experiments and analysis that this approach can achieve better performance with limited annotation compared to models trained from end to end using fully supervised approach. Our analysis also provides insight into applications of the SSRL using TAP in live-cell microscopy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Almost Time-Optimal Loosely-Stabilizing Leader Election on Arbitrary Graphs Without Identifiers in Population Protocols](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03902v1)** | 2024-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The population protocol model is a computational model for passive mobile agents. We address the leader election problem, which determines a unique leader on arbitrary communication graphs starting from any configuration. Unfortunately, self-stabilizing leader election is impossible to be solved without knowing the exact number of agents; thus, we consider loosely-stabilizing leader election, which converges to safe configurations in a relatively short time, and holds the specification (maintains a unique leader) for a relatively long time. When agents have unique identifiers, Sudo et al.(2019) proposed a protocol that, given an upper bound $N$ for the number of agents $n$, converges in $O(mN\log n)$ expected steps, where $m$ is the number of edges. When unique identifiers are not required, they also proposed a protocol that, using random numbers and given $N$, converges in $O(mN^2\log{N})$ expected steps. Both protocols have a holding time of $\Omega(e^{2N})$ expected steps and use $O(\log{N})$ bits of memory. They also showed that the lower bound of the convergence time is $\Omega(mN)$ expected steps for protocols with a holding time of $\Omega(e^N)$ expected steps given $N$. In this paper, we propose protocols that do not require unique identifiers. These protocols achieve convergence times close to the lower bound with increasing memory usage. Specifically, given $N$ and an upper bound $\Delta$ for the maximum degree, we propose two protocols whose convergence times are $O(mN\log n)$ and $O(mN\log N)$ both in expectation and with high probability. The former protocol uses random numbers, while the latter does not require them. Both protocols utilize $O(\Delta \log N)$ bits of memory and hold the specification for $\Omega(e^{2N})$ expected steps.</p></details> |  |

To uniformly predict 1D and 2D time series, we generalize next token prediction, predominantly adopted for causal generation of 1D sequences, to multivariate next token prediction. The proposed paradigm uniformly formulates various forecasting scenarios as a long-context generation problem. We opt for the generative Transformer, which can capture global-range and causal dependencies while providing contextual flexibility, to implement unified forecasting on univariate series characterized by non-stationarity, multivariate time series with complicated dynamics and correlations, and covariate-informed contexts that include both endogenous and exogenous variables. Technically, we propose a universal TimeAttention to facilitate generative Transformers on time series, which can effectively capture fine-grained intra- and inter-series dependencies of flattened time series tokens (patches) and is further strengthened by position embeddings in both temporal and variable dimensions. Timer-XL achieves state-of-the-art performance across challenging forecasting benchmarks through a unified approach. As a large time series model, it demonstrates notable model transferability by large-scale pre-training, as well as contextual flexibility in token lengths, positioning it as a one-for-all forecaster.</p></details> |  |

Our work introduces a variational approach for fermionic time-dependent wave functions, surpassing mean-field approximations by accurately capturing many-body correlations. Therefore, we employ time-dependent Jastrow factors and backflow transformations, which are enhanced through neural networks parameterizations. To compute the optimal time-dependent parameters, we utilize the time-dependent variational Monte Carlo technique and a new method based on Taylor-root expansions of the propagator, enhancing the accuracy of our simulations. The approach is demonstrated in three distinct systems. In all cases, we show clear signatures of many-body correlations in the dynamics. The results showcase the ability of our variational approach to accurately capture the time evolution, providing insight into the quantum dynamics of interacting electronic systems, beyond the capabilities of mean-field.</p></details> |  |

Our evaluation explores how varying constraints impact the definition of trigger-events and evaluates the eye-tracking signal quality of defined trigger-events. Results show that while the dispersion threshold-based algorithm identifies trigger-events more accurately, the Kalman filter-based classification algorithm performs better in eye-tracking signal quality, as demonstrated through a user-centric quality assessment using user- and error-percentile tiers. Despite median user-level performance showing minor differences across algorithms, significant variability in signal quality across participants highlights the importance of algorithm selection to ensure system reliability.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages including supplementary materials</p></details> |

Today's techniques serving this purpose primarily focus on reducing latency and improving throughput through algorithmic and hardware enhancements, while largely overlooking their privacy side effects, particularly in a multi-user environment. In our research, for the first time, we discovered a set of new timing side channels in LLM systems, arising from shared caches and GPU memory allocations, which can be exploited to infer both confidential system prompts and those issued by other users. These vulnerabilities echo security challenges observed in traditional computing systems, highlighting an urgent need to address potential information leakage in LLM serving infrastructures. In this paper, we report novel attack strategies designed to exploit such timing side channels inherent in LLM deployments, specifically targeting the Key-Value (KV) cache and semantic cache widely used to enhance LLM inference performance. Our approach leverages timing measurements and classification models to detect cache hits, allowing an adversary to infer private prompts with high accuracy. We also propose a token-by-token search algorithm to efficiently recover shared prompt prefixes in the caches, showing the feasibility of stealing system prompts and those produced by peer users. Our experimental studies on black-box testing of popular online LLM services demonstrate that such privacy risks are completely realistic, with significant consequences. Our findings underscore the need for robust mitigation to protect LLM systems against such emerging threats.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work was submitted for review on Sept. 5, 2024, and the initial version was uploaded to Arxiv on Sept. 30, 2024</p></details> |
| **[An efficient scheme for approximating long-time dynamics of a class of non-linear models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03689v1)** | 2024-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a novel, highly efficient, second-order accurate, long-time unconditionally stable numerical scheme for a class of finite-dimensional nonlinear models that are of importance in geophysical fluid dynamics. The scheme is highly efficient in the sense that only a (fixed) symmetric positive definite linear problem (with varying right hand sides) is involved at each time-step. The solutions to the scheme are uniformly bounded for all time. We show that the scheme is able to capture the long-time dynamics of the underlying geophysical model, with the global attractors as well as the invariant measures of the scheme converge to those of the original model as the step size approaches zero. In our numerical experiments, we take an indirect approach, using long-term statistics to approximate the invariant measures. Our results suggest that the convergence rate of the long-term statistics, as a function of terminal time, is approximately first order using the Jensen-Shannon metric and half-order using the L1 metric. This implies that very long time simulation is needed in order to capture a few significant digits of long time statistics (climate) correct. Nevertheless, the second order scheme's performance remains superior to that of the first order one, requiring significantly less time to reach a small neighborhood of statistical equilibrium for a given step size.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Model Adaptation at Test Time: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03687v1)** | 2024-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine learning algorithms have achieved remarkable success across various disciplines, use cases and applications, under the prevailing assumption that training and test samples are drawn from the same distribution. Consequently, these algorithms struggle and become brittle even when samples in the test distribution start to deviate from the ones observed during training. Domain adaptation and domain generalization have been studied extensively as approaches to address distribution shifts across test and train domains, but each has its limitations. Test-time adaptation, a recently emerging learning paradigm, combines the benefits of domain adaptation and domain generalization by training models only on source data and adapting them to target data during test-time inference. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive and systematic review on test-time adaptation, covering more than 400 recent papers. We structure our review by categorizing existing methods into five distinct categories based on what component of the method is adjusted for test-time adaptation: the model, the inference, the normalization, the sample, or the prompt, providing detailed analysis of each. We further discuss the various preparation and adaptation settings for methods within these categories, offering deeper insights into the effective deployment for the evaluation of distribution shifts and their real-world application in understanding images, video and 3D, as well as modalities beyond vision. We close the survey with an outlook on emerging research opportunities for test-time adaptation.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Similarity to Superiority: Channel Clustering for Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01340v2)** | 2024-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting has attracted significant attention in recent decades. Previous studies have demonstrated that the Channel-Independent (CI) strategy improves forecasting performance by treating different channels individually, while it leads to poor generalization on unseen instances and ignores potentially necessary interactions between channels. Conversely, the Channel-Dependent (CD) strategy mixes all channels with even irrelevant and indiscriminate information, which, however, results in oversmoothing issues and limits forecasting accuracy. There is a lack of channel strategy that effectively balances individual channel treatment for improved forecasting performance without overlooking essential interactions between channels. Motivated by our observation of a correlation between the time series model's performance boost against channel mixing and the intrinsic similarity on a pair of channels, we developed a novel and adaptable Channel Clustering Module (CCM). CCM dynamically groups channels characterized by intrinsic similarities and leverages cluster information instead of individual channel identities, combining the best of CD and CI worlds. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that CCM can (1) boost the performance of CI and CD models by an average margin of 2.4% and 7.2% on long-term and short-term forecasting, respectively; (2) enable zero-shot forecasting with mainstream time series forecasting models; (3) uncover intrinsic time series patterns among channels and improve interpretability of complex time series models.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2024 |

Our construction utilizes constant-rate quantum locally testable codes (qLTC), new fault-tolerant gadgets on qLTCs and qLDPC codes, and a new analysis framework. In particular, 1) we develop a new simple and self-contained construction of magic state distillation for qubits using qudit quantum Reed-Solomon codes with $(\log \frac{1}{\varepsilon})^{\gamma}$ spacetime overhead, where $\gamma \rightarrow 0$. 2) We prove that the recent family of almost-good qLTCs of Dinur-Lin-Vidick admit parallel single-shot decoders against adversarial errors of weight scaling with the code distance. 3) We develop logical state preparation and logical gate procedures with $\widetilde{O}(1)$-spacetime overhead on qLTCs. 4) To combine these ingredients, we introduce a new framework of fault tolerance analysis called the weight enumerator formalism. The framework permits easy formal composition of fault-tolerant gadgets, so we expect it to be of independent interest. Our work gives the lowest spacetime overhead to date, which, for the first time, matches that of classical fault tolerance up to sub-polylog factors. We conjecture this is optimal up to sub-polylog factors.</p></details> |  |

However, existing systems primarily focus on offline scenarios, overlooking the distinct requirements of online applications that necessitate real-time insertion of new vectors. This limitation renders such systems inefficient for real-world scenarios. Moreover, previous architectures struggled to effectively support real-time insertion due to their reliance on serial execution streams. In this paper, we introduce a novel Real-Time Adaptive Multi-Stream GPU ANNS System (RTAMS-GANNS). Our architecture achieves its objectives through three key advancements: 1) We initially examined the real-time insertion mechanisms in existing GPU ANNS systems and discovered their reliance on repetitive copying and memory allocation, which significantly hinders real-time effectiveness on GPUs. As a solution, we introduce a dynamic vector insertion algorithm based on memory blocks, which includes in-place rearrangement. 2) To enable real-time vector insertion in parallel, we introduce a multi-stream parallel execution mode, which differs from existing systems that operate serially within a single stream. Our system utilizes a dynamic resource pool, allowing multiple streams to execute concurrently without additional execution blocking. 3) Through extensive experiments and comparisons, our approach effectively handles varying QPS levels across different datasets, reducing latency by up to 40%-80%. The proposed system has also been deployed in real-world industrial search and recommendation systems, serving hundreds of millions of users daily, and has achieved good results.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CIKM'24, V2 fixes some typos</p></details> |

Since humanoid robots are inherently underactuated thanks to unilateral ground contacts, a path is considered safe if it is obstacle-free and respects the robot's physical limitations and underlying dynamics. Existing approaches often decouple path planning from gait control due to the significant computational challenge caused by the full-order robot dynamics. In this work, we develop a unified, safe path and gait planning framework that can be evaluated online in real-time, allowing the robot to navigate clustered environments while sustaining stable locomotion. Our approach uses the popular Linear Inverted Pendulum (LIP) model as a template model to represent walking dynamics. It incorporates heading angles in the model to evaluate kinematic constraints essential for physically feasible gaits properly. In addition, we leverage discrete control barrier functions (DCBF) for obstacle avoidance, ensuring that the subsequent foot placement provides a safe navigation path within clustered environments. To guarantee real-time computation, we use a novel approximation of the DCBF to produce linear DCBF (LDCBF) constraints. We validate the proposed approach in simulation using a Digit robot in randomly generated environments. The results demonstrate that our approach can generate safe gaits for a non-trivial humanoid robot to navigate environments with randomly generated obstacles in real-time.</p></details> | 7 pages, 10 figures |

We also establish general lower bounds based on certain universal properties of slowly varying functions and the relationship between the Wasserstein and Toscani--Fourier distances of the marginals. Our upper and lower bounds typically have matching rates. In particular, the rate of convergence is polynomial for the domain of normal attraction and slower than a slowly varying function for the domain of non-normal attraction.</p></details> | <details><summary>42 pa...</summary><p>42 pages, 2 figures, for a short YouTube video describing the results, see https://youtu.be/76eJD6a8Kko?si=5OkdWw4AiNp0P1po</p></details> |
| **[From Medprompt to o1: Exploration of Run-Time Strategies for Medical Challenge Problems and Beyond](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03590v1)** | 2024-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Run-time steering strategies like Medprompt are valuable for guiding large language models (LLMs) to top performance on challenging tasks. Medprompt demonstrates that a general LLM can be focused to deliver state-of-the-art performance on specialized domains like medicine by using a prompt to elicit a run-time strategy involving chain of thought reasoning and ensembling. OpenAI's o1-preview model represents a new paradigm, where a model is designed to do run-time reasoning before generating final responses. We seek to understand the behavior of o1-preview on a diverse set of medical challenge problem benchmarks. Following on the Medprompt study with GPT-4, we systematically evaluate the o1-preview model across various medical benchmarks. Notably, even without prompting techniques, o1-preview largely outperforms the GPT-4 series with Medprompt. We further systematically study the efficacy of classic prompt engineering strategies, as represented by Medprompt, within the new paradigm of reasoning models. We found that few-shot prompting hinders o1's performance, suggesting that in-context learning may no longer be an effective steering approach for reasoning-native models. While ensembling remains viable, it is resource-intensive and requires careful cost-performance optimization. Our cost and accuracy analysis across run-time strategies reveals a Pareto frontier, with GPT-4o representing a more affordable option and o1-preview achieving state-of-the-art performance at higher cost. Although o1-preview offers top performance, GPT-4o with steering strategies like Medprompt retains value in specific contexts. Moreover, we note that the o1-preview model has reached near-saturation on many existing medical benchmarks, underscoring the need for new, challenging benchmarks. We close with reflections on general directions for inference-time computation with LLMs.</p></details> | 25 pages |

In this paper, we propose a new deep learning framework for probabilistic interpolation of irregularly sampled time series that we call the Heteroscedastic Temporal Variational Autoencoder (HeTVAE). HeTVAE includes a novel input layer to encode information about input observation sparsity, a temporal VAE architecture to propagate uncertainty due to input sparsity, and a heteroscedastic output layer to enable variable uncertainty in output interpolations. Our results show that the proposed architecture is better able to reflect variable uncertainty through time due to sparse and irregular sampling than a range of baseline and traditional models, as well as recently proposed deep latent variable models that use homoscedastic output layers.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR) 2022</p></details> |

This paper introduces an open-source computational framework designed for real-time analysis of HRTEM data, with a focus on characterizing complex microstructures in conjugated polymers, and illustrated using Poly[N-9$'$-heptadecanyl-2,7-carbazole-alt-5,5-(4$'$,7$'$-di-2-thienyl-2$'$,1$'$,3$'$-benzothiadiazole)] (PCDTBT), a key material in organic photovoltaics. The framework employs fast, automated image processing algorithms, enabling rapid extraction of structural features like \textit{d}-spacing, orientation, and shape metrics. Gaussian process optimization rapidly identifies the user-defined parameters in the approach, reducing the need for manual parameter tuning and thus enhancing reproducibility and usability. Additionally, the framework is compatible with high-performance computing (HPC) environments, allowing for efficient, large-scale data processing at near real-time speeds. A unique feature of the framework is a Wasserstein distance-based stopping criterion, which optimizes data collection by determining when further sampling no longer adds statistically significant information. This capability optimizes the amount of time the TEM facility is used while ensuring data adequacy for in-depth analysis. Open-source and tested on a substantial PCDTBT dataset, this tool offers a powerful, robust, and accessible solution for high-throughput material characterization in organic electronics.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 9 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

This paper introduces a novel methodology that considers the dynamic influence of an environmental flow field and considers geometric constraints, including obstacles and forbidden zones, enriching the complexity of the planning problem. We formulate it as a multi-objective optimal control problem, propose a novel transformation called Harmonic Transformation, and apply a semi-Lagrangian scheme to solve it. The set of Pareto efficient solutions is obtained considering two distinct approaches: a deterministic method and an evolutionary-based one, both of which are designed to make use of the proposed Harmonic Transformation. Through an extensive analysis of these approaches, we demonstrate their efficacy in finding optimized paths.</p></details> | <details><summary>50 pa...</summary><p>50 pages, reviewed version; Preprint submitted to Journal of the Franklin Institute (under review)</p></details> |
| **[A robust first order meshfree method for time-dependent nonlinear conservation laws](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03411v1)** | 2024-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a robust first order accurate meshfree method to numerically solve time-dependent nonlinear conservation laws. The main contribution of this work is the meshfree construction of first order consistent summation by parts differentiations. We describe how to efficiently construct such operators on a point cloud. We then study the performance of such differentiations, and then combine these operators with a numerical flux-based formulation to approximate the solution of nonlinear conservation laws, with focus on the advection equation and the compressible Euler equations. We observe numerically that, while the resulting mesh-free differentiation operators are only $O(h^\frac{1}{2})$ accurate in the $L^2$ norm, they achieve $O(h)$ rates of convergence when applied to the numerical solution of PDEs.</p></details> |  |
| **[A networked small-gain theorem based on discrete-time diagonal stability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03380v1)** | 2024-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a new sufficient condition for finite-gain $L_2$ input-to-output stability of a networked system. The condition requires a matrix, that combines information on the $L_2$ gains of the sub-systems and their interconnections, to be discrete-time diagonally stable (DTDS). We show that the new result generalizes the standard small gain theorem for the negative feedback connection of two sub-systems. An important advantage of the new result is that known sufficient conditions for DTDS can be applied to derive sufficient conditions for networked input-to-output stability. We demonstrate this using several examples. We also derive a new necessary and sufficient condition for a matrix that is a rank one perturbation of a Schur diagonal matrix to be DTDS.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quantum One-Time Protection of any Randomized Algorithm](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03305v1)** | 2024-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The meteoric rise in power and popularity of machine learning models dependent on valuable training data has reignited a basic tension between the power of running a program locally and the risk of exposing details of that program to the user. At the same time, fundamental properties of quantum states offer new solutions to data and program security that can require strikingly few quantum resources to exploit, and offer advantages outside of mere computational run time. In this work, we demonstrate such a solution with quantum one-time tokens. A quantum one-time token is a quantum state that permits a certain program to be evaluated exactly once. One-time security guarantees, roughly, that the token cannot be used to evaluate the program more than once. We propose a scheme for building quantum one-time tokens for any randomized classical program, which include generative AI models. We prove that the scheme satisfies an interesting definition of one-time security as long as outputs of the classical algorithm have high enough min-entropy, in a black box model. Importantly, the classical program being protected does not need to be implemented coherently on a quantum computer. In fact, the size and complexity of the quantum one-time token is independent of the program being protected, and additional quantum resources serve only to increase the security of the protocol. Due to this flexibility in adjusting the security, we believe that our proposal is parsimonious enough to serve as a promising candidate for a near-term useful demonstration of quantum computing in either the NISQ or early fault tolerant regime.</p></details> |  |
| **[Caging in Time: A Framework for Robust Object Manipulation under Uncertainties and Limited Robot Perception](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16481v3)** | 2024-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world object manipulation has been commonly challenged by physical uncertainties and perception limitations. Being an effective strategy, while caging configuration-based manipulation frameworks have successfully provided robust solutions, they are not broadly applicable due to their strict requirements on the availability of multiple robots, widely distributed contacts, or specific geometries of the robots or the objects. To this end, this work proposes a novel concept, termed Caging in Time, to allow caging configurations to be formed even if there is just one robot engaged in a task. This novel concept can be explained by an insight that even if a caging configuration is needed to constrain the motion of an object, only a small portion of the cage is actively manipulating at a time. As such, we can switch the configuration of the robot strategically so that by collapsing its configuration in time, we will see a cage formed and its necessary portion active whenever needed. We instantiate our Caging in Time theory on challenging quasistatic and dynamic manipulation tasks, showing that Caging in Time can be achieved in general state spaces including geometry-based and energy-based spaces. With extensive experiments, we show robust and accurate manipulation, in an open-loop manner, without requiring detailed knowledge of the object geometry or physical properties, nor realtime accurate feedback on the manipulation states. In addition to being an effective and robust open-loop manipulation solution, the proposed theory can be a supplementary strategy to other manipulation systems affected by uncertain or limited robot perception.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 25 figures, video available at: www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ag_jTzazuSM</p></details> |

The key components of the package are (a) two approaches for the estimation of the evolutionary wavelet spectrum in the presence of trend; and (b) wavelet-based trend estimation in the presence of locally stationary wavelet errors via both linear and nonlinear wavelet thresholding; and (c) the calculation of associated pointwise confidence intervals. Lastly, the package directly implements boundary handling methods that enable the methods to be performed on data of arbitrary length, not just dyadic length as is common for wavelet-based methods, ensuring no pre-processing of data is necessary. The key functionality of the package is demonstrated through two data examples, arising from biology and activity monitoring.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Framework for Real-Time Volcano-Seismic Event Recognition Based on Multi-Station Seismograms and Semantic Segmentation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20595v3)** | 2024-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In volcano monitoring, effective recognition of seismic events is essential for understanding volcanic activity and raising timely warning alerts. Traditional methods rely on manual analysis, which can be subjective and labor-intensive. Furthermore, current automatic approaches often tackle detection and classification separately, mostly rely on single station information and generally require tailored preprocessing and representations to perform predictions. These limitations often hinder their application to real-time monitoring and utilization across different volcano conditions. This study introduces a novel approach that utilizes Semantic Segmentation models to automate seismic event recognition by applying a straight forward transformation of multi-channel 1D signals into 2D representations, enabling their use as images. Our framework employs a data-driven, end-to-end design that integrates multi-station seismic data with minimal preprocessing, performing both detection and classification simultaneously for five seismic event classes. We evaluated four state-of-the-art segmentation models (UNet, UNet++, DeepLabV3+ and SwinUNet) on approximately 25.000 seismic events recorded at four different Chilean volcanoes: Nevados del Chill\'an Volcanic Complex, Laguna del Maule, Villarrica and Puyehue-Cord\'on Caulle. Among these models, the UNet architecture was identified as the most effective model, achieving mean F1 and Intersection over Union (IoU) scores of up to 0.91 and 0.88, respectively, and demonstrating superior noise robustness and model flexibility to unseen volcano datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 9 figures.

| **[Fully Dynamic $k$-Median with Near-Optimal Update Time and Recourse](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03121v1)** | 2024-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In metric $k$-clustering, we are given as input a set of $n$ points in a general metric space, and we have to pick $k$ centers and cluster the input points around these chosen centers, so as to minimize an appropriate objective function. In recent years, significant effort has been devoted to the study of metric $k$-clustering problems in a dynamic setting, where the input keeps changing via updates (point insertions/deletions), and we have to maintain a good clustering throughout these updates. The performance of such a dynamic algorithm is measured in terms of three parameters: (i) Approximation ratio, which signifies the quality of the maintained solution, (ii) Recourse, which signifies how stable the maintained solution is, and (iii) Update time, which signifies the efficiency of the algorithm. We consider the metric $k$-median problem, where the objective is the sum of the distances of the points to their nearest centers. We design the first dynamic algorithm for this problem with near-optimal guarantees across all three performance measures (up to a constant factor in approximation ratio, and polylogarithmic factors in recourse and update time). Specifically, we obtain a $O(1)$-approximation algorithm for dynamic metric $k$-median with $\tilde{O}(1)$ recourse and $\tilde{O}(k)$ update time. Prior to our work, the state-of-the-art here was the recent result of [Bhattacharya et al., FOCS'24], who obtained $O(\epsilon^{-1})$-approximation ratio with $\tilde{O}(k^{\epsilon})$ recourse and $\tilde{O}(k^{1+\epsilon})$ update time. We achieve our results by carefully synthesizing the concept of robust centers introduced in [Fichtenberger et al., SODA'21] along with the randomized local search subroutine from [Bhattacharya et al., FOCS'24], in addition to several key technical insights of our own.</p></details> |  |

APM can process patches of an image one at a time in any order asymmetrically and still encode semantic-awareness in the net. We demonstrate APM's ability to recognize out-of-distribution images without dataset-specific pre-training, augmentation or any-pretext task. APM offers competitive performance over existing TTT approaches. To perform TTT, APM just distills test sample's representation once. APM possesses a unique property: it can learn using just this single representation and starts predicting semantically-aware features. APM demostrates potential applications beyond test-time-training: APM can scale up to a dataset of 2D images and yield semantic-clusterings in a single forward pass. APM also provides first empirical evidence towards validating GLOM's insight, i.e. input percept is a field. Therefore, APM helps us converge towards an implementation which can do both interpolation and perception on a shared-connectionist hardware.

Traditional safety monitoring methods, including wearable sensors and GPS, often fail under obstructive or indoor conditions. This research introduces a novel real-time scream detection and localization system tailored for construction sites, especially in low-resource environments. Integrating Wav2Vec2 and Enhanced ConvNet models for accurate scream detection, coupled with the GCC-PHAT algorithm for robust time delay estimation under reverberant conditions, followed by a gradient descent-based approach to achieve precise position estimation in noisy environments. Our approach combines these concepts to achieve high detection accuracy and rapid localization, thereby minimizing false alarms and optimizing emergency response. Preliminary results demonstrate that the system not only accurately detects distress calls amidst construction noise but also reliably identifies the caller's location. This solution represents a substantial improvement in worker safety, with the potential for widespread application across high-risk occupational environments. The scripts used for training, evaluation of scream detection, position estimation, and integrated framework will be released at: https://github.com/Anmol2059/construction_safety.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 14 figures, 1 table, submitted to AIRISE conference</p></details> |
| **[Losing momentum in continuous-time stochastic optimisation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.03705v2)** | 2024-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The training of modern machine learning models often consists in solving high-dimensional non-convex optimisation problems that are subject to large-scale data. In this context, momentum-based stochastic optimisation algorithms have become particularly widespread. The stochasticity arises from data subsampling which reduces computational cost. Both, momentum and stochasticity help the algorithm to converge globally. In this work, we propose and analyse a continuous-time model for stochastic gradient descent with momentum. This model is a piecewise-deterministic Markov process that represents the optimiser by an underdamped dynamical system and the data subsampling through a stochastic switching. We investigate longtime limits, the subsampling-to-no-subsampling limit, and the momentum-to-no-momentum limit. We are particularly interested in the case of reducing the momentum over time. Under convexity assumptions, we show convergence of our dynamical system to the global minimiser when reducing momentum over time and letting the subsampling rate go to infinity. We then propose a stable, symplectic discretisation scheme to construct an algorithm from our continuous-time dynamical system. In experiments, we study our scheme in convex and non-convex test problems. Additionally, we train a convolutional neural network in an image classification problem. Our algorithm {attains} competitive results compared to stochastic gradient descent with momentum.</p></details> |  |

Still, the generation, and especially the labeling of motion data for specific activities can be time-consuming and costly. Additionally, many models struggle with limited data, which limits their performance in recognizing complex movement patterns. To address those issues, generating synthetic data can help expand the diversity and variability. In this work, we propose IMUDiffusion, a probabilistic diffusion model specifically designed for multivariate time series generation. Our approach enables the generation of high-quality time series sequences which accurately capture the dynamics of human activities. Moreover, by joining our dataset with synthetic data, we achieve a significant improvement in the performance of our baseline human activity classifier. In some cases, we are able to improve the macro F1-score by almost 30%. IMUDiffusion provides a valuable tool for generating realistic human activity movements and enhance the robustness of models in scenarios with limited training data.</p></details> |  |

Our approach imposes a causality constraint on the encoder and decoder networks, ensuring a causal transport from the real market time series to the fake generated time series. Specifically, we prove that the TC-VAE loss provides an upper bound on the causal Wasserstein distance between market distributions and generated distributions. Consequently, the TC-VAE loss controls the discrepancy between optimal values of various dynamic stochastic optimization problems under real and generated distributions. To further enhance the model's ability to approximate the latent representation of the real market distribution, we integrate a RealNVP prior into the TC-VAE framework. Finally, extensive numerical experiments show that TC-VAE achieves promising results on both synthetic and real market data. This is done by comparing real and generated distributions according to various statistical distances, demonstrating the effectiveness of the generated data for downstream financial optimization tasks, as well as showcasing that the generated data reproduces stylized facts of real financial market data.</p></details> |  |
| **[ABBA-VSM: Time Series Classification using Symbolic Representation on the Edge](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10285v2)** | 2024-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, Edge AI has become more prevalent with applications across various industries, from environmental monitoring to smart city management. Edge AI facilitates the processing of Internet of Things (IoT) data and provides privacy-enabled and latency-sensitive services to application users using Machine Learning (ML) algorithms, e.g., Time Series Classification (TSC). However, existing TSC algorithms require access to full raw data and demand substantial computing resources to train and use them effectively in runtime. This makes them impractical for deployment in resource-constrained Edge environments. To address this, in this paper, we propose an Adaptive Brownian Bridge-based Symbolic Aggregation Vector Space Model (ABBA-VSM). It is a new TSC model designed for classification services on Edge. Here, we first adaptively compress the raw time series into symbolic representations, thus capturing the changing trends of data. Subsequently, we train the classification model directly on these symbols. ABBA-VSM reduces communication data between IoT and Edge devices, as well as computation cycles, in the development of resource-efficient TSC services on Edge. We evaluate our solution with extensive experiments using datasets from the UCR time series classification archive. The results demonstrate that the ABBA-VSM achieves up to 80% compression ratio and 90-100% accuracy for binary classification. Whereas, for non-binary classification, it achieves an average compression ratio of 60% and accuracy ranging from 60-80%.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages with references, 5 figures</p></details> |
| **[A Mamba Foundation Model for Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02941v1)** | 2024-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series foundation models have demonstrated strong performance in zero-shot learning, making them well-suited for predicting rapidly evolving patterns in real-world applications where relevant training data are scarce. However, most of these models rely on the Transformer architecture, which incurs quadratic complexity as input length increases. To address this, we introduce TSMamba, a linear-complexity foundation model for time series forecasting built on the Mamba architecture. The model captures temporal dependencies through both forward and backward Mamba encoders, achieving high prediction accuracy. To reduce reliance on large datasets and lower training costs, TSMamba employs a two-stage transfer learning process that leverages pretrained Mamba LLMs, allowing effective time series modeling with a moderate training set. In the first stage, the forward and backward backbones are optimized via patch-wise autoregressive prediction; in the second stage, the model trains a prediction head and refines other components for long-term forecasting. While the backbone assumes channel independence to manage varying channel numbers across datasets, a channel-wise compressed attention module is introduced to capture cross-channel dependencies during fine-tuning on specific multivariate datasets. Experiments show that TSMamba's zero-shot performance is comparable to state-of-the-art time series foundation models, despite using significantly less training data. It also achieves competitive or superior full-shot performance compared to task-specific prediction models. The code will be made publicly available.</p></details> |  |
| **[Knowledge Enhanced Conditional Imputation for Healthcare Time-series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16713v4)** | 2024-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce the Conditional Self-Attention Imputation (CSAI), a novel recurrent neural network architecture designed to address the challenges of complex missing data patterns in multivariate time series derived from hospital electronic health records (EHRs). CSAI extends the current state-of-the-art neural network-based imputation methods by introducing key modifications specifically adapted to EHR data characteristics, namely: a) an attention-based hidden state initialisation technique to capture both long- and short-range temporal dependencies prevalent in EHRs, b) a domain-informed temporal decay mechanism to adjust the imputation process to clinical data recording patterns, and c) a non-uniform masking strategy that models non-random missingness by calibrating weights according to both temporal and cross-sectional data characteristics. Comprehensive evaluation across four EHR benchmark datasets demonstrate CSAI's effectiveness compared to state-of-the-art neural architectures in data restoration and downstream predictive tasks. Additionally, CSAI is integrated within PyPOTS, an open-source Python toolbox designed for machine learning tasks on partially observed time series. This work significantly advances the state of neural network imputation applied to EHRs by more closely aligning algorithmic imputation with clinical realities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimal bounds for POD approximations of infinite horizon control problems based on time derivatives](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10552v3)** | 2024-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper we consider the numerical approximation of infinite horizon problems via the dynamic programming approach. The value function of the problem solves a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation that is approximated by a fully discrete method. It is known that the numerical problem is difficult to handle by the so called curse of dimensionality. To mitigate this issue we apply a reduction of the order by means of a new proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) method based on time derivatives. We carry out the error analysis of the method using recently proved optimal bounds for the fully discrete approximations. Moreover, the use of snapshots based on time derivatives allow us to bound some terms of the error that could not be bounded in a standard POD approach. Some numerical experiments show the good performance of the method in practice.</p></details> |  |
| **[Not All Frequencies Are Created Equal:Towards a Dynamic Fusion of Frequencies in Time-Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12415v3)** | 2024-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long-term time series forecasting is a long-standing challenge in various applications. A central issue in time series forecasting is that methods should expressively capture long-term dependency. Furthermore, time series forecasting methods should be flexible when applied to different scenarios. Although Fourier analysis offers an alternative to effectively capture reusable and periodic patterns to achieve long-term forecasting in different scenarios, existing methods often assume high-frequency components represent noise and should be discarded in time series forecasting. However, we conduct a series of motivation experiments and discover that the role of certain frequencies varies depending on the scenarios. In some scenarios, removing high-frequency components from the original time series can improve the forecasting performance, while in others scenarios, removing them is harmful to forecasting performance. Therefore, it is necessary to treat the frequencies differently according to specific scenarios. To achieve this, we first reformulate the time series forecasting problem as learning a transfer function of each frequency in the Fourier domain. Further, we design Frequency Dynamic Fusion (FreDF), which individually predicts each Fourier component, and dynamically fuses the output of different frequencies. Moreover, we provide a novel insight into the generalization ability of time series forecasting and propose the generalization bound of time series forecasting. Then we prove FreDF has a lower bound, indicating that FreDF has better generalization ability. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple benchmark datasets and ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of FreDF. The code is available at https://github.com/Zh-XY22/FreDF.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accpe...</summary><p>Accpeted by ACMMM2024</p></details> |

We consider a network with $n$ nodes and $m$ edges where the capacity and length of each edge is a piecewise constant function, and use $\mu=\Omega(m)$ to denote the total number of pieces in all of the $2m$ functions. Our goal is to design exact algorithms for various flow problems that run in time polynomial in the parameter $\mu$. Importantly, the algorithms we design are strongly polynomial, i.e. have no dependence on the capacities, flow value, or the time horizon of the flow process, all of which can be exponentially large relative to the other parameters; and return an integral flow when all input parameters are integral. Our main result is an algorithm for checking feasibility of a dynamic transshipment problem on temporal networks -- given multiple sources and sinks with supply and demand values, is it possible to satisfy the desired supplies and demands within a given time horizon? We develop a fast ($O(\mu^3)$ time) algorithm for this feasibility problem when the input network has a certain canonical form, by exploiting the cut structure of the associated time expanded network. We then adapt an approach of \cite{hoppe2000} to show how other flow problems on temporal networks can be reduced to the canonical format. For computing dynamic transshipments on temporal networks, this results in a $O(\mu^7)$ time algorithm, whereas the previous best integral exact algorithm runs in time $\tilde O(\mu^{19})$. We achieve similar improvements for other flow problems on temporal networks.</p></details> | 33 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Sampling-guided Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network with Temporal Smoothing for Scalable Longitudinal Data Imputation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04899v1)** | 2024-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose a novel framework, the Sampling-guided Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network (SHT-GNN), to effectively tackle the challenge of missing data imputation in longitudinal studies. Unlike traditional methods, which often require extensive preprocessing to handle irregular or inconsistent missing data, our approach accommodates arbitrary missing data patterns while maintaining computational efficiency. SHT-GNN models both observations and covariates as distinct node types, connecting observation nodes at successive time points through subject-specific longitudinal subnetworks, while covariate-observation interactions are represented by attributed edges within bipartite graphs. By leveraging subject-wise mini-batch sampling and a multi-layer temporal smoothing mechanism, SHT-GNN efficiently scales to large datasets, while effectively learning node representations and imputing missing data. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets, including the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset, demonstrate that SHT-GNN significantly outperforms existing imputation methods, even with high missing data rates. The empirical results highlight SHT-GNN's robust imputation capabilities and superior performance, particularly in the context of complex, large-scale longitudinal data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Zero-Shot Temporal Resolution Domain Adaptation for Spiking Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04760v1)** | 2024-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are biologically-inspired deep neural networks that efficiently extract temporal information while offering promising gains in terms of energy efficiency and latency when deployed on neuromorphic devices. However, SNN model parameters are sensitive to temporal resolution, leading to significant performance drops when the temporal resolution of target data at the edge is not the same with that of the pre-deployment source data used for training, especially when fine-tuning is not possible at the edge. To address this challenge, we propose three novel domain adaptation methods for adapting neuron parameters to account for the change in time resolution without re-training on target time-resolution. The proposed methods are based on a mapping between neuron dynamics in SNNs and State Space Models (SSMs); and are applicable to general neuron models. We evaluate the proposed methods under spatio-temporal data tasks, namely the audio keyword spotting datasets SHD and MSWC as well as the image classification NMINST dataset. Our methods provide an alternative to - and in majority of the cases significantly outperform - the existing reference method that simply scales the time constant. Moreover, our results show that high accuracy on high temporal resolution data can be obtained by time efficient training on lower temporal resolution data and model adaptation.</p></details> |  |

The framework adeptly handles incomplete and noisy skeletal data common in short-form dance videos on social media platforms like TikTok. DanceFusion incorporates a hierarchical Transformer-based Variational Autoencoder (VAE) integrated with a diffusion model, significantly enhancing motion realism and accuracy. Our approach introduces sophisticated masking techniques and a unique iterative diffusion process that refines the motion sequences, ensuring high fidelity in both motion generation and synchronization with accompanying audio cues. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that DanceFusion surpasses existing methods, providing state-of-the-art performance in generating dynamic, realistic, and stylistically diverse dance motions. Potential applications of this framework extend to content creation, virtual reality, and interactive entertainment, promising substantial advancements in automated dance generation.

| **[Temporal Complexity of a Hopfield-Type Neural Model in Random and Scale-Free Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12895v3)** | 2024-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Hopfield network model and its generalizations were introduced as a model of associative, or content-addressable, memory. They were widely investigated both as an unsupervised learning method in artificial intelligence and as a model of biological neural dynamics in computational neuroscience. The complexity features of biological neural networks have attracted the scientific community's interest for the last two decades. More recently, concepts and tools borrowed from complex network theory were applied to artificial neural networks and learning, thus focusing on the topological aspects. However, the temporal structure is also a crucial property displayed by biological neural networks and investigated in the framework of systems displaying complex intermittency. The Intermittency-Driven Complexity (IDC) approach indeed focuses on the metastability of self-organized states, whose signature is a power-decay in the inter-event time distribution or a scaling behaviour in the related event-driven diffusion processes. The investigation of IDC in neural dynamics and its relationship with network topology is still in its early stages. In this work, we present the preliminary results of an IDC analysis carried out on a bio-inspired Hopfield-type neural network comparing two different connectivities, i.e., scale-free vs. random network topology. We found that random networks can trigger complexity features similar to that of scale-free networks, even if with some differences and for different parameter values, in particular for different noise levels</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-temporal crack segmentation in concrete structure using deep learning approaches](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04620v1)** | 2024-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cracks are among the earliest indicators of deterioration in concrete structures. Early automatic detection of these cracks can significantly extend the lifespan of critical infrastructures, such as bridges, buildings, and tunnels, while simultaneously reducing maintenance costs and facilitating efficient structural health monitoring. This study investigates whether leveraging multi-temporal data for crack segmentation can enhance segmentation quality. Therefore, we compare a Swin UNETR trained on multi-temporal data with a U-Net trained on mono-temporal data to assess the effect of temporal information compared with conventional single-epoch approaches. To this end, a multi-temporal dataset comprising 1356 images, each with 32 sequential crack propagation images, was created. After training the models, experiments were conducted to analyze their generalization ability, temporal consistency, and segmentation quality. The multi-temporal approach consistently outperformed its mono-temporal counterpart, achieving an IoU of $82.72\%$ and a F1-score of $90.54\%$, representing a significant improvement over the mono-temporal model's IoU of $76.69\%$ and F1-score of $86.18\%$, despite requiring only half of the trainable parameters. The multi-temporal model also displayed a more consistent segmentation quality, with reduced noise and fewer errors. These results suggest that temporal information significantly enhances the performance of segmentation models, offering a promising solution for improved crack detection and the long-term monitoring of concrete structures, even with limited sequential data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Identifying Performance Issues in Cloud Service Systems Based on Relational-Temporal Features](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10869v3)** | 2024-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cloud systems are susceptible to performance issues, which may cause service-level agreement violations and financial losses. In current practice, crucial metrics are monitored periodically to provide insight into the operational status of components. Identifying performance issues is often formulated as an anomaly detection problem, which is tackled by analyzing each metric independently. However, this approach overlooks the complex dependencies existing among cloud components. Some graph neural network-based methods take both temporal and relational information into account, however, the correlation violations in the metrics that serve as indicators of underlying performance issues are difficult for them to identify. Furthermore, a large volume of components in a cloud system results in a vast array of noisy metrics. This complexity renders it impractical for engineers to fully comprehend the correlations, making it challenging to identify performance issues accurately. To address these limitations, we propose Identifying Performance Issues based on Relational-Temporal Features (ISOLATE ), a learning-based approach that leverages both the relational and temporal features of metrics to identify performance issues. In particular, it adopts a graph neural network with attention to characterizing the relations among metrics and extracts long-term and multi-scale temporal patterns using a GRU and a convolution network, respectively. The learned graph attention weights can be further used to localize the correlation-violated metrics. Moreover, to relieve the impact of noisy data, ISOLATE utilizes a positive unlabeled learning strategy that tags pseudo-labels based on a small portion of confirmed negative examples. Extensive evaluation on both public and industrial datasets shows that ISOLATE outperforms all baseline models with 0.945 F1-score and 0.920 Hit rate@3.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology (TOSEM)</p></details> |
| **[Prompt-Based Spatio-Temporal Graph Transfer Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12452v2)** | 2024-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal graph neural networks have proven efficacy in capturing complex dependencies for urban computing tasks such as forecasting and kriging. Yet, their performance is constrained by the reliance on extensive data for training on a specific task, thereby limiting their adaptability to new urban domains with varied task demands. Although transfer learning has been proposed to remedy this problem by leveraging knowledge across domains, the cross-task generalization still remains under-explored in spatio-temporal graph transfer learning due to the lack of a unified framework. To bridge the gap, we propose Spatio-Temporal Graph Prompting (STGP), a prompt-based framework capable of adapting to multi-diverse tasks in a data-scarce domain. Specifically, we first unify different tasks into a single template and introduce a task-agnostic network architecture that aligns with this template. This approach enables capturing dependencies shared across tasks. Furthermore, we employ learnable prompts to achieve domain and task transfer in a two-stage prompting pipeline, facilitating the prompts to effectively capture domain knowledge and task-specific properties. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that STGP outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in three tasks-forecasting, kriging, and extrapolation-achieving an improvement of up to 10.7%.</p></details> |  |
| **[ProGraph: Temporally-alignable Probability Guided Graph Topological Modeling for 3D Human Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04399v1)** | 2024-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current 3D human motion reconstruction methods from monocular videos rely on features within the current reconstruction window, leading to distortion and deformations in the human structure under local occlusions or blurriness in video frames. To estimate realistic 3D human mesh sequences based on incomplete features, we propose Temporally-alignable Probability Guided Graph Topological Modeling for 3D Human Reconstruction (ProGraph). For missing parts recovery, we exploit the explicit topological-aware probability distribution across the entire motion sequence. To restore the complete human, Graph Topological Modeling (GTM) learns the underlying topological structure, focusing on the relationships inherent in the individual parts. Next, to generate blurred motion parts, Temporal-alignable Probability Distribution (TPDist) utilizes the GTM to predict features based on distribution. This interactive mechanism facilitates motion consistency, allowing the restoration of human parts. Furthermore, Hierarchical Human Loss (HHLoss) constrains the probability distribution errors of inter-frame features during topological structure variation. Our Method achieves superior results than other SOTA methods in addressing occlusions and blurriness on 3DPW.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Bayesian Mixture Model of Temporal Point Processes with Determinantal Point Process Prior](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04397v1)** | 2024-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Asynchronous event sequence clustering aims to group similar event sequences in an unsupervised manner. Mixture models of temporal point processes have been proposed to solve this problem, but they often suffer from overfitting, leading to excessive cluster generation with a lack of diversity. To overcome these limitations, we propose a Bayesian mixture model of Temporal Point Processes with Determinantal Point Process prior (TP$^2$DP$^2$) and accordingly an efficient posterior inference algorithm based on conditional Gibbs sampling. Our work provides a flexible learning framework for event sequence clustering, enabling automatic identification of the potential number of clusters and accurate grouping of sequences with similar features. It is applicable to a wide range of parametric temporal point processes, including neural network-based models. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world data suggest that our framework could produce moderately fewer yet more diverse mixture components, and achieve outstanding results across multiple evaluation metrics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Identification of Long-Term Treatment Effects via Temporal Links, Observational, and Experimental Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04380v1)** | 2024-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent literature proposes combining short-term experimental and long-term observational data to provide credible alternatives to conventional observational studies for identification of long-term average treatment effects (LTEs). I show that experimental data have an auxiliary role in this context. They bring no identifying power without additional modeling assumptions. When modeling assumptions are imposed, experimental data serve to amplify their identifying power. If the assumptions fail, adding experimental data may only yield results that are farther from the truth. Motivated by this, I introduce two assumptions on treatment response that may be defensible based on economic theory or intuition. To utilize them, I develop a novel two-step identification approach that centers on bounding temporal link functions -- the relationship between short-term and mean long-term potential outcomes. The approach provides sharp bounds on LTEs for a general class of assumptions, and allows for imperfect experimental compliance -- extending existing results.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robust Real-Time Mortality Prediction in the Intensive Care Unit using Temporal Difference Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04285v1)** | 2024-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The task of predicting long-term patient outcomes using supervised machine learning is a challenging one, in part because of the high variance of each patient's trajectory, which can result in the model over-fitting to the training data. Temporal difference (TD) learning, a common reinforcement learning technique, may reduce variance by generalising learning to the pattern of state transitions rather than terminal outcomes. However, in healthcare this method requires several strong assumptions about patient states, and there appears to be limited literature evaluating the performance of TD learning against traditional supervised learning methods for long-term health outcome prediction tasks. In this study, we define a framework for applying TD learning to real-time irregularly sampled time series data using a Semi-Markov Reward Process. We evaluate the model framework in predicting intensive care mortality and show that TD learning under this framework can result in improved model robustness compared to standard supervised learning methods. and that this robustness is maintained even when validated on external datasets. This approach may offer a more reliable method when learning to predict patient outcomes using high-variance irregular time series data.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be published in the Proceedings of the 4th Machine Learning for Health symposium, Proceedings of Machine Learning Research (PMLR)</p></details> |
| **[Multi-branch Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Network For Efficient Ice Layer Thickness Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04055v1)** | 2024-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding spatio-temporal patterns in polar ice layers is essential for tracking changes in ice sheet balance and assessing ice dynamics. While convolutional neural networks are widely used in learning ice layer patterns from raw echogram images captured by airborne snow radar sensors, noise in the echogram images prevents researchers from getting high-quality results. Instead, we focus on geometric deep learning using graph neural networks, aiming to build a spatio-temporal graph neural network that learns from thickness information of the top ice layers and predicts for deeper layers. In this paper, we developed a novel multi-branch spatio-temporal graph neural network that used the GraphSAGE framework for spatio features learning and a temporal convolution operation to capture temporal changes, enabling different branches of the network to be more specialized and focusing on a single learning task. We found that our proposed multi-branch network can consistently outperform the current fused spatio-temporal graph neural network in both accuracy and efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Temporal Network Creation Games: The Impact of Non-Locality and Terminals](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03973v1)** | 2024-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We live in a world full of networks where our economy, our communication, and even our social life crucially depends on them. These networks typically emerge from the interaction of many entities, which is why researchers study agent-based models of network formation. While traditionally static networks with a fixed set of links were considered, a recent stream of works focuses on networks whose behavior may change over time. In particular, Bil\`o et al. (IJCAI 2023) recently introduced a game-theoretic network formation model that embeds temporal aspects in networks. More precisely, a network is formed by selfish agents corresponding to nodes in a given host network with edges having labels denoting their availability over time. Each agent strategically selects local, i.e., incident, edges to ensure temporal reachability towards everyone at low cost. In this work we set out to explore the impact of two novel conceptual features: agents are no longer restricted to creating incident edges, called the global setting, and agents might only want to ensure that they can reach a subset of the other nodes, called the terminal model. For both, we study the existence, structure, and quality of equilibrium networks. For the terminal model, we prove that many core properties crucially depend on the number of terminals. We also develop a novel tool that allows translating equilibrium constructions from the non-terminal model to the terminal model. For the global setting, we show the surprising result that equilibria in the global and the local model are incomparable and we establish a high lower bound on the Price of Anarchy of the global setting that matches the upper bound of the local model. This shows the counter-intuitive fact that allowing agents more flexibility in edge creation does not improve the quality of equilibrium networks.</p></details> |  |

We test the framework on the Dengue history of several countries located in both Latin America and Asia. We also observe a strong correlation between the total number of infected individuals and the changes in the local temperature. Our results further support the expectation that global warming is bound to increase the cases of Dengue worldwide. We then move to investigate, via the eRG, the recent outbreak in Fano, Italy and offer our projections.</p></details> |  |

Current state-of-the-art methods typically adopt dual-path networks to separately modeling spatial features and temporal features. However, the uncertain compatibility of the two networks brings a challenge for spatio-temporal features fusion and violate the spatio-temporal coherence and coupling of human motions by nature. To address this issue, we propose a novel graph structure, UnityGraph, which treats spatio-temporal features as a whole, enhancing model coherence and coupling.spatio-temporal features as a whole, enhancing model coherence and coupling. Specifically, UnityGraph is a hypervariate graph based network. The flexibility of the hypergraph allows us to consider the observed motions as graph nodes. We then leverage hyperedges to bridge these nodes for exploring spatio-temporal features. This perspective considers spatio-temporal dynamics unitedly and reformulates multi-person motion prediction into a problem on a single graph. Leveraging the dynamic message passing based on this hypergraph, our model dynamically learns from both types of relations to generate targeted messages that reflect the relevance among nodes. Extensive experiments on several datasets demonstrates that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, confirming its effectiveness and innovative design.</p></details> | <details><summary>13pag...</summary><p>13pages, 12 figures. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2411.03729</p></details> |

The existing mainstream solutions generally leverage temporal information by roughly stacking history frames to supplement the current frame, such straightforward temporal modeling inevitably diminishes valid clues and increases learning difficulty. To address this problem, we present HTCL, a novel Hierarchical Temporal Context Learning paradigm for improving camera-based semantic scene completion. The primary innovation of this work involves decomposing temporal context learning into two hierarchical steps: (a) cross-frame affinity measurement and (b) affinity-based dynamic refinement. Firstly, to separate critical relevant context from redundant information, we introduce the pattern affinity with scale-aware isolation and multiple independent learners for fine-grained contextual correspondence modeling. Subsequently, to dynamically compensate for incomplete observations, we adaptively refine the feature sampling locations based on initially identified locations with high affinity and their neighboring relevant regions. Our method ranks $1^{st}$ on the SemanticKITTI benchmark and even surpasses LiDAR-based methods in terms of mIoU on the OpenOccupancy benchmark. Our code is available on https://github.com/Arlo0o/HTCL.</p></details> | ECCV 2024 |

Much research suggests that NAc dopamine encodes temporal-difference (TD) errors for learning value predictions. However, dopamine is synchronously distributed in regionally homogeneous concentrations, which does not support explicit credit assignment (like used by backpropagation). It is unclear whether distributed errors alone are sufficient for synapses to make coordinated updates to learn complex, nonlinear reward-based learning tasks. We design a new deep Q-learning algorithm, Artificial Dopamine, to computationally demonstrate that synchronously distributed, per-layer TD errors may be sufficient to learn surprisingly complex RL tasks. We empirically evaluate our algorithm on MinAtar, the DeepMind Control Suite, and classic control tasks, and show it often achieves comparable performance to deep RL algorithms that use backpropagation.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, to be published at NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |

In fact, simple heuristic approaches such as persistent forecasts and moving averages over \emph{ground-truth labels} significantly and consistently outperform TGNs. Building on this observation, we find that computing heuristics \textit{over messages} is an equally competitive approach, outperforming TGN and all current temporal graph (TG) models on dynamic node affinity prediction. In this paper, we prove that no formulation of TGN can represent persistent forecasting or moving averages over messages, and propose to enhance the expressivity of TGNs by adding source-target identification to each interaction event message. We show that this modification is required to represent persistent forecasting, moving averages, and the broader class of autoregressive models over messages. Our proposed method, TGNv2, significantly outperforms TGN and all current TG models on all Temporal Graph Benchmark (TGB) dynamic node affinity prediction datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS Symmetry and Geometry in Neural Representations Workshop 2024</p></details> |

HeTVAE includes a novel input layer to encode information about input observation sparsity, a temporal VAE architecture to propagate uncertainty due to input sparsity, and a heteroscedastic output layer to enable variable uncertainty in output interpolations.

| **[Temporal Smoothness Regularisers for Neural Link Predictors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09045v2)** | 2024-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most algorithms for representation learning and link prediction on relational data are designed for static data. However, the data to which they are applied typically evolves over time, including online social networks or interactions between users and items in recommender systems. This is also the case for graph-structured knowledge bases -- knowledge graphs -- which contain facts that are valid only for specific points in time. In such contexts, it becomes crucial to correctly identify missing links at a precise time point, i.e. the temporal prediction link task. Recently, Lacroix et al. and Sadeghian et al. proposed a solution to the problem of link prediction for knowledge graphs under temporal constraints inspired by the canonical decomposition of 4-order tensors, where they regularise the representations of time steps by enforcing temporal smoothing, i.e. by learning similar transformation for adjacent timestamps. However, the impact of the choice of temporal regularisation terms is still poorly understood. In this work, we systematically analyse several choices of temporal smoothing regularisers using linear functions and recurrent architectures. In our experiments, we show that by carefully selecting the temporal smoothing regulariser and regularisation weight, a simple method like TNTComplEx can produce significantly more accurate results than state-of-the-art methods on three widely used temporal link prediction datasets. Furthermore, we evaluate the impact of a wide range of temporal smoothing regularisers on two state-of-the-art temporal link prediction models. Our work shows that simple tensor factorisation models can produce new state-of-the-art results using newly proposed temporal regularisers, highlighting a promising avenue for future research.</p></details> |  |

HD EEG devices improve the spatial resolution of EEG by placing more electrodes on the scalp, which meet the requirements of clinical diagnostic applications such as epilepsy focus localization. However, this technique faces challenges, such as high acquisition costs and limited usage scenarios. In this paper, spatio-temporal adaptive diffusion models (STAD) are proposed to pioneer the use of diffusion models for achieving spatial SR reconstruction from low-resolution (LR, 64 channels or fewer) EEG to high-resolution (HR, 256 channels) EEG. Specifically, a spatio-temporal condition module is designed to extract the spatio-temporal features of LR EEG, which then used as conditional inputs to direct the reverse denoising process. Additionally, a multi-scale Transformer denoising module is constructed to leverage multi-scale convolution blocks and cross-attention-based diffusion Transformer blocks for conditional guidance to generate subject-adaptive SR EEG. Experimental results demonstrate that the STAD significantly enhances the spatial resolution of LR EEG and quantitatively outperforms existing methods. Furthermore, STAD demonstrate their value by applying synthetic SR EEG to classification and source localization tasks, indicating their potential to Substantially boost the spatial resolution of EEG.</p></details> |  |
| **[CRT-Fusion: Camera, Radar, Temporal Fusion Using Motion Information for 3D Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03013v1)** | 2024-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate and robust 3D object detection is a critical component in autonomous vehicles and robotics. While recent radar-camera fusion methods have made significant progress by fusing information in the bird's-eye view (BEV) representation, they often struggle to effectively capture the motion of dynamic objects, leading to limited performance in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we introduce CRT-Fusion, a novel framework that integrates temporal information into radar-camera fusion to address this challenge. Our approach comprises three key modules: Multi-View Fusion (MVF), Motion Feature Estimator (MFE), and Motion Guided Temporal Fusion (MGTF). The MVF module fuses radar and image features within both the camera view and bird's-eye view, thereby generating a more precise unified BEV representation. The MFE module conducts two simultaneous tasks: estimation of pixel-wise velocity information and BEV segmentation. Based on the velocity and the occupancy score map obtained from the MFE module, the MGTF module aligns and fuses feature maps across multiple timestamps in a recurrent manner. By considering the motion of dynamic objects, CRT-Fusion can produce robust BEV feature maps, thereby improving detection accuracy and robustness. Extensive evaluations on the challenging nuScenes dataset demonstrate that CRT-Fusion achieves state-of-the-art performance for radar-camera-based 3D object detection. Our approach outperforms the previous best method in terms of NDS by +1.7%, while also surpassing the leading approach in mAP by +1.4%. These significant improvements in both metrics showcase the effectiveness of our proposed fusion strategy in enhancing the reliability and accuracy of 3D object detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS2024</p></details> |

In this paper, we explore the concept of equilibrium design, where incentives are designed to obtain a desirable equilibrium that satisfies a specific temporal logic property. Our study is based on a framework where system specifications are represented as temporal logic formulae, games as quantitative concurrent game structures, and players' goals as mean-payoff objectives. We consider system specifications given by LTL and GR(1) formulae, and show that designing incentives to ensure that a given temporal logic property is satisfied on some/every Nash equilibrium of the game can be achieved in PSPACE for LTL properties and in NP/{\Sigma}P 2 for GR(1) specifications. We also examine the complexity of related decision and optimisation problems, such as optimality and uniqueness of solutions, as well as considering social welfare, and show that the complexities of these problems lie within the polynomial hierarchy. Equilibrium design can be used as an alternative solution to rational synthesis and verification problems for concurrent games with mean-payoff objectives when no solution exists or as a technique to repair concurrent games with undesirable Nash equilibria in an optimal way.</p></details> | <details><summary>The m...</summary><p>The manuscript is going to be submitted to the Journal on Logical Methods in Computer Science. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2106.10192</p></details> |
| **[Temporal Wasserstein Imputation: Versatile Missing Data Imputation for Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02811v1)** | 2024-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Missing data often significantly hamper standard time series analysis, yet in practice they are frequently encountered. In this paper, we introduce temporal Wasserstein imputation, a novel method for imputing missing data in time series. Unlike existing techniques, our approach is fully nonparametric, circumventing the need for model specification prior to imputation, making it suitable for potential nonlinear dynamics. Its principled algorithmic implementation can seamlessly handle univariate or multivariate time series with any missing pattern. In addition, the plausible range and side information of the missing entries (such as box constraints) can easily be incorporated. As a key advantage, our method mitigates the distributional bias typical of many existing approaches, ensuring more reliable downstream statistical analysis using the imputed series. Leveraging the benign landscape of the optimization formulation, we establish the convergence of an alternating minimization algorithm to critical points. Furthermore, we provide conditions under which the marginal distributions of the underlying time series can be identified. Our numerical experiments, including extensive simulations covering linear and nonlinear time series models and an application to a real-world groundwater dataset laden with missing data, corroborate the practical usefulness of the proposed method.</p></details> |  |
| **[DEMONet: Underwater Acoustic Target Recognition based on Multi-Expert Network and Cross-Temporal Variational Autoencoder](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02758v1)** | 2024-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Building a robust underwater acoustic recognition system in real-world scenarios is challenging due to the complex underwater environment and the dynamic motion states of targets. A promising optimization approach is to leverage the intrinsic physical characteristics of targets, which remain invariable regardless of environmental conditions, to provide robust insights. However, our study reveals that while physical characteristics exhibit robust properties, they may lack class-specific discriminative patterns. Consequently, directly incorporating physical characteristics into model training can potentially introduce unintended inductive biases, leading to performance degradation. To utilize the benefits of physical characteristics while mitigating possible detrimental effects, we propose DEMONet in this study, which utilizes the detection of envelope modulation on noise (DEMON) to provide robust insights into the shaft frequency or blade counts of targets. DEMONet is a multi-expert network that allocates various underwater signals to their best-matched expert layer based on DEMON spectra for fine-grained signal processing. Thereinto, DEMON spectra are solely responsible for providing implicit physical characteristics without establishing a mapping relationship with the target category. Furthermore, to mitigate noise and spurious modulation spectra in DEMON features, we introduce a cross-temporal alignment strategy and employ a variational autoencoder (VAE) to reconstruct noise-resistant DEMON spectra to replace the raw DEMON features. The effectiveness of the proposed DEMONet with cross-temporal VAE was primarily evaluated on the DeepShip dataset and our proprietary datasets. Experimental results demonstrated that our approach could achieve state-of-the-art performance on both datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[CollaMamba: Efficient Collaborative Perception with Cross-Agent Spatial-Temporal State Space Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07714v3)** | 2024-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>By sharing complementary perceptual information, multi-agent collaborative perception fosters a deeper understanding of the environment. Recent studies on collaborative perception mostly utilize CNNs or Transformers to learn feature representation and fusion in the spatial dimension, which struggle to handle long-range spatial-temporal features under limited computing and communication resources. Holistically modeling the dependencies over extensive spatial areas and extended temporal frames is crucial to enhancing feature quality. To this end, we propose a resource efficient cross-agent spatial-temporal collaborative state space model (SSM), named CollaMamba. Initially, we construct a foundational backbone network based on spatial SSM. This backbone adeptly captures positional causal dependencies from both single-agent and cross-agent views, yielding compact and comprehensive intermediate features while maintaining linear complexity. Furthermore, we devise a history-aware feature boosting module based on temporal SSM, extracting contextual cues from extended historical frames to refine vague features while preserving low overhead. Extensive experiments across several datasets demonstrate that CollaMamba outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving higher model accuracy while reducing computational and communication overhead by up to 71.9% and 1/64, respectively. This work pioneers the exploration of the Mamba's potential in collaborative perception. The source code will be made available.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unlocking Temporal Question Answering for Large Language Models with Tailor-Made Reasoning Logic](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15014v2)** | 2024-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The temporal aspect is a significant dimension of our reality. We notice the challenge that large language models (LLMs) face when engaging in temporal reasoning. Our preliminary experiments show that methods involving the generation of intermediate reasoning steps, such as chain-of-thought and program-aided language models, do not consistently boost the performance of complex temporal question-answering tasks. This limitation can be attributed to the LLMs' inadequate understanding of temporal information. To address this problem, we propose TempLogic, a novel framework designed specifically for temporal question-answering tasks across three levels of reasoning. TempLogic incorporates retrieval-guided context distillation, temporal data extraction, and tailor-made logic reasoning. Extensive experiments and analysis demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in solving intricate time-bound reasoning tasks.</p></details> | Work in progress |
| **[AM Flow: Adapters for Temporal Processing in Action Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02065v1)** | 2024-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning models, in particular \textit{image} models, have recently gained generalisability and robustness. %are becoming more general and robust by the day. In this work, we propose to exploit such advances in the realm of \textit{video} classification. Video foundation models suffer from the requirement of extensive pretraining and a large training time. Towards mitigating such limitations, we propose "\textit{Attention Map (AM) Flow}" for image models, a method for identifying pixels relevant to motion in each input video frame. In this context, we propose two methods to compute AM flow, depending on camera motion. AM flow allows the separation of spatial and temporal processing, while providing improved results over combined spatio-temporal processing (as in video models). Adapters, one of the popular techniques in parameter efficient transfer learning, facilitate the incorporation of AM flow into pretrained image models, mitigating the need for full-finetuning. We extend adapters to "\textit{temporal processing adapters}" by incorporating a temporal processing unit into the adapters. Our work achieves faster convergence, therefore reducing the number of epochs needed for training. Moreover, we endow an image model with the ability to achieve state-of-the-art results on popular action recognition datasets. This reduces training time and simplifies pretraining. We present experiments on Kinetics-400, Something-Something v2, and Toyota Smarthome datasets, showcasing state-of-the-art or comparable results.</p></details> |  |
| **[TRACE: Temporal Grounding Video LLM via Causal Event Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05643v2)** | 2024-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Temporal Grounding (VTG) is a crucial capability for video understanding models and plays a vital role in downstream tasks such as video browsing and editing. To effectively handle various tasks simultaneously and enable zero-shot prediction, there is a growing trend in employing video LLMs for VTG tasks. However, current video LLM-based methods rely exclusively on natural language generation, lacking the ability to model the clear structure inherent in videos, which restricts their effectiveness in tackling VTG tasks. To address this issue, this paper first formally introduces causal event modeling framework, which represents videos as sequences of events, and predict the current event using previous events, video inputs, and textural instructions. Each event consists of three components: timestamps, salient scores, and textual captions. We then propose a novel task-interleaved video LLM called TRACE to effectively implement the causal event modeling framework in practice. The TRACE processes visual frames, timestamps, salient scores, and text as distinct tasks, employing various encoders and decoding heads for each. Task tokens are arranged in an interleaved sequence according to the causal event modeling framework's formulation. Extensive experiments on various VTG tasks and datasets demonstrate the superior performance of TRACE compared to state-of-the-art video LLMs. Our model and code are available at \url{https://github.com/gyxxyg/TRACE}.</p></details> |  |

Traditional methods often focus solely on spatial or temporal features, limiting their ability to comprehend complex human activities fully. Our proposed model integrates joint, motion, and temporal information through a multi-stream fusion architecture. Specifically, it comprises a joint stream for extracting skeleton features, a temporal stream for capturing dynamic temporal features, and an ARN-LSTM block that utilizes Time-Distributed Long Short-Term Memory (TD-LSTM) layers followed by an Attention Relation Network (ARN) to model temporal relations. The outputs from these streams are fused in a fully connected layer to provide the final action prediction. Evaluations on the NTU RGB+D 60 and NTU RGB+D 120 datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our model, achieving effective performance, particularly in group activity recognition.</p></details> |  |
| **[FedASTA: Federated adaptive spatial-temporal attention for traffic flow prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13090v2)** | 2024-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mobile devices and the Internet of Things (IoT) devices nowadays generate a large amount of heterogeneous spatial-temporal data. It remains a challenging problem to model the spatial-temporal dynamics under privacy concern. Federated learning (FL) has been proposed as a framework to enable model training across distributed devices without sharing original data which reduce privacy concern. Personalized federated learning (PFL) methods further address data heterogenous problem. However, these methods don't consider natural spatial relations among nodes. For the sake of modeling spatial relations, Graph Neural Netowork (GNN) based FL approach have been proposed. But dynamic spatial-temporal relations among edge nodes are not taken into account. Several approaches model spatial-temporal dynamics in a centralized environment, while less effort has been made under federated setting. To overcome these challeges, we propose a novel Federated Adaptive Spatial-Temporal Attention (FedASTA) framework to model the dynamic spatial-temporal relations. On the client node, FedASTA extracts temporal relations and trend patterns from the decomposed terms of original time series. Then, on the server node, FedASTA utilize trend patterns from clients to construct adaptive temporal-spatial aware graph which captures dynamic correlation between clients. Besides, we design a masked spatial attention module with both static graph and constructed adaptive graph to model spatial dependencies among clients. Extensive experiments on five real-world public traffic flow datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-art performance in federated scenario. In addition, the experiments made in centralized setting show the effectiveness of our novel adaptive graph construction approach compared with other popular dynamic spatial-temporal aware methods.</p></details> |  |

However, accurately capturing interactions across multiple spatial and temporal scales remains a significant challenge. We present a novel framework that jointly models spatial and temporal multiscale interactions in molecular dynamics. Our approach leverages Graph Fourier Transforms to decompose molecular structures into different spatial scales and employs Neural Ordinary Differential Equations to model the temporal dynamics in a curated manner influenced by the spatial modes. This unified framework links spatial structures with temporal evolution in a flexible manner, enabling more accurate and comprehensive simulations of molecular systems. We evaluate our model on the MD17 dataset, demonstrating consistent performance improvements over state-of-the-art baselines across multiple molecules, particularly under challenging conditions such as irregular timestep sampling and long-term prediction horizons. Ablation studies confirm the significant contributions of both spatial and temporal multiscale modeling components. Our method advances the simulation of complex molecular systems, potentially accelerating research in computational chemistry, drug discovery, and materials science.</p></details> |  |

To address these limitations, we propose BiT-MamSleep, a novel architecture that integrates the Triple-Resolution CNN (TRCNN) for efficient multi-scale feature extraction with the Bidirectional Mamba (BiMamba) mechanism, which models both short- and long-term temporal dependencies through bidirectional processing of EEG data. Additionally, BiT-MamSleep incorporates an Adaptive Feature Recalibration (AFR) module and a temporal enhancement block to dynamically refine feature importance, optimizing classification accuracy without increasing computational complexity. To further improve robustness, we apply optimization techniques such as Focal Loss and SMOTE to mitigate class imbalance. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate that BiT-MamSleep significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly in handling long EEG sequences and addressing class imbalance, leading to more accurate and scalable sleep stage classification.</p></details> |  |

Predicting future events typically relies on closely related historical facts, yielding more accurate results for repetitive or periodic events. However, for future events with sparse historical interactions, the effectiveness of this method, which focuses on leveraging high-frequency historical information, diminishes. Recently, the capabilities of diffusion models in image generation have opened new opportunities for TKG reasoning. Therefore, we propose a graph node diffusion model with dual-domain periodic contrastive learning (DPCL-Diff). Graph node diffusion model (GNDiff) introduces noise into sparsely related events to simulate new events, generating high-quality data that better conforms to the actual distribution. This generative mechanism significantly enhances the model's ability to reason about new events. Additionally, the dual-domain periodic contrastive learning (DPCL) maps periodic and non-periodic event entities to Poincar\'e and Euclidean spaces, leveraging their characteristics to distinguish similar periodic events effectively. Experimental results on four public datasets demonstrate that DPCL-Diff significantly outperforms state-of-the-art TKG models in event prediction, demonstrating our approach's effectiveness. This study also investigates the combined effectiveness of GNDiff and DPCL in TKG tasks.</p></details> | 11 pages, 2 figures |
| **[Learning Hidden Subgoals under Temporal Ordering Constraints in Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01425v1)** | 2024-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In real-world applications, the success of completing a task is often determined by multiple key steps which are distant in time steps and have to be achieved in a fixed time order. For example, the key steps listed on the cooking recipe should be achieved one-by-one in the right time order. These key steps can be regarded as subgoals of the task and their time orderings are described as temporal ordering constraints. However, in many real-world problems, subgoals or key states are often hidden in the state space and their temporal ordering constraints are also unknown, which make it challenging for previous RL algorithms to solve this kind of tasks. In order to address this issue, in this work we propose a novel RL algorithm for {\bf l}earning hidden {\bf s}ubgoals under {\bf t}emporal {\bf o}rdering {\bf c}onstraints (LSTOC). We propose a new contrastive learning objective which can effectively learn hidden subgoals (key states) and their temporal orderings at the same time, based on first-occupancy representation and temporal geometric sampling. In addition, we propose a sample-efficient learning strategy to discover subgoals one-by-one following their temporal order constraints by building a subgoal tree to represent discovered subgoals and their temporal ordering relationships. Specifically, this tree can be used to improve the sample efficiency of trajectory collection, fasten the task solving and generalize to unseen tasks. The LSTOC framework is evaluated on several environments with image-based observations, showing its significant improvement over baseline methods.</p></details> |  |

The inherent uncertainty and variability in such data often render deterministic models insufficient, prompting a shift towards probabilistic approaches, where diffusion-based generative models have emerged as effective solutions. In this paper, we present ProGen, a novel framework for probabilistic spatiotemporal time series forecasting that leverages Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs) and diffusion-based generative modeling techniques in the continuous domain. By integrating a novel denoising score model, graph neural networks, and a tailored SDE, ProGen provides a robust solution that effectively captures spatiotemporal dependencies while managing uncertainty. Our extensive experiments on four benchmark traffic datasets demonstrate that ProGen outperforms state-of-the-art deterministic and probabilistic models. This work contributes a continuous, diffusion-based generative approach to spatiotemporal forecasting, paving the way for future research in probabilistic modeling and stochastic processes.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods struggle to address the complex, temporally dynamic nature of endoscopic scenes. This paper presents ST-Endo4DGS, a novel framework that models the spatio-temporal volume of dynamic endoscopic scenes using unbiased 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS) primitives, parameterized by anisotropic ellipses with flexible 4D rotations. This approach enables precise representation of deformable tissue dynamics, capturing intricate spatial and temporal correlations in real time. Additionally, we extend spherindrical harmonics to represent time-evolving appearance, achieving realistic adaptations to lighting and view changes. A new endoscopic normal alignment constraint (ENAC) further enhances geometric fidelity by aligning rendered normals with depth-derived geometry. Extensive evaluations show that ST-Endo4DGS outperforms existing methods in both visual quality and real-time performance, establishing a new state-of-the-art in dynamic scene reconstruction for endoscopic surgery.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Unifying Approach to Product Constructions for Quantitative Temporal Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10465v2)** | 2024-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Probabilistic programs are a powerful and convenient approach to formalise distributions over system executions. A classical verification problem for probabilistic programs is temporal inference: to compute the likelihood that the execution traces satisfy a given temporal property. This paper presents a general framework for temporal inference, which applies to a rich variety of quantitative models including those that arise in the operational semantics of probabilistic and weighted programs. The key idea underlying our framework is that in a variety of existing approaches, the main construction that enables temporal inference is that of a product between the system of interest and the temporal property. We provide a unifying mathematical definition of product constructions, enabled by the realisation that 1) both systems and temporal properties can be modelled as coalgebras and 2) product constructions are distributive laws in this context. Our categorical framework leads us to our main contribution: a sufficient condition for correctness, which is precisely what enables to use the product construction for temporal inference. We show that our framework can be instantiated to naturally recover a number of disparate approaches from the literature including, e.g., partial expected rewards in Markov reward models, resource-sensitive reachability analysis, and weighted optimization problems. Further, we demonstrate a product of weighted programs and weighted temporal properties as a new instance to show the scalability of our approach.</p></details> | Preprint |

At the core of the framework is an adaptive memory designed to accommodate dynamic changes in context over time, alongside a feature augmentation module that enhances the frames with the memory. In addition, we propose a post-processing approach to mitigate the severe over-segmentation in the online setting. On three common segmentation benchmarks, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 4 figures, 12 tables.

One promising approach to tackle this challenge is to adopt existing expert video demonstrations for policy learning. Some recent work investigates how to learn robot policies from only a single/few expert video demonstrations. For example, reward labeling via Optimal Transport (OT) has been shown to be an effective strategy to generate a proxy reward by measuring the alignment between the robot trajectory and the expert demonstrations. However, previous work mostly overlooks that the OT reward is invariant to temporal order information, which could bring extra noise to the reward signal. To address this issue, in this paper, we introduce the Temporal Optimal Transport (TemporalOT) reward to incorporate temporal order information for learning a more accurate OT-based proxy reward. Extensive experiments on the Meta-world benchmark tasks validate the efficacy of the proposed method. Code is available at: https://github.com/fuyw/TemporalOT</p></details> | NeurIPS 2024 |

Our approach captures temporal and feature dependencies within a unified spatio-temporal pipeline by leveraging a GCNN that uses a spatio-temporal graph aimed at optimizing predictive accuracy and interoperability. For graph estimation, we introduce techniques, including one based on the (heterogeneous) Gower distance. Once estimated, we propose two methods for graph construction: one based on the Cartesian product, treating temporal instants homogeneously, and another spatio-temporal approach with distinct graphs per time step. We also propose two GCNN architectures: a standard GCNN with a normalized adjacency matrix and a higher-order polynomial GCNN. In addition to accuracy, we emphasize explainability by designing an inherently interpretable model and performing a thorough interpretability analysis, identifying key feature-time combinations that drive predictions. We evaluate XST-GCNN using real-world Electronic Health Record data from University Hospital of Fuenlabrada to predict Multidrug Resistance (MDR) in ICU patients, a critical healthcare challenge linked to high mortality and complex treatments. Our architecture outperforms traditional models, achieving a mean ROC-AUC score of 81.03 +- 2.43. Furthermore, the interpretability analysis provides actionable insights into clinical factors driving MDR predictions, enhancing model transparency. This work sets a benchmark for tackling complex inference tasks with heterogeneous MTS, offering a versatile, interpretable solution for real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

However, prior work has primarily focused on capturing temporal interactions within individual samples and fusing multimodal information, overlooking critical temporal patterns across patients. These patterns, such as trends in vital signs like abnormal heart rate or blood pressure, can indicate deteriorating health or an impending critical event. Similarly, clinical notes often contain textual descriptions that reflect these patterns. Identifying corresponding temporal patterns across different modalities is crucial for improving the accuracy of clinical outcome predictions, yet it remains a challenging task. To address this gap, we introduce a Cross-Modal Temporal Pattern Discovery (CTPD) framework, designed to efficiently extract meaningful cross-modal temporal patterns from multimodal EHR data. Our approach introduces shared initial temporal pattern representations which are refined using slot attention to generate temporal semantic embeddings. To ensure rich cross-modal temporal semantics in the learned patterns, we introduce a contrastive-based TPNCE loss for cross-modal alignment, along with two reconstruction losses to retain core information of each modality. Evaluations on two clinically critical tasks, 48-hour in-hospital mortality and 24-hour phenotype classification, using the MIMIC-III database demonstrate the superiority of our method over existing approaches.</p></details> | Technical report |

However, Transformer's complex architecture and black-box nature pose challenges for explainability, a crucial aspect for real-world applications and scientific inquiry. Current Explainable AI (XAI) methods can only provide one-dimensional feature importance, either spatial or temporal explanation, with significant computational complexity. This paper introduces STAA (Spatio-Temporal Attention Attribution), an XAI method for interpreting video Transformer models. Differ from traditional methods that separately apply image XAI techniques for spatial features or segment contribution analysis for temporal aspects, STAA offers both spatial and temporal information simultaneously from attention values in Transformers. The study utilizes the Kinetics-400 dataset, a benchmark collection of 400 human action classes used for action recognition research. We introduce metrics to quantify explanations. We also apply optimization to enhance STAA's raw output. By implementing dynamic thresholding and attention focusing mechanisms, we improve the signal-to-noise ratio in our explanations, resulting in more precise visualizations and better evaluation results. In terms of computational overhead, our method requires less than 3\% of the computational resources of traditional XAI methods, making it suitable for real-time video XAI analysis applications. STAA contributes to the growing field of XAI by offering a method for researchers and practitioners to analyze Transformer models.</p></details> |  |

A Contrastive Method](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00612v1)** | 2024-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal Heterogeneous Networks play a crucial role in capturing the dynamics and heterogeneity inherent in various real-world complex systems, rendering them a noteworthy research avenue for link prediction. However, existing methods fail to capture the fine-grained differential distribution patterns and temporal dynamic characteristics, which we refer to as spatial heterogeneity and temporal heterogeneity. To overcome such limitations, we propose a novel \textbf{C}ontrastive Learning-based \textbf{L}ink \textbf{P}rediction model, \textbf{CLP}, which employs a multi-view hierarchical self-supervised architecture to encode spatial and temporal heterogeneity. Specifically, aiming at spatial heterogeneity, we develop a spatial feature modeling layer to capture the fine-grained topological distribution patterns from node- and edge-level representations, respectively. Furthermore, aiming at temporal heterogeneity, we devise a temporal information modeling layer to perceive the evolutionary dependencies of dynamic graph topologies from time-level representations. Finally, we encode the spatial and temporal distribution heterogeneity from a contrastive learning perspective, enabling a comprehensive self-supervised hierarchical relation modeling for the link prediction task. Extensive experiments conducted on four real-world dynamic heterogeneous network datasets verify that our \mymodel consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art models, demonstrating an average improvement of 10.10\%, 13.44\% in terms of AUC and AP, respectively.</p></details> |  |

Current state-of-the-art methods either require multiple independent stages of processing that employ motion cues or, in the case of end-to-end trainable networks, lack in segmentation accuracy, in part due to the difficulty of learning segmentation maps from videos with transient object presence. This limits the application of WSVOS for semantic annotation of surgical videos where multiple surgical tools frequently move in and out of the field of view, a problem that is more difficult than typically encountered in WSVOS. This paper introduces Video Spatio-Temporal Disentanglement Networks (VDST-Net), a framework to disentangle spatiotemporal information using semi-decoupled knowledge distillation to predict high-quality class activation maps (CAMs). A teacher network designed to resolve temporal conflicts when specifics about object location and timing in the video are not provided works with a student network that integrates information over time by leveraging temporal dependencies. We demonstrate the efficacy of our framework on a public reference dataset and on a more challenging surgical video dataset where objects are, on average, present in less than 60\% of annotated frames. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques and generates superior segmentation masks under video-level weak supervision.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV)</p></details> |

Recent catastrophic events in Pakistan and New Zealand underscore the urgent need for precise flood mapping to guide restoration efforts, understand vulnerabilities, and prepare for future occurrences. While Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) remote sensing offers day-and-night, all-weather imaging capabilities, its application in deep learning for flood segmentation is limited by the lack of large annotated datasets. To address this, we introduce Kuro Siwo, a manually annotated multi-temporal dataset, spanning 43 flood events globally. Our dataset maps more than 338 billion $m^2$ of land, with 33 billion designated as either flooded areas or permanent water bodies. Kuro Siwo includes a highly processed product optimized for flood mapping based on SAR Ground Range Detected, and a primal SAR Single Look Complex product with minimal preprocessing, designed to promote research on the exploitation of both the phase and amplitude information and to offer maximum flexibility for downstream task preprocessing. To leverage advances in large scale self-supervised pretraining methods for remote sensing data, we augment Kuro Siwo with a large unlabeled set of SAR samples. Finally, we provide an extensive benchmark, namely BlackBench, offering strong baselines for a diverse set of flood events from Europe, America, Africa, Asia and Australia.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 38th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2024) Track on Datasets and Benchmarks</p></details> |
| **[Modelling multivariate spatio-temporal data with identifiable variational autoencoders](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04162v2)** | 2024-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modelling multivariate spatio-temporal data with complex dependency structures is a challenging task but can be simplified by assuming that the original variables are generated from independent latent components. If these components are found, they can be modelled univariately. Blind source separation aims to recover the latent components by estimating the unmixing transformation based on the observed data only. The current methods for spatio-temporal blind source separation are restricted to linear unmixing, and nonlinear variants have not been implemented. In this paper, we extend identifiable variational autoencoder to the nonlinear nonstationary spatio-temporal blind source separation setting and demonstrate its performance using comprehensive simulation studies. Additionally, we introduce two alternative methods for the latent dimension estimation, which is a crucial task in order to obtain the correct latent representation. Finally, we illustrate the proposed methods using a meteorological application, where we estimate the latent dimension and the latent components, interpret the components, and show how nonstationarity can be accounted and prediction accuracy can be improved by using the proposed nonlinear blind source separation method as a preprocessing method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Human Action Recognition (HAR) Using Skeleton-based Spatial Temporal Relative Transformer Network: ST-RTR](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23806v2)** | 2024-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human Action Recognition (HAR) is an interesting research area in human-computer interaction used to monitor the activities of elderly and disabled individuals affected by physical and mental health. In the recent era, skeleton-based HAR has received much attention because skeleton data has shown that it can handle changes in striking, body size, camera views, and complex backgrounds. One key characteristic of ST-GCN is automatically learning spatial and temporal patterns from skeleton sequences. It has some limitations, as this method only works for short-range correlation due to its limited receptive field. Consequently, understanding human action requires long-range interconnection. To address this issue, we developed a spatial-temporal relative transformer ST-RTR model. The ST-RTR includes joint and relay nodes, which allow efficient communication and data transmission within the network. These nodes help to break the inherent spatial and temporal skeleton topologies, which enables the model to understand long-range human action better. Furthermore, we combine ST-RTR with a fusion model for further performance improvements. To assess the performance of the ST-RTR method, we conducted experiments on three skeleton-based HAR benchmarks: NTU RGB+D 60, NTU RGB+D 120, and UAV-Human. It boosted CS and CV by 2.11 % and 1.45% on NTU RGB+D 60, 1.25% and 1.05% on NTU RGB+D 120. On UAV-Human datasets, accuracy improved by 2.54%. The experimental outcomes explain that the proposed ST-RTR model significantly improves action recognition associated with the standard ST-GCN method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving Traffic Flow Predictions with SGCN-LSTM: A Hybrid Model for Spatial and Temporal Dependencies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00282v1)** | 2024-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large amounts of traffic can lead to negative effects such as increased car accidents, air pollution, and significant time wasted. Understanding traffic speeds on any given road segment can be highly beneficial for traffic management strategists seeking to reduce congestion. While recent studies have primarily focused on modeling spatial dependencies by using graph convolutional networks (GCNs) over fixed weighted graphs, the relationships between nodes are often more complex, with edges that interact dynamically. This paper addresses both the temporal patterns in traffic data and the intricate spatial dependencies by introducing the Signal-Enhanced Graph Convolutional Network Long Short Term Memory (SGCN-LSTM) model for predicting traffic speeds across road networks. Extensive experiments on the PEMS-BAY road network traffic dataset demonstrate the SGCN-LSTM model's effectiveness, yielding significant improvements in Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) compared to benchmark models on the same dataset.</p></details> | 5 pages, 6 figures |

We construct a dataset containing audio samples from music covers on YouTube along with the audio of the original song, and sentiment scores derived from user comments, serving as proxy labels for content quality. Our approach involves extensive pre-processing, segmenting audio signals into 30-second windows, and extracting high-dimensional feature representations through Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC), Chroma, Spectral Contrast, and Temporal characteristics. Leveraging these features, we train regression models to predict sentiment scores on a 0-100 scale, achieving root mean square error (RMSE) values of 3.420, 5.482, 2.783, and 4.212, respectively. Improvements over a baseline model based on absolute difference metrics are observed. These results demonstrate the potential of machine learning to capture sentiment and similarity in audio, offering an adaptable framework for AI applications in media analysis.</p></details> | 6 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Continuous Spatio-Temporal Memory Networks for 4D Cardiac Cine MRI Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23191v2)** | 2024-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current cardiac cine magnetic resonance image (cMR) studies focus on the end diastole (ED) and end systole (ES) phases, while ignoring the abundant temporal information in the whole image sequence. This is because whole sequence segmentation is currently a tedious process and inaccurate. Conventional whole sequence segmentation approaches first estimate the motion field between frames, which is then used to propagate the mask along the temporal axis. However, the mask propagation results could be prone to error, especially for the basal and apex slices, where through-plane motion leads to significant morphology and structural change during the cardiac cycle. Inspired by recent advances in video object segmentation (VOS), based on spatio-temporal memory (STM) networks, we propose a continuous STM (CSTM) network for semi-supervised whole heart and whole sequence cMR segmentation. Our CSTM network takes full advantage of the spatial, scale, temporal and through-plane continuity prior of the underlying heart anatomy structures, to achieve accurate and fast 4D segmentation. Results of extensive experiments across multiple cMR datasets show that our method can improve the 4D cMR segmentation performance, especially for the hard-to-segment regions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to WACV 2025</p></details> |
| **[Identifying Spatio-Temporal Drivers of Extreme Events](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24075v1)** | 2024-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The spatio-temporal relations of impacts of extreme events and their drivers in climate data are not fully understood and there is a need of machine learning approaches to identify such spatio-temporal relations from data. The task, however, is very challenging since there are time delays between extremes and their drivers, and the spatial response of such drivers is inhomogeneous. In this work, we propose a first approach and benchmarks to tackle this challenge. Our approach is trained end-to-end to predict spatio-temporally extremes and spatio-temporally drivers in the physical input variables jointly. By enforcing the network to predict extremes from spatio-temporal binary masks of identified drivers, the network successfully identifies drivers that are correlated with extremes. We evaluate our approach on three newly created synthetic benchmarks, where two of them are based on remote sensing or reanalysis climate data, and on two real-world reanalysis datasets.

| **[Will LLMs Replace the Encoder-Only Models in Temporal Relation Classification?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10476v2)** | 2024-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The automatic detection of temporal relations among events has been mainly investigated with encoder-only models such as RoBERTa. Large Language Models (LLM) have recently shown promising performance in temporal reasoning tasks such as temporal question answering. Nevertheless, recent studies have tested the LLMs' performance in detecting temporal relations of closed-source models only, limiting the interpretability of those results. In this work, we investigate LLMs' performance and decision process in the Temporal Relation Classification task. First, we assess the performance of seven open and closed-sourced LLMs experimenting with in-context learning and lightweight fine-tuning approaches. Results show that LLMs with in-context learning significantly underperform smaller encoder-only models based on RoBERTa. Then, we delve into the possible reasons for this gap by applying explainable methods. The outcome suggests a limitation of LLMs in this task due to their autoregressive nature, which causes them to focus only on the last part of the sequence. Additionally, we evaluate the word embeddings of these two models to better understand their pre-training differences. The code and the fine-tuned models can be found respectively on GitHub.</p></details> |  |
| **[Asynchronous Jump Testing and Estimation in High Dimensions Under Complex Temporal Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23706v1)** | 2024-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most high dimensional changepoint detection methods assume the error process is stationary and changepoints occur synchronously across dimensions. The violation of these assumptions, which in applied settings is increasingly likely as the dimensionality of the time series being analyzed grows, can dramatically curtail the sensitivity or the accuracy of these methods. We propose AJDN (Asynchronous Jump Detection under Nonstationary noise). AJDN is a high dimensional multiscale jump detection method that tests and estimates jumps in an otherwise smoothly varying mean function for high dimensional time series with nonstationary noise where the jumps across dimensions may not occur at the same time. AJDN is correct in the sense that it detects the correct number of jumps with a prescribed probability asymptotically and its accuracy in estimating the locations of the jumps is asymptotically nearly optimal under the asynchronous jump assumption. Through a simulation study we demonstrate AJDN's robustness across a wide variety of stationary and nonstationary high dimensional time series, and we show its strong performance relative to some existing high dimensional changepoint detection methods. We apply AJDN to a seismic time series to demonstrate its ability to accurately detect jumps in real-world high dimensional time series with complex temporal dynamics.</p></details> |  |

Recently, transformer based models have shown remarkable potential in weather forecasting achieving state-of-the-art results. However, transformers are discrete and physics-agnostic models which limit their ability to learn the continuous spatio-temporal features of the dynamical weather system. We address this issue with STC-ViT, a Spatio-Temporal Continuous Vision Transformer for weather forecasting. STC-ViT incorporates the continuous time Neural ODE layers with multi-head attention mechanism to learn the continuous weather evolution over time. The attention mechanism is encoded as a differentiable function in the transformer architecture to model the complex weather dynamics. Further, we define a customised physics informed loss for STC-ViT which penalize the model's predictions for deviating away from physical laws. We evaluate STC-ViT against operational Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) model and several deep learning based weather forecasting models. STC-ViT, trained on 1.5-degree 6-hourly data, demonstrates computational efficiency and competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art data-driven models trained on higher-resolution data for global forecasting.</p></details> |  |

In contrast, biological control achieves remarkable performance while also optimizing computational energy expenditure and decision frequency. We propose a Decision Bounded Markov Decision Process (DB-MDP), that constrains the number of decisions and computational energy available to agents in reinforcement learning environments. Our experiments demonstrate that existing reinforcement learning algorithms struggle within this framework, leading to either failure or suboptimal performance. To address this, we introduce a biologically-inspired, Temporally Layered Architecture (TLA), enabling agents to manage computational costs through two layers with distinct time scales and energy requirements. TLA achieves optimal performance in decision-bounded environments and in continuous control environments, it matches state-of-the-art performance while utilizing a fraction of the compute cost. Compared to current reinforcement learning algorithms that solely prioritize performance, our approach significantly lowers computational energy expenditure while maintaining performance. These findings establish a benchmark and pave the way for future research on energy and time-aware control.</p></details> | <details><summary>50 Pa...</summary><p>50 Pages, 9 Figures, 6 Tables.

We study this setting, as well as a number of its special cases formed by the restrictions to two agents, same goods on each day, identical preferences, or combinations thereof, and chart out the landscape of achieving two types of fairness guarantees simultaneously: fairness on each day (per day) and fairness over time (up to each day, or the weaker version, overall). In the most general setting, we prove that there always exists an allocation that is stochastically-dominant envy-free up to one good (SD-EF1) per day and proportional up to one good (PROP1) overall, and when all the agents have identical preferences, we show that SD-EF1 per day and SD-EF1 overall can be guaranteed. For the case of two agents, we prove that SD-EF1 per day and EF1 up to each day can be guaranteed using an envy balancing technique. We provide counterexamples for other combinations that establish our results as among the best guarantees possible, but also leaving open some tantalizing questions.</p></details> |  |

As such, gaze deployment crucially is a temporal process. Existing computational models have made significant strides in predicting spatial aspects of observer's visual scanpaths (where to look), while often putting on the background the temporal facet of attention dynamics (when). In this paper we present TPP-Gaze, a novel and principled approach to model scanpath dynamics based on Neural Temporal Point Process (TPP), that jointly learns the temporal dynamics of fixations position and duration, integrating deep learning methodologies with point process theory.

However, how well do the models truly perform visual temporal reasoning? Our study of existing benchmarks shows that this capability of MFMs is likely overestimated as many questions can be solved by using a single, few, or out-of-order frames. To systematically examine current visual temporal reasoning tasks, we propose three principles with corresponding metrics: (1) Multi-Frame Gain, (2) Frame Order Sensitivity, and (3) Frame Information Disparity. Following these principles, we introduce TOMATO, Temporal Reasoning Multimodal Evaluation, a novel benchmark crafted to rigorously assess MFMs' temporal reasoning capabilities in video understanding. TOMATO comprises 1,484 carefully curated, human-annotated questions spanning six tasks (i.e., action count, direction, rotation, shape & trend, velocity & frequency, and visual cues), applied to 1,417 videos, including 805 self-recorded and -generated videos, that encompass human-centric, real-world, and simulated scenarios. Our comprehensive evaluation reveals a human-model performance gap of 57.3% with the best-performing model. Moreover, our in-depth analysis uncovers more fundamental limitations beyond this gap in current MFMs. While they can accurately recognize events in isolated frames, they fail to interpret these frames as a continuous sequence. We believe TOMATO will serve as a crucial testbed for evaluating the next-generation MFMs and as a call to the community to develop AI systems capable of comprehending human world dynamics through the video modality.</p></details> |  |

However, the scarcity of data coupled with the high expenses involved in sensor deployment results in notable data imbalances. Furthermore, models that are excessively customized and devoid of causal connections further undermine the generalizability and interpretability. To this end, we establish a causal framework for ST predictions, termed CaPaint, which targets to identify causal regions in data and endow model with causal reasoning ability in a two-stage process. Going beyond this process, we utilize the back-door adjustment to specifically address the sub-regions identified as non-causal in the upstream phase. Specifically, we employ a novel image inpainting technique. By using a fine-tuned unconditional Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) as the generative prior, we in-fill the masks defined as environmental parts, offering the possibility of reliable extrapolation for potential data distributions. CaPaint overcomes the high complexity dilemma of optimal ST causal discovery models by reducing the data generation complexity from exponential to quasi-linear levels. Extensive experiments conducted on five real-world ST benchmarks demonstrate that integrating the CaPaint concept allows models to achieve improvements ranging from 4.3% to 77.3%. Moreover, compared to traditional mainstream ST augmenters, CaPaint underscores the potential of diffusion models in ST enhancement, offering a novel paradigm for this field.

However, numerous benign conditions can cause increased uptake of radiopharmaceuticals, confounding differentiation from malignant tumors. Several studies have indicated that dual-time PET imaging holds promise in distinguishing between malignant and benign tumor processes. Nevertheless, the hour-long distribution period of radiopharmaceuticals post-injection complicates the determination of optimal timing for the second scan, presenting challenges in both practical applications and research. Notably, we have identified that delay time PET imaging can be framed as an image-to-image conversion problem. Motivated by this insight, we propose a novel spatial-temporal guided diffusion transformer probabilistic model (st-DTPM) to solve dual-time PET imaging prediction problem. Specifically, this architecture leverages the U-net framework that integrates patch-wise features of CNN and pixel-wise relevance of Transformer to obtain local and global information. And then employs a conditional DDPM model for image synthesis. Furthermore, on spatial condition, we concatenate early scan PET images and noisy PET images on every denoising step to guide the spatial distribution of denoising sampling. On temporal condition, we convert diffusion time steps and delay time to a universal time vector, then embed it to each layer of model architecture to further improve the accuracy of predictions. Experimental results demonstrated the superiority of our method over alternative approaches in preserving image quality and structural information, thereby affirming its efficacy in predictive task.</p></details> |  |
| **[Identifying Drift, Diffusion, and Causal Structure from Temporal Snapshots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22729v1)** | 2024-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Stochastic differential equations (SDEs) are a fundamental tool for modelling dynamic processes, including gene regulatory networks (GRNs), contaminant transport, financial markets, and image generation. However, learning the underlying SDE from observational data is a challenging task, especially when individual trajectories are not observable. Motivated by burgeoning research in single-cell datasets, we present the first comprehensive approach for jointly estimating the drift and diffusion of an SDE from its temporal marginals. Assuming linear drift and additive diffusion, we prove that these parameters are identifiable from marginals if and only if the initial distribution is not invariant to a class of generalized rotations, a condition that is satisfied by most distributions. We further prove that the causal graph of any SDE with additive diffusion can be recovered from the SDE parameters. To complement this theory, we adapt entropy-regularized optimal transport to handle anisotropic diffusion, and introduce APPEX (Alternating Projection Parameter Estimation from $X_0$), an iterative algorithm designed to estimate the drift, diffusion, and causal graph of an additive noise SDE, solely from temporal marginals. We show that each of these steps are asymptotically optimal with respect to the Kullback-Leibler divergence, and demonstrate APPEX's effectiveness on simulated data from linear additive noise SDEs.</p></details> |  |

| **[An Overtaking Trajectory Planning Framework Based on Spatio-temporal Topology and Reachable Set Analysis Ensuring Time Efficiency](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22643v1)** | 2024-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating overtaking trajectories in high-speed scenarios presents significant challenges and is typically addressed through hierarchical planning methods. However, this method has two primary drawbacks. First, heuristic algorithms can only provide a single initial solution, which may lead to local optima and consequently diminish the quality of the solution. Second, the time efficiency of trajectory refinement based on numerical optimization is insufficient. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes an overtaking trajectory planning framework based on spatio-temporal topology and reachable set analysis (SROP), to improve trajectory quality and time efficiency. Specifically, this paper introduces topological classes to describe trajectories representing different overtaking behaviors, which support the spatio-temporal topological search method employed by the upper-layer planner to identify diverse initial paths. This approach helps prevent getting stuck in local optima, enhancing the overall solution quality by considering multiple initial solutions from distinct topologies. Moreover, the reachable set method is integrated into the lower-layer planner for parallel trajectory evaluation. This method enhances planning efficiency by decoupling vehicle model constraints from the optimization process, enabling parallel computation while ensuring control feasibility. Simulation results show that the proposed method improves the smoothness of generated trajectories by 66.8% compared to state-of-the-art methods, highlighting its effectiveness in enhancing trajectory quality. Additionally, this method reduces computation time by 62.9%, demonstrating its efficiency.</p></details> |  |

Specifically, a deep evolutionary clustering module is proposed to capture the temporal evolution of high-order correlations among entities. Furthermore, a cluster-aware unsupervised alignment mechanism is introduced to ensure the precise one-to-one alignment of soft overlapping clusters across timestamps, thereby maintaining the temporal smoothness of clusters. In addition, an implicit correlation encoder is introduced to capture latent correlations between any pair of clusters under the guidance of a global graph. Extensive experiments on seven real-world datasets demonstrate that DECRL achieves the state-of-the-art performances, outperforming the best baseline by an average of 9.53%, 12.98%, 10.42%, and 14.68% in MRR, Hits@1, Hits@3, and Hits@10, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2024, 17 pages, and 3 figures</p></details> |
| **[Cops & Robber on Periodic Temporal Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22618v1)** | 2024-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the Cops and Robber pursuit-evasion game when the edge-set of the graph is allowed to change in time, possibly at every round. Specifically, the game is played on an infinite periodic sequence $\mathcal{G} = (G_0, \dots, G_{p-1})^*$ of graphs on the same set $V$ of $n$ vertices: in round $t$, the topology of $\mathcal{G}$ is $G_i=(V,E_i)$ where $i\equiv t \pmod{p}$. Concentrating on the case of a single cop, we provide a characterization of copwin periodic temporal graphs, establishing several basic properties on their nature, and extending to the temporal domain classical C&R concepts such as covers and corners. Based on these results, we design an efficient algorithm for determining if a periodic temporal graph is copwin. We also consider the case of $k>1$ cops. By shifting from a representation in terms of directed graphs to one in terms of directed multi-hypergraphs, we prove that all the fundamental properties established for $k=1$ continue to hold, providing a characterization of $k$-copwin periodic graphs, as well as a general strategy to determine if a periodic graph is $k$-copwin. Our results do not rely on any assumption on properties such as connectivity, symmetry, reflexivity held by the individual graphs in the sequence. They are established for a unified version of the game that includes the standard games studied in the literature, both for undirected and directed graphs, and both when the players are fully active and when they are not. They hold also for a variety of settings not considered in the literature.</p></details> |  |
| **[Temporal and Spatial Super Resolution with Latent Diffusion Model in Medical MRI images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23898v1)** | 2024-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Super Resolution (SR) plays a critical role in computer vision, particularly in medical imaging, where hardware and acquisition time constraints often result in low spatial and temporal resolution. While diffusion models have been applied for both spatial and temporal SR, few studies have explored their use for joint spatial and temporal SR, particularly in medical imaging. In this work, we address this gap by proposing to use a Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) combined with a Vector Quantised GAN (VQGAN)-based encoder-decoder architecture for joint super resolution. We frame SR as an image denoising problem, focusing on improving both spatial and temporal resolution in medical images. Using the cardiac MRI dataset from the Data Science Bowl Cardiac Challenge, consisting of 2D cine images with a spatial resolution of 256x256 and 8-14 slices per time-step, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Our LDM model achieves Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) of 30.37, Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) of 0.7580, and Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity (LPIPS) of 0.2756, outperforming simple baseline method by 5% in PSNR, 6.5% in SSIM, 39% in LPIPS. Our LDM model generates images with high fidelity and perceptual quality with 15 diffusion steps. These results suggest that LDMs hold promise for advancing super resolution in medical imaging, potentially enhancing diagnostic accuracy and patient outcomes. Code link is also shared.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Spatial-Spectral and Temporal Dual Prototype Network for Motor Imagery Brain-Computer Interface](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03177v2)** | 2024-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motor imagery electroencephalogram (MI-EEG) decoding plays a crucial role in developing motor imagery brain-computer interfaces (MI-BCIs). However, decoding intentions from MI remains challenging due to the inherent complexity of EEG signals relative to the small-sample size. To address this issue, we propose a spatial-spectral and temporal dual prototype network (SST-DPN). First, we design a lightweight attention mechanism to uniformly model the spatial-spectral relationships across multiple EEG electrodes, enabling the extraction of powerful spatial-spectral features. Then, we develop a multi-scale variance pooling module tailored for EEG signals to capture long-term temporal features. This module is parameter-free and computationally efficient, offering clear advantages over the widely used transformer models. Furthermore, we introduce dual prototype learning to optimize the feature space distribution and training process, thereby improving the model's generalization ability on small-sample MI datasets. Our experimental results show that the SST-DPN outperforms state-of-the-art models with superior classification accuracy (84.11% for dataset BCI4-2A, 86.65% for dataset BCI4-2B). Additionally, we use the BCI3-4A dataset with fewer training data to further validate the generalization ability of the proposed SST-DPN. We also achieve superior performance with 82.03% classification accuracy. Benefiting from the lightweight parameters and superior decoding accuracy, our SST-DPN shows great potential for practical MI-BCI applications. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/hancan16/SST-DPN.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hypergraph-based multi-scale spatio-temporal graph convolution network for Time-Series anomaly detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22256v1)** | 2024-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate time series anomaly detection technology plays an important role in many fields including aerospace, water treatment, cloud service providers, etc. Excellent anomaly detection models can greatly improve work efficiency and avoid major economic losses. However, with the development of technology, the increasing size and complexity of data, and the lack of labels for relevant abnormal data, it is becoming increasingly challenging to perform effective and accurate anomaly detection in high-dimensional and complex data sets. In this paper, we propose a hypergraph based spatiotemporal graph convolutional neural network model STGCN_Hyper, which explicitly captures high-order, multi-hop correlations between multiple variables through a hypergraph based dynamic graph structure learning module. On this basis, we further use the hypergraph based spatiotemporal graph convolutional network to utilize the learned hypergraph structure to effectively propagate and aggregate one-hop and multi-hop related node information in the convolutional network, thereby obtaining rich spatial information. Furthermore, through the multi-scale TCN dilated convolution module, the STGCN_hyper model can also capture the dependencies of features at different scales in the temporal dimension. An unsupervised anomaly detector based on PCA and GMM is also integrated into the STGCN_hyper model. Through the anomaly score of the detector, the model can detect the anomalies in an unsupervised way. Experimental results on multiple time series datasets show that our model can flexibly learn the multi-scale time series features in the data and the dependencies between features, and outperforms most existing baseline models in terms of precision, recall, F1-score on anomaly detection tasks. Our code is available on: https://git.ecdf.ed.ac.uk/msc-23-24/s2044819</p></details> |  |
| **[S-TLLR: STDP-inspired Temporal Local Learning Rule for Spiking Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15220v4)** | 2024-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are biologically plausible models that have been identified as potentially apt for deploying energy-efficient intelligence at the edge, particularly for sequential learning tasks. However, training of SNNs poses significant challenges due to the necessity for precise temporal and spatial credit assignment. Back-propagation through time (BPTT) algorithm, whilst the most widely used method for addressing these issues, incurs high computational cost due to its temporal dependency. In this work, we propose S-TLLR, a novel three-factor temporal local learning rule inspired by the Spike-Timing Dependent Plasticity (STDP) mechanism, aimed at training deep SNNs on event-based learning tasks. Furthermore, S-TLLR is designed to have low memory and time complexities, which are independent of the number of time steps, rendering it suitable for online learning on low-power edge devices. To demonstrate the scalability of our proposed method, we have conducted extensive evaluations on event-based datasets spanning a wide range of applications, such as image and gesture recognition, audio classification, and optical flow estimation. In all the experiments, S-TLLR achieved high accuracy, comparable to BPTT, with a reduction in memory between $5-50\times$ and multiply-accumulate (MAC) operations between $1.3-6.6\times$.</p></details> | 23 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Modeling Temporal Positive and Negative Excitation for Sequential Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22013v1)** | 2024-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sequential recommendation aims to predict the next item which interests users via modeling their interest in items over time. Most of the existing works on sequential recommendation model users' dynamic interest in specific items while overlooking users' static interest revealed by some static attribute information of items, e.g., category, or brand. Moreover, existing works often only consider the positive excitation of a user's historical interactions on his/her next choice on candidate items while ignoring the commonly existing negative excitation, resulting in insufficient modeling dynamic interest. The overlook of static interest and negative excitation will lead to incomplete interest modeling and thus impede the recommendation performance. To this end, in this paper, we propose modeling both static interest and negative excitation for dynamic interest to further improve the recommendation performance. Accordingly, we design a novel Static-Dynamic Interest Learning (SDIL) framework featured with a novel Temporal Positive and Negative Excitation Modeling (TPNE) module for accurate sequential recommendation. TPNE is specially designed for comprehensively modeling dynamic interest based on temporal positive and negative excitation learning. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets show that SDIL can effectively capture both static and dynamic interest and outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[State Space Models on Temporal Graphs: A First-Principles Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00943v2)** | 2024-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Over the past few years, research on deep graph learning has shifted from static graphs to temporal graphs in response to real-world complex systems that exhibit dynamic behaviors. In practice, temporal graphs are formalized as an ordered sequence of static graph snapshots observed at discrete time points. Sequence models such as RNNs or Transformers have long been the predominant backbone networks for modeling such temporal graphs. Yet, despite the promising results, RNNs struggle with long-range dependencies, while transformers are burdened by quadratic computational complexity. Recently, state space models (SSMs), which are framed as discretized representations of an underlying continuous-time linear dynamical system, have garnered substantial attention and achieved breakthrough advancements in independent sequence modeling. In this work, we undertake a principled investigation that extends SSM theory to temporal graphs by integrating structural information into the online approximation objective via the adoption of a Laplacian regularization term. The emergent continuous-time system introduces novel algorithmic challenges, thereby necessitating our development of GraphSSM, a graph state space model for modeling the dynamics of temporal graphs. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our GraphSSM framework across various temporal graph benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |
| **[Spatio-temporal Transformers for Action Unit Classification with Event Cameras](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21958v1)** | 2024-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Face analysis has been studied from different angles to infer emotion, poses, shapes, and landmarks. Traditionally RGB cameras are used, yet for fine-grained tasks standard sensors might not be up to the task due to their latency, making it impossible to record and detect micro-movements that carry a highly informative signal, which is necessary for inferring the true emotions of a subject. Event cameras have been increasingly gaining interest as a possible solution to this and similar high-frame rate tasks. We propose a novel spatiotemporal Vision Transformer model that uses Shifted Patch Tokenization (SPT) and Locality Self-Attention (LSA) to enhance the accuracy of Action Unit classification from event streams. We also address the lack of labeled event data in the literature, which can be considered one of the main causes of an existing gap between the maturity of RGB and neuromorphic vision models. Gathering data is harder in the event domain since it cannot be crawled from the web and labeling frames should take into account event aggregation rates and the fact that static parts might not be visible in certain frames. To this end, we present FACEMORPHIC, a temporally synchronized multimodal face dataset composed of RGB videos and event streams. The dataset is annotated at a video level with facial Action Units and contains streams collected with various possible applications, ranging from 3D shape estimation to lip-reading. We then show how temporal synchronization can allow effective neuromorphic face analysis without the need to manually annotate videos: we instead leverage cross-modal supervision bridging the domain gap by representing face shapes in a 3D space. Our proposed model outperforms baseline methods by effectively capturing spatial and temporal information, crucial for recognizing subtle facial micro-expressions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review at CVIU. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2409.10213</p></details> |
| **[Continuous Temporal Domain Generalization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16075v2)** | 2024-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal Domain Generalization (TDG) addresses the challenge of training predictive models under temporally varying data distributions. Traditional TDG approaches typically focus on domain data collected at fixed, discrete time intervals, which limits their capability to capture the inherent dynamics within continuous-evolving and irregularly-observed temporal domains. To overcome this, this work formalizes the concept of Continuous Temporal Domain Generalization (CTDG), where domain data are derived from continuous times and are collected at arbitrary times. CTDG tackles critical challenges including: 1) Characterizing the continuous dynamics of both data and models, 2) Learning complex high-dimensional nonlinear dynamics, and 3) Optimizing and controlling the generalization across continuous temporal domains. To address them, we propose a Koopman operator-driven continuous temporal domain generalization (Koodos) framework. We formulate the problem within a continuous dynamic system and leverage the Koopman theory to learn the underlying dynamics; the framework is further enhanced with a comprehensive optimization strategy equipped with analysis and control driven by prior knowledge of the dynamics patterns. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach.

The objective of the presented systematic literature review is hence to provide a comprehensive overview of the various modeling approaches and application domains of GNNs for time series classification and forecasting. A database search was conducted, and over 150 journal papers were selected for a detailed examination of the current state-of-the-art in the field. This examination is intended to offer to the reader a comprehensive collection of proposed models, links to related source code, available datasets, benchmark models, and fitting results. All this information is hoped to assist researchers in future studies. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic literature review presenting a detailed comparison of the results of current spatio-temporal GNN models in different domains. In addition, in its final part this review discusses current limitations and challenges in the application of spatio-temporal GNNs, such as comparability, reproducibility, explainability, poor information capacity, and scalability.</p></details> |  |

| **[A Temporal Linear Network for Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21448v1)** | 2024-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent research has challenged the necessity of complex deep learning architectures for time series forecasting, demonstrating that simple linear models can often outperform sophisticated approaches. Building upon this insight, we introduce a novel architecture the Temporal Linear Net (TLN), that extends the capabilities of linear models while maintaining interpretability and computational efficiency. TLN is designed to effectively capture both temporal and feature-wise dependencies in multivariate time series data. Our approach is a variant of TSMixer that maintains strict linearity throughout its architecture. TSMixer removes activation functions, introduces specialized kernel initializations, and incorporates dilated convolutions to handle various time scales, while preserving the linear nature of the model. Unlike transformer-based models that may lose temporal information due to their permutation-invariant nature, TLN explicitly preserves and leverages the temporal structure of the input data. A key innovation of TLN is its ability to compute an equivalent linear model, offering a level of interpretability not found in more complex architectures such as TSMixer. This feature allows for seamless conversion between the full TLN model and its linear equivalent, facilitating both training flexibility and inference optimization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hybrid Architecture for Real-Time Video Anomaly Detection: Integrating Spatial and Temporal Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15909v2)** | 2024-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a new architecture for real-time anomaly detection in video data, inspired by human behavior by combining spatial and temporal analyses. This approach uses two distinct models: for temporal analysis, a recurrent convolutional network (CNN + RNN) is employed, associating VGG19 and a GRU to process video sequences. Regarding spatial analysis, it is performed using YOLOv7 to analyze individual images. These two analyses can be carried out either in parallel, with a final prediction that combines the results of both analyses, or in series, where the spatial analysis enriches the data before the temporal analysis. In this article, we will compare these two architectural configurations with each other, to evaluate the effectiveness of our hybrid approach in video anomaly detection.</p></details> |  |
| **[Federated Time Series Generation on Feature and Temporally Misaligned Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21072v1)** | 2024-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Distributed time series data presents a challenge for federated learning, as clients often possess different feature sets and have misaligned time steps. Existing federated time series models are limited by the assumption of perfect temporal or feature alignment across clients. In this paper, we propose FedTDD, a novel federated time series diffusion model that jointly learns a synthesizer across clients. At the core of FedTDD is a novel data distillation and aggregation framework that reconciles the differences between clients by imputing the misaligned timesteps and features. In contrast to traditional federated learning, FedTDD learns the correlation across clients' time series through the exchange of local synthetic outputs instead of model parameters. A coordinator iteratively improves a global distiller network by leveraging shared knowledge from clients through the exchange of synthetic data. As the distiller becomes more refined over time, it subsequently enhances the quality of the clients' local feature estimates, allowing each client to then improve its local imputations for missing data using the latest, more accurate distiller. Experimental results on five datasets demonstrate FedTDD's effectiveness compared to centralized training, and the effectiveness of sharing synthetic outputs to transfer knowledge of local time series. Notably, FedTDD achieves 79.4% and 62.8% improvement over local training in Context-FID and Correlational scores.</p></details> |  |
| **[Label Attention Network for Temporal Sets Prediction: You Were Looking at a Wrong Self-Attention](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00280v3)** | 2024-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most user-related data can be represented as a sequence of events associated with a timestamp and a collection of categorical labels. For example, the purchased basket of goods and the time of buying fully characterize the event of the store visit. Anticipation of the label set for the future event called the problem of temporal sets prediction, holds significant value, especially in such high-stakes industries as finance and e-commerce. A fundamental challenge of this task is the joint consideration of the temporal nature of events and label relations within sets. The existing models fail to capture complex time and label dependencies due to ineffective representation of historical information initially. We aim to address this shortcoming by presenting the framework with a specific way to aggregate the observed information into time- and set structure-aware views prior to transferring it into main architecture blocks. Our strong emphasis on input arrangement facilitates the subsequent efficient learning of label interactions. The proposed model is called Label-Attention NETwork, or LANET. We conducted experiments on four different datasets and made a comparison with four established models, including SOTA, in this area. The experimental results suggest that LANET provides significantly better quality than any other model, achieving an improvement up to $65 \%$ in terms of weighted F1 metric compared to the closest competitor. Moreover, we contemplate causal relationships between labels in our work, as well as a thorough study of LANET components' influence on performance. We provide an implementation of LANET to encourage its wider usage.</p></details> |  |

However, adjusting specific elements in generated videos, such as object motion or camera movement, is often a tedious process of trial and error, e.g., involving re-generating videos with different random seeds. Recent techniques address this issue by fine-tuning a pre-trained model to follow conditioning signals, such as bounding boxes or point trajectories. Yet, this fine-tuning procedure can be computationally expensive, and it requires datasets with annotated object motion, which can be difficult to procure. In this work, we introduce SG-I2V, a framework for controllable image-to-video generation that is self-guided$\unicode{x2013}$offering zero-shot control by relying solely on the knowledge present in a pre-trained image-to-video diffusion model without the need for fine-tuning or external knowledge. Our zero-shot method outperforms unsupervised baselines while being competitive with supervised models in terms of visual quality and motion fidelity.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://kmcode1.github.io/Projects/SG-I2V/</p></details> |

Predicting future movement enables cameras to automatically track and predict a player's future trajectory without human intervention. Predicting future human movement in the context of complex physical tasks is also intellectually satisfying. Swift advancements in sports analytics and the wide availability of videos for tennis have inspired us to propose a novel method called Pose2Trajectory, which predicts a tennis player's future trajectory as a sequence derived from their body joints' data and ball position. Demonstrating impressive accuracy, our approach capitalizes on body joint information to provide a comprehensive understanding of the human body's geometry and motion, thereby enhancing the prediction of the player's trajectory. We use encoder-decoder Transformer architecture trained on the joints and trajectory information of the players with ball positions. The predicted sequence can provide information to help close-up cameras to keep tracking the tennis player, following centroid coordinates. We generate a high-quality dataset from multiple videos to assist tennis player movement prediction using object detection and human pose estimation methods. It contains bounding boxes and joint information for tennis players and ball positions in singles tennis games. Our method shows promising results in predicting the tennis player's movement trajectory with different sequence prediction lengths using the joints and trajectory information with the ball position.</p></details> |  |

To enable similar capabilities in quadruped robots, complex real-time jumping maneuvers are required. Current research does not adequately address the problem of online omnidirectional jumping and neglects the robot's kinodynamic constraints during trajectory generation. This paper proposes a general and complete cascade online optimization framework for omnidirectional jumping for quadruped robots. Our solution systematically encompasses jumping trajectory generation, a trajectory tracking controller, and a landing controller. It also incorporates environmental perception to navigate obstacles that standard locomotion cannot bypass, such as jumping from high platforms. We introduce a novel jumping plane to parameterize omnidirectional jumping motion and formulate a tightly coupled optimization problem accounting for the kinodynamic constraints, simultaneously optimizing CoM trajectory, Ground Reaction Forces (GRFs), and joint states. To meet the online requirements, we propose an accelerated evolutionary algorithm as the trajectory optimizer to address the complexity of kinodynamic constraints. To ensure stability and accuracy in environmental perception post-landing, we introduce a coarse-to-fine relocalization method that combines global Branch and Bound (BnB) search with Maximum a Posteriori (MAP) estimation for precise positioning during navigation and jumping. The proposed framework achieves jump trajectory generation in approximately 0.1 seconds with a warm start and has been successfully validated on two quadruped robots on uneven terrains. Additionally, we extend the framework's versatility to humanoid robots.</p></details> | Submitted to IJRR |

Both of these tasks often require filling gaps in a partially specified sequence of visits - a new problem that we call "controlled" synthetic trajectory generation. Existing methods for next-location prediction or synthetic trajectory generation cannot solve this problem as they lack the mechanisms needed to constrain the generated sequences of visits. Moreover, existing approaches (1) frequently treat space and time as independent factors, an assumption that fails to hold true in real-world scenarios, and (2) suffer from challenges in accuracy of temporal prediction as they fail to deal with mixed distributions and the inter-relationships of different modes with latent variables (e.g., day-of-the-week). These limitations become even more pronounced when the task involves filling gaps within sequences instead of solely predicting the next visit. We introduce TrajGPT, a transformer-based, multi-task, joint spatiotemporal generative model to address these issues. Taking inspiration from large language models, TrajGPT poses the problem of controlled trajectory generation as that of text infilling in natural language. TrajGPT integrates the spatial and temporal models in a transformer architecture through a Bayesian probability model that ensures that the gaps in a visit sequence are filled in a spatiotemporally consistent manner. Our experiments on public and private datasets demonstrate that TrajGPT not only excels in controlled synthetic visit generation but also outperforms competing models in next-location prediction tasks - Relatively, TrajGPT achieves a 26-fold improvement in temporal accuracy while retaining more than 98% of spatial accuracy on average.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 3 figures, 32nd ACM SIGSPATIAL International Conference on Advances in Geographic Information Systems (ACM SIGSPATIAL 2024)</p></details> |

Data augmentation techniques, such as noise injection and data synthesizing, aim to improve Q-function approximation by smoothing the learned state-action region. However, these methods often fall short of directly improving the quality of offline datasets, leading to suboptimal results. In response, we introduce GTA, Generative Trajectory Augmentation, a novel generative data augmentation approach designed to enrich offline data by augmenting trajectories to be both high-rewarding and dynamically plausible. GTA applies a diffusion model within the data augmentation framework. GTA partially noises original trajectories and then denoises them with classifier-free guidance via conditioning on amplified return value. Our results show that GTA, as a general data augmentation strategy, enhances the performance of widely used offline RL algorithms across various tasks with unique challenges. Furthermore, we conduct a quality analysis of data augmented by GTA and demonstrate that GTA improves the quality of the data.

While prior research has typically focused on either prediction or generation, our approach unifies these tasks to provide a versatile framework and achieve state-of-the-art performance. While diffusion models excel in trajectory generation, their iterative sampling process is computationally intensive, hindering robotic systems' dynamic capabilities. We introduce Trajectory Conditional Flow Matching (T-CFM), a novel approach using flow matching techniques to learn a solver time-varying vector field for efficient, fast trajectory generation. T-CFM demonstrates effectiveness in adversarial tracking, real-world aircraft trajectory forecasting, and long-horizon planning, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines with 35% higher predictive accuracy and 142% improved planning performance. Crucially, T-CFM achieves up to 100$\times$ speed-up compared to diffusion models without sacrificing accuracy, enabling real-time decision making in robotics.

The convex cover consists of a set of polytopes such that the union of the polytopes represents obstacle-free space, allowing us to find trajectories for robots that lie within the convex cover. In order to find the SFC that facilitates optimal trajectory generation, we iteratively find overlapping polytopes of maximum volumes that include specified waypoints initialized by a geometric or kinematic planner. Constraints at waypoints appear in two alternating stages of a joint optimization problem, which is solved by a method inspired by the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) with partially distributed variables. We validate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm using a range of parameterized environments and show its applications for two-stage motion planning.</p></details> |  |

However, extensive demonstrations are required for policy robustness and generalization. To reduce the demonstration reliance, we leverage spatial symmetry and propose ET-SEED, an efficient trajectory-level SE(3) equivariant diffusion model for generating action sequences in complex robot manipulation tasks. Further, previous equivariant diffusion models require the per-step equivariance in the Markov process, making it difficult to learn policy under such strong constraints. We theoretically extend equivariant Markov kernels and simplify the condition of equivariant diffusion process, thereby significantly improving training efficiency for trajectory-level SE(3) equivariant diffusion policy in an end-to-end manner. We evaluate ET-SEED on representative robotic manipulation tasks, involving rigid body, articulated and deformable object. Experiments demonstrate superior data efficiency and manipulation proficiency of our proposed method, as well as its ability to generalize to unseen configurations with only a few demonstrations.

However, current robotic-assisted physiotherapy methods struggle including biomechanical metrics in their control algorithms, crucial for safe and effective therapy. This paper introduces BATON, a Biomechanics-Aware Trajectory Optimization approach to robotic Navigation of human musculoskeletal loads. The method integrates a high-fidelity musculoskeletal model of the human shoulder into real-time control of robot-patient interaction during rotator cuff tendon rehabilitation. We extract skeletal dynamics and tendon loading information from an OpenSim shoulder model to solve an optimal control problem, generating strain-minimizing trajectories. Trajectories were realized on a healthy subject by an impedance-controlled robot while estimating the state of the subject's shoulder. Target poses were prescribed to design personalized rehabilitation across a wide range of shoulder motion avoiding high-strain areas. BATON was designed with real-time capabilities, enabling continuous trajectory replanning to address unforeseen variations in tendon strain, such as those from changing muscle activation of the subject.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 9 figures, under review</p></details> |
| **[UniTraj: Universal Human Trajectory Modeling from Billion-Scale Worldwide Traces](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03859v1)** | 2024-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human trajectory modeling is essential for deciphering movement patterns and supporting advanced applications across various domains. However, existing methods are often tailored to specific tasks and regions, resulting in limitations related to task specificity, regional dependency, and data quality sensitivity. Addressing these challenges requires a universal human trajectory foundation model capable of generalizing and scaling across diverse tasks and geographic contexts. To this end, we propose UniTraj, a Universal human Trajectory foundation model that is task-adaptive, region-independent, and highly generalizable. To further enhance performance, we construct WorldTrace, the first large-scale, high-quality, globally distributed dataset sourced from open web platforms, encompassing 2.45 million trajectories with billions of points across 70 countries. Through multiple resampling and masking strategies designed for pre-training, UniTraj effectively overcomes geographic and task constraints, adapting to heterogeneous data quality. Extensive experiments across multiple trajectory analysis tasks and real-world datasets demonstrate that UniTraj consistently outperforms existing approaches in terms of scalability and adaptability. These results underscore the potential of UniTraj as a versatile, robust solution for a wide range of trajectory analysis applications, with WorldTrace serving as an ideal but non-exclusive foundation for training.</p></details> |  |
| **[How to Drawjectory? -- Trajectory Planning using Programming by Demonstration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03815v1)** | 2024-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A flight trajectory defines how exactly a quadrocopter moves in the three-dimensional space from one position to another. Automatic flight trajectory planning faces challenges such as high computational effort and a lack of precision. Hence, when low computational effort or precise control is required, programming the flight route trajectory manually might be preferable. However, this requires in-depth knowledge of how to accurately plan flight trajectories in three-dimensional space. We propose planning quadrocopter flight trajectories manually using the Programming by Demonstration (PbD) approach -- simply drawing the trajectory in the three-dimensional space by hand. This simplifies the planning process and reduces the level of in-depth knowledge required. We implemented the approach in the context of the Quadcopter Lab at Ulm University. In order to evaluate our approach, we compare the precision and accuracy of the trajectories drawn by a user using our approach as well as the required time with those manually programmed using a domain specific language. The evaluation shows that the Drawjectory workflow is, on average, 78.7 seconds faster without a significant loss of precision, shown by an average deviation 6.67 cm.</p></details> |  |
| **[Revisiting CNNs for Trajectory Similarity Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19761v2)** | 2024-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Similarity search is a fundamental but expensive operator in querying trajectory data, due to its quadratic complexity of distance computation. To mitigate the computational burden for long trajectories, neural networks have been widely employed for similarity learning and each trajectory is encoded as a high-dimensional vector for similarity search with linear complexity. Given the sequential nature of trajectory data, previous efforts have been primarily devoted to the utilization of RNNs or Transformers. In this paper, we argue that the common practice of treating trajectory as sequential data results in excessive attention to capturing long-term global dependency between two sequences. Instead, our investigation reveals the pivotal role of local similarity, prompting a revisit of simple CNNs for trajectory similarity learning. We introduce ConvTraj, incorporating both 1D and 2D convolutions to capture sequential and geo-distribution features of trajectories, respectively. In addition, we conduct a series of theoretical analyses to justify the effectiveness of ConvTraj. Experimental results on four real-world large-scale datasets demonstrate that ConvTraj achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in trajectory similarity search. Owing to the simple network structure of ConvTraj, the training and inference speed on the Porto dataset with 1.6 million trajectories are increased by at least $240$x and $2.16$x, respectively. The source code and dataset can be found at \textit{\url{https://github.com/Proudc/ConvTraj}}.</p></details> |  |
| **[NEOviz: Uncertainty-Driven Visual Analysis of Asteroid Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02812v1)** | 2024-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce NEOviz, an interactive visualization system designed to assist planetary defense experts in the visual analysis of the movements of near-Earth objects in the Solar System that might prove hazardous to Earth. Asteroids are often discovered using optical telescopes and their trajectories are calculated from images, resulting in an inherent asymmetric uncertainty in their position and velocity. Consequently, we typically cannot determine the exact trajectory of an asteroid, and an ensemble of trajectories must be generated to estimate an asteroid's movement over time. When propagating these ensembles over decades, it is challenging to visualize the varying paths and determine their potential impact on Earth, which could cause catastrophic damage. NEOviz equips experts with the necessary tools to effectively analyze the existing catalog of asteroid observations. In particular, we present a novel approach for visualizing the 3D uncertainty region through which an asteroid travels, while providing accurate spatial context in relation to system-critical infrastructure such as Earth, the Moon, and artificial satellites. Furthermore, we use NEOviz to visualize the divergence of asteroid trajectories, capturing high-variance events in an asteroid's orbital properties. For potential impactors, we combine the 3D visualization with an uncertainty-aware impact map to illustrate the potential risks to human populations. NEOviz was developed with continuous input from members of the planetary defense community through a participatory design process. It is exemplified in three real-world use cases and evaluated via expert feedback interviews.</p></details> |  |

We employ state-of-the-art computer vision and deep learning to create an end-to-end pipeline that enhances vehicle detection, tracking, and trajectory stabilization. Conducted in the Songdo International Business District, South Korea, the study used a multi-drone experiment over 20 intersections, capturing approximately 12TB of 4K video data over four days. We developed a novel track stabilization method that uses detected vehicle bounding boxes as exclusion masks during image registration, which, combined with advanced georeferencing techniques, accurately transforms vehicle coordinates into real-world geographical data. Additionally, our framework includes robust vehicle dimension estimation and detailed road segmentation for in-depth traffic analysis. The framework produced two high-quality datasets: the Songdo Traffic dataset, comprising nearly 1 million unique vehicle trajectories, and the Songdo Vision dataset, containing over 5,000 human-annotated frames with about 300,000 vehicle instances in four classes. Comparisons between drone-derived data and high-precision sensor data from an instrumented probe vehicle highlight the accuracy and consistency of our framework's extraction in dense urban settings. By publicly releasing these datasets and the pipeline source code, this work sets new benchmarks for data quality, reproducibility, and scalability in traffic research. Results demonstrate the potential of integrating drone technology with advanced computer vision for precise, cost-effective urban traffic monitoring, providing valuable resources for the research community to develop intelligent transportation systems and improve traffic management strategies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hyper-SD: Trajectory Segmented Consistency Model for Efficient Image Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13686v3)** | 2024-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, a series of diffusion-aware distillation algorithms have emerged to alleviate the computational overhead associated with the multi-step inference process of Diffusion Models (DMs). Current distillation techniques often dichotomize into two distinct aspects: i) ODE Trajectory Preservation; and ii) ODE Trajectory Reformulation. However, these approaches suffer from severe performance degradation or domain shifts. To address these limitations, we propose Hyper-SD, a novel framework that synergistically amalgamates the advantages of ODE Trajectory Preservation and Reformulation, while maintaining near-lossless performance during step compression. Firstly, we introduce Trajectory Segmented Consistency Distillation to progressively perform consistent distillation within pre-defined time-step segments, which facilitates the preservation of the original ODE trajectory from a higher-order perspective. Secondly, we incorporate human feedback learning to boost the performance of the model in a low-step regime and mitigate the performance loss incurred by the distillation process. Thirdly, we integrate score distillation to further improve the low-step generation capability of the model and offer the first attempt to leverage a unified LoRA to support the inference process at all steps. Extensive experiments and user studies demonstrate that Hyper-SD achieves SOTA performance from 1 to 8 inference steps for both SDXL and SD1.5. For example, Hyper-SDXL surpasses SDXL-Lightning by +0.68 in CLIP Score and +0.51 in Aes Score in the 1-step inference.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2024 (Camera-Ready Version).

Principal component analysis (PCA) is applied to trajectory data consisting of $n_s = 4,000,000$ datapoints, of the FPUT $\beta$ model with $N = 32$ coupled oscillators, revealing a critical relationship between $m^{\ast}$ and the model's nonlinear strength. For weak nonlinearities, $m^{\ast} \ll n$, where $n = 2N$. In contrast, for strong nonlinearities, $m^{\ast} \rightarrow n - 1$, consistently with the ergodic hypothesis. Furthermore, one of the potential limitations of PCA is addressed through an analysis with t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding ($t$-SNE). Accordingly, we found strong evidence suggesting that the datapoints lie near or on a curved low-dimensional manifold for weak nonlinearities.</p></details> | 20 pages, 18 figures |

In this paper, we proposed an integrative approach that combines motion prediction and trajectory planning to enable safe and socially-aware robot navigation. The main idea of the proposed method is to leverage the advantages of Socially Acceptable trajectory prediction and Timed Elastic Band (TEB) by incorporating human interactive information including position, orientation, and motion into the objective function of the TEB algorithms. In addition, we designed social constraints to ensure the safety of robot navigation. The proposed system is evaluated through physical simulation using both quantitative and qualitative metrics, demonstrating its superior performance in avoiding human and dynamic obstacles, thereby ensuring safe navigation.

The number of features is comparable to the sample size and errors may be heavy-tailed. We introduce estimators that precisely track the generalization error of the iterates along the trajectory of the iterative algorithm. These estimators are provably consistent under suitable conditions. The results are illustrated through several examples, including Huber regression, pseudo-Huber regression, and their penalized variants with non-smooth regularizer. We provide explicit generalization error estimates for iterates generated from GD and SGD, or from proximal SGD in the presence of a non-smooth regularizer. The proposed risk estimates serve as effective proxies for the actual generalization error, allowing us to determine the optimal stopping iteration that minimizes the generalization error. Extensive simulations confirm the effectiveness of the proposed generalization error estimates.</p></details> | <details><summary>Camer...</summary><p>Camera-ready version of NeurIPS 2024 paper</p></details> |
| **[Interaction-Aware Trajectory Prediction for Safe Motion Planning in Autonomous Driving: A Transformer-Transfer Learning Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01475v1)** | 2024-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A critical aspect of safe and efficient motion planning for autonomous vehicles (AVs) is to handle the complex and uncertain behavior of surrounding human-driven vehicles (HDVs). Despite intensive research on driver behavior prediction, existing approaches typically overlook the interactions between AVs and HDVs assuming that HDV trajectories are not affected by AV actions. To address this gap, we present a transformer-transfer learning-based interaction-aware trajectory predictor for safe motion planning of autonomous driving, focusing on a vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) interaction scenario consisting of an AV and an HDV. Specifically, we construct a transformer-based interaction-aware trajectory predictor using widely available datasets of HDV trajectory data and further transfer the learned predictor using a small set of AV-HDV interaction data. Then, to better incorporate the proposed trajectory predictor into the motion planning module of AVs, we introduce an uncertainty quantification method to characterize the errors of the predictor, which are integrated into the path-planning process. Our experimental results demonstrate the value of explicitly considering interactions and handling uncertainties.</p></details> |  |

| **[TrajRoute: Rethinking Routing with a Simple Trajectory-Based Approach -- Forget the Maps and Traffic!](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01325v1)** | 2024-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The abundance of vehicle trajectory data offers a new opportunity to compute driving routes between origins and destinations. Current graph-based routing pipelines, while effective, involve substantial costs in constructing, maintaining, and updating road network graphs to reflect real-time conditions. In this study, we propose a new trajectory-based routing paradigm that bypasses current workflows by directly utilizing raw trajectory data to compute efficient routes. Our method, named TrajRoute, uniquely "follows" historical trajectories from a source to a destination, constructing paths that reflect actual driver behavior and implicit preferences. To supplement areas with sparse trajectory data, the road network is also incorporated into TrajRoute's index, and tunable parameters are introduced to control the balance between road segments and trajectories, ensuring a unified and adaptable routing approach. We experimentally verify our approach by comparing it to an existing online routing service. Our results demonstrate that as the number of trajectories covering the road network increases, TrajRoute produces increasingly accurate travel time and route length estimates while gradually eliminating the need to downgrade to the road network. This highlights the potential of simpler, data-driven pipelines for routing, offering lower-maintenance alternatives to conventional systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[GPTR: Gaussian Process Trajectory Representation for Continuous-Time Motion Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22931v3)** | 2024-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Continuous-time trajectory representation has gained significant popularity in recent years, as it offers an elegant formulation that allows the fusion of a larger number of sensors and sensing modalities, overcoming limitations of traditional discrete-time frameworks. To bolster the adoption of the continuous-time paradigm, we propose a so-called Gaussian Process Trajectory Representation (GPTR) framework for continuous-time motion estimation (CTME) tasks. Our approach stands out by employing a third-order random jerk model, featuring closed-form expressions for both rotational and translational state derivatives. This model provides smooth, continuous trajectory representations that are crucial for precise estimation of complex motion. To support the wider robotics and computer vision communities, we have made the source code for GPTR available as a light-weight header-only library. This format was chosen for its ease of integration, allowing developers to incorporate GPTR into existing systems without needing extensive code modifications. Moreover, we also provide a set of optimization examples with LiDAR, camera, IMU, UWB factors, and closed-form analytical Jacobians under the proposed GP framework. Our experiments demonstrate the efficacy and efficiency of GP-based trajectory representation in various motion estimation tasks, and the examples can serve as the prototype to help researchers quickly develop future applications such as batch optimization, calibration, sensor fusion, trajectory planning, etc., with continuous-time trajectory representation.

The base transcription algorithm for which we establish the refinement algorithm is a direct multiple shooting technique -- QuITO v.2 (Quasi-Interpolation based Trajectory Optimization). The mesh refinement technique consists of two steps -- localization of certain irregular regions in an optimal control trajectory via wavelets, followed by a targeted $h$-refinement approach around such regions of irregularity. Theoretical approximation guarantees on uniform grids are presented for optimal controls with certain regularity properties, along with guarantees of localization of change points by wavelet transform. Numerical illustrations are provided for control profiles involving discontinuities to show the effectiveness of the localization and refinement strategy. We also announce, and make freely available, a new software package based on QuITO v.2 along with all its functionalities for completeness.

The key idea is to capture each task by an object-centric representation, specifically the SE(3) object pose trajectory relative to the target. This approach decouples embodiment actions from sensory inputs, facilitating learning from various demonstration types, including both action-based and action-less human hand demonstrations, as well as cross-embodiment generalization. Additionally, object pose trajectories inherently capture planning constraints from demonstrations without the need for manually crafted rules. To guide the robot in executing the task, the object trajectory is used to condition a diffusion policy. We show improvement compared to prior work on RLBench simulated tasks. In real-world evaluation, using only eight demonstrations shot on an iPhone, our approach completed all tasks while fully complying with task constraints.

At the heart of RopeTP is a hierarchical attention mechanism that significantly improves context awareness, which is essential for accurately inferring the posture of occluded body parts. This is achieved by exploiting the relationships with visible anatomical structures, enhancing the accuracy of local pose estimations. The improved robustness of these local estimations allows for the reconstruction of precise and stable global trajectories. Additionally, RopeTP incorporates a diffusion trajectory model that predicts realistic human motion from local pose sequences. This model ensures that the generated trajectories are not only consistent with observed local actions but also unfold naturally over time, thereby improving the realism and stability of 3D human motion reconstruction. Extensive experimental validation shows that RopeTP surpasses current methods on two benchmark datasets, particularly excelling in scenarios with occlusions. It also outperforms methods that rely on SLAM for initial camera estimates and extensive optimization, delivering more accurate and realistic trajectories.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by WACV 2025 (Round 1)</p></details> |

Significant progress has been made in the past decade thanks to the availability of pedestrian trajectory datasets, which enable trajectory prediction methods to learn from pedestrians' past movements and predict future trajectories. However, these datasets and methods typically assume that the observed trajectory sequence is complete, ignoring real-world issues such as sensor failure, occlusion, and limited fields of view that can result in missing values in observed trajectories. To address this challenge, we present TrajImpute, a pedestrian trajectory prediction dataset that simulates missing coordinates in the observed trajectory, enhancing real-world applicability. TrajImpute maintains a uniform distribution of missing data within the observed trajectories. In this work, we comprehensively examine several imputation methods to reconstruct the missing coordinates and benchmark them for imputing pedestrian trajectories. Furthermore, we provide a thorough analysis of recent trajectory prediction methods and evaluate the performance of these models on the imputed trajectories. Our experimental evaluation of the imputation and trajectory prediction methods offers several valuable insights. Our dataset provides a foundational resource for future research on imputation-aware pedestrian trajectory prediction, potentially accelerating the deployment of these methods in real-world applications.

We begin by introducing the Quantile Attention-Fourier Deep Operator Network (QAF-DeepONet), designed to capture the complex dynamics of voltage trajectories and reliably estimate quantiles of the target trajectory without any distributional assumptions. The proposed operator regression model maps the observed portion of the voltage trajectory to its unobserved post-fault trajectory. Our methodology employs a pre-training and fine-tuning process to address the challenge of limited data availability. To ensure data privacy in learning the pre-trained model, we use merging via federated learning with data from neighboring buses, enabling the model to learn the underlying voltage dynamics from such buses without directly sharing their data. After pre-training, we fine-tune the model with data from the target bus, allowing it to adapt to unique dynamics and operating conditions. Finally, we integrate conformal prediction into the fine-tuned model to ensure coverage guarantees for the predicted intervals. We evaluated the performance of the proposed methodology using the New England 39-bus test system considering detailed models of voltage and frequency controllers. Two metrics, Prediction Interval Coverage Probability (PICP) and Prediction Interval Normalized Average Width (PINAW), are used to numerically assess the model's performance in predicting intervals. The results show that the proposed approach offers practical and reliable uncertainty quantification in predicting the interval of post-fault voltage trajectories.</p></details> |  |

Existing research mainly focuses on leveraging single-frame cooperative information to enhance the limited perception capability of the ego vehicle, while underutilizing the motion and interaction context of traffic participants observed from cooperative devices. In this paper, we propose a forecasting-oriented representation paradigm to utilize motion and interaction features from cooperative information. Specifically, we present V2X-Graph, a representative framework to achieve interpretable and end-to-end trajectory feature fusion for cooperative motion forecasting. V2X-Graph is evaluated on V2X-Seq in vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) scenarios. To further evaluate on vehicle-to-everything (V2X) scenario, we construct the first real-world V2X motion forecasting dataset V2X-Traj, which contains multiple autonomous vehicles and infrastructure in every scenario. Experimental results on both V2X-Seq and V2X-Traj show the advantage of our method. We hope both V2X-Graph and V2X-Traj will benefit the further development of cooperative motion forecasting.

While most existing methods consider this as a discrete problem, popularity actually evolves continuously, exhibiting rich dynamic properties such as change rates and growth patterns. In this paper, we argue that popularity trajectory prediction is more practical, as it aims to forecast the entire trajectory of how popularity unfolds over arbitrary future time. This approach offers insights into both instantaneous popularity and the underlying dynamic properties. However, traditional methods for popularity trajectory prediction primarily rely on specific diffusion mechanism assumptions, which may not align well with real-world dynamics and compromise their performance. To address these limitations, we propose NODEPT, a novel approach based on neural ordinary differential equations (ODEs) for popularity trajectory prediction. NODEPT models the continuous dynamics of the underlying diffusion system using neural ODEs. We first employ an encoder to initialize the latent state representations of information cascades, consisting of two representation learning modules that capture the co-evolution structural characteristics and temporal patterns of cascades from different perspectives. More importantly, we then introduce an ODE-based generative module that learns the dynamics of the diffusion system in the latent space. Finally, a decoder transforms the latent state into the prediction of the future popularity trajectory. Our experimental results on three real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority and rationality of the proposed NODEPT method.</p></details> | <details><summary>The t...</summary><p>The time complexity analysis in section 4.4 contains error; we overlooked the impact of the memory module</p></details> |

However, for most problems of interest, MPC relies on the recursive solution of highly non-convex trajectory optimization problems, leading to high computational complexity and strong dependency on initialization. In this work, we present a unified framework to combine the main strengths of optimization-based and learning-based methods for MPC. Our approach entails embedding high-capacity, transformer-based neural network models within the optimization process for trajectory generation, whereby the transformer provides a near-optimal initial guess, or target plan, to a non-convex optimization problem. Our experiments, performed in simulation and the real world onboard a free flyer platform, demonstrate the capabilities of our framework to improve MPC convergence and runtime. Compared to purely optimization-based approaches, results show that our approach can improve trajectory generation performance by up to 75%, reduce the number of solver iterations by up to 45%, and improve overall MPC runtime by 7x without loss in performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 7 figures.

We study generative modeling for planning with datasets repurposed from offline reinforcement learning. Specifically, we identify temporal consistency in the absence of step-wise rewards as one key technical challenge. We introduce the Latent Plan Transformer (LPT), a novel model that leverages a latent variable to connect a Transformer-based trajectory generator and the final return. LPT can be learned with maximum likelihood estimation on trajectory-return pairs. In learning, posterior sampling of the latent variable naturally integrates sub-trajectories to form a consistent abstraction despite the finite context. At test time, the latent variable is inferred from an expected return before policy execution, realizing the idea of planning as inference. Our experiments demonstrate that LPT can discover improved decisions from sub-optimal trajectories, achieving competitive performance across several benchmarks, including Gym-Mujoco, Franka Kitchen, Maze2D, and Connect Four. It exhibits capabilities in nuanced credit assignments, trajectory stitching, and adaptation to environmental contingencies. These results validate that latent variable inference can be a strong alternative to step-wise reward prompting.</p></details> |  |

Trajectory optimization is a powerful and widely used algorithm in control, parameterized by a cost and a dynamics function. The key to our approach is to leverage the recent progress in differentiable trajectory optimization, which enables computing the gradients of the loss with respect to the parameters of trajectory optimization. As a result, the cost and dynamics functions of trajectory optimization can be learned end-to-end. DiffTORI addresses the ``objective mismatch'' issue of prior model-based RL algorithms, as the dynamics model in DiffTORI is learned to directly maximize task performance by differentiating the policy gradient loss through the trajectory optimization process.

| **[Dual Agent Learning Based Aerial Trajectory Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23571v1)** | 2024-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a novel reinforcement learning framework for trajectory tracking of unmanned aerial vehicles in cluttered environments using a dual-agent architecture. Traditional optimization methods for trajectory tracking face significant computational challenges and lack robustness in dynamic environments. Our approach employs deep reinforcement learning (RL) to overcome these limitations, leveraging 3D pointcloud data to perceive the environment without relying on memory-intensive obstacle representations like occupancy grids. The proposed system features two RL agents: one for predicting UAV velocities to follow a reference trajectory and another for managing collision avoidance in the presence of obstacles. This architecture ensures real-time performance and adaptability to uncertainties. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach through simulated and real-world experiments, highlighting improvements over state-of-the-art RL and optimization-based methods. Additionally, a curriculum learning paradigm is employed to scale the algorithms to more complex environments, ensuring robust trajectory tracking and obstacle avoidance in both static and dynamic scenarios.</p></details> |  |

DisCo is a distributed contact-implicit trajectory optimization algorithm, which allows a group of robots to optimize a time sequence of forces to objects and to their environment to accomplish tasks such as collaborative manipulation, robot team sports, and modular robot locomotion. We build our algorithm on a variant of the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM), where each robot computes its own contact forces and contact-switching events from a smaller single-robot, contact-implicit trajectory optimization problem, while cooperating with other robots through dual variables, enforcing constraints between robots. Each robot iterates between solving its local problem, and communicating over a wireless mesh network to enforce these consistency constraints with its neighbors, ultimately converging to a coordinated plan for the group. The local problems solved by each robot are significantly less challenging than a centralized problem with all robots' contact forces and switching events, improving the computational efficiency, while also preserving the privacy of some aspects of each robot's operation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm in simulations of collaborative manipulation, multi-robot team sports scenarios, and in modular robot locomotion, where DisCo achieves $3$x higher success rates with a 2.5x to 5x faster computation time. Further, we provide results of hardware experiments on a modular truss robot, with three collaborating truss nodes planning individually while working together to produce a punctuated rolling-gate motion of the composite structure.

| **[Long-Term Human Trajectory Prediction using 3D Dynamic Scene Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00552v4)** | 2024-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a novel approach for long-term human trajectory prediction in indoor human-centric environments, which is essential for long-horizon robot planning in these environments. State-of-the-art human trajectory prediction methods are limited by their focus on collision avoidance and short-term planning, and their inability to model complex interactions of humans with the environment. In contrast, our approach overcomes these limitations by predicting sequences of human interactions with the environment and using this information to guide trajectory predictions over a horizon of up to 60s. We leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to predict interactions with the environment by conditioning the LLM prediction on rich contextual information about the scene. This information is given as a 3D Dynamic Scene Graph that encodes the geometry, semantics, and traversability of the environment into a hierarchical representation. We then ground these interaction sequences into multi-modal spatio-temporal distributions over human positions using a probabilistic approach based on continuous-time Markov Chains. To evaluate our approach, we introduce a new semi-synthetic dataset of long-term human trajectories in complex indoor environments, which also includes annotations of human-object interactions. We show in thorough experimental evaluations that our approach achieves a 54% lower average negative log-likelihood and a 26.5% lower Best-of-20 displacement error compared to the best non-privileged (i.e., evaluated in a zero-shot fashion on the dataset) baselines for a time horizon of 60s.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures.

Detection methods in generative language models (GLMs) mainly focus on uncertainty estimation and embedding distance measurement, with the latter proven to be most effective in traditional linguistic tasks like summarization and translation. However, another complex generative scenario mathematical reasoning poses significant challenges to embedding-based methods due to its high-density feature of output spaces, but this feature causes larger discrepancies in the embedding shift trajectory between different samples in latent spaces. Hence, we propose a trajectory-based method TV score, which uses trajectory volatility for OOD detection in mathematical reasoning. Experiments show that our method outperforms all traditional algorithms on GLMs under mathematical reasoning scenarios and can be extended to more applications with high-density features in output spaces, such as multiple-choice questions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |

In this letter, we extend the recently proposed Hybrid iLQR method [1] to handle state and input constraints within an indirect optimization framework, aiming to preserve computational efficiency and ensure dynamic feasibility. Specifically, we incorporate two constraint handling mechanisms into the Hybrid iLQR: Discrete Barrier State and Augmented Lagrangian methods. Comprehensive simulations across various operational situations are conducted to evaluate and compare the performance of these extended methods in terms of convergence and their ability to handle infeasible starting trajectories. Results indicate that while the Discrete Barrier State approach is more computationally efficient, the Augmented Lagrangian method outperforms it in complex and real-world scenarios with infeasible initial trajectories.</p></details> | 6 pages 4 figures |

By combining sampling-based Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) control with gradient-based Interior-Point Differential Dynamic Programming (IPDDP), we leverage their respective strengths in exploration and smoothing. The proposed method, MPPI-IPDDP, involves three steps: First, MPPI control is used to generate a coarse trajectory. Second, a collision-free convex corridor is constructed. Third, IPDDP is applied to smooth the coarse trajectory, utilizing the collision-free corridor from the second step. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we apply the proposed algorithm to trajectory optimization for differential-drive wheeled mobile robots and point-mass quadrotors. In comparisons with other MPPI variants and continuous optimization-based solvers, our method shows superior performance in terms of computational robustness and trajectory smoothness.

| **[Choice between Partial Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22690v1)** | 2024-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As AI agents generate increasingly sophisticated behaviors, manually encoding human preferences to guide these agents becomes more challenging. To address this, it has been suggested that agents instead learn preferences from human choice data. This approach requires a model of choice behavior that the agent can use to interpret the data. For choices between partial trajectories of states and actions, previous models assume choice probabilities to be determined by the partial return or the cumulative advantage. We consider an alternative model based instead on the bootstrapped return, which adds to the partial return an estimate of the future return. Benefits of the bootstrapped return model stem from its treatment of human beliefs. Unlike partial return, choices based on bootstrapped return reflect human beliefs about the environment. Further, while recovering the reward function from choices based on cumulative advantage requires that those beliefs are correct, doing so from choices based on bootstrapped return does not. To motivate the bootstrapped return model, we formulate axioms and prove an Alignment Theorem. This result formalizes how, for a general class of human preferences, such models are able to disentangle goals from beliefs. This ensures recovery of an aligned reward function when learning from choices based on bootstrapped return. The bootstrapped return model also affords greater robustness to choice behavior. Even when choices are based on partial return, learning via a bootstrapped return model recovers an aligned reward function. The same holds with choices based on the cumulative advantage if the human and the agent both adhere to correct and consistent beliefs about the environment. On the other hand, if choices are based on bootstrapped return, learning via partial return or cumulative advantage models does not generally produce an aligned reward function.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Overtaking Trajectory Planning Framework Based on Spatio-temporal Topology and Reachable Set Analysis Ensuring Time Efficiency](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22643v1)** | 2024-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating overtaking trajectories in high-speed scenarios presents significant challenges and is typically addressed through hierarchical planning methods. However, this method has two primary drawbacks. First, heuristic algorithms can only provide a single initial solution, which may lead to local optima and consequently diminish the quality of the solution. Second, the time efficiency of trajectory refinement based on numerical optimization is insufficient. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes an overtaking trajectory planning framework based on spatio-temporal topology and reachable set analysis (SROP), to improve trajectory quality and time efficiency. Specifically, this paper introduces topological classes to describe trajectories representing different overtaking behaviors, which support the spatio-temporal topological search method employed by the upper-layer planner to identify diverse initial paths. This approach helps prevent getting stuck in local optima, enhancing the overall solution quality by considering multiple initial solutions from distinct topologies. Moreover, the reachable set method is integrated into the lower-layer planner for parallel trajectory evaluation. This method enhances planning efficiency by decoupling vehicle model constraints from the optimization process, enabling parallel computation while ensuring control feasibility. Simulation results show that the proposed method improves the smoothness of generated trajectories by 66.8% compared to state-of-the-art methods, highlighting its effectiveness in enhancing trajectory quality. Additionally, this method reduces computation time by 62.9%, demonstrating its efficiency.</p></details> |  |

LCGA summarizes similar patterns of change over time into a few distinct categories called trajectory groups, which are then included as "treatments" in the MSM. MSMs are a class of causal models that correctly handle treatment-confounder feedback. The parameters of LCGA-MSMs can be consistently estimated using different estimators, such as inverse probability weighting (IPW), g-computation, and pooled longitudinal targeted maximum likelihood estimation (pooled LTMLE). These three estimators of the parameters of LCGA-MSMs are currently implemented in our package. In the context of a time-dependent outcome, we previously proposed a combination of LCGA and history-restricted MSMs (LCGA-HRMSMs). Our package provides additional functions to estimate the parameters of such models.

However, they face challenges due to their high-dimensional and unstable dynamics, as well as the complex contact-rich nature of the tasks. Model-based optimal control methods offer precise and systematic control but are limited by high computational complexity and accurate contact sensing. On the other hand, reinforcement learning (RL) provides robustness and handles high-dimensional spaces but suffers from inefficient learning, unnatural motion, and sim-to-real gaps. To address these challenges, we introduce Opt2Skill, an end-to-end pipeline that combines model-based trajectory optimization with RL to achieve robust whole-body loco-manipulation. We generate reference motions for the Digit humanoid robot using differential dynamic programming (DDP) and train RL policies to track these trajectories. Our results demonstrate that Opt2Skill outperforms pure RL methods in both training efficiency and task performance, with optimal trajectories that account for torque limits enhancing trajectory tracking. We successfully transfer our approach to real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we provide a method for the learning of the recovery trajectory of an individual patient, as they undertake exercises as part of their physical therapy towards recovery of their loss of movement ability, following a critical illness. The difference between the Movement Recovery Scores (MRSs) attained by a patient, when undertaking a given exercise routine on successive instances, is given by a statistical distance/divergence between the (posterior) probabilities of random graphs that are Bayesianly learnt using time series data on locations of 20 of the patient's joints, recorded on an e-platform as the patient exercises. This allows for the computation of the MRS on every occasion the patient undertakes this exercise, using which, the recovery trajectory is drawn. We learn each graph as a Random Geometric Graph drawn in a probabilistic metric space, and identify the closed-form marginal posterior of any edge of the graph, given the correlation structure of the multivariate time series data on joint locations. On the basis of our recovery learning, we offer recommendations on the optimal exercise routines for patients with given level of mobility impairment.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we develop a strategy to locally adapt the step size parameter of HMC at every iteration by evaluating a low-rank approximation of the local Hessian and estimating its largest eigenvalue. We combine it with a strategy to similarly adapt the trajectory length by monitoring the no U-turn condition, resulting in an adaptive sampler, ATLAS: adapting trajectory length and step-size. We further use a delayed rejection framework for making multiple proposals that improves the computational efficiency of ATLAS, and develop an approach for automatically tuning its hyperparameters during warmup. We compare ATLAS with state-of-the-art samplers like NUTS on a suite of synthetic and real world examples, and show that i) unlike NUTS, ATLAS is able to accurately sample difficult distributions with complex geometries, ii) it is computationally competitive to NUTS for simpler distributions, and iii) it is more robust to the tuning of hyperparamters.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code available at https://github.com/modichirag/AtlasSampler</p></details> |

Neural stochastic differential equations (Neural SDEs) are an attractive modeling technique for this problem, which parameterize the drift and diffusion terms of an SDE with neural networks. However, current algorithms for training Neural SDEs require backpropagation through the SDE dynamics, greatly limiting their scalability and stability. To address this, we propose Trajectory Flow Matching (TFM), which trains a Neural SDE in a simulation-free manner, bypassing backpropagation through the dynamics. TFM leverages the flow matching technique from generative modeling to model time series. In this work we first establish necessary conditions for TFM to learn time series data. Next, we present a reparameterization trick which improves training stability. Finally, we adapt TFM to the clinical time series setting, demonstrating improved performance on three clinical time series datasets both in terms of absolute performance and uncertainty prediction.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2024 Spotlight</p></details> |
| **[Combining Deep Reinforcement Learning with a Jerk-Bounded Trajectory Generator for Kinematically Constrained Motion Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20907v1)** | 2024-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is emerging as a promising method for adaptive robotic motion and complex task automation, effectively addressing the limitations of traditional control methods. However, ensuring safety throughout both the learning process and policy deployment remains a key challenge due to the risky exploration inherent in DRL, as well as the discrete nature of actions taken at intervals. These discontinuities, despite being part of a continuous action space, can lead to abrupt changes between successive actions, causing instability and unsafe intermediate states. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an integrated framework that combines DRL with a jerk-bounded trajectory generator (JBTG) and a robust low-level control strategy, significantly enhancing the safety, stability, and reliability of robotic manipulators. The low-level controller ensures the precise execution of DRL-generated commands, while the JBTG refines these motions to produce smooth, continuous trajectories that prevent abrupt or unsafe actions. The framework also includes pre-calculated safe velocity zones for smooth braking, preventing joint limit violations and ensuring compliance with kinematic constraints. This approach not only guarantees the robustness and safety of the robotic system but also optimizes motion control, making it suitable for practical applications. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is demonstrated through its application to a highly complex heavy-duty manipulator.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been submitted to the IEEE for potential publication</p></details> |

Modeling the interactions among agents is the key to understanding and predicting the dynamics of the complex system, e.g., predicting the trajectories of traffic participants in the city. Compared with interaction modeling in homogeneous systems such as pedestrians in a crowded scene, heterogeneous interaction modeling is less explored. Worse still, the error accumulation problem becomes more severe since the interactions are more complex. To tackle the two problems, this paper proposes heterogeneous interaction modeling with reduced accumulated error for multi-agent trajectory prediction. Based on the historical trajectories, our method infers the dynamic interaction graphs among agents, featured by directed interacting relations and interacting effects. A heterogeneous attention mechanism is defined on the interaction graphs for aggregating the influence from heterogeneous neighbors to the target agent. To alleviate the error accumulation problem, this paper analyzes the error sources from the spatial and temporal perspectives, and proposes to introduce the graph entropy and the mixup training strategy for reducing the two types of errors respectively. Our method is examined on three real-world datasets containing heterogeneous agents, and the experimental results validate the superiority of our method.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, accepted by IEEE TNNLS</p></details> |

Numerous methods have been proposed to address specific problems within trajectory modelling. However, due to the heterogeneity of data and the diversity of trajectory tasks, achieving unified trajectory modelling remains an important yet challenging task. In this paper, we propose TrajAgent, a large language model-based agentic framework, to unify various trajectory modelling tasks.

Yet, it poses challenges due to substantial parameter size and limited scalability, which is particularly critical in sequential decision-making scenarios where resources are constrained such as in robots and drones with limited computational power. Mamba, a promising new linear-time sequence model, offers performance on par with transformers while delivering substantially fewer parameters on long sequences. As it remains unclear whether Mamba is compatible with trajectory optimization, this work aims to conduct comprehensive experiments to explore the potential of Decision Mamba (dubbed DeMa) in offline RL from the aspect of data structures and essential components with the following insights: (1) Long sequences impose a significant computational burden without contributing to performance improvements since DeMa's focus on sequences diminishes approximately exponentially. Consequently, we introduce a Transformer-like DeMa as opposed to an RNN-like DeMa. (2) For the components of DeMa, we identify the hidden attention mechanism as a critical factor in its success, which can also work well with other residual structures and does not require position embedding. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our specially designed DeMa is compatible with trajectory optimization and surpasses previous methods, outperforming Decision Transformer (DT) with higher performance while using 30\% fewer parameters in Atari, and exceeding DT with only a quarter of the parameters in MuJoCo.</p></details> | 23 pages, 11 figures |

Most ZS-ICL methods use large language models (LLMs) to generate (input, label) pairs as pseudo-demonstrations and leverage historical pseudo-demonstrations to help solve the current problem. They assume that problems are from the same task and traverse them in a random order. However, in real-world scenarios, problems usually come from diverse tasks, and only a few belong to the same task. The random traversing order may generate unreliable pseudo-demonstrations and lead to error accumulation. To address this problem, we reformulate ZS-ICL as a planning problem and propose a Demonstration-aware Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) approach (DAWN-ICL), which leverages MCTS to strategically plan the problem-solving trajectories for ZS-ICL. In addition, to achieve effective and efficient Q value estimation, we propose a novel demonstration-aware Q-value function and use it to enhance the selection phase and accelerate the expansion and simulation phases in MCTS. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of DAWN-ICL on in-domain and cross-domain scenarios, and it even outperforms ICL using human-annotated labels.

| **[Context-Aware Trajectory Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19136v1)** | 2024-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory anomaly detection is crucial for effective decision-making in urban and human mobility management. Existing methods of trajectory anomaly detection generally focus on training a trajectory generative model and evaluating the likelihood of reconstructing a given trajectory. However, previous work often lacks important contextual information on the trajectory, such as the agent's information (e.g., agent ID) or geographic information (e.g., Points of Interest (POI)), which could provide additional information on accurately capturing anomalous behaviors. To fill this gap, we propose a context-aware anomaly detection approach that models contextual information related to trajectories. The proposed method is based on a trajectory reconstruction framework guided by contextual factors such as agent ID and contextual POI embedding. The injection of contextual information aims to improve the performance of anomaly detection. We conducted experiments in two cities and demonstrated that the proposed approach significantly outperformed existing methods by effectively modeling contextual information. Overall, this paper paves a new direction for advancing trajectory anomaly detection.</p></details> |  |

In the situation where gradient information is not available, the gradients need to be estimated from zeroth-order information, which typically involves computing finite-differences along isotropic random directions. This method suffers from high estimation errors, as the geometric features of the objective landscape may be overlooked during the isotropic sampling. In this work, we propose a non-isotropic sampling method to improve the gradient estimation procedure. Gradients in our method are estimated in a subspace spanned by historical trajectories of solutions, aiming to encourage the exploration of promising regions and hence improve the convergence. The proposed method uses a covariance matrix for sampling which is a convex combination of two parts. The first part is a thin projection matrix containing the basis of the subspace which is designed to improve the exploitation ability. The second part is the historical trajectories. We implement this method in zeroth-order federated settings, and show that the convergence rate aligns with existing ones while introducing no significant overheads in communication or local computation. The effectiveness of our proposal is verified on several numerical experiments in comparison to several commonly-used zeroth-order federated optimization algorithms.</p></details> |  |

Existing prediction models that rely primarily on position data struggle with accuracy, especially when UAV movements fall outside the position domain used in training. Our research identifies a gap in utilizing velocity estimates, first-order dynamics, to better capture the dynamics and enhance prediction accuracy and generalizability in any position domain. To bridge this gap, we propose a new trajectory prediction method using Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) within sequence-based neural networks. Unlike traditional methods that rely on RNNs or transformers, this approach forecasts future velocities and positions based on historical velocity data instead of positions. This is designed to enhance prediction accuracy and scalability, overcoming challenges faced by conventional models in handling complex UAV dynamics. The methodology employs both synthetic and real-world 3D UAV trajectory data, capturing a wide range of flight patterns, speeds, and agility. Synthetic data is generated using the Gazebo simulator and PX4 Autopilot, while real-world data comes from the UZH-FPV and Mid-Air drone racing datasets. The GRU-based models significantly outperform state-of-the-art RNN approaches, with a mean square error (MSE) as low as 2 x 10^-8. Overall, our findings confirm the effectiveness of incorporating velocity data in improving the accuracy of UAV trajectory predictions across both synthetic and real-world scenarios, in and out of position data distributions. Finally, we open-source our 5000 trajectories dataset and a ROS 2 package to facilitate the integration with existing ROS-based UAV systems.</p></details> |  |

Advances in machine learning have made traditional image and text-based CAPTCHAs vulnerable to attacks, leading modern CAPTCHAs, such as GeeTest and Akamai, to incorporate behavioral analysis like mouse trajectory detection. Existing bypass techniques struggle to fully mimic human behavior, making it difficult to evaluate the effectiveness of anti-bot measures. To address this, we propose a diffusion model-based mouse trajectory generation framework (DMTG), which controls trajectory complexity and produces realistic human-like mouse movements. DMTG also provides white-box and black-box testing methods to assess its ability to bypass CAPTCHA systems. In experiments, DMTG reduces bot detection accuracy by 4.75%-9.73% compared to other models. Additionally, it mimics physical human behaviors, such as slow initiation and directional force differences, demonstrating improved performance in both simulation and real-world CAPTCHA scenarios.</p></details> |  |

However, since the solid state diffusional transformations that drive microstructure outcomes are governed by nonlinear ODEs in terms of temperature, which is itself governed by PDEs over the entire part domain, solving for the system inputs needed to achieve desired microstructure distributions has proven difficult. In this work, we present a trajectory optimization approach for spatial control of microstructure in metal AM, which we demonstrate by controlling the hardness of a low-alloy steel in electron beam powder bed fusion (EB-PBF). To this end, we present models for thermal and microstructural dynamics. Next, we use experimental data to identify the parameters of the microstructure transformation dynamics. We then pose spatial microstructure control as a finite-horizon optimal control problem. The optimal power field trajectory is computed using an augmented Lagrangian differential dynamic programming (AL-DDP) method with GPU acceleration. The resulting time-varying power fields are then realized on an EB-PBF machine through an approximation scheme. Measurements of the resultant hardness shows that the optimized power field trajectory is able to closely produce the desired hardness distribution.</p></details> | 6 pages, 6 figures |

Our approach integrates a differentiable optimization layer into the neural network. By formulating the optimization layer as a trajectory optimization problem, we enable the model to end-to-end generate actions in a safe and constraint-controlled fashion without extra modules. Our method allows for the introduction of constraint information during the training process, thereby balancing the training objectives of satisfying constraints, smoothing the trajectories, and minimizing errors with demonstrations. This ``gray box" method marries optimization-based safety and interpretability with powerful representational abilities of neural networks. We quantitatively evaluate LeTO in simulation and in the real robot. The results demonstrate that LeTO performs well in both simulated and real-world tasks. In addition, it is capable of generating trajectories that are less uncertain, higher quality, and smoother compared to existing imitation learning methods. Therefore, it is shown that LeTO provides a practical example of how to achieve the integration of neural networks with trajectory optimization. We release our code at https://github.com/ZhengtongXu/LeTO.</p></details> |  |

Their image rendering performance will severely degrade on viewpoints falling out of the recorded trajectory, where camera rays are untrained. We propose FreeVS, a novel fully generative approach that can synthesize camera views on free new trajectories in real driving scenes. To control the generation results to be 3D consistent with the real scenes and accurate in viewpoint pose, we propose the pseudo-image representation of view priors to control the generation process. Viewpoint transformation simulation is applied on pseudo-images to simulate camera movement in each direction. Once trained, FreeVS can be applied to any validation sequences without reconstruction process and synthesis views on novel trajectories. Moreover, we propose two new challenging benchmarks tailored to driving scenes, which are novel camera synthesis and novel trajectory synthesis, emphasizing the freedom of viewpoints. Given that no ground truth images are available on novel trajectories, we also propose to evaluate the consistency of images synthesized on novel trajectories with 3D perception models. Experiments on the Waymo Open Dataset show that FreeVS has a strong image synthesis performance on both the recorded trajectories and novel trajectories.

Although many methods have been explored, they all assign correlation coefficients to surrounding agents in a purely learning-based manner. In this study, we present ASPILin, which manually selects interacting agents and calculates their correlations instead of attention scores. Surprisingly, these simple modifications can significantly improve prediction performance and substantially reduce computational costs. Additionally, ASPILin models the interacting agents at each past time step separately, rather than only modeling the interacting agents at the current time step. This clarifies the causal chain of the target agent's historical trajectory and helps the model better understand dynamic interactions. We intentionally simplified our model in other aspects, such as map encoding. Remarkably, experiments conducted on the INTERACTION, highD, and CitySim datasets demonstrate that our method is efficient and straightforward, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>code:...</summary><p>code:https://github.com/kkk00714/ASPILin</p></details> |

Traditional data-driven approaches often handle these tasks separately with specialized models. We introduce TranSPORTmer, a unified transformer-based framework capable of addressing all these tasks, showcasing its application to the intricate dynamics of multi-agent sports scenarios like soccer and basketball. Using Set Attention Blocks, TranSPORTmer effectively captures temporal dynamics and social interactions in an equivariant manner. The model's tasks are guided by an input mask that conceals missing or yet-to-be-predicted observations. Additionally, we introduce a CLS extra agent to classify states along soccer trajectories, including passes, possessions, uncontrolled states, and out-of-play intervals, contributing to an enhancement in modeling trajectories. Evaluations on soccer and basketball datasets show that TranSPORTmer outperforms state-of-the-art task-specific models in player forecasting, player forecasting-imputation, ball inference, and ball imputation. https://youtu.be/8VtSRm8oGoE</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACCV 2024</p></details> |
| **[Hierarchical Light Transformer Ensembles for Multimodal Trajectory Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17678v2)** | 2024-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate trajectory forecasting is crucial for the performance of various systems, such as advanced driver-assistance systems and self-driving vehicles. These forecasts allow to anticipate events leading to collisions and, therefore, to mitigate them. Deep Neural Networks have excelled in motion forecasting, but issues like overconfidence and uncertainty quantification persist. Deep Ensembles address these concerns, yet applying them to multimodal distributions remains challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel approach named Hierarchical Light Transformer Ensembles (HLT-Ens), aimed at efficiently training an ensemble of Transformer architectures using a novel hierarchical loss function. HLT-Ens leverages grouped fully connected layers, inspired by grouped convolution techniques, to capture multimodal distributions, effectively. Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate that HLT-Ens achieves state-of-the-art performance levels, offering a promising avenue for improving trajectory forecasting techniques.</p></details> | <details><summary>ackno...</summary><p>acknowledgement added</p></details> |

For example, we can swing a bat when walking without having to re-learn such a policy from scratch by composing the individual skills of walking and bat swinging. Enabling robots to combine or compose skills is essential so they can learn novel skills and tasks faster with fewer real world samples. To this end, we propose a novel compositional approach called DSE- Diffusion Score Equilibrium that enables few-shot learning for novel skills by utilizing a combination of base policy priors. Our method is based on probabilistically composing diffusion policies to better model the few-shot demonstration data-distribution than any individual policy. Our goal here is to learn robot motions few-shot and not necessarily goal oriented trajectories. Unfortunately we lack a general purpose metric to evaluate the error between a skill or motion and the provided demonstrations. Hence, we propose a probabilistic measure - Maximum Mean Discrepancy on the Forward Kinematics Kernel (MMD-FK), that is task and action space agnostic. By using our few-shot learning approach DSE, we show that we are able to achieve a reduction of over 30% in MMD-FK across skills and number of demonstrations. Moreover, we show the utility of our approach through real world experiments by teaching novel trajectories to a robot in 5 demonstrations.</p></details> | <details><summary>6(+1)...</summary><p>6(+1) pages, 6 figures</p></details> |

With recent advancements in differentiable rendering techniques, several methods have attempted to simultaneously optimize scene representations (NeRF or 3DGS) and camera poses. Despite recent progress, existing methods relying on traditional camera input tend to fail in high-speed (or equivalently low-frame-rate) scenarios. Event cameras, inspired by biological vision, record pixel-wise intensity changes asynchronously with high temporal resolution, providing valuable scene and motion information in blind inter-frame intervals. In this paper, we introduce the event camera to aid scene construction from a casually captured video for the first time, and propose Event-Aided Free-Trajectory 3DGS, called EF-3DGS, which seamlessly integrates the advantages of event cameras into 3DGS through three key components. First, we leverage the Event Generation Model (EGM) to fuse events and frames, supervising the rendered views observed by the event stream. Second, we adopt the Contrast Maximization (CMax) framework in a piece-wise manner to extract motion information by maximizing the contrast of the Image of Warped Events (IWE), thereby calibrating the estimated poses. Besides, based on the Linear Event Generation Model (LEGM), the brightness information encoded in the IWE is also utilized to constrain the 3DGS in the gradient domain. Third, to mitigate the absence of color information of events, we introduce photometric bundle adjustment (PBA) to ensure view consistency across events and frames. We evaluate our method on the public Tanks and Temples benchmark and a newly collected real-world dataset, RealEv-DAVIS.

| **[PRIMER: Perception-Aware Robust Learning-based Multiagent Trajectory Planner](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10060v2)** | 2024-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In decentralized multiagent trajectory planners, agents need to communicate and exchange their positions to generate collision-free trajectories. However, due to localization errors/uncertainties, trajectory deconfliction can fail even if trajectories are perfectly shared between agents. To address this issue, we first present PARM and PARM*, perception-aware, decentralized, asynchronous multiagent trajectory planners that enable a team of agents to navigate uncertain environments while deconflicting trajectories and avoiding obstacles using perception information. PARM* differs from PARM as it is less conservative, using more computation to find closer-to-optimal solutions. While these methods achieve state-of-the-art performance, they suffer from high computational costs as they need to solve large optimization problems onboard, making it difficult for agents to replan at high rates. To overcome this challenge, we present our second key contribution, PRIMER, a learning-based planner trained with imitation learning (IL) using PARM* as the expert demonstrator. PRIMER leverages the low computational requirements at deployment of neural networks and achieves a computation speed up to 5500 times faster than optimization-based approaches.</p></details> | 7 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Cooperative Trajectory Planning: Principles for Human-Machine System Design on Trajectory Level](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16938v1)** | 2024-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper explores cooperative trajectory planning approaches within the context of human-machine shared control. In shared control research, it is typically assumed that the human and the automation use the same reference trajectory to stabilize the coupled system. However, this assumption is often incorrect, as they usually follow different trajectories, causing control conflicts at the action level that have not been widely researched. To address this, it is logical to extend shared control concepts to include human-machine interaction at the trajectory-level before action execution, resulting in a unified reference trajectory for both human and automation. This paper begins with a literature overview on approaches of cooperative trajectory planning. It then presents an approach of finding a joint trajectory by modelling cooperative trajectory planning as an agreement process. A generally valid system structure is proposed for this purpose. Finally, it proposes concepts to implement cooperative trajectory planning as an agreement process.</p></details> |  |

However, existing research often neglects the consideration of the joint reasoning of scenario agents and lacks interpretability in trajectory prediction models, thereby limiting their practical application in real-world scenarios. To this purpose, an explainability-oriented trajectory prediction model is designed in this work, named Explainable Conditional Diffusion based Multimodal Trajectory Prediction Traj-Explainer, to retrieve the influencing factors of prediction and help understand the intrinsic mechanism of prediction. In Traj-Explainer, a modified conditional diffusion is well designed to capture the scenario multimodal trajectory pattern, and meanwhile, a modified Shapley Value model is assembled to rationally learn the importance of the global and scenario features. Numerical experiments are carried out by several trajectory prediction datasets, including Waymo, NGSIM, HighD, and MoCAD datasets. Furthermore, we evaluate the identified input factors which indicates that they are in agreement with the human driving experience, indicating the capability of the proposed model in appropriately learning the prediction.

| **[Influential Language Data Selection via Gradient Trajectory Pursuit](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16710v1)** | 2024-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Curating a desirable dataset for training has been the core of building highly capable large language models (Touvron et al., 2023; Achiam et al., 2023; Team et al.,2024). Gradient influence scores (Pruthi et al., 2020; Xia et al., 2024) are shown to be correlated with model performance and are commonly used as the criterion for data selection. However, existing methods are built upon either individual sample rankings or inefficient matching process, leading to suboptimal performance or scaling up issues.In this paper, we propose Gradient Trajectory Pursuit (GTP), an algorithm that performs pursuit of gradient trajectories via jointly selecting data points under an L0-norm regularized objective. The proposed algorithm highlights: (1) joint selection instead of independent top-k selection, which automatically de-duplicates samples; (2) higher efficiency with compressive sampling processes, which can be further sped up using a distributed framework. In the experiments, we demonstrate the algorithm in both in-domain and target-domain selection benchmarks and show that it outperforms top-k selection and competitive algorithms consistently, for example, our algorithm chooses as low as 0.5% data to achieve full performance on the targeted instruction tuning tasks</p></details> |  |

Specifically, a pair of locations may not be lined up in a sequence especially when one location includes the other geographically. In this study, we propose a graph representation that retains information on the geographic hierarchy as well as the temporal order of visited locations, and have constructed a benchmark dataset for graph-structured trajectory extraction. The experiments with our baselines have demonstrated that it is possible to accurately predict visited locations and the order among them, but it remains a challenge to predict the hierarchical relations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Incorporating Navigation Context into Inland Vessel Trajectory Prediction: A Gaussian Mixture Model and Transformer Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02344v3)** | 2024-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Using data sources beyond the Automatic Identification System to represent the context a vessel is navigating in and consequently improve situation awareness is still rare in machine learning approaches to vessel trajectory prediction (VTP). In inland shipping, where vessel movement is constrained within fairways, navigational context information is indispensable. In this contribution targeting inland VTP, Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) are applied, on a fused dataset of AIS and discharge measurements, to generate multi-modal distribution curves, capturing typical lateral vessel positioning in the fairway and dislocation speeds along the waterway. By sampling the probability density curves of the GMMs, feature vectors are derived which are used, together with spatio-temporal vessel features and fairway geometries, as input to a VTP transformer model. The incorporation of these distribution features of both the current and forthcoming navigation context improves prediction accuracy. The superiority of the model over a previously proposed transformer model for inland VTP is shown. The novelty lies in the provision of preprocessed, statistics-based features representing the conditioned spatial context, rather than relying on the model to extract relevant features for the VTP task from contextual data. Oversimplification of the complexity of inland navigation patterns by assuming a single typical route or selecting specific clusters prior to model application is avoided by giving the model access to the entire distribution information. The methodology's generalizability is demonstrated through the usage of data of 3 distinct river sections. It can be integrated into an interaction-aware prediction framework, where insights into the positioning of the actual vessel behavior in the overall distribution at the current location and discharge can enhance trajectory prediction accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamic Time Warping-based imputation of long gaps in human mobility trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16096v1)** | 2024-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Individual mobility trajectories are difficult to measure and often incur long periods of missingness. Aggregation of this mobility data without accounting for the missingness leads to erroneous results, underestimating travel behavior. This paper proposes Dynamic Time Warping-Based Multiple Imputation (DTWBMI) as a method of filling long gaps in human mobility trajectories in order to use the available data to the fullest extent. This method reduces spatiotemporal trajectories to time series of particular travel behavior, then selects candidates for multiple imputation on the basis of the dynamic time warping distance between the potential donor series and the series preceding and following the gap in the recipient series and finally imputes values multiple times. A simulation study designed to establish optimal parameters for DTWBMI provides two versions of the method. These two methods are applied to a real-world dataset of individual mobility trajectories with simulated missingness and compared against other methods of handling missingness. Linear interpolation outperforms DTWBMI and other methods when gaps are short and data are limited. DTWBMI outperforms other methods when gaps become longer and when more data are available.</p></details> | 28 pages, 8 figures |

In practice, different driving scenarios present varying levels of difficulty for trajectory prediction models. However, most existing research focuses on the average precision of prediction results, while ignoring the underlying distribution of the input scenarios. This paper proposes a critical example mining method that utilizes a data-driven approach to estimate the rareness of the trajectories. By combining the rareness estimation of observations with whole trajectories, the proposed method effectively identifies a subset of data that is relatively hard to predict BEFORE feeding them to a specific prediction model. The experimental results show that the mined subset has higher prediction error when applied to different downstream prediction models, which reaches +108.1% error (greater than two times compared to the average on dataset) when mining 5% samples. Further analysis indicates that the mined critical examples include uncommon cases such as sudden brake and cancelled lane-change, which helps to better understand and improve the performance of prediction models.</p></details> | 8 pages,6 figures |

However, existing MARL approaches often rely on the restrictive assumption that the number of entities (e.g., agents, obstacles) remains constant between training and inference. This overlooks scenarios where entities are dynamically removed or added during the inference trajectory -- a common occurrence in real-world environments like search and rescue missions and dynamic combat situations. In this paper, we tackle the challenge of intra-trajectory dynamic entity composition under zero-shot out-of-domain (OOD) generalization, where such dynamic changes cannot be anticipated beforehand. Our empirical studies reveal that existing MARL methods suffer significant performance degradation and increased uncertainty in these scenarios. In response, we propose FlickerFusion, a novel OOD generalization method that acts as a universally applicable augmentation technique for MARL backbone methods. Our results show that FlickerFusion not only achieves superior inference rewards but also uniquely reduces uncertainty vis-\`a-vis the backbone, compared to existing methods. For standardized evaluation, we introduce MPEv2, an enhanced version of Multi Particle Environments (MPE), consisting of 12 benchmarks. Benchmarks, implementations, and trained models are organized and open-sourced at flickerfusion305.github.io, accompanied by ample demo video renderings.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS '24 Open-World Agents Workshop</p></details> |

However, current IRL works cannot learn incrementally from an ongoing trajectory because they have to wait to collect at least one complete trajectory to learn. To bridge the gap, this paper considers the problem of learning a reward function and a corresponding policy while observing the initial state-action pair of an ongoing trajectory and keeping updating the learned reward and policy when new state-action pairs of the ongoing trajectory are observed. We formulate this problem as an online bi-level optimization problem where the upper level dynamically adjusts the learned reward according to the newly observed state-action pairs with the help of a meta-regularization term, and the lower level learns the corresponding policy. We propose a novel algorithm to solve this problem and guarantee that the algorithm achieves sub-linear local regret $O(\sqrt{T}+\log T+\sqrt{T}\log T)$. If the reward function is linear, we prove that the proposed algorithm achieves sub-linear regret $O(\log T)$. Experiments are used to validate the proposed algorithm.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reinforced Imitative Trajectory Planning for Urban Automated Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15607v1)** | 2024-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) faces challenges in trajectory planning for urban automated driving due to the poor convergence of RL and the difficulty in designing reward functions. The convergence problem is alleviated by combining RL with supervised learning. However, most existing approaches only reason one step ahead and lack the capability to plan for multiple future steps. Besides, although inverse reinforcement learning holds promise for solving the reward function design issue, existing methods for automated driving impose a linear structure assumption on reward functions, making them difficult to apply to urban automated driving. In light of these challenges, this paper proposes a novel RL-based trajectory planning method that integrates RL with imitation learning to enable multi-step planning. Furthermore, a transformer-based Bayesian reward function is developed, providing effective reward signals for RL in urban scenarios. Moreover, a hybrid-driven trajectory planning framework is proposed to enhance safety and interpretability. The proposed methods were validated on the large-scale real-world urban automated driving nuPlan dataset. The results demonstrated the significant superiority of the proposed methods over the baselines in terms of the closed-loop metrics.

The key question in AL is which unlabeled data should be selected for annotation. Existing deep AL methods arguably suffer from bias incurred by clabeled data, which takes a much lower percentage than unlabeled data in AL context. We observe that such an issue is severe in different types of data, such as vision and non-vision data. To address this issue, we propose a novel method, namely Manifold-Preserving Trajectory Sampling (MPTS), aiming to enforce the feature space learned from labeled data to represent a more accurate manifold. By doing so, we expect to effectively correct the bias incurred by labeled data, which can cause a biased selection of unlabeled data. Despite its focus on manifold, the proposed method can be conveniently implemented by performing distribution mapping with MMD (Maximum Mean Discrepancies). Extensive experiments on various vision and non-vision benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method. Our source code can be found here.</p></details> |  |

Specifically, we present a novel Conditional RNN(CRNN) for diffusion models to efficiently generate trajectories. Furthermore, we propose an adaptive training method that ensures that the diffusion model generates more traversable trajectories. We evaluate our methods in various outdoor scenes and compare the performance with other global navigation algorithms on a Husky robot. In practice, we observe at least a 15% improvement in traveling distance and around a 7% improvement in traversability.</p></details> | 10 pages |

However, adjusting specific elements in generated videos, such as object motion or camera movement, is often a tedious process of trial and error, e.g., involving re-generating videos with different random seeds. Recent techniques address this issue by fine-tuning a pre-trained model to follow conditioning signals, such as bounding boxes or point trajectories. Yet, this fine-tuning procedure can be computationally expensive, and it requires datasets with annotated object motion, which can be difficult to procure. In this work, we introduce SG-I2V, a framework for controllable image-to-video generation that is self-guided$\unicode{x2013}$offering zero-shot control by relying solely on the knowledge present in a pre-trained image-to-video diffusion model without the need for fine-tuning or external knowledge. Our zero-shot method outperforms unsupervised baselines while being competitive with supervised models in terms of visual quality and motion fidelity.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://kmcode1.github.io/Projects/SG-I2V/</p></details> |

Predicting future movement enables cameras to automatically track and predict a player's future trajectory without human intervention. Predicting future human movement in the context of complex physical tasks is also intellectually satisfying. Swift advancements in sports analytics and the wide availability of videos for tennis have inspired us to propose a novel method called Pose2Trajectory, which predicts a tennis player's future trajectory as a sequence derived from their body joints' data and ball position. Demonstrating impressive accuracy, our approach capitalizes on body joint information to provide a comprehensive understanding of the human body's geometry and motion, thereby enhancing the prediction of the player's trajectory. We use encoder-decoder Transformer architecture trained on the joints and trajectory information of the players with ball positions. The predicted sequence can provide information to help close-up cameras to keep tracking the tennis player, following centroid coordinates. We generate a high-quality dataset from multiple videos to assist tennis player movement prediction using object detection and human pose estimation methods. It contains bounding boxes and joint information for tennis players and ball positions in singles tennis games. Our method shows promising results in predicting the tennis player's movement trajectory with different sequence prediction lengths using the joints and trajectory information with the ball position.</p></details> |  |
| **[Online Omnidirectional Jumping Trajectory Planning for Quadrupedal Robots on Uneven Terrains](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04494v1)** | 2024-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Natural terrain complexity often necessitates agile movements like jumping in animals to improve traversal efficiency. To enable similar capabilities in quadruped robots, complex real-time jumping maneuvers are required. Current research does not adequately address the problem of online omnidirectional jumping and neglects the robot's kinodynamic constraints during trajectory generation. This paper proposes a general and complete cascade online optimization framework for omnidirectional jumping for quadruped robots. Our solution systematically encompasses jumping trajectory generation, a trajectory tracking controller, and a landing controller. It also incorporates environmental perception to navigate obstacles that standard locomotion cannot bypass, such as jumping from high platforms. We introduce a novel jumping plane to parameterize omnidirectional jumping motion and formulate a tightly coupled optimization problem accounting for the kinodynamic constraints, simultaneously optimizing CoM trajectory, Ground Reaction Forces (GRFs), and joint states. To meet the online requirements, we propose an accelerated evolutionary algorithm as the trajectory optimizer to address the complexity of kinodynamic constraints. To ensure stability and accuracy in environmental perception post-landing, we introduce a coarse-to-fine relocalization method that combines global Branch and Bound (BnB) search with Maximum a Posteriori (MAP) estimation for precise positioning during navigation and jumping. The proposed framework achieves jump trajectory generation in approximately 0.1 seconds with a warm start and has been successfully validated on two quadruped robots on uneven terrains. Additionally, we extend the framework's versatility to humanoid robots.</p></details> | Submitted to IJRR |
| **[TrajGPT: Controlled Synthetic Trajectory Generation Using a Multitask Transformer-Based Spatiotemporal Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04381v1)** | 2024-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human mobility modeling from GPS-trajectories and synthetic trajectory generation are crucial for various applications, such as urban planning, disaster management and epidemiology. Both of these tasks often require filling gaps in a partially specified sequence of visits - a new problem that we call "controlled" synthetic trajectory generation. Existing methods for next-location prediction or synthetic trajectory generation cannot solve this problem as they lack the mechanisms needed to constrain the generated sequences of visits. Moreover, existing approaches (1) frequently treat space and time as independent factors, an assumption that fails to hold true in real-world scenarios, and (2) suffer from challenges in accuracy of temporal prediction as they fail to deal with mixed distributions and the inter-relationships of different modes with latent variables (e.g., day-of-the-week). These limitations become even more pronounced when the task involves filling gaps within sequences instead of solely predicting the next visit. We introduce TrajGPT, a transformer-based, multi-task, joint spatiotemporal generative model to address these issues. Taking inspiration from large language models, TrajGPT poses the problem of controlled trajectory generation as that of text infilling in natural language. TrajGPT integrates the spatial and temporal models in a transformer architecture through a Bayesian probability model that ensures that the gaps in a visit sequence are filled in a spatiotemporally consistent manner. Our experiments on public and private datasets demonstrate that TrajGPT not only excels in controlled synthetic visit generation but also outperforms competing models in next-location prediction tasks - Relatively, TrajGPT achieves a 26-fold improvement in temporal accuracy while retaining more than 98% of spatial accuracy on average.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 3 figures, 32nd ACM SIGSPATIAL International Conference on Advances in Geographic Information Systems (ACM SIGSPATIAL 2024)</p></details> |

Data augmentation techniques, such as noise injection and data synthesizing, aim to improve Q-function approximation by smoothing the learned state-action region. However, these methods often fall short of directly improving the quality of offline datasets, leading to suboptimal results. In response, we introduce GTA, Generative Trajectory Augmentation, a novel generative data augmentation approach designed to enrich offline data by augmenting trajectories to be both high-rewarding and dynamically plausible. GTA applies a diffusion model within the data augmentation framework. GTA partially noises original trajectories and then denoises them with classifier-free guidance via conditioning on amplified return value. Our results show that GTA, as a general data augmentation strategy, enhances the performance of widely used offline RL algorithms across various tasks with unique challenges. Furthermore, we conduct a quality analysis of data augmented by GTA and demonstrate that GTA improves the quality of the data.

| **[Efficient Trajectory Forecasting and Generation with Conditional Flow Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10809v2)** | 2024-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction and generation are crucial for autonomous robots in dynamic environments. While prior research has typically focused on either prediction or generation, our approach unifies these tasks to provide a versatile framework and achieve state-of-the-art performance. While diffusion models excel in trajectory generation, their iterative sampling process is computationally intensive, hindering robotic systems' dynamic capabilities. We introduce Trajectory Conditional Flow Matching (T-CFM), a novel approach using flow matching techniques to learn a solver time-varying vector field for efficient, fast trajectory generation. T-CFM demonstrates effectiveness in adversarial tracking, real-world aircraft trajectory forecasting, and long-horizon planning, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines with 35% higher predictive accuracy and 142% improved planning performance. Crucially, T-CFM achieves up to 100$\times$ speed-up compared to diffusion models without sacrificing accuracy, enabling real-time decision making in robotics.

| **[Optimal Convex Cover as Collision-free Space Approximation for Trajectory Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09631v2)** | 2024-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose an online iterative algorithm to find an optimal convex cover to under-approximate the free space for autonomous navigation to delineate Safe Flight Corridors (SFC). The convex cover consists of a set of polytopes such that the union of the polytopes represents obstacle-free space, allowing us to find trajectories for robots that lie within the convex cover. In order to find the SFC that facilitates optimal trajectory generation, we iteratively find overlapping polytopes of maximum volumes that include specified waypoints initialized by a geometric or kinematic planner. Constraints at waypoints appear in two alternating stages of a joint optimization problem, which is solved by a method inspired by the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) with partially distributed variables. We validate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm using a range of parameterized environments and show its applications for two-stage motion planning.</p></details> |  |

However, extensive demonstrations are required for policy robustness and generalization. To reduce the demonstration reliance, we leverage spatial symmetry and propose ET-SEED, an efficient trajectory-level SE(3) equivariant diffusion model for generating action sequences in complex robot manipulation tasks. Further, previous equivariant diffusion models require the per-step equivariance in the Markov process, making it difficult to learn policy under such strong constraints. We theoretically extend equivariant Markov kernels and simplify the condition of equivariant diffusion process, thereby significantly improving training efficiency for trajectory-level SE(3) equivariant diffusion policy in an end-to-end manner. We evaluate ET-SEED on representative robotic manipulation tasks, involving rigid body, articulated and deformable object. Experiments demonstrate superior data efficiency and manipulation proficiency of our proposed method, as well as its ability to generalize to unseen configurations with only a few demonstrations.

However, current robotic-assisted physiotherapy methods struggle including biomechanical metrics in their control algorithms, crucial for safe and effective therapy. This paper introduces BATON, a Biomechanics-Aware Trajectory Optimization approach to robotic Navigation of human musculoskeletal loads. The method integrates a high-fidelity musculoskeletal model of the human shoulder into real-time control of robot-patient interaction during rotator cuff tendon rehabilitation. We extract skeletal dynamics and tendon loading information from an OpenSim shoulder model to solve an optimal control problem, generating strain-minimizing trajectories. Trajectories were realized on a healthy subject by an impedance-controlled robot while estimating the state of the subject's shoulder. Target poses were prescribed to design personalized rehabilitation across a wide range of shoulder motion avoiding high-strain areas. BATON was designed with real-time capabilities, enabling continuous trajectory replanning to address unforeseen variations in tendon strain, such as those from changing muscle activation of the subject.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 9 figures, under review</p></details> |

However, existing methods are often tailored to specific tasks and regions, resulting in limitations related to task specificity, regional dependency, and data quality sensitivity. Addressing these challenges requires a universal human trajectory foundation model capable of generalizing and scaling across diverse tasks and geographic contexts. To this end, we propose UniTraj, a Universal human Trajectory foundation model that is task-adaptive, region-independent, and highly generalizable. To further enhance performance, we construct WorldTrace, the first large-scale, high-quality, globally distributed dataset sourced from open web platforms, encompassing 2.45 million trajectories with billions of points across 70 countries. Through multiple resampling and masking strategies designed for pre-training, UniTraj effectively overcomes geographic and task constraints, adapting to heterogeneous data quality. Extensive experiments across multiple trajectory analysis tasks and real-world datasets demonstrate that UniTraj consistently outperforms existing approaches in terms of scalability and adaptability. These results underscore the potential of UniTraj as a versatile, robust solution for a wide range of trajectory analysis applications, with WorldTrace serving as an ideal but non-exclusive foundation for training.</p></details> |  |
| **[How to Drawjectory? -- Trajectory Planning using Programming by Demonstration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03815v1)** | 2024-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A flight trajectory defines how exactly a quadrocopter moves in the three-dimensional space from one position to another. Automatic flight trajectory planning faces challenges such as high computational effort and a lack of precision. Hence, when low computational effort or precise control is required, programming the flight route trajectory manually might be preferable. However, this requires in-depth knowledge of how to accurately plan flight trajectories in three-dimensional space. We propose planning quadrocopter flight trajectories manually using the Programming by Demonstration (PbD) approach -- simply drawing the trajectory in the three-dimensional space by hand. This simplifies the planning process and reduces the level of in-depth knowledge required. We implemented the approach in the context of the Quadcopter Lab at Ulm University. In order to evaluate our approach, we compare the precision and accuracy of the trajectories drawn by a user using our approach as well as the required time with those manually programmed using a domain specific language. The evaluation shows that the Drawjectory workflow is, on average, 78.7 seconds faster without a significant loss of precision, shown by an average deviation 6.67 cm.</p></details> |  |
| **[Revisiting CNNs for Trajectory Similarity Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19761v2)** | 2024-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Similarity search is a fundamental but expensive operator in querying trajectory data, due to its quadratic complexity of distance computation. To mitigate the computational burden for long trajectories, neural networks have been widely employed for similarity learning and each trajectory is encoded as a high-dimensional vector for similarity search with linear complexity. Given the sequential nature of trajectory data, previous efforts have been primarily devoted to the utilization of RNNs or Transformers. In this paper, we argue that the common practice of treating trajectory as sequential data results in excessive attention to capturing long-term global dependency between two sequences. Instead, our investigation reveals the pivotal role of local similarity, prompting a revisit of simple CNNs for trajectory similarity learning. We introduce ConvTraj, incorporating both 1D and 2D convolutions to capture sequential and geo-distribution features of trajectories, respectively. In addition, we conduct a series of theoretical analyses to justify the effectiveness of ConvTraj. Experimental results on four real-world large-scale datasets demonstrate that ConvTraj achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in trajectory similarity search. Owing to the simple network structure of ConvTraj, the training and inference speed on the Porto dataset with 1.6 million trajectories are increased by at least $240$x and $2.16$x, respectively. The source code and dataset can be found at \textit{\url{https://github.com/Proudc/ConvTraj}}.</p></details> |  |
| **[NEOviz: Uncertainty-Driven Visual Analysis of Asteroid Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02812v1)** | 2024-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce NEOviz, an interactive visualization system designed to assist planetary defense experts in the visual analysis of the movements of near-Earth objects in the Solar System that might prove hazardous to Earth. Asteroids are often discovered using optical telescopes and their trajectories are calculated from images, resulting in an inherent asymmetric uncertainty in their position and velocity. Consequently, we typically cannot determine the exact trajectory of an asteroid, and an ensemble of trajectories must be generated to estimate an asteroid's movement over time. When propagating these ensembles over decades, it is challenging to visualize the varying paths and determine their potential impact on Earth, which could cause catastrophic damage. NEOviz equips experts with the necessary tools to effectively analyze the existing catalog of asteroid observations. In particular, we present a novel approach for visualizing the 3D uncertainty region through which an asteroid travels, while providing accurate spatial context in relation to system-critical infrastructure such as Earth, the Moon, and artificial satellites. Furthermore, we use NEOviz to visualize the divergence of asteroid trajectories, capturing high-variance events in an asteroid's orbital properties. For potential impactors, we combine the 3D visualization with an uncertainty-aware impact map to illustrate the potential risks to human populations. NEOviz was developed with continuous input from members of the planetary defense community through a participatory design process. It is exemplified in three real-world use cases and evaluated via expert feedback interviews.</p></details> |  |

We employ state-of-the-art computer vision and deep learning to create an end-to-end pipeline that enhances vehicle detection, tracking, and trajectory stabilization. Conducted in the Songdo International Business District, South Korea, the study used a multi-drone experiment over 20 intersections, capturing approximately 12TB of 4K video data over four days. We developed a novel track stabilization method that uses detected vehicle bounding boxes as exclusion masks during image registration, which, combined with advanced georeferencing techniques, accurately transforms vehicle coordinates into real-world geographical data. Additionally, our framework includes robust vehicle dimension estimation and detailed road segmentation for in-depth traffic analysis. The framework produced two high-quality datasets: the Songdo Traffic dataset, comprising nearly 1 million unique vehicle trajectories, and the Songdo Vision dataset, containing over 5,000 human-annotated frames with about 300,000 vehicle instances in four classes. Comparisons between drone-derived data and high-precision sensor data from an instrumented probe vehicle highlight the accuracy and consistency of our framework's extraction in dense urban settings. By publicly releasing these datasets and the pipeline source code, this work sets new benchmarks for data quality, reproducibility, and scalability in traffic research. Results demonstrate the potential of integrating drone technology with advanced computer vision for precise, cost-effective urban traffic monitoring, providing valuable resources for the research community to develop intelligent transportation systems and improve traffic management strategies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hyper-SD: Trajectory Segmented Consistency Model for Efficient Image Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13686v3)** | 2024-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, a series of diffusion-aware distillation algorithms have emerged to alleviate the computational overhead associated with the multi-step inference process of Diffusion Models (DMs). Current distillation techniques often dichotomize into two distinct aspects: i) ODE Trajectory Preservation; and ii) ODE Trajectory Reformulation. However, these approaches suffer from severe performance degradation or domain shifts. To address these limitations, we propose Hyper-SD, a novel framework that synergistically amalgamates the advantages of ODE Trajectory Preservation and Reformulation, while maintaining near-lossless performance during step compression. Firstly, we introduce Trajectory Segmented Consistency Distillation to progressively perform consistent distillation within pre-defined time-step segments, which facilitates the preservation of the original ODE trajectory from a higher-order perspective. Secondly, we incorporate human feedback learning to boost the performance of the model in a low-step regime and mitigate the performance loss incurred by the distillation process. Thirdly, we integrate score distillation to further improve the low-step generation capability of the model and offer the first attempt to leverage a unified LoRA to support the inference process at all steps. Extensive experiments and user studies demonstrate that Hyper-SD achieves SOTA performance from 1 to 8 inference steps for both SDXL and SD1.5. For example, Hyper-SDXL surpasses SDXL-Lightning by +0.68 in CLIP Score and +0.51 in Aes Score in the 1-step inference.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2024 (Camera-Ready Version).

Principal component analysis (PCA) is applied to trajectory data consisting of $n_s = 4,000,000$ datapoints, of the FPUT $\beta$ model with $N = 32$ coupled oscillators, revealing a critical relationship between $m^{\ast}$ and the model's nonlinear strength. For weak nonlinearities, $m^{\ast} \ll n$, where $n = 2N$. In contrast, for strong nonlinearities, $m^{\ast} \rightarrow n - 1$, consistently with the ergodic hypothesis. Furthermore, one of the potential limitations of PCA is addressed through an analysis with t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding ($t$-SNE). Accordingly, we found strong evidence suggesting that the datapoints lie near or on a curved low-dimensional manifold for weak nonlinearities.</p></details> | 20 pages, 18 figures |

The number of features is comparable to the sample size and errors may be heavy-tailed. We introduce estimators that precisely track the generalization error of the iterates along the trajectory of the iterative algorithm. These estimators are provably consistent under suitable conditions. The results are illustrated through several examples, including Huber regression, pseudo-Huber regression, and their penalized variants with non-smooth regularizer. We provide explicit generalization error estimates for iterates generated from GD and SGD, or from proximal SGD in the presence of a non-smooth regularizer. The proposed risk estimates serve as effective proxies for the actual generalization error, allowing us to determine the optimal stopping iteration that minimizes the generalization error. Extensive simulations confirm the effectiveness of the proposed generalization error estimates.</p></details> | <details><summary>Camer...</summary><p>Camera-ready version of NeurIPS 2024 paper</p></details> |

Despite intensive research on driver behavior prediction, existing approaches typically overlook the interactions between AVs and HDVs assuming that HDV trajectories are not affected by AV actions. To address this gap, we present a transformer-transfer learning-based interaction-aware trajectory predictor for safe motion planning of autonomous driving, focusing on a vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) interaction scenario consisting of an AV and an HDV. Specifically, we construct a transformer-based interaction-aware trajectory predictor using widely available datasets of HDV trajectory data and further transfer the learned predictor using a small set of AV-HDV interaction data. Then, to better incorporate the proposed trajectory predictor into the motion planning module of AVs, we introduce an uncertainty quantification method to characterize the errors of the predictor, which are integrated into the path-planning process. Our experimental results demonstrate the value of explicitly considering interactions and handling uncertainties.</p></details> |  |

Current graph-based routing pipelines, while effective, involve substantial costs in constructing, maintaining, and updating road network graphs to reflect real-time conditions. In this study, we propose a new trajectory-based routing paradigm that bypasses current workflows by directly utilizing raw trajectory data to compute efficient routes. Our method, named TrajRoute, uniquely "follows" historical trajectories from a source to a destination, constructing paths that reflect actual driver behavior and implicit preferences. To supplement areas with sparse trajectory data, the road network is also incorporated into TrajRoute's index, and tunable parameters are introduced to control the balance between road segments and trajectories, ensuring a unified and adaptable routing approach. We experimentally verify our approach by comparing it to an existing online routing service. Our results demonstrate that as the number of trajectories covering the road network increases, TrajRoute produces increasingly accurate travel time and route length estimates while gradually eliminating the need to downgrade to the road network. This highlights the potential of simpler, data-driven pipelines for routing, offering lower-maintenance alternatives to conventional systems.</p></details> |  |

To bolster the adoption of the continuous-time paradigm, we propose a so-called Gaussian Process Trajectory Representation (GPTR) framework for continuous-time motion estimation (CTME) tasks. Our approach stands out by employing a third-order random jerk model, featuring closed-form expressions for both rotational and translational state derivatives. This model provides smooth, continuous trajectory representations that are crucial for precise estimation of complex motion. To support the wider robotics and computer vision communities, we have made the source code for GPTR available as a light-weight header-only library. This format was chosen for its ease of integration, allowing developers to incorporate GPTR into existing systems without needing extensive code modifications. Moreover, we also provide a set of optimization examples with LiDAR, camera, IMU, UWB factors, and closed-form analytical Jacobians under the proposed GP framework. Our experiments demonstrate the efficacy and efficiency of GP-based trajectory representation in various motion estimation tasks, and the examples can serve as the prototype to help researchers quickly develop future applications such as batch optimization, calibration, sensor fusion, trajectory planning, etc., with continuous-time trajectory representation.

Theoretical approximation guarantees on uniform grids are presented for optimal controls with certain regularity properties, along with guarantees of localization of change points by wavelet transform. Numerical illustrations are provided for control profiles involving discontinuities to show the effectiveness of the localization and refinement strategy.

The key idea is to capture each task by an object-centric representation, specifically the SE(3) object pose trajectory relative to the target. This approach decouples embodiment actions from sensory inputs, facilitating learning from various demonstration types, including both action-based and action-less human hand demonstrations, as well as cross-embodiment generalization. Additionally, object pose trajectories inherently capture planning constraints from demonstrations without the need for manually crafted rules. To guide the robot in executing the task, the object trajectory is used to condition a diffusion policy. We show improvement compared to prior work on RLBench simulated tasks.

At the heart of RopeTP is a hierarchical attention mechanism that significantly improves context awareness, which is essential for accurately inferring the posture of occluded body parts. This is achieved by exploiting the relationships with visible anatomical structures, enhancing the accuracy of local pose estimations. The improved robustness of these local estimations allows for the reconstruction of precise and stable global trajectories. Additionally, RopeTP incorporates a diffusion trajectory model that predicts realistic human motion from local pose sequences. This model ensures that the generated trajectories are not only consistent with observed local actions but also unfold naturally over time, thereby improving the realism and stability of 3D human motion reconstruction. Extensive experimental validation shows that RopeTP surpasses current methods on two benchmark datasets, particularly excelling in scenarios with occlusions. It also outperforms methods that rely on SLAM for initial camera estimates and extensive optimization, delivering more accurate and realistic trajectories.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by WACV 2025 (Round 1)</p></details> |

Significant progress has been made in the past decade thanks to the availability of pedestrian trajectory datasets, which enable trajectory prediction methods to learn from pedestrians' past movements and predict future trajectories. However, these datasets and methods typically assume that the observed trajectory sequence is complete, ignoring real-world issues such as sensor failure, occlusion, and limited fields of view that can result in missing values in observed trajectories. To address this challenge, we present TrajImpute, a pedestrian trajectory prediction dataset that simulates missing coordinates in the observed trajectory, enhancing real-world applicability. TrajImpute maintains a uniform distribution of missing data within the observed trajectories. In this work, we comprehensively examine several imputation methods to reconstruct the missing coordinates and benchmark them for imputing pedestrian trajectories. Furthermore, we provide a thorough analysis of recent trajectory prediction methods and evaluate the performance of these models on the imputed trajectories. Our experimental evaluation of the imputation and trajectory prediction methods offers several valuable insights. Our dataset provides a foundational resource for future research on imputation-aware pedestrian trajectory prediction, potentially accelerating the deployment of these methods in real-world applications.

We begin by introducing the Quantile Attention-Fourier Deep Operator Network (QAF-DeepONet), designed to capture the complex dynamics of voltage trajectories and reliably estimate quantiles of the target trajectory without any distributional assumptions. The proposed operator regression model maps the observed portion of the voltage trajectory to its unobserved post-fault trajectory. Our methodology employs a pre-training and fine-tuning process to address the challenge of limited data availability. To ensure data privacy in learning the pre-trained model, we use merging via federated learning with data from neighboring buses, enabling the model to learn the underlying voltage dynamics from such buses without directly sharing their data. After pre-training, we fine-tune the model with data from the target bus, allowing it to adapt to unique dynamics and operating conditions. Finally, we integrate conformal prediction into the fine-tuned model to ensure coverage guarantees for the predicted intervals. We evaluated the performance of the proposed methodology using the New England 39-bus test system considering detailed models of voltage and frequency controllers. Two metrics, Prediction Interval Coverage Probability (PICP) and Prediction Interval Normalized Average Width (PINAW), are used to numerically assess the model's performance in predicting intervals. The results show that the proposed approach offers practical and reliable uncertainty quantification in predicting the interval of post-fault voltage trajectories.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Cooperative Trajectory Representations for Motion Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00371v2)** | 2024-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motion forecasting is an essential task for autonomous driving, and utilizing information from infrastructure and other vehicles can enhance forecasting capabilities. Existing research mainly focuses on leveraging single-frame cooperative information to enhance the limited perception capability of the ego vehicle, while underutilizing the motion and interaction context of traffic participants observed from cooperative devices. In this paper, we propose a forecasting-oriented representation paradigm to utilize motion and interaction features from cooperative information. Specifically, we present V2X-Graph, a representative framework to achieve interpretable and end-to-end trajectory feature fusion for cooperative motion forecasting. V2X-Graph is evaluated on V2X-Seq in vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) scenarios. To further evaluate on vehicle-to-everything (V2X) scenario, we construct the first real-world V2X motion forecasting dataset V2X-Traj, which contains multiple autonomous vehicles and infrastructure in every scenario. Experimental results on both V2X-Seq and V2X-Traj show the advantage of our method. We hope both V2X-Graph and V2X-Traj will benefit the further development of cooperative motion forecasting.

While most existing methods consider this as a discrete problem, popularity actually evolves continuously, exhibiting rich dynamic properties such as change rates and growth patterns. In this paper, we argue that popularity trajectory prediction is more practical, as it aims to forecast the entire trajectory of how popularity unfolds over arbitrary future time. This approach offers insights into both instantaneous popularity and the underlying dynamic properties. However, traditional methods for popularity trajectory prediction primarily rely on specific diffusion mechanism assumptions, which may not align well with real-world dynamics and compromise their performance. To address these limitations, we propose NODEPT, a novel approach based on neural ordinary differential equations (ODEs) for popularity trajectory prediction. NODEPT models the continuous dynamics of the underlying diffusion system using neural ODEs. We first employ an encoder to initialize the latent state representations of information cascades, consisting of two representation learning modules that capture the co-evolution structural characteristics and temporal patterns of cascades from different perspectives. More importantly, we then introduce an ODE-based generative module that learns the dynamics of the diffusion system in the latent space. Finally, a decoder transforms the latent state into the prediction of the future popularity trajectory. Our experimental results on three real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority and rationality of the proposed NODEPT method.</p></details> | <details><summary>The t...</summary><p>The time complexity analysis in section 4.4 contains error; we overlooked the impact of the memory module</p></details> |

However, for most problems of interest, MPC relies on the recursive solution of highly non-convex trajectory optimization problems, leading to high computational complexity and strong dependency on initialization. In this work, we present a unified framework to combine the main strengths of optimization-based and learning-based methods for MPC. Our approach entails embedding high-capacity, transformer-based neural network models within the optimization process for trajectory generation, whereby the transformer provides a near-optimal initial guess, or target plan, to a non-convex optimization problem. Our experiments, performed in simulation and the real world onboard a free flyer platform, demonstrate the capabilities of our framework to improve MPC convergence and runtime. Compared to purely optimization-based approaches, results show that our approach can improve trajectory generation performance by up to 75%, reduce the number of solver iterations by up to 45%, and improve overall MPC runtime by 7x without loss in performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 7 figures.

We study generative modeling for planning with datasets repurposed from offline reinforcement learning. Specifically, we identify temporal consistency in the absence of step-wise rewards as one key technical challenge. We introduce the Latent Plan Transformer (LPT), a novel model that leverages a latent variable to connect a Transformer-based trajectory generator and the final return. LPT can be learned with maximum likelihood estimation on trajectory-return pairs. In learning, posterior sampling of the latent variable naturally integrates sub-trajectories to form a consistent abstraction despite the finite context. At test time, the latent variable is inferred from an expected return before policy execution, realizing the idea of planning as inference. Our experiments demonstrate that LPT can discover improved decisions from sub-optimal trajectories, achieving competitive performance across several benchmarks, including Gym-Mujoco, Franka Kitchen, Maze2D, and Connect Four. It exhibits capabilities in nuanced credit assignments, trajectory stitching, and adaptation to environmental contingencies. These results validate that latent variable inference can be a strong alternative to step-wise reward prompting.</p></details> |  |

Trajectory optimization is a powerful and widely used algorithm in control, parameterized by a cost and a dynamics function. The key to our approach is to leverage the recent progress in differentiable trajectory optimization, which enables computing the gradients of the loss with respect to the parameters of trajectory optimization. As a result, the cost and dynamics functions of trajectory optimization can be learned end-to-end. DiffTORI addresses the ``objective mismatch'' issue of prior model-based RL algorithms, as the dynamics model in DiffTORI is learned to directly maximize task performance by differentiating the policy gradient loss through the trajectory optimization process. We further benchmark DiffTORI for imitation learning on standard robotic manipulation task suites with high-dimensional sensory observations and compare our method to feed-forward policy classes as well as Energy-Based Models (EBM) and Diffusion. Across 15 model-based RL tasks and 35 imitation learning tasks with high-dimensional image and point cloud inputs, DiffTORI outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods in both domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2024 (Spotlight)</p></details> |

Traditional optimization methods for trajectory tracking face significant computational challenges and lack robustness in dynamic environments. Our approach employs deep reinforcement learning (RL) to overcome these limitations, leveraging 3D pointcloud data to perceive the environment without relying on memory-intensive obstacle representations like occupancy grids. The proposed system features two RL agents: one for predicting UAV velocities to follow a reference trajectory and another for managing collision avoidance in the presence of obstacles. This architecture ensures real-time performance and adaptability to uncertainties. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach through simulated and real-world experiments, highlighting improvements over state-of-the-art RL and optimization-based methods. Additionally, a curriculum learning paradigm is employed to scale the algorithms to more complex environments, ensuring robust trajectory tracking and obstacle avoidance in both static and dynamic scenarios.</p></details> |  |

DisCo is a distributed contact-implicit trajectory optimization algorithm, which allows a group of robots to optimize a time sequence of forces to objects and to their environment to accomplish tasks such as collaborative manipulation, robot team sports, and modular robot locomotion. We build our algorithm on a variant of the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM), where each robot computes its own contact forces and contact-switching events from a smaller single-robot, contact-implicit trajectory optimization problem, while cooperating with other robots through dual variables, enforcing constraints between robots. Each robot iterates between solving its local problem, and communicating over a wireless mesh network to enforce these consistency constraints with its neighbors, ultimately converging to a coordinated plan for the group. The local problems solved by each robot are significantly less challenging than a centralized problem with all robots' contact forces and switching events, improving the computational efficiency, while also preserving the privacy of some aspects of each robot's operation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm in simulations of collaborative manipulation, multi-robot team sports scenarios, and in modular robot locomotion, where DisCo achieves $3$x higher success rates with a 2.5x to 5x faster computation time. Further, we provide results of hardware experiments on a modular truss robot, with three collaborating truss nodes planning individually while working together to produce a punctuated rolling-gate motion of the composite structure.

State-of-the-art human trajectory prediction methods are limited by their focus on collision avoidance and short-term planning, and their inability to model complex interactions of humans with the environment. In contrast, our approach overcomes these limitations by predicting sequences of human interactions with the environment and using this information to guide trajectory predictions over a horizon of up to 60s. We leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to predict interactions with the environment by conditioning the LLM prediction on rich contextual information about the scene. This information is given as a 3D Dynamic Scene Graph that encodes the geometry, semantics, and traversability of the environment into a hierarchical representation. We then ground these interaction sequences into multi-modal spatio-temporal distributions over human positions using a probabilistic approach based on continuous-time Markov Chains. To evaluate our approach, we introduce a new semi-synthetic dataset of long-term human trajectories in complex indoor environments, which also includes annotations of human-object interactions. We show in thorough experimental evaluations that our approach achieves a 54% lower average negative log-likelihood and a 26.5% lower Best-of-20 displacement error compared to the best non-privileged (i.e., evaluated in a zero-shot fashion on the dataset) baselines for a time horizon of 60s.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures.

Detection methods in generative language models (GLMs) mainly focus on uncertainty estimation and embedding distance measurement, with the latter proven to be most effective in traditional linguistic tasks like summarization and translation. However, another complex generative scenario mathematical reasoning poses significant challenges to embedding-based methods due to its high-density feature of output spaces, but this feature causes larger discrepancies in the embedding shift trajectory between different samples in latent spaces. Hence, we propose a trajectory-based method TV score, which uses trajectory volatility for OOD detection in mathematical reasoning. Experiments show that our method outperforms all traditional algorithms on GLMs under mathematical reasoning scenarios and can be extended to more applications with high-density features in output spaces, such as multiple-choice questions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |

In this letter, we extend the recently proposed Hybrid iLQR method [1] to handle state and input constraints within an indirect optimization framework, aiming to preserve computational efficiency and ensure dynamic feasibility. Specifically, we incorporate two constraint handling mechanisms into the Hybrid iLQR: Discrete Barrier State and Augmented Lagrangian methods. Comprehensive simulations across various operational situations are conducted to evaluate and compare the performance of these extended methods in terms of convergence and their ability to handle infeasible starting trajectories. Results indicate that while the Discrete Barrier State approach is more computationally efficient, the Augmented Lagrangian method outperforms it in complex and real-world scenarios with infeasible initial trajectories.</p></details> | 6 pages 4 figures |

By combining sampling-based Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) control with gradient-based Interior-Point Differential Dynamic Programming (IPDDP), we leverage their respective strengths in exploration and smoothing. The proposed method, MPPI-IPDDP, involves three steps: First, MPPI control is used to generate a coarse trajectory. Second, a collision-free convex corridor is constructed. Third, IPDDP is applied to smooth the coarse trajectory, utilizing the collision-free corridor from the second step. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we apply the proposed algorithm to trajectory optimization for differential-drive wheeled mobile robots and point-mass quadrotors. In comparisons with other MPPI variants and continuous optimization-based solvers, our method shows superior performance in terms of computational robustness and trajectory smoothness.

| **[Choice between Partial Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22690v1)** | 2024-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As AI agents generate increasingly sophisticated behaviors, manually encoding human preferences to guide these agents becomes more challenging. To address this, it has been suggested that agents instead learn preferences from human choice data. This approach requires a model of choice behavior that the agent can use to interpret the data. For choices between partial trajectories of states and actions, previous models assume choice probabilities to be determined by the partial return or the cumulative advantage. We consider an alternative model based instead on the bootstrapped return, which adds to the partial return an estimate of the future return. Benefits of the bootstrapped return model stem from its treatment of human beliefs. Unlike partial return, choices based on bootstrapped return reflect human beliefs about the environment. Further, while recovering the reward function from choices based on cumulative advantage requires that those beliefs are correct, doing so from choices based on bootstrapped return does not. To motivate the bootstrapped return model, we formulate axioms and prove an Alignment Theorem. This result formalizes how, for a general class of human preferences, such models are able to disentangle goals from beliefs. This ensures recovery of an aligned reward function when learning from choices based on bootstrapped return. The bootstrapped return model also affords greater robustness to choice behavior. Even when choices are based on partial return, learning via a bootstrapped return model recovers an aligned reward function. The same holds with choices based on the cumulative advantage if the human and the agent both adhere to correct and consistent beliefs about the environment. On the other hand, if choices are based on bootstrapped return, learning via partial return or cumulative advantage models does not generally produce an aligned reward function.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Overtaking Trajectory Planning Framework Based on Spatio-temporal Topology and Reachable Set Analysis Ensuring Time Efficiency](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22643v1)** | 2024-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating overtaking trajectories in high-speed scenarios presents significant challenges and is typically addressed through hierarchical planning methods. However, this method has two primary drawbacks. First, heuristic algorithms can only provide a single initial solution, which may lead to local optima and consequently diminish the quality of the solution. Second, the time efficiency of trajectory refinement based on numerical optimization is insufficient. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes an overtaking trajectory planning framework based on spatio-temporal topology and reachable set analysis (SROP), to improve trajectory quality and time efficiency. Specifically, this paper introduces topological classes to describe trajectories representing different overtaking behaviors, which support the spatio-temporal topological search method employed by the upper-layer planner to identify diverse initial paths. This approach helps prevent getting stuck in local optima, enhancing the overall solution quality by considering multiple initial solutions from distinct topologies. Moreover, the reachable set method is integrated into the lower-layer planner for parallel trajectory evaluation. This method enhances planning efficiency by decoupling vehicle model constraints from the optimization process, enabling parallel computation while ensuring control feasibility. Simulation results show that the proposed method improves the smoothness of generated trajectories by 66.8% compared to state-of-the-art methods, highlighting its effectiveness in enhancing trajectory quality. Additionally, this method reduces computation time by 62.9%, demonstrating its efficiency.</p></details> |  |

LCGA summarizes similar patterns of change over time into a few distinct categories called trajectory groups, which are then included as "treatments" in the MSM. MSMs are a class of causal models that correctly handle treatment-confounder feedback. The parameters of LCGA-MSMs can be consistently estimated using different estimators, such as inverse probability weighting (IPW), g-computation, and pooled longitudinal targeted maximum likelihood estimation (pooled LTMLE). These three estimators of the parameters of LCGA-MSMs are currently implemented in our package. In the context of a time-dependent outcome, we previously proposed a combination of LCGA and history-restricted MSMs (LCGA-HRMSMs).

However, they face challenges due to their high-dimensional and unstable dynamics, as well as the complex contact-rich nature of the tasks. Model-based optimal control methods offer precise and systematic control but are limited by high computational complexity and accurate contact sensing. On the other hand, reinforcement learning (RL) provides robustness and handles high-dimensional spaces but suffers from inefficient learning, unnatural motion, and sim-to-real gaps. To address these challenges, we introduce Opt2Skill, an end-to-end pipeline that combines model-based trajectory optimization with RL to achieve robust whole-body loco-manipulation. We generate reference motions for the Digit humanoid robot using differential dynamic programming (DDP) and train RL policies to track these trajectories. Our results demonstrate that Opt2Skill outperforms pure RL methods in both training efficiency and task performance, with optimal trajectories that account for torque limits enhancing trajectory tracking. We successfully transfer our approach to real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we provide a method for the learning of the recovery trajectory of an individual patient, as they undertake exercises as part of their physical therapy towards recovery of their loss of movement ability, following a critical illness. The difference between the Movement Recovery Scores (MRSs) attained by a patient, when undertaking a given exercise routine on successive instances, is given by a statistical distance/divergence between the (posterior) probabilities of random graphs that are Bayesianly learnt using time series data on locations of 20 of the patient's joints, recorded on an e-platform as the patient exercises. This allows for the computation of the MRS on every occasion the patient undertakes this exercise, using which, the recovery trajectory is drawn. We learn each graph as a Random Geometric Graph drawn in a probabilistic metric space, and identify the closed-form marginal posterior of any edge of the graph, given the correlation structure of the multivariate time series data on joint locations. On the basis of our recovery learning, we offer recommendations on the optimal exercise routines for patients with given level of mobility impairment.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we develop a strategy to locally adapt the step size parameter of HMC at every iteration by evaluating a low-rank approximation of the local Hessian and estimating its largest eigenvalue. We combine it with a strategy to similarly adapt the trajectory length by monitoring the no U-turn condition, resulting in an adaptive sampler, ATLAS: adapting trajectory length and step-size. We further use a delayed rejection framework for making multiple proposals that improves the computational efficiency of ATLAS, and develop an approach for automatically tuning its hyperparameters during warmup. We compare ATLAS with state-of-the-art samplers like NUTS on a suite of synthetic and real world examples, and show that i) unlike NUTS, ATLAS is able to accurately sample difficult distributions with complex geometries, ii) it is computationally competitive to NUTS for simpler distributions, and iii) it is more robust to the tuning of hyperparamters.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code available at https://github.com/modichirag/AtlasSampler</p></details> |

To address this, we propose Trajectory Flow Matching (TFM), which trains a Neural SDE in a simulation-free manner, bypassing backpropagation through the dynamics. TFM leverages the flow matching technique from generative modeling to model time series. In this work we first establish necessary conditions for TFM to learn time series data.

However, ensuring safety throughout both the learning process and policy deployment remains a key challenge due to the risky exploration inherent in DRL, as well as the discrete nature of actions taken at intervals. These discontinuities, despite being part of a continuous action space, can lead to abrupt changes between successive actions, causing instability and unsafe intermediate states. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an integrated framework that combines DRL with a jerk-bounded trajectory generator (JBTG) and a robust low-level control strategy, significantly enhancing the safety, stability, and reliability of robotic manipulators. The low-level controller ensures the precise execution of DRL-generated commands, while the JBTG refines these motions to produce smooth, continuous trajectories that prevent abrupt or unsafe actions. The framework also includes pre-calculated safe velocity zones for smooth braking, preventing joint limit violations and ensuring compliance with kinematic constraints. This approach not only guarantees the robustness and safety of the robotic system but also optimizes motion control, making it suitable for practical applications. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is demonstrated through its application to a highly complex heavy-duty manipulator.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been submitted to the IEEE for potential publication</p></details> |

Modeling the interactions among agents is the key to understanding and predicting the dynamics of the complex system, e.g., predicting the trajectories of traffic participants in the city. Compared with interaction modeling in homogeneous systems such as pedestrians in a crowded scene, heterogeneous interaction modeling is less explored. Worse still, the error accumulation problem becomes more severe since the interactions are more complex. To tackle the two problems, this paper proposes heterogeneous interaction modeling with reduced accumulated error for multi-agent trajectory prediction. Based on the historical trajectories, our method infers the dynamic interaction graphs among agents, featured by directed interacting relations and interacting effects. A heterogeneous attention mechanism is defined on the interaction graphs for aggregating the influence from heterogeneous neighbors to the target agent. To alleviate the error accumulation problem, this paper analyzes the error sources from the spatial and temporal perspectives, and proposes to introduce the graph entropy and the mixup training strategy for reducing the two types of errors respectively. Our method is examined on three real-world datasets containing heterogeneous agents, and the experimental results validate the superiority of our method.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, accepted by IEEE TNNLS</p></details> |

Yet, it poses challenges due to substantial parameter size and limited scalability, which is particularly critical in sequential decision-making scenarios where resources are constrained such as in robots and drones with limited computational power. Mamba, a promising new linear-time sequence model, offers performance on par with transformers while delivering substantially fewer parameters on long sequences. As it remains unclear whether Mamba is compatible with trajectory optimization, this work aims to conduct comprehensive experiments to explore the potential of Decision Mamba (dubbed DeMa) in offline RL from the aspect of data structures and essential components with the following insights: (1) Long sequences impose a significant computational burden without contributing to performance improvements since DeMa's focus on sequences diminishes approximately exponentially. Consequently, we introduce a Transformer-like DeMa as opposed to an RNN-like DeMa. (2) For the components of DeMa, we identify the hidden attention mechanism as a critical factor in its success, which can also work well with other residual structures and does not require position embedding. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our specially designed DeMa is compatible with trajectory optimization and surpasses previous methods, outperforming Decision Transformer (DT) with higher performance while using 30\% fewer parameters in Atari, and exceeding DT with only a quarter of the parameters in MuJoCo.</p></details> | 23 pages, 11 figures |

Most ZS-ICL methods use large language models (LLMs) to generate (input, label) pairs as pseudo-demonstrations and leverage historical pseudo-demonstrations to help solve the current problem. They assume that problems are from the same task and traverse them in a random order. However, in real-world scenarios, problems usually come from diverse tasks, and only a few belong to the same task. The random traversing order may generate unreliable pseudo-demonstrations and lead to error accumulation. To address this problem, we reformulate ZS-ICL as a planning problem and propose a Demonstration-aware Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) approach (DAWN-ICL), which leverages MCTS to strategically plan the problem-solving trajectories for ZS-ICL. In addition, to achieve effective and efficient Q value estimation, we propose a novel demonstration-aware Q-value function and use it to enhance the selection phase and accelerate the expansion and simulation phases in MCTS. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of DAWN-ICL on in-domain and cross-domain scenarios, and it even outperforms ICL using human-annotated labels.

Moreover, we reassess the role of social interaction and present a novel method based on explicit modality modulation to integrate temporal and social features, thereby constructing an efficient single-stage inference pipeline. Results on public benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our model compared with the state-of-the-art methods.

| **[Context-Aware Trajectory Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19136v1)** | 2024-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory anomaly detection is crucial for effective decision-making in urban and human mobility management. Existing methods of trajectory anomaly detection generally focus on training a trajectory generative model and evaluating the likelihood of reconstructing a given trajectory. However, previous work often lacks important contextual information on the trajectory, such as the agent's information (e.g., agent ID) or geographic information (e.g., Points of Interest (POI)), which could provide additional information on accurately capturing anomalous behaviors. To fill this gap, we propose a context-aware anomaly detection approach that models contextual information related to trajectories. The proposed method is based on a trajectory reconstruction framework guided by contextual factors such as agent ID and contextual POI embedding. The injection of contextual information aims to improve the performance of anomaly detection. We conducted experiments in two cities and demonstrated that the proposed approach significantly outperformed existing methods by effectively modeling contextual information. Overall, this paper paves a new direction for advancing trajectory anomaly detection.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Historical Trajectory Assisted Optimization Method for Zeroth-Order Federated Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15955v5)** | 2024-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated learning heavily relies on distributed gradient descent techniques. In the situation where gradient information is not available, the gradients need to be estimated from zeroth-order information, which typically involves computing finite-differences along isotropic random directions. This method suffers from high estimation errors, as the geometric features of the objective landscape may be overlooked during the isotropic sampling. In this work, we propose a non-isotropic sampling method to improve the gradient estimation procedure. Gradients in our method are estimated in a subspace spanned by historical trajectories of solutions, aiming to encourage the exploration of promising regions and hence improve the convergence. The proposed method uses a covariance matrix for sampling which is a convex combination of two parts. The first part is a thin projection matrix containing the basis of the subspace which is designed to improve the exploitation ability. The second part is the historical trajectories. We implement this method in zeroth-order federated settings, and show that the convergence rate aligns with existing ones while introducing no significant overheads in communication or local computation. The effectiveness of our proposal is verified on several numerical experiments in comparison to several commonly-used zeroth-order federated optimization algorithms.</p></details> |  |
| **[VECTOR: Velocity-Enhanced GRU Neural Network for Real-Time 3D UAV Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23305v1)** | 2024-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper tackles the challenge of real-time 3D trajectory prediction for UAVs, which is critical for applications such as aerial surveillance and defense. Existing prediction models that rely primarily on position data struggle with accuracy, especially when UAV movements fall outside the position domain used in training. Our research identifies a gap in utilizing velocity estimates, first-order dynamics, to better capture the dynamics and enhance prediction accuracy and generalizability in any position domain. To bridge this gap, we propose a new trajectory prediction method using Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) within sequence-based neural networks. Unlike traditional methods that rely on RNNs or transformers, this approach forecasts future velocities and positions based on historical velocity data instead of positions. This is designed to enhance prediction accuracy and scalability, overcoming challenges faced by conventional models in handling complex UAV dynamics. The methodology employs both synthetic and real-world 3D UAV trajectory data, capturing a wide range of flight patterns, speeds, and agility. Synthetic data is generated using the Gazebo simulator and PX4 Autopilot, while real-world data comes from the UZH-FPV and Mid-Air drone racing datasets. The GRU-based models significantly outperform state-of-the-art RNN approaches, with a mean square error (MSE) as low as 2 x 10^-8. Overall, our findings confirm the effectiveness of incorporating velocity data in improving the accuracy of UAV trajectory predictions across both synthetic and real-world scenarios, in and out of position data distributions. Finally, we open-source our 5000 trajectories dataset and a ROS 2 package to facilitate the integration with existing ROS-based UAV systems.</p></details> |  |

Advances in machine learning have made traditional image and text-based CAPTCHAs vulnerable to attacks, leading modern CAPTCHAs, such as GeeTest and Akamai, to incorporate behavioral analysis like mouse trajectory detection. Existing bypass techniques struggle to fully mimic human behavior, making it difficult to evaluate the effectiveness of anti-bot measures. To address this, we propose a diffusion model-based mouse trajectory generation framework (DMTG), which controls trajectory complexity and produces realistic human-like mouse movements. DMTG also provides white-box and black-box testing methods to assess its ability to bypass CAPTCHA systems. In experiments, DMTG reduces bot detection accuracy by 4.75%-9.73% compared to other models. Additionally, it mimics physical human behaviors, such as slow initiation and directional force differences, demonstrating improved performance in both simulation and real-world CAPTCHA scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory Optimization for Spatial Microstructure Control in Electron Beam Metal Additive Manufacturing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18207v1)** | 2024-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Metal additive manufacturing (AM) opens the possibility for spatial control of as-fabricated microstructure and properties. However, since the solid state diffusional transformations that drive microstructure outcomes are governed by nonlinear ODEs in terms of temperature, which is itself governed by PDEs over the entire part domain, solving for the system inputs needed to achieve desired microstructure distributions has proven difficult. In this work, we present a trajectory optimization approach for spatial control of microstructure in metal AM, which we demonstrate by controlling the hardness of a low-alloy steel in electron beam powder bed fusion (EB-PBF). To this end, we present models for thermal and microstructural dynamics. Next, we use experimental data to identify the parameters of the microstructure transformation dynamics. We then pose spatial microstructure control as a finite-horizon optimal control problem. The optimal power field trajectory is computed using an augmented Lagrangian differential dynamic programming (AL-DDP) method with GPU acceleration. The resulting time-varying power fields are then realized on an EB-PBF machine through an approximation scheme. Measurements of the resultant hardness shows that the optimized power field trajectory is able to closely produce the desired hardness distribution.</p></details> | 6 pages, 6 figures |

Our approach integrates a differentiable optimization layer into the neural network. By formulating the optimization layer as a trajectory optimization problem, we enable the model to end-to-end generate actions in a safe and constraint-controlled fashion without extra modules. Our method allows for the introduction of constraint information during the training process, thereby balancing the training objectives of satisfying constraints, smoothing the trajectories, and minimizing errors with demonstrations. This ``gray box" method marries optimization-based safety and interpretability with powerful representational abilities of neural networks. We quantitatively evaluate LeTO in simulation and in the real robot. The results demonstrate that LeTO performs well in both simulated and real-world tasks. In addition, it is capable of generating trajectories that are less uncertain, higher quality, and smoother compared to existing imitation learning methods. Therefore, it is shown that LeTO provides a practical example of how to achieve the integration of neural networks with trajectory optimization. We release our code at https://github.com/ZhengtongXu/LeTO.</p></details> |  |
| **[FreeVS: Generative View Synthesis on Free Driving Trajectory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18079v1)** | 2024-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing reconstruction-based novel view synthesis methods for driving scenes focus on synthesizing camera views along the recorded trajectory of the ego vehicle. Their image rendering performance will severely degrade on viewpoints falling out of the recorded trajectory, where camera rays are untrained. We propose FreeVS, a novel fully generative approach that can synthesize camera views on free new trajectories in real driving scenes. To control the generation results to be 3D consistent with the real scenes and accurate in viewpoint pose, we propose the pseudo-image representation of view priors to control the generation process. Viewpoint transformation simulation is applied on pseudo-images to simulate camera movement in each direction. Once trained, FreeVS can be applied to any validation sequences without reconstruction process and synthesis views on novel trajectories. Moreover, we propose two new challenging benchmarks tailored to driving scenes, which are novel camera synthesis and novel trajectory synthesis, emphasizing the freedom of viewpoints. Given that no ground truth images are available on novel trajectories, we also propose to evaluate the consistency of images synthesized on novel trajectories with 3D perception models. Experiments on the Waymo Open Dataset show that FreeVS has a strong image synthesis performance on both the recorded trajectories and novel trajectories.

| **[Enhancing Interaction Modeling with Agent Selection and Physical Coefficient for Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13152v3)** | 2024-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A thorough understanding of the interaction between the target agent and surrounding agents is a prerequisite for accurate trajectory prediction. Although many methods have been explored, they all assign correlation coefficients to surrounding agents in a purely learning-based manner. In this study, we present ASPILin, which manually selects interacting agents and calculates their correlations instead of attention scores. Surprisingly, these simple modifications can significantly improve prediction performance and substantially reduce computational costs. Additionally, ASPILin models the interacting agents at each past time step separately, rather than only modeling the interacting agents at the current time step. This clarifies the causal chain of the target agent's historical trajectory and helps the model better understand dynamic interactions. We intentionally simplified our model in other aspects, such as map encoding. Remarkably, experiments conducted on the INTERACTION, highD, and CitySim datasets demonstrate that our method is efficient and straightforward, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>code:...</summary><p>code:https://github.com/kkk00714/ASPILin</p></details> |

Traditional data-driven approaches often handle these tasks separately with specialized models. We introduce TranSPORTmer, a unified transformer-based framework capable of addressing all these tasks, showcasing its application to the intricate dynamics of multi-agent sports scenarios like soccer and basketball. Using Set Attention Blocks, TranSPORTmer effectively captures temporal dynamics and social interactions in an equivariant manner. The model's tasks are guided by an input mask that conceals missing or yet-to-be-predicted observations. Additionally, we introduce a CLS extra agent to classify states along soccer trajectories, including passes, possessions, uncontrolled states, and out-of-play intervals, contributing to an enhancement in modeling trajectories. Evaluations on soccer and basketball datasets show that TranSPORTmer outperforms state-of-the-art task-specific models in player forecasting, player forecasting-imputation, ball inference, and ball imputation. https://youtu.be/8VtSRm8oGoE</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACCV 2024</p></details> |
| **[Hierarchical Light Transformer Ensembles for Multimodal Trajectory Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17678v2)** | 2024-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate trajectory forecasting is crucial for the performance of various systems, such as advanced driver-assistance systems and self-driving vehicles. These forecasts allow to anticipate events leading to collisions and, therefore, to mitigate them. Deep Neural Networks have excelled in motion forecasting, but issues like overconfidence and uncertainty quantification persist. Deep Ensembles address these concerns, yet applying them to multimodal distributions remains challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel approach named Hierarchical Light Transformer Ensembles (HLT-Ens), aimed at efficiently training an ensemble of Transformer architectures using a novel hierarchical loss function. HLT-Ens leverages grouped fully connected layers, inspired by grouped convolution techniques, to capture multimodal distributions, effectively. Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate that HLT-Ens achieves state-of-the-art performance levels, offering a promising avenue for improving trajectory forecasting techniques.</p></details> | <details><summary>ackno...</summary><p>acknowledgement added</p></details> |

For example, we can swing a bat when walking without having to re-learn such a policy from scratch by composing the individual skills of walking and bat swinging. Enabling robots to combine or compose skills is essential so they can learn novel skills and tasks faster with fewer real world samples. To this end, we propose a novel compositional approach called DSE- Diffusion Score Equilibrium that enables few-shot learning for novel skills by utilizing a combination of base policy priors. Our method is based on probabilistically composing diffusion policies to better model the few-shot demonstration data-distribution than any individual policy. Our goal here is to learn robot motions few-shot and not necessarily goal oriented trajectories. Unfortunately we lack a general purpose metric to evaluate the error between a skill or motion and the provided demonstrations. Hence, we propose a probabilistic measure - Maximum Mean Discrepancy on the Forward Kinematics Kernel (MMD-FK), that is task and action space agnostic. By using our few-shot learning approach DSE, we show that we are able to achieve a reduction of over 30% in MMD-FK across skills and number of demonstrations. Moreover, we show the utility of our approach through real world experiments by teaching novel trajectories to a robot in 5 demonstrations.</p></details> | <details><summary>6(+1)...</summary><p>6(+1) pages, 6 figures</p></details> |

With recent advancements in differentiable rendering techniques, several methods have attempted to simultaneously optimize scene representations (NeRF or 3DGS) and camera poses. Despite recent progress, existing methods relying on traditional camera input tend to fail in high-speed (or equivalently low-frame-rate) scenarios. Event cameras, inspired by biological vision, record pixel-wise intensity changes asynchronously with high temporal resolution, providing valuable scene and motion information in blind inter-frame intervals. In this paper, we introduce the event camera to aid scene construction from a casually captured video for the first time, and propose Event-Aided Free-Trajectory 3DGS, called EF-3DGS, which seamlessly integrates the advantages of event cameras into 3DGS through three key components. First, we leverage the Event Generation Model (EGM) to fuse events and frames, supervising the rendered views observed by the event stream. Second, we adopt the Contrast Maximization (CMax) framework in a piece-wise manner to extract motion information by maximizing the contrast of the Image of Warped Events (IWE), thereby calibrating the estimated poses. Besides, based on the Linear Event Generation Model (LEGM), the brightness information encoded in the IWE is also utilized to constrain the 3DGS in the gradient domain. Third, to mitigate the absence of color information of events, we introduce photometric bundle adjustment (PBA) to ensure view consistency across events and frames. We evaluate our method on the public Tanks and Temples benchmark and a newly collected real-world dataset, RealEv-DAVIS.

However, due to localization errors/uncertainties, trajectory deconfliction can fail even if trajectories are perfectly shared between agents. To address this issue, we first present PARM and PARM*, perception-aware, decentralized, asynchronous multiagent trajectory planners that enable a team of agents to navigate uncertain environments while deconflicting trajectories and avoiding obstacles using perception information. PARM* differs from PARM as it is less conservative, using more computation to find closer-to-optimal solutions. While these methods achieve state-of-the-art performance, they suffer from high computational costs as they need to solve large optimization problems onboard, making it difficult for agents to replan at high rates. To overcome this challenge, we present our second key contribution, PRIMER, a learning-based planner trained with imitation learning (IL) using PARM* as the expert demonstrator. PRIMER leverages the low computational requirements at deployment of neural networks and achieves a computation speed up to 5500 times faster than optimization-based approaches.</p></details> | 7 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Cooperative Trajectory Planning: Principles for Human-Machine System Design on Trajectory Level](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16938v1)** | 2024-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper explores cooperative trajectory planning approaches within the context of human-machine shared control. In shared control research, it is typically assumed that the human and the automation use the same reference trajectory to stabilize the coupled system. However, this assumption is often incorrect, as they usually follow different trajectories, causing control conflicts at the action level that have not been widely researched. To address this, it is logical to extend shared control concepts to include human-machine interaction at the trajectory-level before action execution, resulting in a unified reference trajectory for both human and automation. This paper begins with a literature overview on approaches of cooperative trajectory planning. It then presents an approach of finding a joint trajectory by modelling cooperative trajectory planning as an agreement process. A generally valid system structure is proposed for this purpose. Finally, it proposes concepts to implement cooperative trajectory planning as an agreement process.</p></details> |  |

However, existing research often neglects the consideration of the joint reasoning of scenario agents and lacks interpretability in trajectory prediction models, thereby limiting their practical application in real-world scenarios. To this purpose, an explainability-oriented trajectory prediction model is designed in this work, named Explainable Conditional Diffusion based Multimodal Trajectory Prediction Traj-Explainer, to retrieve the influencing factors of prediction and help understand the intrinsic mechanism of prediction. In Traj-Explainer, a modified conditional diffusion is well designed to capture the scenario multimodal trajectory pattern, and meanwhile, a modified Shapley Value model is assembled to rationally learn the importance of the global and scenario features. Numerical experiments are carried out by several trajectory prediction datasets, including Waymo, NGSIM, HighD, and MoCAD datasets. Furthermore, we evaluate the identified input factors which indicates that they are in agreement with the human driving experience, indicating the capability of the proposed model in appropriately learning the prediction.

| **[Influential Language Data Selection via Gradient Trajectory Pursuit](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16710v1)** | 2024-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Curating a desirable dataset for training has been the core of building highly capable large language models (Touvron et al., 2023; Achiam et al., 2023; Team et al.,2024). Gradient influence scores (Pruthi et al., 2020; Xia et al., 2024) are shown to be correlated with model performance and are commonly used as the criterion for data selection. However, existing methods are built upon either individual sample rankings or inefficient matching process, leading to suboptimal performance or scaling up issues.In this paper, we propose Gradient Trajectory Pursuit (GTP), an algorithm that performs pursuit of gradient trajectories via jointly selecting data points under an L0-norm regularized objective. The proposed algorithm highlights: (1) joint selection instead of independent top-k selection, which automatically de-duplicates samples; (2) higher efficiency with compressive sampling processes, which can be further sped up using a distributed framework. In the experiments, we demonstrate the algorithm in both in-domain and target-domain selection benchmarks and show that it outperforms top-k selection and competitive algorithms consistently, for example, our algorithm chooses as low as 0.5% data to achieve full performance on the targeted instruction tuning tasks</p></details> |  |

Specifically, a pair of locations may not be lined up in a sequence especially when one location includes the other geographically. In this study, we propose a graph representation that retains information on the geographic hierarchy as well as the temporal order of visited locations, and have constructed a benchmark dataset for graph-structured trajectory extraction. The experiments with our baselines have demonstrated that it is possible to accurately predict visited locations and the order among them, but it remains a challenge to predict the hierarchical relations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Incorporating Navigation Context into Inland Vessel Trajectory Prediction: A Gaussian Mixture Model and Transformer Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02344v3)** | 2024-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Using data sources beyond the Automatic Identification System to represent the context a vessel is navigating in and consequently improve situation awareness is still rare in machine learning approaches to vessel trajectory prediction (VTP). In inland shipping, where vessel movement is constrained within fairways, navigational context information is indispensable. In this contribution targeting inland VTP, Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) are applied, on a fused dataset of AIS and discharge measurements, to generate multi-modal distribution curves, capturing typical lateral vessel positioning in the fairway and dislocation speeds along the waterway. By sampling the probability density curves of the GMMs, feature vectors are derived which are used, together with spatio-temporal vessel features and fairway geometries, as input to a VTP transformer model. The incorporation of these distribution features of both the current and forthcoming navigation context improves prediction accuracy. The superiority of the model over a previously proposed transformer model for inland VTP is shown. The novelty lies in the provision of preprocessed, statistics-based features representing the conditioned spatial context, rather than relying on the model to extract relevant features for the VTP task from contextual data. Oversimplification of the complexity of inland navigation patterns by assuming a single typical route or selecting specific clusters prior to model application is avoided by giving the model access to the entire distribution information. The methodology's generalizability is demonstrated through the usage of data of 3 distinct river sections. It can be integrated into an interaction-aware prediction framework, where insights into the positioning of the actual vessel behavior in the overall distribution at the current location and discharge can enhance trajectory prediction accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamic Time Warping-based imputation of long gaps in human mobility trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16096v1)** | 2024-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Individual mobility trajectories are difficult to measure and often incur long periods of missingness. Aggregation of this mobility data without accounting for the missingness leads to erroneous results, underestimating travel behavior. This paper proposes Dynamic Time Warping-Based Multiple Imputation (DTWBMI) as a method of filling long gaps in human mobility trajectories in order to use the available data to the fullest extent. This method reduces spatiotemporal trajectories to time series of particular travel behavior, then selects candidates for multiple imputation on the basis of the dynamic time warping distance between the potential donor series and the series preceding and following the gap in the recipient series and finally imputes values multiple times. A simulation study designed to establish optimal parameters for DTWBMI provides two versions of the method. These two methods are applied to a real-world dataset of individual mobility trajectories with simulated missingness and compared against other methods of handling missingness. Linear interpolation outperforms DTWBMI and other methods when gaps are short and data are limited. DTWBMI outperforms other methods when gaps become longer and when more data are available.</p></details> | 28 pages, 8 figures |

In practice, different driving scenarios present varying levels of difficulty for trajectory prediction models. However, most existing research focuses on the average precision of prediction results, while ignoring the underlying distribution of the input scenarios. This paper proposes a critical example mining method that utilizes a data-driven approach to estimate the rareness of the trajectories. By combining the rareness estimation of observations with whole trajectories, the proposed method effectively identifies a subset of data that is relatively hard to predict BEFORE feeding them to a specific prediction model. The experimental results show that the mined subset has higher prediction error when applied to different downstream prediction models, which reaches +108.1% error (greater than two times compared to the average on dataset) when mining 5% samples. Further analysis indicates that the mined critical examples include uncommon cases such as sudden brake and cancelled lane-change, which helps to better understand and improve the performance of prediction models.</p></details> | 8 pages,6 figures |

However, existing MARL approaches often rely on the restrictive assumption that the number of entities (e.g., agents, obstacles) remains constant between training and inference. This overlooks scenarios where entities are dynamically removed or added during the inference trajectory -- a common occurrence in real-world environments like search and rescue missions and dynamic combat situations. In this paper, we tackle the challenge of intra-trajectory dynamic entity composition under zero-shot out-of-domain (OOD) generalization, where such dynamic changes cannot be anticipated beforehand. Our empirical studies reveal that existing MARL methods suffer significant performance degradation and increased uncertainty in these scenarios. In response, we propose FlickerFusion, a novel OOD generalization method that acts as a universally applicable augmentation technique for MARL backbone methods. Our results show that FlickerFusion not only achieves superior inference rewards but also uniquely reduces uncertainty vis-\`a-vis the backbone, compared to existing methods. For standardized evaluation, we introduce MPEv2, an enhanced version of Multi Particle Environments (MPE), consisting of 12 benchmarks. Benchmarks, implementations, and trained models are organized and open-sourced at flickerfusion305.github.io, accompanied by ample demo video renderings.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS '24 Open-World Agents Workshop</p></details> |

However, current IRL works cannot learn incrementally from an ongoing trajectory because they have to wait to collect at least one complete trajectory to learn. To bridge the gap, this paper considers the problem of learning a reward function and a corresponding policy while observing the initial state-action pair of an ongoing trajectory and keeping updating the learned reward and policy when new state-action pairs of the ongoing trajectory are observed. We formulate this problem as an online bi-level optimization problem where the upper level dynamically adjusts the learned reward according to the newly observed state-action pairs with the help of a meta-regularization term, and the lower level learns the corresponding policy. We propose a novel algorithm to solve this problem and guarantee that the algorithm achieves sub-linear local regret $O(\sqrt{T}+\log T+\sqrt{T}\log T)$. If the reward function is linear, we prove that the proposed algorithm achieves sub-linear regret $O(\log T)$. Experiments are used to validate the proposed algorithm.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reinforced Imitative Trajectory Planning for Urban Automated Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15607v1)** | 2024-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) faces challenges in trajectory planning for urban automated driving due to the poor convergence of RL and the difficulty in designing reward functions. The convergence problem is alleviated by combining RL with supervised learning. However, most existing approaches only reason one step ahead and lack the capability to plan for multiple future steps. Besides, although inverse reinforcement learning holds promise for solving the reward function design issue, existing methods for automated driving impose a linear structure assumption on reward functions, making them difficult to apply to urban automated driving. In light of these challenges, this paper proposes a novel RL-based trajectory planning method that integrates RL with imitation learning to enable multi-step planning. Furthermore, a transformer-based Bayesian reward function is developed, providing effective reward signals for RL in urban scenarios. Moreover, a hybrid-driven trajectory planning framework is proposed to enhance safety and interpretability. The proposed methods were validated on the large-scale real-world urban automated driving nuPlan dataset. The results demonstrated the significant superiority of the proposed methods over the baselines in terms of the closed-loop metrics.

The key question in AL is which unlabeled data should be selected for annotation. Existing deep AL methods arguably suffer from bias incurred by clabeled data, which takes a much lower percentage than unlabeled data in AL context. We observe that such an issue is severe in different types of data, such as vision and non-vision data. To address this issue, we propose a novel method, namely Manifold-Preserving Trajectory Sampling (MPTS), aiming to enforce the feature space learned from labeled data to represent a more accurate manifold. By doing so, we expect to effectively correct the bias incurred by labeled data, which can cause a biased selection of unlabeled data. Despite its focus on manifold, the proposed method can be conveniently implemented by performing distribution mapping with MMD (Maximum Mean Discrepancies). Extensive experiments on various vision and non-vision benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method. Our source code can be found here.</p></details> |  |

Specifically, we present a novel Conditional RNN(CRNN) for diffusion models to efficiently generate trajectories. Furthermore, we propose an adaptive training method that ensures that the diffusion model generates more traversable trajectories. We evaluate our methods in various outdoor scenes and compare the performance with other global navigation algorithms on a Husky robot. In practice, we observe at least a 15% improvement in traveling distance and around a 7% improvement in traversability.</p></details> | 10 pages |

The trajectory design process also often involves carefully selecting various hyperparameters and requires a good initial guess which can further complicate the development process. This work introduces a generalized gait optimization framework that directly generates smooth and physically feasible trajectories. The proposed method demonstrates faster and more robust convergence than existing techniques and explicitly incorporates closed-loop kinematic constraints that appear in many modern humanoids.

Due to the fast and simple generation of DGA domains, detection methods must be highly efficient and precise to be effective. Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated their proficiency in real-time detection tasks, making them ideal candidates for detecting DGAs. Our work validates the effectiveness of fine-tuned LLMs for detecting DGAs and DNS exfiltration attacks. We developed LLM models and conducted comprehensive evaluation using a diverse dataset comprising 59 distinct real-world DGA malware families and normal domain data. Our LLM model significantly outperformed traditional natural language processing techniques, especially in detecting unknown DGAs. We also evaluated its performance on DNS exfiltration datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing cybersecurity measures. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that empirically applies LLMs for DGA and DNS exfiltration detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in Proceedings of the Workshop at AI for Cyber Threat Intelligence (WAITI), 2024</p></details> |
| **[Enhancing Reverse Engineering: Investigating and Benchmarking Large Language Models for Vulnerability Analysis in Decompiled Binaries](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04981v1)** | 2024-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Security experts reverse engineer (decompile) binary code to identify critical security vulnerabilities. The limited access to source code in vital systems - such as firmware, drivers, and proprietary software used in Critical Infrastructures (CI) - makes this analysis even more crucial on the binary level. Even with available source code, a semantic gap persists after compilation between the source and the binary code executed by the processor. This gap may hinder the detection of vulnerabilities in source code. That being said, current research on Large Language Models (LLMs) overlooks the significance of decompiled binaries in this area by focusing solely on source code. In this work, we are the first to empirically uncover the substantial semantic limitations of state-of-the-art LLMs when it comes to analyzing vulnerabilities in decompiled binaries, largely due to the absence of relevant datasets. To bridge the gap, we introduce DeBinVul, a novel decompiled binary code vulnerability dataset. Our dataset is multi-architecture and multi-optimization, focusing on C/C++ due to their wide usage in CI and association with numerous vulnerabilities. Specifically, we curate 150,872 samples of vulnerable and non-vulnerable decompiled binary code for the task of (i) identifying; (ii) classifying; (iii) describing vulnerabilities; and (iv) recovering function names in the domain of decompiled binaries. Subsequently, we fine-tune state-of-the-art LLMs using DeBinVul and report on a performance increase of 19%, 24%, and 21% in the capabilities of CodeLlama, Llama3, and CodeGen2 respectively, in detecting binary code vulnerabilities. Additionally, using DeBinVul, we report a high performance of 80-90% on the vulnerability classification task. Furthermore, we report improved performance in function name recovery and vulnerability description tasks.</p></details> |  |

Unlike existing methods that rely on draft models or specialized decoding heads, SuffixDecoding leverages suffix trees built from previously generated outputs to efficiently predict candidate token sequences. Our approach enables flexible tree-structured speculation without the overhead of maintaining and orchestrating additional models. SuffixDecoding builds and dynamically updates suffix trees to capture patterns in the generated text, using them to construct speculation trees through a principled scoring mechanism based on empirical token frequencies. SuffixDecoding requires only CPU memory which is plentiful and underutilized on typical LLM serving nodes. We demonstrate that SuffixDecoding achieves competitive speedups compared to model-based approaches across diverse workloads including open-domain chat, code generation, and text-to-SQL tasks. For open-ended chat and code generation tasks, SuffixDecoding achieves up to $1.4\times$ higher output throughput than SpecInfer and up to $1.1\times$ lower time-per-token (TPOT) latency. For a proprietary multi-LLM text-to-SQL application, SuffixDecoding achieves up to $2.9\times$ higher output throughput and $3\times$ lower latency than speculative decoding. Our evaluation shows that SuffixDecoding maintains high acceptance rates even with small reference corpora of 256 examples, while continuing to improve performance as more historical outputs are incorporated.</p></details> |  |

Yet, their intricate semantic nuances pose a longstanding challenge. Understanding verb relations through the concept of lexical entailment is crucial for comprehending sentence meanings and grasping verb dynamics. This work investigates the capabilities of eight Large Language Models in recognizing lexical entailment relations among verbs through differently devised prompting strategies and zero-/few-shot settings over verb pairs from two lexical databases, namely WordNet and HyperLex. Our findings unveil that the models can tackle the lexical entailment recognition task with moderately good performance, although at varying degree of effectiveness and under different conditions. Also, utilizing few-shot prompting can enhance the models' performance. However, perfectly solving the task arises as an unmet challenge for all examined LLMs, which raises an emergence for further research developments on this topic.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at The 2024 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP-2024) - Findings</p></details> |

Existing video-based Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) handle basic conversations but struggle with precise pixel-level grounding in videos. To address this, we introduce VideoGLaMM, a LMM designed for fine-grained pixel-level grounding in videos based on user-provided textual inputs. Our design seamlessly connects three key components: a Large Language Model, a dual vision encoder that emphasizes both spatial and temporal details, and a spatio-temporal decoder for accurate mask generation. This connection is facilitated via tunable V-L and L-V adapters that enable close Vision-Language (VL) alignment. The architecture is trained to synchronize both spatial and temporal elements of video content with textual instructions. To enable fine-grained grounding, we curate a multimodal dataset featuring detailed visually-grounded conversations using a semiautomatic annotation pipeline, resulting in a diverse set of 38k video-QA triplets along with 83k objects and 671k masks. We evaluate VideoGLaMM on three challenging tasks: Grounded Conversation Generation, Visual Grounding, and Referring Video Segmentation. Experimental results show that our model consistently outperforms existing approaches across all three tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Techn...</summary><p>Technical Report of VideoGLaMM</p></details> |

While these three have seen steady development, comprehensive KB construction at large has seen few fresh attempts. In this work, we propose to build a large general-domain KB entirely from a large language model (LLM). We demonstrate the feasibility of large-scale KB construction from LLMs, while highlighting specific challenges arising around entity recognition, entity and property canonicalization, and taxonomy construction. As a prototype, we use GPT-4o-mini to construct GPTKB, which contains 105 million triples for more than 2.9 million entities, at a cost 100x less than previous KBC projects. Our work is a landmark for two fields: For NLP, for the first time, it provides \textit{constructive} insights into the knowledge (or beliefs) of LLMs. For the Semantic Web, it shows novel ways forward for the long-standing challenge of general-domain KB construction. GPTKB is accessible at https://gptkb.org.</p></details> | 11 pages, 4 tables |

The scarcity is due to various challenges, including resource constraints, ethical considerations, and the competitive advantages of keeping models advanced. To address the gap, we introduce OpenCoder, a top-tier code LLM that not only achieves performance comparable to leading models but also serves as an ``open cookbook'' for the research community. Unlike most prior efforts, we release not only model weights and inference code, but also the reproducible training data, complete data processing pipeline, rigorous experimental ablation results, and detailed training protocols for open scientific research. Through this comprehensive release, we identify the key ingredients for building a top-tier code LLM: (1) code optimized heuristic rules for data cleaning and methods for data deduplication, (2) recall of text corpus related to code and (3) high-quality synthetic data in both annealing and supervised fine-tuning stages. By offering this level of openness, we aim to broaden access to all aspects of a top-tier code LLM, with OpenCoder serving as both a powerful model and an open foundation to accelerate research, and enable reproducible advancements in code AI.</p></details> |  |

However, their universal nature poses limitations in scenarios requiring personalized responses, such as recommendation systems and chatbots. This paper investigates methods to personalize LLMs, comparing fine-tuning and zero-shot reasoning approaches on subjective tasks. Results demonstrate that personalized fine-tuning improves model reasoning compared to non-personalized models. Experiments on datasets for emotion recognition and hate speech detection show consistent performance gains with personalized methods across different LLM architectures. These findings underscore the importance of personalization for enhancing LLM capabilities in subjective text perception tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to SENTIRE 2024 (ICDM Workshops): https://sentic.net/sentire2024wozniak.pdf</p></details> |

However, they sometimes generate responses that are logically coherent but factually incorrect or misleading, which is known as LLM hallucinations. Data-driven supervised methods train hallucination detectors by leveraging the internal states of LLMs, but detectors trained on specific domains often struggle to generalize well to other domains. In this paper, we aim to enhance the cross-domain performance of supervised detectors with only in-domain data. We propose a novel framework, prompt-guided internal states for hallucination detection of LLMs, namely PRISM. By utilizing appropriate prompts to guide changes in the structure related to text truthfulness within the LLM's internal states, we make this structure more salient and consistent across texts from different domains. We integrated our framework with existing hallucination detection methods and conducted experiments on datasets from different domains. The experimental results indicate that our framework significantly enhances the cross-domain generalization of existing hallucination detection methods.</p></details> |  |

To reduce harm and misuse, efforts have been made to align these LLMs to human values using advanced training techniques such as Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). However, recent studies have highlighted the vulnerability of LLMs to adversarial jailbreak attempts aiming at subverting the embedded safety guardrails. To address this challenge, this paper defines and investigates the Refusal Loss of LLMs and then proposes a method called Gradient Cuff to detect jailbreak attempts. Gradient Cuff exploits the unique properties observed in the refusal loss landscape, including functional values and its smoothness, to design an effective two-step detection strategy. Experimental results on two aligned LLMs (LLaMA-2-7B-Chat and Vicuna-7B-V1.5) and six types of jailbreak attacks (GCG, AutoDAN, PAIR, TAP, Base64, and LRL) show that Gradient Cuff can significantly improve the LLM's rejection capability for malicious jailbreak queries, while maintaining the model's performance for benign user queries by adjusting the detection threshold.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2024.

We consider a scenario in which a large group of follower agents (targets) must be confined within a designated goal region through indirect interactions with a controllable set of leader agents (herders). Our approach transforms the microscopic agent-based dynamics into a macroscopic continuum model via partial differential equations (PDEs). This formulation enables efficient, scalable control design for the herders' behavior, with guarantees of global convergence. Numerical and experimental validations in a mixed-reality swarm robotics framework demonstrate the method's effectiveness.</p></details> |  |

Large language models (LLMs), which underpin most contemporary question answering systems, struggle to induce how concepts relate in specialized domains such as medicine. Existing medical LLMs are also costly to train. In this work, we present MEG, a parameter-efficient approach for medical knowledge-augmented LLMs. MEG uses a lightweight mapping network to integrate graph embeddings into the LLM, enabling it to leverage external knowledge in a cost-effective way. We evaluate our method on four popular medical multiple-choice datasets and show that LLMs greatly benefit from the factual grounding provided by knowledge graph embeddings. MEG attains an average of +10.2% accuracy over the Mistral-Instruct baseline, and +6.7% over specialized models like BioMistral. We also show results based on Llama-3. Finally, we show that MEG's performance remains robust to the choice of graph encoder.</p></details> |  |

In particular, we consider the memory-less polynomial model for non-ideal hardware and derive analytical expressions for the signal to noise plus distortion ratio after applying maximum ratio combining (MRC) at the LIS. We also study the effect of back-off and automatic gain control on the RX-chains. The derived expressions enable us to evaluate the scalability of LIS when hardware impairments are present. We also study the cost of assuming ideal hardware by analyzing the minimum scaling required to achieve the same performance with a non-ideal hardware. Then, we exploit the analytical expressions to propose optimized antenna selection schemes for LIS and we show that such schemes can improve the performance significantly. In particular, the antenna selection schemes allow the LIS to have lower number of non-ideal RX-chains for signal reception while maintaining a good performance. We also consider a more practical case where the LIS is deployed as a grid of multi-antenna panels, and we propose panel selection schemes to optimize the complexity-performance trade-offs and improve the system overall efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |
| **[Reciprocal Point Learning Network with Large Electromagnetic Kernel for SAR Open-Set Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04693v1)** | 2024-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The limitations of existing Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Automatic Target Recognition (ATR) methods lie in their confinement by the closed-environment assumption, hindering their effective and robust handling of unknown target categories in open environments. Open Set Recognition (OSR), a pivotal facet for algorithmic practicality, intends to categorize known classes while denoting unknown ones as "unknown." The chief challenge in OSR involves concurrently mitigating risks associated with generalizing features from a restricted set of known classes to numerous unknown samples and the open space exposure to potential unknown data. To enhance open-set SAR classification, a method called scattering kernel with reciprocal learning network is proposed. Initially, a feature learning framework is constructed based on reciprocal point learning (RPL), establishing a bounded space for potential unknown classes. This approach indirectly introduces unknown information into a learner confined to known classes, thereby acquiring more concise and discriminative representations. Subsequently, considering the variability in the imaging of targets at different angles and the discreteness of components in SAR images, a proposal is made to design convolutional kernels based on large-sized attribute scattering center models. This enhances the ability to extract intrinsic non-linear features and specific scattering characteristics in SAR images, thereby improving the discriminative features of the model and mitigating the impact of imaging variations on classification performance. Experiments on the MSTAR datasets substantiate the superior performance of the proposed approach called ASC-RPL over mainstream methods.</p></details> |  |

Particularly in digital health, smartphones facilitate the tracking of health-related behaviors and contexts, contributing significantly to digital phenotyping, a process where data from digital interactions is analyzed to infer behaviors and assess mental health. Traditional methods process raw sensor data into information features for statistical and machine learning analyses. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach that systematically converts smartphone-collected data into structured, chronological narratives. The AWARE Narrator translates quantitative smartphone sensing data into English language descriptions, forming comprehensive narratives of an individual's activities. We apply the framework to the data collected from university students over a week, demonstrating the potential of utilizing the narratives to summarize individual behavior, and analyzing psychological states by leveraging large language models.</p></details> |  |

Its effectiveness depends highly on the speculation lookahead (SL)-the number of tokens generated by the draft model at each iteration. In this work we show that the common practice of using the same SL for all iterations (static SL) is suboptimal. We introduce DISCO (DynamIc SpeCulation lookahead Optimization), a novel method for dynamically selecting the SL. Our experiments with four datasets show that DISCO reaches an average speedup of 10% compared to the best static SL baseline, while generating the exact same text.</p></details> |  |

Creating interfaces for exploring and searching these collections is difficult, particularly in the absence of granular metadata. In this paper, we introduce a method for using state-of-the-art multimodal large language models (LLMs) to enable an open-ended, explainable search and discovery interface for visual collections. We show how our approach can create novel clustering and recommendation systems that avoid common pitfalls of methods based directly on visual embeddings. Of particular interest is the ability to offer concrete textual explanations of each recommendation without the need to preselect the features of interest. Together, these features can create a digital interface that is more open-ended and flexible while also being better suited to addressing privacy and ethical concerns. Through a case study using a collection of documentary photographs, we provide several metrics showing the efficacy and possibilities of our approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, CHR 2024: Computational Humanities Research Conference, December 4 - 6, 2024, Aarhus University, Denmark</p></details> |

Existing detection methods often depend on predefined patterns, limiting their adaptability across diverse LLM architectures. We propose GlitchMiner, a gradient-based discrete optimization framework that efficiently identifies glitch tokens by leveraging entropy to quantify prediction uncertainty and a local search strategy for exploring the token space.

In this paradigm, multiple passages are reranked in a listwise manner and a textual reranked permutation is generated. However, due to the limited context window of LLMs, this reranking paradigm requires a sliding window strategy to iteratively handle larger candidate sets. This not only increases computational costs but also restricts the LLM from fully capturing all the comparison information for all candidates. To address these challenges, we propose a novel self-calibrated listwise reranking method, which aims to leverage LLMs to produce global relevance scores for ranking. To achieve it, we first propose the relevance-aware listwise reranking framework, which incorporates explicit list-view relevance scores to improve reranking efficiency and enable global comparison across the entire candidate set. Second, to ensure the comparability of the computed scores, we propose self-calibrated training that uses point-view relevance assessments generated internally by the LLM itself to calibrate the list-view relevance assessments. Extensive experiments and comprehensive analysis on the BEIR benchmark and TREC Deep Learning Tracks demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed method.</p></details> |  |

However, using LLMs also introduces compliance risks relating to privacy, ethics, and regulations. This study investigated the compliance risks professionals perceive with LLM use and their risk mitigation strategies. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 24 law, healthcare, and academia professionals. Results showed that the main compliance concerns centered around potential exposure to sensitive customer/patient information through LLMs. To address risks, professionals reported proactively inputting distorted data to preserve privacy. However, full compliance proved challenging, given the complex interactions between user inputs, LLM behaviors, and regulations. This research provides valuable insights into designing LLMs with built-in privacy and risk controls to support professionals' evaluation and adoption of emerging AI technologies while meeting compliance obligations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Best Practices for Distilling Large Language Models into BERT for Web Search Ranking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04539v1)** | 2024-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies have highlighted the significant potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) as zero-shot relevance rankers. These methods predominantly utilize prompt learning to assess the relevance between queries and documents by generating a ranked list of potential documents. Despite their promise, the substantial costs associated with LLMs pose a significant challenge for their direct implementation in commercial search systems. To overcome this barrier and fully exploit the capabilities of LLMs for text ranking, we explore techniques to transfer the ranking expertise of LLMs to a more compact model similar to BERT, using a ranking loss to enable the deployment of less resource-intensive models. Specifically, we enhance the training of LLMs through Continued Pre-Training, taking the query as input and the clicked title and summary as output. We then proceed with supervised fine-tuning of the LLM using a rank loss, assigning the final token as a representative of the entire sentence. Given the inherent characteristics of autoregressive language models, only the final token </s> can encapsulate all preceding tokens. Additionally, we introduce a hybrid point-wise and margin MSE loss to transfer the ranking knowledge from LLMs to smaller models like BERT. This method creates a viable solution for environments with strict resource constraints. Both offline and online evaluations have confirmed the efficacy of our approach, and our model has been successfully integrated into a commercial web search engine as of February 2024.</p></details> | Arxiv Version |

In existing frameworks, LLMs learn tool use either by in-context demonstrations or via full model fine-tuning on annotated data. As these approaches do not easily scale, a recent trend is to abandon them in favor of lightweight, parameter-efficient tuning paradigms. These methods allow quickly alternating between the frozen LLM and its specialised fine-tuned version, by switching on or off a handful of additional custom parameters. Hence, we postulate that the generalization ability of the frozen model can be leveraged to improve tool selection. We present Tool selECTion via meta-reasONing (TECTON), a two-phase system that first reasons over a task using a custom fine-tuned LM head and outputs candidate tools. Then, with the custom head disabled, it meta-reasons (i.e., it reasons over the previous reasoning process) to make a final choice. We show that TECTON results in substantial gains - both in-distribution and out-of-distribution - on a range of math reasoning datasets.</p></details> |  |

Numerous benchmarks have been proposed to evaluate the ability of LLMs for scientific research. However, current benchmarks are mostly based on pre-collected objective questions. This design suffers from data leakage problem and lacks the evaluation of subjective Q/A ability. In this paper, we propose SciEval, a comprehensive and multi-disciplinary evaluation benchmark to address these issues. Based on Bloom's taxonomy, SciEval covers four dimensions to systematically evaluate scientific research ability. In particular, we design a "dynamic" subset based on scientific principles to prevent evaluation from potential data leakage. Both objective and subjective questions are included in SciEval. These characteristics make SciEval a more effective benchmark for scientific research ability evaluation of LLMs. Comprehensive experiments on most advanced LLMs show that, although GPT-4 achieves SOTA performance compared to other LLMs, there is still substantial room for improvement, especially for dynamic questions.

For large language model (LLM)-based conversational agents, planning appropriate conversational skills, as humans do, is challenging due to the complexity of social dialogue, especially in interactive scenarios. To address this, we propose a skill-of-mind-annotated conversation dataset, named Multifaceted Skill-of-Mind, which includes multi-turn and multifaceted conversational skills across various interactive scenarios (e.g., long-term, counseling, task-oriented), grounded in diverse social contexts (e.g., demographics, persona, rules of thumb). This dataset consists of roughly 100K conversations. Using this dataset, we introduce a new family of skill-of-mind-infused LLMs, named Thanos, with model sizes of 1B, 3B, and 8B parameters. With extensive experiments, these models successfully demonstrate the skill-of-mind process and exhibit strong generalizability in inferring multifaceted skills across a variety of domains. Moreover, we show that Thanos significantly enhances the quality of responses generated by LLM-based conversational agents and promotes prosocial behavior in human evaluations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/passing2961/Thanos</p></details> |

However, most LLMs only focus on general science, while they lack domain-specific knowledge, such as chemical molecules and amino acid sequences. To bridge these gaps, we introduce SciDFM, a mixture-of-experts LLM, which is trained from scratch and is able to conduct college-level scientific reasoning and understand molecules and amino acid sequences. We collect a large-scale training corpus containing numerous scientific papers and books from different disciplines as well as data from domain-specific databases. We further fine-tune the pre-trained model on lots of instruction data to improve performances on downstream benchmarks. From experiment results, we show that SciDFM achieves strong performance on general scientific benchmarks such as SciEval and SciQ, and it reaches a SOTA performance on domain-specific benchmarks among models of similar size. We further analyze the expert layers and show that the results of expert selection vary with data from different disciplines. To benefit the broader research community, we open-source SciDFM at https://huggingface.co/OpenDFM/SciDFM-MoE-A5.6B-v1.0.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 1 figure, 9 tables.

However, the set size of a PCSS is upper bounded by the number of row sequences of each two-dimensional matrix in PCSS. Then quasi-complementary sequence set (QCSS) was proposed to support more users in MC-CDMA communications. For practical applications, it is desirable to construct an $(M,K,N,\vartheta_{max})$-QCSS with $M$ as large as possible and $\vartheta_{max}$ as small as possible, where $M$ is the number of matrices with $K$ rows and $N$ columns in the set and $\vartheta_{max}$ denotes its periodic tolerance. There exists a tradoff among these parameters and constructing QCSSs achieving or nearly achieving the known correlation lower bound has been an interesting research topic. Up to now, only a few constructions of asymptotically optimal or near-optimal periodic QCSSs were reported in the literature. In this paper, we construct five families of asymptotically optimal or near-optimal periodic QCSSs with large set sizes and low periodic tolerances. These families of QCSSs have set size $\Theta(q^2)$ or $\Theta(q^3)$ and flock size $\Theta(q)$, where $q$ is a power of a prime. To the best of our knowledge, only three known families of periodic QCSSs with set size $\Theta(q^2)$ and flock size $\Theta(q)$ were constructed and all other known periodic QCSSs have set sizes much smaller than $\Theta(q^2)$. Our new constructed periodic QCSSs with set size $\Theta(q^2)$ and flock size $\Theta(q)$ have better parameters than known ones. They have larger set sizes or lower periodic tolerances.The periodic QCSSs with set size $\Theta(q^3)$ and flock size $\Theta(q)$ constructed in this paper have the largest set size among all known families of asymptotically optimal or near-optimal periodic QCSSs.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we introduce a new implementation of a reduced-rank approach to fit large dimensional multivariate random effects by writing them as a linear combination of $d < q$ latent variables. By adding reduced-rank functionality to the package glmmTMB, we enhance the mixed models available to include random effects of dimensions that were previously not possible. We apply the reduced-rank random effect to two examples, estimating a generalized latent variable model for multivariate abundance data and a random-slopes model.</p></details> |  |
| **[TableGPT2: A Large Multimodal Model with Tabular Data Integration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02059v3)** | 2024-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The emergence of models like GPTs, Claude, LLaMA, and Qwen has reshaped AI applications, presenting vast new opportunities across industries. Yet, the integration of tabular data remains notably underdeveloped, despite its foundational role in numerous real-world domains. This gap is critical for three main reasons. First, database or data warehouse data integration is essential for advanced applications; second, the vast and largely untapped resource of tabular data offers immense potential for analysis; and third, the business intelligence domain specifically demands adaptable, precise solutions that many current LLMs may struggle to provide. In response, we introduce TableGPT2, a model rigorously pre-trained and fine-tuned with over 593.8K tables and 2.36M high-quality query-table-output tuples, a scale of table-related data unprecedented in prior research. This extensive training enables TableGPT2 to excel in table-centric tasks while maintaining strong general language and coding abilities. One of TableGPT2's key innovations is its novel table encoder, specifically designed to capture schema-level and cell-level information. This encoder strengthens the model's ability to handle ambiguous queries, missing column names, and irregular tables commonly encountered in real-world applications. Similar to visual language models, this pioneering approach integrates with the decoder to form a robust large multimodal model. We believe the results are compelling: over 23 benchmarking metrics, TableGPT2 achieves an average performance improvement of 35.20% in the 7B model and 49.32% in the 72B model over prior benchmark-neutral LLMs, with robust general-purpose capabilities intact.</p></details> |  |

Text-to-SQL (Text2SQL) solves the issues by utilizing natural language processing (NLP) techniques to convert natural language into SQL queries. With the development of Large Language Models (LLMs), a range of LLM-based Text2SQL methods have emerged. This survey provides a comprehensive review of LLMs in Text2SQL tasks. We review benchmark datasets, prompt engineering methods, fine-tuning methods, and base models in LLM-based Text2SQL methods. We provide insights in each part and discuss future directions in this field.</p></details> |  |
| **[FactTest: Factuality Testing in Large Language Models with Finite-Sample and Distribution-Free Guarantees](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02603v3)** | 2024-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The propensity of Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate hallucinations and non-factual content undermines their reliability in high-stakes domains, where rigorous control over Type I errors (the conditional probability of incorrectly classifying hallucinations as truthful content) is essential. Despite its importance, formal verification of LLM factuality with such guarantees remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce FactTest, a novel framework that statistically assesses whether a LLM can confidently provide correct answers to given questions with high-probability correctness guarantees. We formulate factuality testing as hypothesis testing problem to enforce an upper bound of Type I errors at user-specified significance levels. Notably, we prove that our framework also ensures strong Type II error control under mild conditions and can be extended to maintain its effectiveness when covariate shifts exist. Our approach is distribution-free and works for any number of human-annotated samples. It is model-agnostic and applies to any black-box or white-box LM. Extensive experiments on question-answering (QA) and multiple-choice benchmarks demonstrate that FactTest effectively detects hallucinations and improves the model's ability to abstain from answering unknown questions, leading to an over 40% accuracy improvement.</p></details> |  |
| **[Linguistic Collapse: Neural Collapse in (Large) Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17767v2)** | 2024-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural collapse ($\mathcal{NC}$) is a phenomenon observed in classification tasks where top-layer representations collapse into their class means, which become equinorm, equiangular and aligned with the classifiers. These behaviors -- associated with generalization and robustness -- would manifest under specific conditions: models are trained towards zero loss, with noise-free labels belonging to balanced classes, which do not outnumber the model's hidden dimension. Recent studies have explored $\mathcal{NC}$ in the absence of one or more of these conditions to extend and capitalize on the associated benefits of ideal geometries. Language modeling presents a curious frontier, as \textit{training by token prediction} constitutes a classification task where none of the conditions exist: the vocabulary is imbalanced and exceeds the embedding dimension; different tokens might correspond to similar contextual embeddings; and large language models (LLMs) in particular are typically only trained for a few epochs. This paper empirically investigates the impact of scaling the architectures and training of causal language models (CLMs) on their progression towards $\mathcal{NC}$. We find that $\mathcal{NC}$ properties that develop with scale (and regularization) are linked to generalization. Moreover, there is evidence of some relationship between $\mathcal{NC}$ and generalization independent of scale. Our work thereby underscores the generality of $\mathcal{NC}$ as it extends to the novel and more challenging setting of language modeling. Downstream, we seek to inspire further research on the phenomenon to deepen our understanding of LLMs -- and neural networks at large -- and improve existing architectures based on $\mathcal{NC}$-related properties.

| **[Long-form factuality in large language models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18802v4)** | 2024-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) often generate content that contains factual errors when responding to fact-seeking prompts on open-ended topics. To benchmark a model's long-form factuality in open domains, we first use GPT-4 to generate LongFact, a prompt set comprising thousands of questions spanning 38 topics. We then propose that LLM agents can be used as automated evaluators for long-form factuality through a method which we call Search-Augmented Factuality Evaluator (SAFE). SAFE utilizes an LLM to break down a long-form response into a set of individual facts and to evaluate the accuracy of each fact using a multi-step reasoning process comprising sending search queries to Google Search and determining whether a fact is supported by the search results. Furthermore, we propose extending F1 score as an aggregated metric for long-form factuality. To do so, we balance the percentage of supported facts in a response (precision) with the percentage of provided facts relative to a hyperparameter representing a user's preferred response length (recall). Empirically, we demonstrate that LLM agents can outperform crowdsourced human annotators - on a set of ~16k individual facts, SAFE agrees with crowdsourced human annotators 72% of the time, and on a random subset of 100 disagreement cases, SAFE wins 76% of the time. At the same time, SAFE is more than 20 times cheaper than human annotators. We also benchmark thirteen language models on LongFact across four model families (Gemini, GPT, Claude, and PaLM-2), finding that larger language models generally achieve better long-form factuality. LongFact, SAFE, and all experimental code are available at https://github.com/google-deepmind/long-form-factuality.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2024; 72 pages, 18 figures, 30 tables.

These APIs however are regularly updated to incorporate new features while the old APIs get deprecated. Even though the importance of updating deprecated API usages with the recommended replacement APIs has been widely recognized, it is non-trivial to update the deprecated API usages. Therefore, the usages of deprecated APIs linger in Android apps and cause compatibility issues in practice. This paper introduces GUPPY, an automated approach that utilizes large language models (LLMs) to update Android deprecated API usages. By employing carefully crafted prompts, GUPPY leverages GPT-4, one of the most powerful LLMs, to update deprecated-API usages, ensuring compatibility in both the old and new API levels. Additionally, GUPPY uses GPT-4 to generate tests, identify incorrect updates, and refine the API usage through an iterative process until the tests pass or a specified limit is reached. Our evaluation, conducted on 360 benchmark API usages from 20 deprecated APIs and an additional 156 deprecated API usages from the latest API levels 33 and 34, demonstrates GUPPY's advantages over the state-of-the-art techniques.</p></details> |  |

Traditional approaches often tackle each task separately by its own network, which leads to excessive costs for developing and scaling models, especially in the context of large language models. Although multi-task methods can save costs through parameter sharing, they often struggle to outperform single-task methods in real-world applications. To tackle these challenges, we present a three-stage multi-task learning framework for large language models. It involves task filtering, followed by fine-tuning on high-resource tasks, and finally fine-tuning on all tasks. We conducted comprehensive experiments in single-task and multi-task settings. Our approach, exemplified on different benchmarks, demonstrates that it is able to achieve performance comparable to the single-task method while reducing up to 90.9\% of its overhead.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by COLING 2025 Industry Track</p></details> |

The benchmark is designed to evaluate both the correctness of the generated code and its computational efficiency. Our benchmark reveals that the o1 series of models outperform other frontier models from OpenAI, Anthropic, Meta, and Google in accuracy and cheating rates across both easy and hard integer sequences. In order to ensure models do not exploit memorized sequence values, we introduce an automated cheating detection mechanism that flags the use of lookup tables and validated this automation against human cheating evaluations. This benchmark provides a meaningful challenge for current LLMs, offering insights into their mathematical reasoning and code writing capabilities, which can guide future research directions and model development in mathematical reasoning and code synthesis.</p></details> |  |
| **[CodeTree: Agent-guided Tree Search for Code Generation with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04329v1)** | 2024-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pre-trained on massive amounts of code and text data, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable achievements in performing code generation tasks. With additional execution-based feedback, these models can act as agents with capabilities to self-refine and improve generated code autonomously. However, on challenging coding tasks with extremely large search space, current agentic approaches still struggle with multi-stage planning, generating, and debugging. To address this problem, we propose CodeTree, a framework for LLM agents to efficiently explore the search space in different stages of the code generation process. Specifically, we adopted a unified tree structure to explicitly explore different coding strategies, generate corresponding coding solutions, and subsequently refine the solutions. In each stage, critical decision-making (ranking, termination, expanding) of the exploration process is guided by both the environmental execution-based feedback and LLM-agent-generated feedback. We comprehensively evaluated CodeTree on 7 code generation benchmarks and demonstrated the significant performance gains of CodeTree against strong baselines. Using GPT-4o as the base model, we consistently achieved top results of 95.1 on HumanEval, 98.7 on MBPP, and 43.0 on CodeContests. On the challenging SWEBench benchmark, our approach led to significant performance gains.</p></details> |  |
| **[Gradient Boosting Trees and Large Language Models for Tabular Data Few-Shot Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04324v1)** | 2024-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLM) have brought numerous of new applications to Machine Learning (ML). In the context of tabular data (TD), recent studies show that TabLLM is a very powerful mechanism for few-shot-learning (FSL) applications, even if gradient boosting decisions trees (GBDT) have historically dominated the TD field. In this work we demonstrate that although LLMs are a viable alternative, the evidence suggests that baselines used to gauge performance can be improved. We replicated public benchmarks and our methodology improves LightGBM by 290%, this is mainly driven by forcing node splitting with few samples, a critical step in FSL with GBDT. Our results show an advantage to TabLLM for 8 or fewer shots, but as the number of samples increases GBDT provides competitive performance at a fraction of runtime. For other real-life applications with vast number of samples, we found FSL still useful to improve model diversity, and when combined with ExtraTrees it provides strong resilience to overfitting, our proposal was validated in a ML competition setting ranking first place.</p></details> | <details><summary>FedCS...</summary><p>FedCSIS 2024 - Data Mining Competition - 1st Place Winner</p></details> |

This study seeks to address these challenges by developing a multilingual lexicon designed for French and Tshiluba, now expanded to include translations in English, Afrikaans, Sepedi, and Zulu. The lexicon enhances cultural relevance in sentiment classification by integrating language-specific sentiment scores. A comprehensive testing corpus is created to support translation and sentiment analysis tasks, with machine learning models such as Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Trees, and Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB) trained to predict sentiment across low resource languages (LRLs). Among them, the Random Forest model performed particularly well, capturing sentiment polarity and handling language-specific nuances effectively. Furthermore, Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), a Large Language Model (LLM), is applied to predict context-based sentiment with high accuracy, achieving 99% accuracy and 98% precision, outperforming other models. The BERT predictions were clarified using Explainable AI (XAI), improving transparency and fostering confidence in sentiment classification. Overall, findings demonstrate that the proposed lexicon and machine learning models significantly enhance translation and sentiment analysis for LRLs in South Africa and the DRC, laying a foundation for future AI models that support underrepresented languages, with applications across education, governance, and business in multilingual contexts.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work is part of a PhD proposal in Information Technology at the University of Pretoria, supervised by Dr. Mike Wa Nkongolo and co-supervised by Dr. Phil van Deventer, under the Low-Resource Language Processing Lab in the Department of Informatics</p></details> |

While large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated the ability to generate high-quality stories, their creative capabilities remain underexplored. Previous research has either focused on creativity tests requiring short responses or primarily compared model performance in story generation to that of professional writers. However, the question of whether LLMs exhibit creativity in writing short stories on par with the average human remains unanswered. In this work, we conduct a systematic analysis of creativity in short story generation across LLMs and everyday people. Using a five-sentence creative story task, commonly employed in psychology to assess human creativity, we automatically evaluate model- and human-generated stories across several dimensions of creativity, including novelty, surprise, and diversity. Our findings reveal that while LLMs can generate stylistically complex stories, they tend to fall short in terms of creativity when compared to average human writers.</p></details> | 14 pages |

We posit that we can extend our understanding of LLMs' ToM abilities by evaluating key human ToM precursors$-$perception inference and perception-to-belief inference$-$in LLMs. We introduce two datasets, Percept-ToMi and Percept-FANToM, to evaluate these precursory inferences for ToM in LLMs by annotating characters' perceptions on ToMi and FANToM, respectively. Our evaluation of eight state-of-the-art LLMs reveals that the models generally perform well in perception inference while exhibiting limited capability in perception-to-belief inference (e.g., lack of inhibitory control). Based on these results, we present PercepToM, a novel ToM method leveraging LLMs' strong perception inference capability while supplementing their limited perception-to-belief inference. Experimental results demonstrate that PercepToM significantly enhances LLM's performance, especially in false belief scenarios.</p></details> |  |

In practice, interpreting these differential diagnoses yields significant value but remains under-explored. Given the powerful capabilities of large language models (LLMs), we investigated using LLMs for interpretable DDx. Specifically, we curated the first DDx dataset with expert-derived interpretation on 570 clinical notes. Besides, we proposed Dual-Inf, a novel framework that enabled LLMs to conduct bidirectional inference (i.e., from symptoms to diagnoses and vice versa) for DDx interpretation. Both human and automated evaluation validated its efficacy in predicting and elucidating differentials across four base LLMs. In addition, Dual-Inf could reduce interpretation errors and hold promise for rare disease explanations. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first work that customizes LLMs for DDx explanation and comprehensively evaluates their interpretation performance. Overall, our study bridges a critical gap in DDx interpretation and enhances clinical decision-making.</p></details> | 16 pages |

Today, the maps that power these services are predominantly controlled by a few large corporations and mostly cover outdoor spaces. As the use of these applications expands and indoor localization technologies advance, we are seeing the need for a scalable, federated location management system that can extend into private spaces. We introduce OpenFLAME (Open Federated Localization and Mapping Engine), the first federated and decentralized localization service. OpenFLAME links servers that handle localization for specific regions, providing applications with a seamless global view. Creating a federated localization system poses challenges, such as discovering the appropriate servers for a region and integrating services managed by independent providers. To address these issues and ensure scalability, we leverage Domain Name System (DNS) for service discovery and implement map abstractions to retrieve and merge locations across different maps. Our trace-driven study demonstrates that federated localization across remote servers is feasible with acceptable query latencies. To highlight the potential of the system, we developed an augmented reality navigation application for a large indoor space, showing that OpenFLAME can successfully power location-based applications.</p></details> |  |

This revelation exposes a critical flaw in current LLM safety training, suggesting that existing methods may merely mask vulnerabilities rather than eliminate them.

These works typically claim that such domain-adaptive pretraining (DAPT) improves performance on downstream medical tasks, such as answering medical licensing exam questions. In this paper, we compare seven public "medical" LLMs and two VLMs against their corresponding base models, arriving at a different conclusion: all medical VLMs and nearly all medical LLMs fail to consistently improve over their base models in the zero-/few-shot prompting regime for medical question-answering (QA) tasks. For instance, across the tasks and model pairs we consider in the 3-shot setting, medical LLMs only outperform their base models in 12.1% of cases, reach a (statistical) tie in 49.8% of cases, and are significantly worse than their base models in the remaining 38.2% of cases. Our conclusions are based on (i) comparing each medical model head-to-head, directly against the corresponding base model; (ii) optimizing the prompts for each model separately; and (iii) accounting for statistical uncertainty in comparisons. While these basic practices are not consistently adopted in the literature, our ablations show that they substantially impact conclusions. Our findings suggest that state-of-the-art general-domain models may already exhibit strong medical knowledge and reasoning capabilities, and offer recommendations to strengthen the conclusions of future studies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EMNLP 2024 Main Conference as Long Paper (Oral)</p></details> |

[...] Lyra's eyes welled up with tears as she realized the bitter truth - she had sacrificed everything for fleeting riches, and lost the love of her crew, her family, and herself." Although this story, generated by a large language model, is captivating, one may wonder -- how would the story have unfolded if the model had chosen "Captain Maeve" as the protagonist instead? We cannot know. State-of-the-art large language models are stateless -- they maintain no internal memory or state. Given a prompt, they generate a sequence of tokens as an output using an autoregressive process. As a consequence, they cannot reason about counterfactual alternatives to tokens they have generated in the past. In this work, our goal is to enhance them with this functionality. To this end, we develop a causal model of token generation that builds upon the Gumbel-Max structural causal model. Our model allows any large language model to perform counterfactual token generation at almost no cost in comparison with vanilla token generation, it is embarrassingly simple to implement, and it does not require any fine-tuning nor prompt engineering. We implement our model on Llama 3 8B-Instruct and Ministral-8B-Instruct and conduct a qualitative and a quantitative analysis of counterfactually generated text. We conclude with a demonstrative application of counterfactual token generation for bias detection, unveiling interesting insights about the model of the world constructed by large language models.</p></details> |  |

Existing evaluations rely on deterministic point estimates generated via greedy decoding. However, we find that deterministic evaluations fail to capture the whole output distribution of a model, yielding inaccurate estimations of model capabilities. This is particularly problematic in critical contexts such as unlearning and alignment, where precise model evaluations are crucial. To remedy this, we introduce the first formal probabilistic evaluation framework in LLMs. Namely, we derive novel metrics with high-probability guarantees concerning the output distribution of a model. Our metrics are application-independent and allow practitioners to make more reliable estimates about model capabilities before deployment. Through a case study focused on unlearning, we reveal that deterministic evaluations falsely indicate successful unlearning, whereas our probabilistic evaluations demonstrate that most if not all of the supposedly unlearned information remains accessible in these models. Additionally, we propose a novel unlearning loss based on entropy optimization and adaptive temperature scaling, which significantly improves unlearning in probabilistic settings on recent benchmarks. Our proposed shift from point estimates to probabilistic evaluations of output distributions represents an important step toward comprehensive evaluations of LLMs. Code available at https://github.com/yascho/probabilistic-unlearning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Navigating Extremes: Dynamic Sparsity in Large Output Space](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03171v2)** | 2024-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, Dynamic Sparse Training (DST) has emerged as an alternative to post-training pruning for generating efficient models. In principle, DST allows for a more memory efficient training process, as it maintains sparsity throughout the entire training run. However, current DST implementations fail to capitalize on this in practice. Because sparse matrix multiplication is much less efficient than dense matrix multiplication on GPUs, most implementations simulate sparsity by masking weights. In this paper, we leverage recent advances in semi-structured sparse training to apply DST in the domain of classification with large output spaces, where memory-efficiency is paramount. With a label space of possibly millions of candidates, the classification layer alone will consume several gigabytes of memory. Switching from a dense to a fixed fan-in sparse layer updated with sparse evolutionary training (SET); however, severely hampers training convergence, especially at the largest label spaces. We find that poor gradient flow from the sparse classifier to the dense text encoder make it difficult to learn good input representations. By employing an intermediate layer or adding an auxiliary training objective, we recover most of the generalisation performance of the dense model. Overall, we demonstrate the applicability and practical benefits of DST in a challenging domain -- characterized by a highly skewed label distribution that differs substantially from typical DST benchmark datasets -- which enables end-to-end training with millions of labels on commodity hardware.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 7 figures, NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |

Different from previous efforts, we are dedicated to exploring the dynamic expert path in an already exist MLLM and show that a standard MLLM can be also a mixture of experts. To approach this target, we propose a novel dynamic expert scheme for MLLMs, termed Routing Experts (RoE), which can achieve example-dependent optimal path routing without obvious structure tweaks. Meanwhile, a new regularization of structure sparsity is also introduced to enforce MLLMs to learn more short-cut inference, ensuring the efficiency. In addition, we also realize the first attempt of aligning the training and inference schemes of MLLMs in terms of network routing. To validate RoE, we apply it to a set of latest MLLMs, including LLaVA-1.5, LLaVA-HR and VILA, and conduct extensive experiments on a bunch of VL benchmarks. The experiment results not only show the great advantages of our RoE in improving MLLMs' efficiency, but also yield obvious advantages than MoE-LLaVA in both performance and speed, e.g., an average performance gain of 3.3% on 5 benchmarks while being faster.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving Causal Reasoning in Large Language Models: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16676v3)** | 2024-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Causal reasoning (CR) is a crucial aspect of intelligence, essential for problem-solving, decision-making, and understanding the world. While large language models (LLMs) can generate rationales for their outputs, their ability to reliably perform causal reasoning remains uncertain, often falling short in tasks requiring a deep understanding of causality. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of research aimed at enhancing LLMs for causal reasoning. We categorize existing methods based on the role of LLMs: either as reasoning engines or as helpers providing knowledge or data to traditional CR methods, followed by a detailed discussion of the methodologies in each category. We then evaluate the performance of LLMs on various causal reasoning tasks, providing key findings and in-depth analysis. Finally, we provide insights from current studies and highlight promising directions for future research. We aim for this work to serve as a comprehensive resource, fostering further advancements in causal reasoning with LLMs. Resources are available at https://github.com/chendl02/Awesome-LLM-causal-reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hotfixing Large Language Models for Code](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05727v4)** | 2024-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models for Code (LLM4Code) have become an integral part of developers' workflows, assisting with tasks such as code completion and generation. However, these models are found to exhibit undesired behaviors after their release, like generating buggy code, due to their extensive training on vast amounts of source code that contain such buggy code. The training data (usually coming from open-source software) keeps evolving, e.g., developers fix the buggy code. However, adapting such evolution to mitigate LLM4Code's undesired behaviors is non-trivial, as retraining models on the updated dataset usually takes much time and resources. This motivates us to propose the concept of hotfixing LLM4Code, mitigating LLM4Code's undesired behaviors effectively and efficiently with minimal negative effects. This paper mainly focuses on hotfixing LLM4Code to make them generate less buggy code and more fixed code. We begin by demonstrating that models from the popular CodeGen family frequently generate buggy code. Then, we define three learning objectives in hotfixing and design multiple loss functions for each objective: (1) learn the desired behaviors, (2) unlearn the undesired behaviors, and (3) retain knowledge of other code. We evaluate four different fine-tuning techniques for hotfixing the models and gain the following insights. Optimizing these three learning goals together, using LoRA (low-rank adaptation), effectively influences the model's behavior. Specifically, it increases the generation of fixed code by up to 108.42% and decreases the generation of buggy code by up to 50.47%. Statistical tests confirm that hotfixing does not significantly affect the models' functional correctness on the HumanEval benchmark. Additionally, to evaluate the generalizability of hotfixing by reducing the exposure of email addresses by 99.30%.</p></details> | <details><summary>Add a...</summary><p>Add a case study on mitigting potential privacy leakage</p></details> |

However, their linguistic generalization capabilities remain questionable, raising doubts about whether these models learn language similarly to humans. While humans exhibit compositional generalization and linguistic creativity in language use, the extent to which LLMs replicate these abilities, particularly in morphology, is under-explored. In this work, we systematically investigate the morphological generalization abilities of LLMs through the lens of compositionality. We define morphemes as compositional primitives and design a novel suite of generative and discriminative tasks to assess morphological productivity and systematicity. Focusing on agglutinative languages such as Turkish and Finnish, we evaluate several state-of-the-art instruction-finetuned multilingual models, including GPT-4 and Gemini. Our analysis shows that LLMs struggle with morphological compositional generalization particularly when applied to novel word roots, with performance declining sharply as morphological complexity increases. While models can identify individual morphological combinations better than chance, their performance lacks systematicity, leading to significant accuracy gaps compared to humans.</p></details> | 33 pages |
| **[Interactions Across Blocks in Post-Training Quantization of Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03934v1)** | 2024-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Post-training quantization is widely employed to reduce the computational demands of neural networks. Typically, individual substructures, such as layers or blocks of layers, are quantized with the objective of minimizing quantization errors in their pre-activations by fine-tuning the corresponding weights. Deriving this local objective from the global objective of minimizing task loss involves two key simplifications: assuming substructures are mutually independent and ignoring the knowledge of subsequent substructures as well as the task loss. In this work, we assess the effects of these simplifications on weight-only quantization of large language models. We introduce two multi-block fine-tuning strategies and compare them against the baseline of fine-tuning single transformer blocks. The first captures correlations of weights across blocks by jointly optimizing multiple quantized blocks. The second incorporates knowledge of subsequent blocks by minimizing the error in downstream pre-activations rather than focusing solely on the quantized block. Our findings indicate that the effectiveness of these methods depends on the specific network model, with no impact on some models but demonstrating significant benefits for others.</p></details> |  |

While recent advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) like GPT-4o have shown promise in high-level ChartQA tasks, such as chart captioning, their effectiveness in low-level ChartQA tasks (e.g., identifying correlations) remains underexplored. In this paper, we address this gap by evaluating MLLMs on low-level ChartQA using a newly curated dataset, ChartInsights, which consists of 22,347 (chart, task, query, answer) covering 10 data analysis tasks across 7 chart types. We systematically evaluate 19 advanced MLLMs, including 12 open-source and 7 closed-source models. The average accuracy rate across these models is 39.8%, with GPT-4o achieving the highest accuracy at 69.17%. To further explore the limitations of MLLMs in low-level ChartQA, we conduct experiments that alter visual elements of charts (e.g., changing color schemes, adding image noise) to assess their impact on the task effectiveness. Furthermore, we propose a new textual prompt strategy, Chain-of-Charts, tailored for low-level ChartQA tasks, which boosts performance by 14.41%, achieving an accuracy of 83.58%. Finally, incorporating a visual prompt strategy that directs attention to relevant visual elements further improves accuracy to 84.32%.</p></details> | <details><summary>EMNLP...</summary><p>EMNLP 2024 Conference Paper</p></details> |

It has garnered significant attention for its potential to forecast real-world social trends. Traditional agent-based modeling (ABM) methods are constrained by their ability to incorporate complex individual background information and provide interactive prediction results. In this paper, we introduce ElectionSim, an innovative election simulation framework based on large language models, designed to support accurate voter simulations and customized distributions, together with an interactive platform to dialogue with simulated voters. We present a million-level voter pool sampled from social media platforms to support accurate individual simulation. We also introduce PPE, a poll-based presidential election benchmark to assess the performance of our framework under the U.S. presidential election scenario. Through extensive experiments and analyses, we demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our framework in U.S. presidential election simulations.</p></details> | 42 pages, 14 figures |
| **[Polynomial Composition Activations: Unleashing the Dynamics of Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03884v1)** | 2024-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformers have found extensive applications across various domains due to the powerful fitting capabilities. This success can be partially attributed to their inherent nonlinearity. Thus, in addition to the ReLU function employed in the original transformer architecture, researchers have explored alternative modules such as GeLU and SwishGLU to enhance nonlinearity and thereby augment representational capacity. In this paper, we propose a novel category of polynomial composition activations (PolyCom), designed to optimize the dynamics of transformers. Theoretically, we provide a comprehensive mathematical analysis of PolyCom, highlighting its enhanced expressivity and efficacy relative to other activation functions. Notably, we demonstrate that networks incorporating PolyCom achieve the $\textbf{optimal approximation rate}$, indicating that PolyCom networks require minimal parameters to approximate general smooth functions in Sobolev spaces. We conduct empirical experiments on the pre-training configurations of large language models (LLMs), including both dense and sparse architectures. By substituting conventional activation functions with PolyCom, we enable LLMs to capture higher-order interactions within the data, thus improving performance metrics in terms of accuracy and convergence rates. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, showing substantial improvements over other activation functions.

Especially ranking ensembles based on different topically related queries retrieve better results than rankings based on a single query alone. Recently, generative instruction-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) improved on a variety of different tasks in capturing human language. To this end, this work explores the feasibility of using synthetic query variants generated by instruction-tuned LLMs in data fusion experiments. More specifically, we introduce a lightweight, unsupervised, and cost-efficient approach that exploits principled prompting and data fusion techniques. In our experiments, LLMs produce more effective queries when provided with additional context information on the topic. Furthermore, our analysis based on four TREC newswire benchmarks shows that data fusion based on synthetic query variants is significantly better than baselines with single queries and also outperforms pseudo-relevance feedback methods.

However, current talking-face SemCom systems still encounter challenges such as low bandwidth utilization, semantic ambiguity, and diminished Quality of Experience (QoE). This study introduces a Large Generative Model-assisted Talking-face Semantic Communication (LGM-TSC) System tailored for the talking-face video communication. Firstly, we introduce a Generative Semantic Extractor (GSE) at the transmitter based on the FunASR model to convert semantically sparse talking-face videos into texts with high information density. Secondly, we establish a private Knowledge Base (KB) based on the Large Language Model (LLM) for semantic disambiguation and correction, complemented by a joint knowledge base-semantic-channel coding scheme. Finally, at the receiver, we propose a Generative Semantic Reconstructor (GSR) that utilizes BERT-VITS2 and SadTalker models to transform text back into a high-QoE talking-face video matching the user's timbre. Simulation results demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed LGM-TSC system.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Fine Line: Navigating Large Language Model Pretraining with Down-streaming Capability Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01204v3)** | 2024-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Uncovering early-stage metrics that reflect final model performance is one core principle for large-scale pretraining. The existing scaling law demonstrates the power-law correlation between pretraining loss and training flops, which serves as an important indicator of the current training state for large language models. However, this principle only focuses on the model's compression properties on the training data, resulting in an inconsistency with the ability improvements on the downstream tasks. Some follow-up works attempted to extend the scaling-law to more complex metrics (such as hyperparameters), but still lacked a comprehensive analysis of the dynamic differences among various capabilities during pretraining. To address the aforementioned limitations, this paper undertakes a comprehensive comparison of model capabilities at various pretraining intermediate checkpoints. Through this analysis, we confirm that specific downstream metrics exhibit similar training dynamics across models of different sizes, up to 67 billion parameters. In addition to our core findings, we've reproduced Amber and OpenLLaMA, releasing their intermediate checkpoints. This initiative offers valuable resources to the research community and facilitates the verification and exploration of LLM pretraining by open-source researchers. Besides, we provide empirical summaries, including performance comparisons of different models and capabilities, and tuition of key metrics for different training phases. Based on these findings, we provide a more user-friendly strategy for evaluating the optimization state, offering guidance for establishing a stable pretraining process.</p></details> |  |

For instance, an egg can be raw, cracked, and whisked while cooking an omelet, and these states can coexist simultaneously (an egg can be both raw and whisked). However, most existing research assumes a single object state change (e.g., uncracked -> cracked), overlooking the coexisting nature of multiple object states and the influence of past states on the current state. We formulate object state recognition as a multi-label classification task that explicitly handles multiple states. We then propose to learn multiple object states from narrated videos by leveraging large language models (LLMs) to generate pseudo-labels from the transcribed narrations, capturing the influence of past states. The challenge is that narrations mostly describe human actions in the video but rarely explain object states. Therefore, we use the LLMs knowledge of the relationship between actions and states to derive the missing object states. We further accumulate the derived object states to consider past state contexts to infer current object state pseudo-labels. We newly collect a dataset called the Multiple Object States Transition (MOST) dataset, which includes manual multi-label annotation for evaluation purposes, covering 60 object states across six object categories. Experimental results show that our model trained on LLM-generated pseudo-labels significantly outperforms strong vision-language models, demonstrating the effectiveness of our pseudo-labeling framework that considers past context via LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is an accepted WACV 2025 paper.

To evaluate DesignMinds, we conducted a between-subject study with 35 design practitioners, comparing its performance to a baseline condition. Our results demonstrate that DesignMinds significantly enhances the flexibility and originality of ideation, while also increasing task engagement. Importantly, the introduction of this technology did not negatively impact user experience, technology acceptance, or usability.</p></details> |  |

Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced their capability in understanding and summarizing complex medical texts. This research aims to explore how LLMs can alleviate the burden of manual summarization, streamline workflow efficiencies, and support informed decision-making in healthcare settings. Clinical notes from a cohort of 1,099 lung cancer patients were utilized, with a subset of 50 patients for testing purposes, and 102 patients used for model fine-tuning. This study evaluates the performance of multiple LLMs, including GPT-3.5, GPT-4, GPT-4o, and LLaMA 3 8b, in generating discharge summaries. Evaluation metrics included token-level analysis (BLEU, ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, ROUGE-L) and semantic similarity scores between model-generated summaries and physician-written gold standards. LLaMA 3 8b was further tested on clinical notes of varying lengths to examine the stability of its performance. The study found notable variations in summarization capabilities among LLMs. GPT-4o and fine-tuned LLaMA 3 demonstrated superior token-level evaluation metrics, while LLaMA 3 consistently produced concise summaries across different input lengths. Semantic similarity scores indicated GPT-4o and LLaMA 3 as leading models in capturing clinical relevance. This study contributes insights into the efficacy of LLMs for generating discharge summaries, highlighting LLaMA 3's robust performance in maintaining clarity and relevance across varying clinical contexts. These findings underscore the potential of automated summarization tools to enhance documentation precision and efficiency, ultimately improving patient care and operational capability in healthcare settings.</p></details> |  |

We recently proposed efficient implementations of the Louvain, Leiden, and Label Propagation Algorithms (LPA) for community detection. However, these incur significant memory overhead from the use of collision-free per-thread hashtables. To address this, we introduce memory-efficient alternatives using weighted Misra-Gries (MG) sketches, which replace the per-thread hashtables, and reduce memory demands in Louvain, Leiden, and LPA implementations - while incurring only a minor quality drop (up to 1%) and moderate runtime penalties. We believe that these approaches, though slightly slower, are well-suited for parallel processing and could outperform current memory-intensive techniques on systems with many threads.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 12 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

However, training these LLMs typically involves substantial memory and computational costs during both forward and backward propagation. While parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) considerably reduces the training memory associated with parameters, it does not address the significant computational costs and activation memory. In this paper, we propose Dropping Backward Propagation (DropBP), a novel approach designed to reduce computational costs and activation memory while maintaining accuracy. DropBP randomly drops layers during backward propagation, which is essentially equivalent to training shallow submodules generated by undropped layers and residual connections. Additionally, DropBP calculates the sensitivity of each layer to assign an appropriate drop rate, thereby stabilizing the training process. DropBP is not only applicable to full fine-tuning but can also be orthogonally integrated with all types of PEFT by dropping layers during backward propagation. Specifically, DropBP can reduce training time by 44% with comparable accuracy to the baseline, accelerate convergence to the same perplexity by 1.5x, and enable training with a sequence length 6.2x larger on a single NVIDIA-A100 GPU. Furthermore, our DropBP enabled a throughput increase of 79% on a NVIDIA A100 GPU and 117% on an Intel Gaudi2 HPU. The code is available at https://github.com/WooSunghyeon/dropbp.</p></details> |  |

This is because they either hallucinate when providing factual quotations or fail to provide quotes that exceed human expectations. To bridge the gap, we systematically study how to evaluate and improve LLMs' performance in quotation generation tasks. We first establish a holistic and automatic evaluation system for quotation generation task, which consists of five criteria each with corresponding automatic metric. To improve the LLMs' quotation generation abilities, we construct a bilingual knowledge base that is broad in scope and rich in dimensions, containing up to 32,022 quotes. Moreover, guided by our critiria, we further design a quotation-specific metric to rerank the retrieved quotations from the knowledge base. Extensive experiments show that our metrics strongly correlate with human preferences. Existing LLMs struggle to generate desired quotes, but our quotation knowledge base and reranking metric help narrow this gap.

Despite Large Language Models (LLMs) holding the potential to efficiently simulate this task by using natural language to direct the optimization, straightforwardly utilizing shows limited performance. In this work, we facilitate utilizing LLMs in an iterative paradigm by proposing a simple yet highly effective domain feedback provider, namely $\text{Re}^3$DF. In detail, $\text{Re}^3$DF harnesses an external toolkit, RDKit, to handle the molecule hallucination, if the modified molecule is chemically invalid. Otherwise, its desired properties are computed and compared to the original one, establishing reliable domain feedback with correct direction and distance towards the objective, followed by a retrieved example, to explicitly guide the LLM to refine the modified molecule. We conduct experiments across both single- and multi-property objectives with 2 thresholds, where $\text{Re}^3$DF shows significant improvements. Particularly, for 20 single-property objectives, $\text{Re}^3$DF enhances Hit ratio by 16.95% and 20.76% under loose and strict thresholds, respectively. For 32 multi-property objectives, $\text{Re}^3$DF enhances Hit ratio by 6.04% and 5.25%.</p></details> |  |

However, existing SSC methods often overlook the high deployment costs in real-world applications. Traditional architectures, such as 3D Convolutional Neural Networks (3D CNNs) and self-attention mechanisms, face challenges in efficiently capturing long-range dependencies within 3D voxel grids, limiting their effectiveness. To address these issues, we introduce MetaSSC, a novel meta-learning-based framework for SSC that leverages deformable convolution, large-kernel attention, and the Mamba (D-LKA-M) model. Our approach begins with a voxel-based semantic segmentation (SS) pretraining task, aimed at exploring the semantics and geometry of incomplete regions while acquiring transferable meta-knowledge. Using simulated cooperative perception datasets, we supervise the perception training of a single vehicle using aggregated sensor data from multiple nearby connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs), generating richer and more comprehensive labels. This meta-knowledge is then adapted to the target domain through a dual-phase training strategy that does not add extra model parameters, enabling efficient deployment. To further enhance the model's capability in capturing long-sequence relationships within 3D voxel grids, we integrate Mamba blocks with deformable convolution and large-kernel attention into the backbone network. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MetaSSC achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming competing models while also reducing deployment costs.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we propose an energy-based physics-informed neural network (PINNs) framework for solving frictionless contact problems under large deformation. Inspired by microscopic Lennard-Jones potential, a surface contact energy is used to describe the contact phenomena. To ensure the robustness of the proposed PINN framework, relaxation, gradual loading and output scaling techniques are introduced. In the numerical examples, the well-known Hertz contact benchmark problem is conducted, demonstrating the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed PINNs framework. Moreover, challenging contact problems with the consideration of geometrical and material nonlinearities are tested. It has been shown that the proposed PINNs framework provides a reliable and powerful tool for nonlinear contact mechanics. More importantly, the proposed PINNs framework exhibits competitive computational efficiency to the commercial FEM software when dealing with those complex contact problems.

We compared the grading performance of GPT-4o with that of human teaching assistants (TAs) on ten quiz problems from the MEEN 361 course at Texas A&M University, each answered by approximately 225 students. Both the LLM and TAs followed the same instructor-provided rubric to ensure grading consistency. We evaluated performance using Spearman's rank correlation coefficient and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) to assess the alignment between rankings and the accuracy of scores assigned by GPT-4o and TAs under zero- and few-shot grading settings. In the zero-shot setting, GPT-4o demonstrated a strong correlation with TA grading, with Spearman's rank correlation coefficient exceeding 0.6 in seven out of ten datasets and reaching a high of 0.9387. Our analysis reveals that GPT-4o performs well when grading criteria are straightforward but struggles with nuanced answers, particularly those involving synonyms not present in the rubric. The model also tends to grade more stringently in ambiguous cases compared to human TAs. Overall, ChatGPT shows promise as a tool for grading conceptual questions, offering scalability and consistency.</p></details> | 21 pages, 21 figures |

Consequently, we obtain a polynomial time algorithm to find linear-sized independent sets in one-sided expanders that are almost $3$-colorable or are promised to contain an independent set of size $(1/2-\epsilon)n$. Our second result above can be refined to require only a weaker vertex expansion property with an efficient certificate. In a surprising contrast to our algorithmic result, we observe that the analogous task of finding a linear-sized independent set in almost $4$-colorable one-sided expanders (even when the second eigenvalue is $o_n(1)$) is NP-hard, assuming the Unique Games Conjecture. All prior algorithms that beat the worst-case guarantees for this problem rely on bottom eigenspace enumeration techniques (following the classical spectral methods of Alon and Kahale) and require two-sided expansion, meaning a bounded number of negative eigenvalues of magnitude $\Omega(1)$. Such techniques naturally extend to almost $k$-colorable graphs for any constant $k$, in contrast to analogous guarantees on one-sided expanders, which are Unique Games-hard to achieve for $k \geq 4$. Our rounding builds on the method of simulating multiple samples from a pseudo-distribution introduced by Bafna et. al. for rounding Unique Games instances. The key to our analysis is a new clustering property of large independent sets in expanding graphs - every large independent set has a larger-than-expected intersection with some member of a small list - and its formalization in the low-degree sum-of-squares proof system.</p></details> | 57 pages, 3 figures |
| **[ConfusionPrompt: Practical Private Inference for Online Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00870v4)** | 2024-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>State-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) are typically deployed as online services, requiring users to transmit detailed prompts to cloud servers. This raises significant privacy concerns. In response, we introduce ConfusionPrompt, a novel framework for private LLM inference that protects user privacy by: (i) decomposing the original prompt into smaller sub-prompts, and (ii) generating pseudo-prompts alongside the genuine sub-prompts, which are then sent to the LLM. The server responses are later recomposed by the user to reconstruct the final output. This approach offers key advantages over previous LLM privacy protection methods: (i) it integrates seamlessly with existing black-box LLMs, and (ii) it delivers a significantly improved privacy-utility trade-off compared to existing text perturbation methods. We also develop a $(\lambda, \mu, \rho)$-privacy model to formulate the requirements for a privacy-preserving group of prompts and provide a complexity analysis to justify the role of prompt decomposition. Our empirical evaluation shows that ConfusionPrompt achieves significantly higher utility than local inference methods using open-source models and perturbation-based techniques, while also reducing memory consumption compared to open-source LLMs.</p></details> | 33 pages |

It encompasses 8 distinct tasks and 26 datasets, among which, 7 are newly proposed datasets. The evaluation targets three main aspects: speech understanding, audio scene understanding, and voice understanding (paralinguistic). Despite recent advancements, there lacks a comprehensive benchmark for AudioLLMs on instruction following capabilities conditioned on audio signals. AudioBench addresses this gap by setting up datasets as well as desired evaluation metrics. Besides, we also evaluated the capabilities of five popular models and found that no single model excels consistently across all tasks. We outline the research outlook for AudioLLMs and anticipate that our open-sourced evaluation toolkit, data, and leaderboard will offer a robust testbed for future model developments.</p></details> | <details><summary>v4 - ...</summary><p>v4 - Add acknowledgment and slight update on structure; Code: https://github.com/AudioLLMs/AudioBench</p></details> |
| **[Automated Commit Message Generation with Large Language Models: An Empirical Study and Beyond](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14824v2)** | 2024-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Commit Message Generation (CMG) approaches aim to automatically generate commit messages based on given code diffs, which facilitate collaboration among developers and play a critical role in Open-Source Software (OSS). Very recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated extensive applicability in diverse code-related task. But few studies systematically explored their effectiveness using LLMs. This paper conducts the first comprehensive experiment to investigate how far we have been in applying LLM to generate high-quality commit messages. Motivated by a pilot analysis, we first clean the most widely-used CMG dataset following practitioners' criteria. Afterward, we re-evaluate diverse state-of-the-art CMG approaches and make comparisons with LLMs, demonstrating the superior performance of LLMs against state-of-the-art CMG approaches. Then, we further propose four manual metrics following the practice of OSS, including Accuracy, Integrity, Applicability, and Readability, and assess various LLMs accordingly. Results reveal that GPT-3.5 performs best overall, but different LLMs carry different advantages. To further boost LLMs' performance in the CMG task, we propose an Efficient Retrieval-based In-Context Learning (ICL) framework, namely ERICommiter, which leverages a two-step filtering to accelerate the retrieval efficiency and introduces semantic/lexical-based retrieval algorithm to construct the ICL examples. Extensive experiments demonstrate the substantial performance improvement of ERICommiter on various LLMs for code diffs of different programming languages. Meanwhile, ERICommiter also significantly reduces the retrieval time while keeping almost the same performance. Our research contributes to the understanding of LLMs' capabilities in the CMG field and provides valuable insights for practitioners seeking to leverage these tools in their workflows.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multilingual Pretraining Using a Large Corpus Machine-Translated from a Single Source Language](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23956v2)** | 2024-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>English, as a very high-resource language, enables the pretraining of high-quality large language models (LLMs). The same cannot be said for most other languages, as leading LLMs still underperform for non-English languages, likely due to a gap in the quality and diversity of the available multilingual pretraining corpora. In this work, we find that machine-translated text from a single high-quality source language can contribute significantly to the pretraining of multilingual LLMs. We translate FineWeb-Edu, a high-quality English web dataset, into French, German, and Spanish, resulting in a final 300B-token dataset, which we call TransWeb-Edu, and pretrain a 1.3B-parameter model, CuatroLLM, from scratch on this dataset. Across five non-English reasoning tasks, we show that CuatroLLM matches or outperforms state-of-the-art multilingual models trained using closed data, such as Llama3.2 and Gemma2, despite using an order of magnitude less data, such as about 6% of the tokens used for Llama3.2's training. We further demonstrate that with additional domain-specific pretraining, amounting to less than 1% of TransWeb-Edu, CuatroLLM surpasses the state of the art in multilingual reasoning. To promote reproducibility, we release our corpus, models, and training pipeline under open licenses at hf.co/britllm/CuatroLLM.</p></details> |  |

In order to handle such geolocation dependency, we propose Spatioformer, where a novel geolocation encoder is coupled with the transformer model to encode geolocation context into remote sensing imagery. The Spatioformer model compares favourably to state-of-the-art models in richness predictions on a large-scale ground-truth richness dataset (HAVPlot) that consists of 68,170 in-situ richness samples covering diverse landscapes across Australia. The results demonstrate that geolocational information is advantageous in predicting species richness from satellite observations over large spatial scales. With Spatioformer, plant species richness maps over Australia are compiled from Landsat archive for the years from 2015 to 2023. The richness maps produced in this study reveal the spatiotemporal dynamics of plant species richness in Australia, providing supporting evidence to inform effective planning and policy development for plant diversity conservation. Regions of high richness prediction uncertainties are identified, highlighting the need for future in-situ surveys to be conducted in these areas to enhance the prediction accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing</p></details> |
| **[Performance-Based Risk Assessment for Large-Scale Transportation Networks Using the Transitional Markov Chain Monte Carlo Method](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03580v1)** | 2024-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurately assessing failure risk due to asset deterioration and/or extreme events is essential for efficient transportation asset management. Traditional risk assessment is conducted for individual assets by either focusing on the economic risk to asset owners or relying on empirical proxies of systemwide consequences. Risk assessment directly based on system performance (e.g., network capacity) is largely limited due to (1) an exponentially increasing number of system states for accurate performance evaluation, (2) potential contribution of system states with low likelihood yet high consequences (i.e., "gray swan" events) to system state, and (3) lack of actionable information for asset management from risk assessment results. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a novel approach to performance-based risk assessment for large-scale transportation networks. The new approach is underpinned by the Transitional Markov Chain Monte Carlo (TMCMC) method, a sequential sampling technique originally developed for Bayesian updating. The risk assessment problem is reformulated such that (1) the system risk becomes the normalizing term (i.e., evidence) of a high-dimensional posterior distribution, and (2) the final posterior samples from TMCMC yield risk-based importance measures for different assets. Two types of analytical examples are developed to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach as the number of assets increases and the influence of gray swan events grows. The new approach is further applied in a case study on the Oregon highway network, serving as a real-world example of large-scale transportation networks.</p></details> |  |

We present NutriBench, the first publicly available natural language meal description nutrition benchmark. NutriBench consists of 11,857 meal descriptions generated from real-world global dietary intake data. The data is human-verified and annotated with macro-nutrient labels, including carbohydrates, proteins, fats, and calories. We conduct an extensive evaluation of NutriBench on the task of carbohydrate estimation, testing twelve leading Large Language Models (LLMs), including GPT-4o, Llama3.1, Qwen2, Gemma2, and OpenBioLLM models, using standard, Chain-of-Thought and Retrieval-Augmented Generation strategies. Additionally, we present a study involving professional nutritionists, finding that LLMs can provide more accurate and faster estimates. Finally, we perform a real-world risk assessment by simulating the effect of carbohydrate predictions on the blood glucose levels of individuals with diabetes. Our work highlights the opportunities and challenges of using LLMs for nutrition estimation, demonstrating their potential to aid professionals and laypersons and improve health outcomes.

These models demonstrate strong performance on a range of tasks; however, there has been evidence of brittleness when applied to more niche or narrow domains where hallucinations or fluent but incorrect responses reduce performance. Given the complex nature of scientific domains, it is prudent to investigate the trade-offs of leveraging off-the-shelf versus more targeted foundation models for scientific domains. In this work, we examine the benefits of in-domain pre-training for a given scientific domain, chemistry, and compare these to open-source, off-the-shelf models with zero-shot and few-shot prompting. Our results show that not only do in-domain base models perform reasonably well on in-domain tasks in a zero-shot setting but that further adaptation using instruction fine-tuning yields impressive performance on chemistry-specific tasks such as named entity recognition and molecular formula generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Long Context RAG Performance of Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03538v1)** | 2024-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a crucial technique for enhancing the accuracy of Large Language Models (LLMs) by incorporating external information. With the advent of LLMs that support increasingly longer context lengths, there is a growing interest in understanding how these models perform in RAG scenarios. Can these new long context models improve RAG performance? This paper presents a comprehensive study of the impact of increased context length on RAG performance across 20 popular open source and commercial LLMs. We ran RAG workflows while varying the total context length from 2,000 to 128,000 tokens (and 2 million tokens when possible) on three domain-specific datasets, and report key insights on the benefits and limitations of long context in RAG applications. Our findings reveal that while retrieving more documents can improve performance, only a handful of the most recent state of the art LLMs can maintain consistent accuracy at long context above 64k tokens. We also identify distinct failure modes in long context scenarios, suggesting areas for future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>2024 ...</summary><p>2024 NeurIPS workshop on Adaptive Foundation Models: Evolving AI for Personalized and Efficient Learning</p></details> |

However, the complexity and diversity of lncRNA sequences, along with the limited knowledge of their functional mechanisms and the regulation of their expressions, pose significant challenges to lncRNA studies. Given the tremendous success of large language models (LLMs) in capturing complex dependencies in sequential data, this study aims to systematically explore the potential and limitations of LLMs in the sequence analysis related to the transcriptional regulation of lncRNA genes. Our extensive experiments demonstrated promising performance of fine-tuned genome foundation models on progressively complex tasks. Furthermore, we conducted an insightful analysis of the critical impact of task complexity, model selection, data quality, and biological interpretability for the studies of the regulation of lncRNA gene expression.</p></details> |  |

However, current multi-agent simulations frequently suffer from inefficiencies due to the limited parallelism caused by false dependencies, resulting in performance bottlenecks. In this paper, we introduce AI Metropolis, a simulation engine that improves the efficiency of LLM agent simulations by incorporating out-of-order execution scheduling. By dynamically tracking real dependencies between agents, AI Metropolis minimizes false dependencies, enhancing parallelism and enabling efficient hardware utilization. Our evaluations demonstrate that AI Metropolis achieves speedups from 1.3x to 4.15x over standard parallel simulation with global synchronization, approaching optimal performance as the number of agents increases.</p></details> |  |

The design of {\lambda}-Tune is motivated by the capabilities of the latest generation of LLMs. Different from prior work, leveraging LLMs to extract tuning hints for single parameters, {\lambda}-Tune generates entire configuration scripts, based on a large input document, describing the tuning context. {\lambda}-Tune generates alternative configurations, using a principled approach to identify the best configuration, out of a small set of candidates. In doing so, it minimizes reconfiguration overheads and ensures that evaluation costs are bounded as a function of the optimal run time. By treating prompt generation as a cost-based optimization problem, {\lambda}-Tune conveys the most relevant context to the LLM while bounding the number of input tokens and, therefore, monetary fees for LLM invocations. We compare {\lambda}-Tune to various baselines, using multiple benchmarks and PostgreSQL and MySQL as target systems for tuning, showing that {\lambda}-Tune is significantly more robust than prior approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be presented at SIGMOD 2025</p></details> |

However, generating pedagogically sound hints that address student misconceptions and adhere to specific educational objectives remains challenging. This work explores using LLMs (GPT-4o and Llama-3-8B-instruct) as teachers to generate effective hints for students simulated through LLMs (GPT-3.5-turbo, Llama-3-8B-Instruct, or Mistral-7B-instruct-v0.3) tackling math exercises designed for human high-school students, and designed using cognitive science principles. We present here the study of several dimensions: 1) identifying error patterns made by simulated students on secondary-level math exercises; 2) developing various prompts for GPT-4o as a teacher and evaluating their effectiveness in generating hints that enable simulated students to self-correct; and 3) testing the best-performing prompts, based on their ability to produce relevant hints and facilitate error correction, with Llama-3-8B-Instruct as the teacher, allowing for a performance comparison with GPT-4o. The results show that model errors increase with higher temperature settings. Notably, when hints are generated by GPT-4o, the most effective prompts include prompts tailored to specific errors as well as prompts providing general hints based on common mathematical errors. Interestingly, Llama-3-8B-Instruct as a teacher showed better overall performance than GPT-4o. Also the problem-solving and response revision capabilities of the LLMs as students, particularly GPT-3.5-turbo, improved significantly after receiving hints, especially at lower temperature settings. However, models like Mistral-7B-Instruct demonstrated a decline in performance as the temperature increased.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2024 Workshop on Large Foundation Models for Educational Assessment (FM-Assess)</p></details> |

By reallocating computational processes to the input phase, a substantial reduction in latency is achieved, thereby significantly enhancing the interactive experience for users of LLMs. The framework adeptly manages the visibility of the streaming input to the model, allowing it to infer from incomplete user input or await additional content. Compared with traditional inference methods on complete user input, our approach demonstrates an average reduction in response latency of 84.0% on the MMLU dataset and 71.6% on the MMLU-Pro dataset, while maintaining comparable accuracy. Additionally, our framework facilitates collaborative inference and output across different models. By employing an large LLM for inference and a small LLM for output, we achieve an average 37% reduction in response latency, alongside a 4.30% improvement in accuracy on the MMLU-Pro dataset compared with the baseline. The proposed LiveMind framework advances the field of human-AI interaction by enabling more responsive and efficient communication between users and AI systems.</p></details> |  |

However, it remains unclear why this model -- originally developed for multi-player stochastic game matching -- can be adopted to convert pairwise response comparisons to reward values and make predictions. Especially given the fact that only a limited number of prompt-response pairs are sparsely compared with others. In this paper, we first revisit the foundations of using BT models in reward modeling, and establish the convergence rate of BT reward models based on deep neural networks using embeddings, providing a theoretical foundation for their use. Despite theoretically sound, we argue that the BT model is not a necessary choice from the perspective of downstream optimization. This is because a reward model only needs to preserve the correct ranking predictions through a monotonic transformation of the true reward. We highlight the critical concept of order consistency in reward modeling and demonstrate that the BT model possesses this property. Consequently, we propose a simple and straightforward upper-bound algorithm, compatible with off-the-shelf binary classifiers, as an alternative order-consistent reward modeling objective. To offer practical insights, we empirically evaluate the performance of these different reward modeling approaches across more than 12,000 experimental setups, using $6$ base LLMs, $2$ datasets, and diverse annotation designs that vary in quantity, quality, and pairing choices in preference annotations.</p></details> |  |

This survey consolidates recent research on (M)LLM-based GUI agents, highlighting key innovations in data, frameworks, and applications. We begin by discussing representative datasets and benchmarks. Next, we summarize a unified framework that captures the essential components used in prior research, accompanied by a taxonomy. Additionally, we explore commercial applications of (M)LLM-based GUI agents. Drawing from existing work, we identify several key challenges and propose future research directions. We hope this paper will inspire further developments in the field of (M)LLM-based GUI agents.</p></details> |  |

This study introduces a novel approach towards the creation of medical foundation models by integrating a large-scale multi-modal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) dataset derived from 41,400 participants in its own. Our method involves a novel two-stage pretraining approach using vision transformers. The first stage is dedicated to encoding anatomical structures in generally healthy brains, identifying key features such as shapes and sizes of different brain regions. The second stage concentrates on spatial information, encompassing aspects like location and the relative positioning of brain structures. We rigorously evaluate our model, BrainFounder, using the Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS) challenge and Anatomical Tracings of Lesions After Stroke v2.0 (ATLAS v2.0) datasets. BrainFounder demonstrates a significant performance gain, surpassing the achievements of the previous winning solutions using fully supervised learning. Our findings underscore the impact of scaling up both the complexity of the model and the volume of unlabeled training data derived from generally healthy brains, which enhances the accuracy and predictive capabilities of the model in complex neuroimaging tasks with MRI. The implications of this research provide transformative insights and practical applications in healthcare and make substantial steps towards the creation of foundation models for Medical AI.

The main problem for those applications arises from the difficulty in collecting large labeled task-specific data for model development. Generalizable respiratory acoustic foundation models pretrained with unlabeled data would offer appealing advantages and possibly unlock this impasse. However, given the safety-critical nature of healthcare applications, it is pivotal to also ensure openness and replicability for any proposed foundation model solution. To this end, we introduce OPERA, an OPEn Respiratory Acoustic foundation model pretraining and benchmarking system, as the first approach answering this need. We curate large-scale respiratory audio datasets (~136K samples, over 400 hours), pretrain three pioneering foundation models, and build a benchmark consisting of 19 downstream respiratory health tasks for evaluation. Our pretrained models demonstrate superior performance (against existing acoustic models pretrained with general audio on 16 out of 19 tasks) and generalizability (to unseen datasets and new respiratory audio modalities). This highlights the great promise of respiratory acoustic foundation models and encourages more studies using OPERA as an open resource to accelerate research on respiratory audio for health.

However, their rapidly growing capabilities and autonomy have raised significant concerns about AI safety. Designing effective guardrails for these agents is challenging due to their autonomous and non-deterministic behavior, and the involvement of multiple artifacts -- such as goals, prompts, plans, tools, knowledge bases, and intermediate and final results. Addressing these unique challenges runtime requires multi-layered guardrails that operate effectively at various levels of the agent architecture, similar to the Swiss Cheese Model. In this paper, we present a taxonomy of multi-layered runtime guardrails to classify and compare their characteristics and design options, grounded on a systematic literature review and guided by the Swiss Cheese Model. This taxonomy is organized into external and internal quality attributes and design options categories. We also highlight the relationships between guardrails, the associated risks they mitigate, and the quality attributes they impact in agent architectures. Thus, the proposed taxonomy provides structured and concrete guidance for making architectural design decisions when implementing multi-layered guardrails while emphasizing the trade-offs inherent in these decisions.</p></details> | 15 Pages |

However, they often fail to fully capture the complexity of research workflows, which typically involve interpreting non-textual data and gathering information across multiple documents. To address this gap, we introduce M3SciQA, a multi-modal, multi-document scientific question answering benchmark designed for a more comprehensive evaluation of foundation models. M3SciQA consists of 1,452 expert-annotated questions spanning 70 natural language processing paper clusters, where each cluster represents a primary paper along with all its cited documents, mirroring the workflow of comprehending a single paper by requiring multi-modal and multi-document data. With M3SciQA, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 18 foundation models. Our results indicate that current foundation models still significantly underperform compared to human experts in multi-modal information retrieval and in reasoning across multiple scientific documents. Additionally, we explore the implications of these findings for the future advancement of applying foundation models in multi-modal scientific literature analysis.</p></details> |  |

Face reconstruction attack (also known as template inversion) refers to reconstructing face images from face embeddings and using the reconstructed face image to enter a face recognition system. In this paper, we propose to use a face foundation model to reconstruct face images from the embeddings of a blackbox face recognition model. The foundation model is trained with 42M images to generate face images from the facial embeddings of a fixed face recognition model. We propose to use an adapter to translate target embeddings into the embedding space of the foundation model. The generated images are evaluated on different face recognition models and different datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method to translate embeddings of different face recognition models. We also evaluate the transferability of reconstructed face images when attacking different face recognition models. Our experimental results show that our reconstructed face images outperform previous reconstruction attacks against face recognition models.</p></details> |  |

Nevertheless, there is a lack of systematic knowledge to guide practitioners in designing the agents considering challenges of goal-seeking (including generating instrumental goals and plans), such as hallucinations inherent in foundation models, explainability of reasoning process, complex accountability, etc. To address this issue, we have performed a systematic literature review to understand the state-of-the-art foundation model-based agents and the broader ecosystem. In this paper, we present a pattern catalogue consisting of 18 architectural patterns with analyses of the context, forces, and trade-offs as the outcomes from the previous literature review. We propose a decision model for selecting the patterns. The proposed catalogue can provide holistic guidance for the effective use of patterns, and support the architecture design of foundation model-based agents by facilitating goal-seeking and plan generation.</p></details> |  |

The Segmentation Anything Model (SAM) serves as a powerful foundation model for visual segmentation and can be adapted for medical image segmentation. However, medical imaging data typically contain privacy-sensitive information, making it challenging to train foundation models with centralized storage and sharing. To date, there are few foundation models tailored for medical image deployment within the federated learning framework, and the segmentation performance, as well as the efficiency of communication and training, remain unexplored. In response to these issues, we developed Federated Foundation models for Medical image Segmentation (FedFMS), which includes the Federated SAM (FedSAM) and a communication and training-efficient Federated SAM with Medical SAM Adapter (FedMSA). Comprehensive experiments on diverse datasets are conducted to investigate the performance disparities between centralized training and federated learning across various configurations of FedFMS. The experiments revealed that FedFMS could achieve performance comparable to models trained via centralized training methods while maintaining privacy.

However, these large-scale datasets are often collected without explicit consent, raising ethical and privacy concerns. To address this, there have been proposals to use synthetic datasets for training face recognition models. Yet, such models still rely on real data to train the generative models and generally exhibit inferior performance compared to those trained on real datasets. One of these datasets, DigiFace, uses a graphics pipeline to generate different identities and different intra-class variations without using real data in training the models. However, the performance of this approach is poor on face recognition benchmarks, possibly due to the lack of realism in the images generated from the graphics pipeline. In this work, we introduce a novel framework for realism transfer aimed at enhancing the realism of synthetically generated face images. Our method leverages the large-scale face foundation model, and we adapt the pipeline for realism enhancement. By integrating the controllable aspects of the graphics pipeline with our realism enhancement technique, we generate a large amount of realistic variations-combining the advantages of both approaches. Our empirical evaluations demonstrate that models trained using our enhanced dataset significantly improve the performance of face recognition systems over the baseline.

One of the most predominant biomarkers in neuroimaging is represented by brain age, which has been shown to be a good indicator for different conditions, such as Alzheimer's Disease. Using brain age for pretraining DL models in transfer learning settings has also recently shown promising results, especially when dealing with data scarcity of different conditions. On the other hand, anatomical information of brain MRIs (e.g. cortical thickness) can provide important information for learning good representations that can be transferred to many downstream tasks. In this work, we propose AnatCL, an anatomical foundation model for brain MRIs that i.) leverages anatomical information with a weakly contrastive learning approach and ii.) achieves state-of-the-art performances in many different downstream tasks. To validate our approach we consider 12 different downstream tasks for diagnosis classification, and prediction of 10 different clinical assessment scores.

| **[Watson: A Cognitive Observability Framework for the Reasoning of Foundation Model-Powered Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03455v1)** | 2024-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As foundation models (FMs) play an increasingly prominent role in complex software systems, such as FM-powered agentic software (i.e., Agentware), they introduce significant challenges for developers regarding observability. Unlike traditional software, agents operate autonomously, using extensive data and opaque implicit reasoning, making it difficult to observe and understand their behavior during runtime, especially when they take unexpected actions or encounter errors. In this paper, we highlight the limitations of traditional operational observability in the context of FM-powered software, and introduce cognitive observability as a new type of required observability that has emerged for such innovative systems. We then propose a novel framework that provides cognitive observability into the implicit reasoning processes of agents (a.k.a. reasoning observability), and demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in boosting the debuggability of Agentware and, in turn, the abilities of an Agentware through a case study on AutoCodeRover, a cuttingedge Agentware for autonomous program improvement.</p></details> |  |
| **[Poseidon: Efficient Foundation Models for PDEs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19101v2)** | 2024-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Poseidon, a foundation model for learning the solution operators of PDEs. It is based on a multiscale operator transformer, with time-conditioned layer norms that enable continuous-in-time evaluations. A novel training strategy leveraging the semi-group property of time-dependent PDEs to allow for significant scaling-up of the training data is also proposed. Poseidon is pretrained on a diverse, large scale dataset for the governing equations of fluid dynamics. It is then evaluated on a suite of 15 challenging downstream tasks that include a wide variety of PDE types and operators. We show that Poseidon exhibits excellent performance across the board by outperforming baselines significantly, both in terms of sample efficiency and accuracy. Poseidon also generalizes very well to new physics that is not seen during pretraining. Moreover, Poseidon scales with respect to model and data size, both for pretraining and for downstream tasks. Taken together, our results showcase the surprising ability of Poseidon to learn effective representations from a very small set of PDEs during pretraining in order to generalize well to unseen and unrelated PDEs downstream, demonstrating its potential as an effective, general purpose PDE foundation model. Finally, the Poseidon model as well as underlying pretraining and downstream datasets are open sourced, with code being available at https://github.com/camlab-ethz/poseidon and pretrained models and datasets at https://huggingface.co/camlab-ethz.</p></details> |  |

Emerging research indicates that large vision-language models (VLMs) can enhance performance across various downstream vision-language understanding tasks. However, general-domain models often underperform in specialized fields. This study introduces a domain-specific Large Vision-Language Model, Human-Scene Vision-Language Model (HumanVLM), designed to provide a foundation for human-scene Vision-Language tasks. Specifically, (1) we create a large-scale human-scene multimodal image-text dataset (HumanCaption-10M) sourced from the Internet to facilitate domain-specific alignment; (2) develop a captioning approach for human-centered images, capturing human faces, bodies, and backgrounds, and construct a high-quality Human-Scene image-text dataset (HumanCaptionHQ, about 311k pairs) that contain as much detailed information as possible about human; (3) Using HumanCaption-10M and HumanCaptionHQ, we train a HumanVLM. In the experiments, we then evaluate our HumanVLM across varous downstream tasks, where it demonstrates superior overall performance among multimodal models of comparable scale, particularly excelling in human-related tasks and significantly outperforming similar models, including Qwen2VL and ChatGPT-4o. HumanVLM, alongside the data introduced, will stimulate the research in human-around fields.</p></details> | 34 pages,11 figures |

While Parameter-efficient Fine-tuning (PEFT) is commonly used to adapt these models, studies often prioritize parameter efficiency, neglecting GPU memory and training speed. To address this, we introduced the IISAN framework, significantly enhancing efficiency. However, IISAN was limited to symmetrical MFMs and identical text and image encoders, preventing the use of state-of-the-art Large Language Models. To overcome this, we developed IISAN-Versa, a versatile plug-and-play architecture compatible with both symmetrical and asymmetrical MFMs. IISAN-Versa employs a Decoupled PEFT structure and utilizes both intra- and inter-modal adaptation. It effectively handles asymmetry through a simple yet effective combination of group layer-dropping and dimension transformation alignment. Our research demonstrates that IISAN-Versa effectively adapts large text encoders, and we further identify a scaling effect where larger encoders generally perform better. IISAN-Versa also demonstrates strong versatility in our defined multimodal scenarios, which include raw titles and captions generated from images and videos. Additionally, IISAN-Versa achieved state-of-the-art performance on the Microlens public benchmark. We will release our code and datasets to support future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>The e...</summary><p>The extension of IISAN in SIGIR2024</p></details> |

However, most of these models rely on the Transformer architecture, which incurs quadratic complexity as input length increases. To address this, we introduce TSMamba, a linear-complexity foundation model for time series forecasting built on the Mamba architecture. The model captures temporal dependencies through both forward and backward Mamba encoders, achieving high prediction accuracy. To reduce reliance on large datasets and lower training costs, TSMamba employs a two-stage transfer learning process that leverages pretrained Mamba LLMs, allowing effective time series modeling with a moderate training set. In the first stage, the forward and backward backbones are optimized via patch-wise autoregressive prediction; in the second stage, the model trains a prediction head and refines other components for long-term forecasting. While the backbone assumes channel independence to manage varying channel numbers across datasets, a channel-wise compressed attention module is introduced to capture cross-channel dependencies during fine-tuning on specific multivariate datasets. Experiments show that TSMamba's zero-shot performance is comparable to state-of-the-art time series foundation models, despite using significantly less training data. It also achieves competitive or superior full-shot performance compared to task-specific prediction models. The code will be made publicly available.</p></details> |  |

We introduce SoniDo, a music foundation model (MFM) designed to extract hierarchical features from target music samples. By leveraging hierarchical intermediate features, SoniDo constrains the information granularity, leading to improved performance across various downstream tasks including both understanding and generative tasks. We specifically evaluated this approach on representative tasks such as music tagging, music transcription, music source separation, and music mixing. Our results reveal that the features extracted from foundation models provide valuable enhancements in training downstream task models. This highlights the capability of using features extracted from music foundation models as a booster for downstream tasks. Our approach not only benefits existing task-specific models but also supports music downstream tasks constrained by data scarcity.

Has this achieved what the original FMs accomplished, i.e. the supplanting of traditional supervised learning in their domains? To answer we look at three modalities -- genomics, satellite imaging, and time series -- with multiple recent FMs and compare them to a standard supervised learning workflow: model development, hyperparameter tuning, and training, all using only data from the target task. Across these three specialized domains, we find that it is consistently possible to train simple supervised models -- no more complicated than a lightly modified wide ResNet or UNet -- that match or even outperform the latest foundation models. Our work demonstrates that the benefits of large-scale pretraining have yet to be realized in many specialized areas, reinforces the need to compare new FMs to strong, well-tuned baselines, and introduces two new, easy-to-use, open-source, and automated workflows for doing so.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The first two authors contributed equally.

| **[Foundation AI Model for Medical Image Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02745v1)** | 2024-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models refer to artificial intelligence (AI) models that are trained on massive amounts of data and demonstrate broad generalizability across various tasks with high accuracy. These models offer versatile, one-for-many or one-for-all solutions, eliminating the need for developing task-specific AI models. Examples of such foundation models include the Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer (ChatGPT) and the Segment Anything Model (SAM). These models have been trained on millions to billions of samples and have shown wide-ranging and accurate applications in numerous tasks such as text processing (using ChatGPT) and natural image segmentation (using SAM). In medical image segmentation - finding target regions in medical images - there is a growing need for these one-for-many or one-for-all foundation models. Such models could obviate the need to develop thousands of task-specific AI models, which is currently standard practice in the field. They can also be adapted to tasks with datasets too small for effective training. We discuss two paths to achieve foundation models for medical image segmentation and comment on progress, challenges, and opportunities. One path is to adapt or fine-tune existing models, originally developed for natural images, for use with medical images. The second path entails building models from scratch, exclusively training on medical images.</p></details> |  |
| **[Conformal Alignment: Knowing When to Trust Foundation Models with Guarantees](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10301v3)** | 2024-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Before deploying outputs from foundation models in high-stakes tasks, it is imperative to ensure that they align with human values. For instance, in radiology report generation, reports generated by a vision-language model must align with human evaluations before their use in medical decision-making. This paper presents Conformal Alignment, a general framework for identifying units whose outputs meet a user-specified alignment criterion. It is guaranteed that on average, a prescribed fraction of selected units indeed meet the alignment criterion, regardless of the foundation model or the data distribution. Given any pre-trained model and new units with model-generated outputs, Conformal Alignment leverages a set of reference data with ground-truth alignment status to train an alignment predictor. It then selects new units whose predicted alignment scores surpass a data-dependent threshold, certifying their corresponding outputs as trustworthy. Through applications to question answering and radiology report generation, we demonstrate that our method is able to accurately identify units with trustworthy outputs via lightweight training over a moderate amount of reference data. En route, we investigate the informativeness of various features in alignment prediction and combine them with standard models to construct the alignment predictor.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Foundations of Tokenization: Statistical and Computational Concerns](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11606v3)** | 2024-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tokenization - the practice of converting strings of characters from an alphabet into sequences of tokens over a vocabulary - is a critical step in the NLP pipeline. The use of token representations is widely credited with increased model performance but is also the source of many undesirable behaviors, such as spurious ambiguity or inconsistency. Despite its recognized importance as a standard representation method in NLP, the theoretical underpinnings of tokenization are not yet fully understood. In particular, the impact of tokenization on statistical estimation has been investigated mostly through empirical means. The present paper contributes to addressing this theoretical gap by proposing a unified formal framework for representing and analyzing tokenizer models. Based on the category of stochastic maps, this framework enables us to establish general conditions for a principled use of tokenizers, and most importantly, the necessary and sufficient conditions for a tokenizer model to preserve the consistency of statistical estimators. Additionally, we discuss statistical and computational concerns crucial for designing and implementing tokenizer models, such as inconsistency, ambiguity, tractability, and boundedness. The framework and results advanced in this paper contribute to building robust theoretical foundations for representations in neural language modeling that can inform future empirical research.</p></details> |  |

Deep learning has shown promise in exploring these relationships using various data types. However, transcriptomics, which provides detailed insights into cellular states, is still underused due to its high noise levels and limited data availability. Recent advancements in transcriptomics sequencing provide new opportunities to uncover valuable insights, especially with the rise of many new foundation models for transcriptomics, yet no benchmark has been made to robustly evaluate the effectiveness of these rising models for perturbation analysis. This article presents a novel biologically motivated evaluation framework and a hierarchy of perturbation analysis tasks for comparing the performance of pretrained foundation models to each other and to more classical techniques of learning from transcriptomics data. We compile diverse public datasets from different sequencing techniques and cell lines to assess models performance. Our approach identifies scVI and PCA to be far better suited models for understanding biological perturbations in comparison to existing foundation models, especially in their application in real-world scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Neuri...</summary><p>Neurips 2024 AIDrugX Workshop</p></details> |

As foundation models evolve, the demands for agents that can adapt in real-time and process multimodal data have grown. This survey provides a comprehensive review of mobile agent technologies, focusing on recent advancements that enhance real-time adaptability and multimodal interaction. Recent evaluation benchmarks have been developed better to capture the static and interactive environments of mobile tasks, offering more accurate assessments of agents' performance. We then categorize these advancements into two main approaches: prompt-based methods, which utilize large language models (LLMs) for instruction-based task execution, and training-based methods, which fine-tune multimodal models for mobile-specific applications. Additionally, we explore complementary technologies that augment agent performance. By discussing key challenges and outlining future research directions, this survey offers valuable insights for advancing mobile agent technologies.

This exploration is beneficial for finding good loss basins when training from scratch. It is not necessarily ideal when resuming from a powerful foundation model because it can lead to large deviations from the pre-trained initialization and, consequently, worse robustness and generalization. At the same time, strong regularization on all parameters can lead to under-fitting. We hypothesize that selectively regularizing the parameter space is the key to fitting and retraining the pre-trained knowledge. This paper proposes a new weight decay technique, Selective Projection Decay (SPD), that selectively imposes a strong penalty on certain layers while allowing others to change freely. Intuitively, SPD expands and contracts the parameter search space for layers with consistent and inconsistent loss reduction, respectively. Experimentally, when equipped with SPD, Adam consistently provides better in-distribution generalization and out-of-distribution robustness performance on multiple popular vision and language benchmarks.

However, addressing uncertainty in both perception (sensory interpretation) and decision-making (plan generation) remains a critical challenge for ensuring task reliability. We present a comprehensive framework to disentangle, quantify, and mitigate these two forms of uncertainty. We first introduce a framework for uncertainty disentanglement, isolating perception uncertainty arising from limitations in visual understanding and decision uncertainty relating to the robustness of generated plans. To quantify each type of uncertainty, we propose methods tailored to the unique properties of perception and decision-making: we use conformal prediction to calibrate perception uncertainty and introduce Formal-Methods-Driven Prediction (FMDP) to quantify decision uncertainty, leveraging formal verification techniques for theoretical guarantees. Building on this quantification, we implement two targeted intervention mechanisms: an active sensing process that dynamically re-observes high-uncertainty scenes to enhance visual input quality and an automated refinement procedure that fine-tunes the model on high-certainty data, improving its capability to meet task specifications. Empirical validation in real-world and simulated robotic tasks demonstrates that our uncertainty disentanglement framework reduces variability by up to 40% and enhances task success rates by 5% compared to baselines. These improvements are attributed to the combined effect of both interventions and highlight the importance of uncertainty disentanglement which facilitates targeted interventions that enhance the robustness and reliability of autonomous systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Fine-...</summary><p>Fine-tuned models, code, and datasets are available at https://tinyurl.com/uncertainty-disentanglement</p></details> |

Investigating molecular data through multi-omics approaches is crucial for unraveling the complex biological mechanisms underlying cancer, thereby enabling more effective diagnosis, treatment, and prevention strategies. However, predicting patient outcomes through the integration of all available multi-omics data is still an under-study research direction. Here, we present SeNMo, a foundation model that has been trained on multi-omics data across 33 cancer types. SeNMo is particularly efficient in handling multi-omics data characterized by high-width and low-length attributes. We trained SeNMo for the task of overall survival of patients using pan-cancer multi-omics data involving 33 cancer sites from the GDC. The training multi-omics data includes gene expression, DNA methylation, miRNA expression, DNA mutations, protein expression modalities, and clinical data. SeNMo was validated on two independent cohorts: Moffitt Cancer Center and CPTAC lung squamous cell carcinoma. We evaluated the model's performance in predicting patient's overall survival using the C-Index. SeNMo performed consistently well in the training regime, reflected by the validation C-Index of 0.76 on GDC's public data. In the testing regime, SeNMo performed with a C-Index of 0.758 on a held-out test set. The model showed an average accuracy of 99.8% on the task of classifying the primary cancer type on the pan-cancer test cohort. SeNMo demonstrated robust performance on the classification task of predicting the primary cancer type of patients. SeNMo further demonstrated significant performance in predicting tertiary lymph structures from multi-omics data, showing generalizability across cancer types, molecular data types, and clinical endpoints.</p></details> |  |

Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a promising tool for disentangling FM representations, but they struggle to capture rare, yet crucial concepts in the data. We introduce Specialized Sparse Autoencoders (SSAEs), designed to illuminate these elusive dark matter features by focusing on specific subdomains. We present a practical recipe for training SSAEs, demonstrating the efficacy of dense retrieval for data selection and the benefits of Tilted Empirical Risk Minimization as a training objective to improve concept recall. Our evaluation of SSAEs on standard metrics, such as downstream perplexity and $L_0$ sparsity, show that they effectively capture subdomain tail concepts, exceeding the capabilities of general-purpose SAEs. We showcase the practical utility of SSAEs in a case study on the Bias in Bios dataset, where SSAEs achieve a 12.5\% increase in worst-group classification accuracy when applied to remove spurious gender information. SSAEs provide a powerful new lens for peering into the inner workings of FMs in subdomains.</p></details> |  |

Deep SSMs demonstrate outstanding performance across a diverse set of domains, at a reduced training and inference cost compared to attention-based transformers. Recent developments show that if the linear recurrence powering SSMs allows for multiplicative interactions between inputs and hidden states (e.g. GateLoop, Mamba, GLA), then the resulting architecture can surpass in both in accuracy and efficiency attention-powered foundation models trained on text, at scales of billion parameters. In this paper, we give theoretical grounding to this recent finding using tools from Rough Path Theory: we show that when random linear recurrences are equipped with simple input-controlled transitions (selectivity mechanism), then the hidden state is provably a low-dimensional projection of a powerful mathematical object called the signature of the input -- capturing non-linear interactions between tokens at distinct timescales. Our theory not only motivates the success of modern selective state-space models such as Mamba but also provides a solid framework to understand the expressive power of future SSM variants.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS Version w/ minor edits</p></details> |

In this work, we investigate for the first time whether such models are suitable for the specific domain of face recognition. We further propose and demonstrate the adaptation of these models for face recognition across different levels of data availability. Extensive experiments are conducted on multiple foundation models and datasets of varying scales for training and fine-tuning, with evaluation on a wide range of benchmarks. Our results indicate that, despite their versatility, pre-trained foundation models underperform in face recognition compared to similar architectures trained specifically for this task. However, fine-tuning foundation models yields promising results, often surpassing models trained from scratch when training data is limited. Even with access to large-scale face recognition training datasets, fine-tuned foundation models perform comparably to models trained from scratch, but with lower training computational costs and without relying on the assumption of extensive data availability. Our analysis also explores bias in face recognition, with slightly higher bias observed in some settings when using foundation models.</p></details> |  |

Most studies focus on enhancing these models by training on ever-larger datasets to build more powerful foundation models. While training stronger models is important, enabling models to evolve during inference is equally crucial, a process we refer to as AI self-evolution. Unlike large-scale training, self-evolution may rely on limited data or interactions. Inspired by the columnar organization of the human cerebral cortex, we hypothesize that AI models could develop cognitive abilities and build internal representations through iterative interactions with their environment. To achieve this, models need long-term memory (LTM) to store and manage processed interaction data. LTM supports self-evolution by representing diverse experiences across environments and agents. In this report, we explore AI self-evolution and its potential to enhance models during inference. We examine LTM's role in lifelong learning, allowing models to evolve based on accumulated interactions. We outline the structure of LTM and the systems needed for effective data retention and representation. We also classify approaches for building personalized models with LTM data and show how these models achieve self-evolution through interaction.

While TSF methods are emerging these days, many of them require domain-specific data collection and model training and struggle with poor generalization performance on new domains. Foundation models aim to overcome this limitation. Pre-trained on large-scale language or time series data, they exhibit promising inferencing capabilities in new or unseen data. This has spurred a surge in new TSF foundation models. We propose a new benchmark, FoundTS, to enable thorough and fair evaluation and comparison of such models. FoundTS covers a variety of TSF foundation models, including those based on large language models and those pretrained on time series. Next, FoundTS supports different forecasting strategies, including zero-shot, few-shot, and full-shot, thereby facilitating more thorough evaluations. Finally, FoundTS offers a pipeline that standardizes evaluation processes such as dataset splitting, loading, normalization, and few-shot sampling, thereby facilitating fair evaluations. Building on this, we report on an extensive evaluation of TSF foundation models on a broad range of datasets from diverse domains and with different statistical characteristics. Specifically, we identify pros and cons and inherent limitations of existing foundation models, and we identify directions for future model design. We make our code and datasets available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/FoundTS-C2B0.</p></details> |  |
| **[HSIGene: A Foundation Model For Hyperspectral Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12470v2)** | 2024-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hyperspectral image (HSI) plays a vital role in various fields such as agriculture and environmental monitoring. However, due to the expensive acquisition cost, the number of hyperspectral images is limited, degenerating the performance of downstream tasks. Although some recent studies have attempted to employ diffusion models to synthesize HSIs, they still struggle with the scarcity of HSIs, affecting the reliability and diversity of the generated images. Some studies propose to incorporate multi-modal data to enhance spatial diversity, but the spectral fidelity cannot be ensured. In addition, existing HSI synthesis models are typically uncontrollable or only support single-condition control, limiting their ability to generate accurate and reliable HSIs. To alleviate these issues, we propose HSIGene, a novel HSI generation foundation model which is based on latent diffusion and supports multi-condition control, allowing for more precise and reliable HSI generation. To enhance the spatial diversity of the training data while preserving spectral fidelity, we propose a new data augmentation method based on spatial super-resolution, in which HSIs are upscaled first, and thus abundant training patches could be obtained by cropping the high-resolution HSIs. In addition, to improve the perceptual quality of the augmented data, we introduce a novel two-stage HSI super-resolution framework, which first applies RGB bands super-resolution and then utilizes our proposed Rectangular Guided Attention Network (RGAN) for guided HSI super-resolution. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed model is capable of generating a vast quantity of realistic HSIs for downstream tasks such as denoising and super-resolution. The code and models are available at https://github.com/LiPang/HSIGene.</p></details> |  |

SpineFM leverages the regular geometry of the spine, employing a novel inductive process to sequentially infer the location of each vertebra along the spinal column. Vertebrae are segmented using Medical-SAM-Adaptor, a robust foundation model that diverges from commonly used CNN-based models. We achieved outstanding results on two publicly available spine X-Ray datasets, with successful identification of 97.8\% and 99.6\% of annotated vertebrae, respectively. Of which, our segmentation reached an average Dice of 0.942 and 0.921, surpassing previous state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 pag...</summary><p>4 pages, 3 figures, submitted to ISBI 2025</p></details> |
| **[Uni-Med: A Unified Medical Generalist Foundation Model For Multi-Task Learning Via Connector-MoE](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17508v2)** | 2024-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have shown impressive capabilities as a general-purpose interface for various visual and linguistic tasks. However, building a unified MLLM for multi-task learning in the medical field remains a thorny challenge. To mitigate the tug-of-war problem of multi-modal multi-task optimization in MLLMs, recent advances primarily focus on improving the LLM components, while neglecting the connector that bridges the gap between modalities. In this paper, we introduce Uni-Med, a novel medical generalist foundation model which consists of a universal visual feature extraction module, a connector mixture-of-experts (CMoE) module, and an LLM. Benefiting from the proposed CMoE that leverages a well-designed router with a mixture of projection experts at the connector, Uni-Med achieves efficient solution to the tug-of-war problem and can perform six different medical tasks including question answering, visual question answering, report generation, referring expression comprehension, referring expression generation and image classification. To the best of our knowledge, Uni-Med is the first effort to tackle multi-task interference at the connector in MLLMs. Extensive ablation experiments validate the effectiveness of introducing CMoE under any configuration, with up to an average 8% performance gains. We further provide interpretation analysis of the tug-of-war problem from the perspective of gradient optimization and parameter statistics. Compared to previous state-of-the-art medical MLLMs, Uni-Med achieves competitive or superior evaluation metrics on diverse tasks.

| **[Prompt Tuning Strikes Back: Customizing Foundation Models with Low-Rank Prompt Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15282v2)** | 2024-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) has become the standard for customising Foundation Models (FMs) to user-specific downstream tasks. However, typical PEFT methods require storing multiple task-specific adapters, creating scalability issues as these adapters must be housed and run at the FM server. Traditional prompt tuning offers a potential solution by customising them through task-specific input prefixes, but it under-performs compared to other PEFT methods like LoRA. To address this gap, we propose Low-Rank Prompt Adaptation (LoPA), a prompt-tuning-based approach that performs on par with state-of-the-art PEFT methods and full fine-tuning while being more parameter-efficient and not requiring a server-based adapter. LoPA generates soft prompts by balancing between sharing task-specific information across instances and customization for each instance. It uses a low-rank decomposition of the soft-prompt component encoded for each instance to achieve parameter efficiency. We provide a comprehensive evaluation on multiple natural language understanding and code generation and understanding tasks across a wide range of foundation models with varying sizes.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 8 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

However, its potential is limited by the sheer volume of images generated during the imaging procedure, which can take anywhere from 6-8 hours and often produce up to 1 million images, necessitating automated analysis. Additionally, the variability of these images, combined with the need for expert annotations and the scarcity of large, high-quality labeled datasets, constrains the effectiveness of current medical image analysis models. To address this, we introduce a novel large gastrointestinal endoscopy dataset, called EndoExtend24, created by merging and re-stratifying the train/test splits of ten existing public and private datasets, ensuring no overlap of patient data across splits. EndoExtend24 includes over 226,000 labeled images, as well as dynamic class mappings, which allow unified training across datasets with differing labeling granularity, supporting up to 123 distinct pathological findings. Further, we propose to leverage domain adaptive pre-training of foundation models in computer vision trained with self-supervision on generic image data, to adapt them to the task of GIE medical diagnosis. Specifically, the EVA-02 model, which is based on the vision transformer architecture and was trained on ImageNet-22k with masked image modeling (using EVA-CLIP as a MIM teacher), is pre-trained on the novel EndoExtend24 dataset to achieve domain adaptation, and finally trained on the Capsule Endoscopy 2024 Challenge dataset. Experimental results demonstrate strong performance with an F1 score of 0.88, an improvement of about 39% over the baseline model's F1 score of 0.49. Additionally, the model achieved a macro AUC score of 0.993 and a balanced accuracy of 89.3%.</p></details> |  |
| **[Probabilistic Conceptual Explainers: Trustworthy Conceptual Explanations for Vision Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12649v3)** | 2024-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision transformers (ViTs) have emerged as a significant area of focus, particularly for their capacity to be jointly trained with large language models and to serve as robust vision foundation models. Yet, the development of trustworthy explanation methods for ViTs has lagged, particularly in the context of post-hoc interpretations of ViT predictions. Existing sub-image selection approaches, such as feature-attribution and conceptual models, fall short in this regard. This paper proposes five desiderata for explaining ViTs -- faithfulness, stability, sparsity, multi-level structure, and parsimony -- and demonstrates the inadequacy of current methods in meeting these criteria comprehensively. We introduce a variational Bayesian explanation framework, dubbed ProbAbilistic Concept Explainers (PACE), which models the distributions of patch embeddings to provide trustworthy post-hoc conceptual explanations. Our qualitative analysis reveals the distributions of patch-level concepts, elucidating the effectiveness of ViTs by modeling the joint distribution of patch embeddings and ViT's predictions. Moreover, these patch-level explanations bridge the gap between image-level and dataset-level explanations, thus completing the multi-level structure of PACE. Through extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets, we demonstrate that PACE surpasses state-of-the-art methods in terms of the defined desiderata.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proce...</summary><p>Proceedings of the 41st International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2024)</p></details> |

Evaluating Cell AI Foundation Models in Kidney Pathology with Human-in-the-Loop Enrichment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00078v1)** | 2024-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training AI foundation models has emerged as a promising large-scale learning approach for addressing real-world healthcare challenges, including digital pathology. While many of these models have been developed for tasks like disease diagnosis and tissue quantification using extensive and diverse training datasets, their readiness for deployment on some arguably simplest tasks, such as nuclei segmentation within a single organ (e.g., the kidney), remains uncertain. This paper seeks to answer this key question, "How good are we?", by thoroughly evaluating the performance of recent cell foundation models on a curated multi-center, multi-disease, and multi-species external testing dataset. Additionally, we tackle a more challenging question, "How can we improve?", by developing and assessing human-in-the-loop data enrichment strategies aimed at enhancing model performance while minimizing the reliance on pixel-level human annotation. To address the first question, we curated a multicenter, multidisease, and multispecies dataset consisting of 2,542 kidney whole slide images (WSIs). Three state-of-the-art (SOTA) cell foundation models-Cellpose, StarDist, and CellViT-were selected for evaluation. To tackle the second question, we explored data enrichment algorithms by distilling predictions from the different foundation models with a human-in-the-loop framework, aiming to further enhance foundation model performance with minimal human efforts. Our experimental results showed that all three foundation models improved over their baselines with model fine-tuning with enriched data. Interestingly, the baseline model with the highest F1 score does not yield the best segmentation outcomes after fine-tuning. This study establishes a benchmark for the development and deployment of cell vision foundation models tailored for real-world data applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[In-Context Fine-Tuning for Time-Series Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24087v1)** | 2024-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motivated by the recent success of time-series foundation models for zero-shot forecasting, we present a methodology for $\textit{in-context fine-tuning}$ of a time-series foundation model. In particular, we design a pretrained foundation model that can be prompted (at inference time) with multiple time-series examples, in order to forecast a target time-series into the future. Our foundation model is specifically trained to utilize examples from multiple related time-series in its context window (in addition to the history of the target time-series) to help it adapt to the specific distribution of the target domain at inference time. We show that such a foundation model that uses in-context examples at inference time can obtain much better performance on popular forecasting benchmarks compared to supervised deep learning methods, statistical models, as well as other time-series foundation models. Interestingly, our in-context fine-tuning approach even rivals the performance of a foundation model that is explicitly fine-tuned on the target domain.</p></details> |  |

Despite the substantial domain gaps in RS images that are characterized by variabilities such as location, wavelength, and sensor type, research in this area remains underexplored: (1) Current cross-domain methods primarily focus on Domain Adaptation (DA), which adapts models to predefined domains rather than to unseen ones; (2) Few studies targeting the RSDG issue, especially for semantic segmentation tasks, where existing models are developed for specific unknown domains, struggling with issues of underfitting on other unknown scenarios; (3) Existing RS foundation models tend to prioritize in-domain performance over cross-domain generalization. To this end, we introduce the first vision foundation model for RSDG semantic segmentation, CrossEarth. CrossEarth demonstrates strong cross-domain generalization through a specially designed data-level Earth-Style Injection pipeline and a model-level Multi-Task Training pipeline. In addition, for the semantic segmentation task, we have curated an RSDG benchmark comprising 28 cross-domain settings across various regions, spectral bands, platforms, and climates, providing a comprehensive framework for testing the generalizability of future RSDG models. Extensive experiments on this benchmark demonstrate the superiority of CrossEarth over existing state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>The c...</summary><p>The codes and models will be available at https://github.com/Cuzyoung/CrossEarth</p></details> |

While the emergence of large language models (LLMs) and multimodal large language models (MM-LLMs) propels advancements in artificial general intelligence through their versatile capabilities, they still lack true any-to-any understanding and generation. Recently, the release of GPT-4o has showcased the remarkable potential of any-to-any LLMs for complex real-world tasks, enabling omnidirectional input and output across images, speech, and text. However, it is closed-source and does not support the generation of multimodal interleaved sequences. To address this gap, we present MIO, which is trained on a mixture of discrete tokens across four modalities using causal multimodal modeling. MIO undergoes a four-stage training process: (1) alignment pre-training, (2) interleaved pre-training, (3) speech-enhanced pre-training, and (4) comprehensive supervised fine-tuning on diverse textual, visual, and speech tasks. Our experimental results indicate that MIO exhibits competitive, and in some cases superior, performance compared to previous dual-modal baselines, any-to-any model baselines, and even modality-specific baselines. Moreover, MIO demonstrates advanced capabilities inherent to its any-to-any feature, such as interleaved video-text generation, chain-of-visual-thought reasoning, visual guideline generation, instructional image editing, etc.</p></details> | <details><summary>Techn...</summary><p>Technical Report.

In real-world environments, the object detection and segmentation performance can lead to a major drop, preventing the use of semantic mapping in a wider domain. On the other hand, the development of vision-language foundation models demonstrates a strong zero-shot transferability across data distribution. It provides an opportunity to construct generalizable instance-aware semantic maps. Hence, this work explores how to boost instance-aware semantic mapping from object detection generated from foundation models. We propose a probabilistic label fusion method to predict close-set semantic classes from open-set label measurements. An instance refinement module merges the over-segmented instances caused by inconsistent segmentation. We integrate all the modules into a unified semantic mapping system. Reading a sequence of RGB-D input, our work incrementally reconstructs an instance-aware semantic map. We evaluate the zero-shot performance of our method in ScanNet and SceneNN datasets. Our method achieves 40.3 mean average precision (mAP) on the ScanNet semantic instance segmentation task. It outperforms the traditional semantic mapping method significantly.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in IEEE RAL</p></details> |

Our method is a generalizable feedforward model that predicts a rich neural scene representation from sparse, single-frame multi-view camera inputs with limited view overlap, and is trained self-supervised with differentiable rendering to reconstruct RGB, depth, or feature images. Our first insight is to exploit per-scene optimized Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) by generating dense depth and virtual camera targets from them, which helps our model to learn enhanced 3D geometry from sparse non-overlapping image inputs. Second, to learn a semantically rich 3D representation, we propose distilling features from pre-trained 2D foundation models, such as CLIP or DINOv2, thereby enabling various downstream tasks without the need for costly 3D human annotations. To leverage these two insights, we introduce a novel model architecture with a two-stage lift-splat-shoot encoder and a parameterized sparse hierarchical voxel representation. Experimental results on the NuScenes and Waymo NOTR datasets demonstrate that DistillNeRF significantly outperforms existing comparable state-of-the-art self-supervised methods for scene reconstruction, novel view synthesis, and depth estimation; and it allows for competitive zero-shot 3D semantic occupancy prediction, as well as open-world scene understanding through distilled foundation model features.

Reinforcement learning (RL) is hard to scale up as it requires a complex reward design for each task. In contrast, language can specify tasks in a more natural way. Current foundation vision-language models (VLMs) generally require fine-tuning or other adaptations to be adopted in embodied contexts, due to the significant domain gap. However, the lack of multimodal data in such domains represents an obstacle to developing foundation models for embodied applications. In this work, we overcome these problems by presenting multimodal-foundation world models, able to connect and align the representation of foundation VLMs with the latent space of generative world models for RL, without any language annotations. The resulting agent learning framework, GenRL, allows one to specify tasks through vision and/or language prompts, ground them in the embodied domain's dynamics, and learn the corresponding behaviors in imagination. As assessed through large-scale multi-task benchmarking in locomotion and manipulation domains, GenRL enables multi-task generalization from language and visual prompts. Furthermore, by introducing a data-free policy learning strategy, our approach lays the groundwork for foundational policy learning using generative world models.

Although medical foundation models have emerged, solutions for cardiac imaging, especially echocardiography videos, are still unexplored. In this paper, we introduce EchoFM, a foundation model specifically designed to represent and analyze echocardiography videos. In EchoFM, we propose a self-supervised learning framework that captures both spatial and temporal variability patterns through a spatio-temporal consistent masking strategy and periodic-driven contrastive learning. This framework can effectively capture the spatio-temporal dynamics of echocardiography and learn the representative video features without any labels. We pre-train our model on an extensive dataset comprising over 290,000 echocardiography videos covering 26 scan views across different imaging modes, with up to 20 million frames of images. The pre-trained EchoFM can then be easily adapted and fine-tuned for a variety of downstream tasks, serving as a robust backbone model. Our evaluation was systemically designed for four downstream tasks after the echocardiography examination routine. Experiment results show that EchoFM surpasses state-of-the-art methods, including specialized echocardiography methods, self-supervised pre-training models, and general-purposed pre-trained foundation models, across all downstream tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, how well do the models truly perform visual temporal reasoning? Our study of existing benchmarks shows that this capability of MFMs is likely overestimated as many questions can be solved by using a single, few, or out-of-order frames. To systematically examine current visual temporal reasoning tasks, we propose three principles with corresponding metrics: (1) Multi-Frame Gain, (2) Frame Order Sensitivity, and (3) Frame Information Disparity. Following these principles, we introduce TOMATO, Temporal Reasoning Multimodal Evaluation, a novel benchmark crafted to rigorously assess MFMs' temporal reasoning capabilities in video understanding. TOMATO comprises 1,484 carefully curated, human-annotated questions spanning six tasks (i.e., action count, direction, rotation, shape & trend, velocity & frequency, and visual cues), applied to 1,417 videos, including 805 self-recorded and -generated videos, that encompass human-centric, real-world, and simulated scenarios. Our comprehensive evaluation reveals a human-model performance gap of 57.3% with the best-performing model. Moreover, our in-depth analysis uncovers more fundamental limitations beyond this gap in current MFMs. While they can accurately recognize events in isolated frames, they fail to interpret these frames as a continuous sequence. We believe TOMATO will serve as a crucial testbed for evaluating the next-generation MFMs and as a call to the community to develop AI systems capable of comprehending human world dynamics through the video modality.</p></details> |  |
| **[Partial Channel Dependence with Channel Masks for Time Series Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23222v1)** | 2024-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in foundation models have been successfully extended to the time series (TS) domain, facilitated by the emergence of large-scale TS datasets. However, previous efforts have primarily focused on designing model architectures to address explicit heterogeneity among datasets such as various numbers of channels, while often overlooking implicit heterogeneity such as varying dependencies between channels. In this work, we introduce the concept of partial channel dependence (PCD), which enables a more sophisticated adjustment of channel dependencies based on dataset-specific information. To achieve PCD, we propose a channel mask that captures the relationships between channels within a dataset using two key components: 1) a correlation matrix that encodes relative dependencies between channels, and 2) domain parameters that learn the absolute dependencies specific to each dataset, refining the correlation matrix. We validate the effectiveness of PCD across four tasks in TS including forecasting, classification, imputation, and anomaly detection, under diverse settings, including few-shot and zero-shot scenarios with both TS foundation models and single-task models.

Practitioners are often reluctant to use open-source VLMs due to their significant performance lag compared to their closed-source counterparts, particularly in GUI grounding and Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) scenarios. To facilitate future research in this area, we developed OS-Atlas - a foundational GUI action model that excels at GUI grounding and OOD agentic tasks through innovations in both data and modeling. We have invested significant engineering effort in developing an open-source toolkit for synthesizing GUI grounding data across multiple platforms, including Windows, Linux, MacOS, Android, and the web. Leveraging this toolkit, we are releasing the largest open-source cross-platform GUI grounding corpus to date, which contains over 13 million GUI elements. This dataset, combined with innovations in model training, provides a solid foundation for OS-Atlas to understand GUI screenshots and generalize to unseen interfaces. Through extensive evaluation across six benchmarks spanning three different platforms (mobile, desktop, and web), OS-Atlas demonstrates significant performance improvements over previous state-of-the-art models. Our evaluation also uncovers valuable insights into continuously improving and scaling the agentic capabilities of open-source VLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Source Code Foundation Models are Transferable Binary Analysis Knowledge Bases](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19581v2)** | 2024-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human-Oriented Binary Reverse Engineering (HOBRE) lies at the intersection of binary and source code, aiming to lift binary code to human-readable content relevant to source code, thereby bridging the binary-source semantic gap. Recent advancements in uni-modal code model pre-training, particularly in generative Source Code Foundation Models (SCFMs) and binary understanding models, have laid the groundwork for transfer learning applicable to HOBRE. However, existing approaches for HOBRE rely heavily on uni-modal models like SCFMs for supervised fine-tuning or general LLMs for prompting, resulting in sub-optimal performance. Inspired by recent progress in large multi-modal models, we propose that it is possible to harness the strengths of uni-modal code models from both sides to bridge the semantic gap effectively. In this paper, we introduce a novel probe-and-recover framework that incorporates a binary-source encoder-decoder model and black-box LLMs for binary analysis. Our approach leverages the pre-trained knowledge within SCFMs to synthesize relevant, symbol-rich code fragments as context. This additional context enables black-box LLMs to enhance recovery accuracy. We demonstrate significant improvements in zero-shot binary summarization and binary function name recovery, with a 10.3% relative gain in CHRF and a 16.7% relative gain in a GPT4-based metric for summarization, as well as a 6.7% and 7.4% absolute increase in token-level precision and recall for name recovery, respectively. These results highlight the effectiveness of our approach in automating and improving binary code analysis.</p></details> |  |

Temporal search trends have been successfully used in time series modeling across a variety of domains such as infectious diseases, unemployment rates, and retail sales. However, most existing applications require curating specialized datasets of individual keywords, queries, or query clusters, and the search data need to be temporally aligned with the outcome variable of interest. We propose a novel approach for generating an aggregated and anonymized representation of search interest as foundation features at the community level for geospatial modeling. We benchmark these features using spatial datasets across multiple domains. In zip codes with a population greater than 3000 that cover over 95% of the contiguous US population, our models for predicting missing values in a 20% set of holdout counties achieve an average $R^2$ score of 0.74 across 21 health variables, and 0.80 across 6 demographic and environmental variables. Our results demonstrate that these search features can be used for spatial predictions without strict temporal alignment, and that the resulting models outperform spatial interpolation and state of the art methods using satellite imagery features.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 8 figures, presented at the DMLR workshop at ICML 2024</p></details> |
| **[Meta-Learning Adaptable Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22264v1)** | 2024-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The power of foundation models (FMs) lies in their capacity to learn highly expressive representations that can be adapted to a broad spectrum of tasks. However, these pretrained models require multiple stages of fine-tuning to become effective for downstream applications. Conventionally, the model is first retrained on the aggregate of a diverse set of tasks of interest and then adapted to specific low-resource downstream tasks by utilizing a parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) scheme. While this two-phase procedure seems reasonable, the independence of the retraining and fine-tuning phases causes a major issue, as there is no guarantee the retrained model will achieve good performance post-fine-tuning. To explicitly address this issue, we introduce a meta-learning framework infused with PEFT in this intermediate retraining stage to learn a model that can be easily adapted to unseen tasks. For our theoretical results, we focus on linear models using low-rank adaptations. In this setting, we demonstrate the suboptimality of standard retraining for finding an adaptable set of parameters. Further, we prove that our method recovers the optimally adaptable parameters. We then apply these theoretical insights to retraining the RoBERTa model to predict the continuation of conversations between different personas within the ConvAI2 dataset. Empirically, we observe significant performance benefits using our proposed meta-learning scheme during retraining relative to the conventional approach.</p></details> | Preprint |

However, current TAG approaches face two primary challenges: (i) Heavy reliance on label information and (ii) Limited cross-domain zero/few-shot transferability. These issues constrain the scaling of both data and model size, owing to high labor costs and scaling laws, complicating the development of graph foundation models with strong transferability. In this work, we propose the GraphCLIP framework to address these challenges by learning graph foundation models with strong cross-domain zero/few-shot transferability through a self-supervised contrastive graph-summary pretraining method. Specifically, we generate and curate large-scale graph-summary pair data with the assistance of LLMs, and introduce a novel graph-summary pretraining method, combined with invariant learning, to enhance graph foundation models with strong cross-domain zero-shot transferability. For few-shot learning, we propose a novel graph prompt tuning technique aligned with our pretraining objective to mitigate catastrophic forgetting and minimize learning costs. Extensive experiments show the superiority of GraphCLIP in both zero-shot and few-shot settings, while evaluations across various downstream tasks confirm the versatility of GraphCLIP.

While depth and normal are geometrically related and highly complimentary, they present distinct challenges. SoTA monocular depth methods achieve zero-shot generalization by learning affine-invariant depths, which cannot recover real-world metrics. Meanwhile, SoTA normal estimation methods have limited zero-shot performance due to the lack of large-scale labeled data. To tackle these issues, we propose solutions for both metric depth estimation and surface normal estimation. For metric depth estimation, we show that the key to a zero-shot single-view model lies in resolving the metric ambiguity from various camera models and large-scale data training. We propose a canonical camera space transformation module, which explicitly addresses the ambiguity problem and can be effortlessly plugged into existing monocular models. For surface normal estimation, we propose a joint depth-normal optimization module to distill diverse data knowledge from metric depth, enabling normal estimators to learn beyond normal labels. Equipped with these modules, our depth-normal models can be stably trained with over 16 million of images from thousands of camera models with different-type annotations, resulting in zero-shot generalization to in-the-wild images with unseen camera settings. Our method enables the accurate recovery of metric 3D structures on randomly collected internet images, paving the way for plausible single-image metrology.

In the medical domain, however, the development of comprehensive foundation models is constrained by limited access to diverse modalities and stringent privacy regulations. To address these constraints, this study introduces a novel knowledge injection approach, FedKIM, designed to scale the medical foundation model within a federated learning framework. FedKIM leverages lightweight local models to extract healthcare knowledge from private data and integrates this knowledge into a centralized foundation model using a designed adaptive Multitask Multimodal Mixture Of Experts (M3OE) module. This method not only preserves privacy but also enhances the model's ability to handle complex medical tasks involving multiple modalities. Our extensive experiments across twelve tasks in seven modalities demonstrate the effectiveness of FedKIM in various settings, highlighting its potential to scale medical foundation models without direct access to sensitive data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by EMNLP'24 Main</p></details> |

With the advent of foundation models (FMs), contemporary segmentation methodologies have embarked on a new epoch by either adapting FMs (e.g., CLIP, Stable Diffusion, DINO) for image segmentation or developing dedicated segmentation foundation models (e.g., SAM). These approaches not only deliver superior segmentation performance, but also herald newfound segmentation capabilities previously unseen in deep learning context. However, current research in image segmentation lacks a detailed analysis of distinct characteristics, challenges, and solutions associated with these advancements. This survey seeks to fill this gap by providing a thorough review of cutting-edge research centered around FM-driven image segmentation. We investigate two basic lines of research -- generic image segmentation (i.e., semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, panoptic segmentation), and promptable image segmentation (i.e., interactive segmentation, referring segmentation, few-shot segmentation) -- by delineating their respective task settings, background concepts, and key challenges. Furthermore, we provide insights into the emergence of segmentation knowledge from FMs like CLIP, Stable Diffusion, and DINO. An exhaustive overview of over 300 segmentation approaches is provided to encapsulate the breadth of current research efforts. Subsequently, we engage in a discussion of open issues and potential avenues for future research. We envisage that this fresh, comprehensive, and systematic survey catalyzes the evolution of advanced image segmentation systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>A com...</summary><p>A comprehensive survey of image segmentation in foundation model era</p></details> |

We compare 13 feature extractor models, including ImageNet-pretrained networks, and histopathology foundation models trained on both public and proprietary data, on Rheumatoid Arthritis subtyping and Sjogren's Disease detection tasks. Using a simple Attention-Based Multiple Instance Learning classifier, we assess the transferability of learned representations from cancer H&E images to autoimmune IHC images. Contrary to expectations, histopathology-pretrained models did not significantly outperform ImageNet-pretrained models. Furthermore, there was evidence of both autoimmune feature misinterpretation and biased feature importance. Our findings highlight the challenges in transferring knowledge from cancer to autoimmune histopathology and emphasise the need for careful evaluation of AI models across diverse histopathological tasks.

| **[Variational Language Concepts for Interpreting Foundation Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03964v2)** | 2024-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation Language Models (FLMs) such as BERT and its variants have achieved remarkable success in natural language processing. To date, the interpretability of FLMs has primarily relied on the attention weights in their self-attention layers. However, these attention weights only provide word-level interpretations, failing to capture higher-level structures, and are therefore lacking in readability and intuitiveness. To address this challenge, we first provide a formal definition of conceptual interpretation and then propose a variational Bayesian framework, dubbed VAriational Language Concept (VALC), to go beyond word-level interpretations and provide concept-level interpretations. Our theoretical analysis shows that our VALC finds the optimal language concepts to interpret FLM predictions. Empirical results on several real-world datasets show that our method can successfully provide conceptual interpretation for FLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at EMNLP 2024 Findings</p></details> |
| **[Quantum Spread-Spectrum CDMA Communication Systems: Mathematical Foundations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21450v1)** | 2024-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper describes the fundamental principles and mathematical foundations of quantum spread spectrum code division multiple access (QCDMA) communication systems. The evolution of quantum signals through the direct-sequence spread spectrum multiple access communication system is carefully characterized by a novel approach called the decomposition of creation operators. In this methodology, the creation operator of the transmitted quantum signal is decomposed into the chip-time interval creation operators each of which is defined over the duration of a chip. These chip-time interval creation operators are the invariant building blocks of the spread spectrum quantum communication systems. With the aid of the proposed chip-time decomposition approach, we can find closed-form relations for quantum signals at the receiver of such a quantum communication system. Further, the paper details the principles of narrow-band filtering of quantum signals required at the receiver, a crucial step in designing and analyzing quantum communication systems. We show that by employing coherent states as the transmitted quantum signals, the inter-user interference appears as an additive term in the magnitude of the output coherent (Glauber) state, and the output of the quantum communication system is a pure quantum signal. On the other hand, if the transmitters utilize particle-like quantum signals (Fock states) such as single photon states, entanglement and a spread spectrum version of the Hong-Ou-Mandel effect can arise at the receivers. The important techniques developed in this paper are expected to have far-reaching implications for various applications in the exciting field of quantum communication and signal processing.</p></details> |  |

However, traditional AI methods often rely on task-specific model designs and training, which constrain both the scalability of model size and generalization across different tasks. Here, we introduce ChemFM, a large-scale foundation model specifically developed for chemistry, comprising up to 3 billion parameters. ChemFM is pre-trained on 178 million molecules using self-supervised causal language modeling to extract generalizable molecular representations. This model can be adapted to diverse downstream chemical applications using both full-parameter and parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods. ChemFM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across multiple chemical tasks. Notably, it achieves up to 67.48% performance improvement across 34 property prediction benchmarks, up to 33.31% reduction in mean average deviation between conditioned and actual properties of generated molecules in conditional molecular generation tasks, and up to 3.7% top-1 accuracy improvement across 4 reaction prediction datasets. Moreover, ChemFM demonstrates superior performance in predicting antibiotic activity and cytotoxicity, highlighting its potential to advance the discovery of novel antibiotics. We anticipate that ChemFM will significantly advance chemistry research by providing a foundation model capable of effectively generalizing across a broad range of tasks with minimal additional training.</p></details> |  |

While foundation models excel at acquiring human knowledge, they often struggle with decision-making in dynamic real-world environments, limiting their progress toward artificial general intelligence. This limitation underscores the importance of developing foundation agents capable of learning through autonomous environmental interactions by reinforcing existing models. Focusing on Web Browser and Phone as representative GUI scenarios, we have developed AutoGLM as a practical foundation agent system for real-world GUI interactions. Our approach integrates a comprehensive suite of techniques and infrastructures to create deployable agent systems suitable for user delivery. Through this development, we have derived two key insights: First, the design of an appropriate "intermediate interface" for GUI control is crucial, enabling the separation of planning and grounding behaviors, which require distinct optimization for flexibility and accuracy respectively. Second, we have developed a novel progressive training framework that enables self-evolving online curriculum reinforcement learning for AutoGLM. Our evaluations demonstrate AutoGLM's effectiveness across multiple domains. For web browsing, AutoGLM achieves a 55.2% success rate on VAB-WebArena-Lite (improving to 59.1% with a second attempt) and 96.2% on OpenTable evaluation tasks. In Android device control, AutoGLM attains a 36.2% success rate on AndroidLab (VAB-Mobile) and 89.7% on common tasks in popular Chinese APPs.</p></details> |  |

Our approach introduces a multi-expert decision framework to address the nonsensical or irrelevant reasoning often seen in foundation model-based systems. The method comprises two key components: Diversified Expert Frontier Analysis (DEFA) and Consensus Decision Making (CDM). DEFA utilizes three expert models: furniture arrangement, room type analysis, and visual scene reasoning, while CDM aggregates their outputs, prioritizing unanimous or majority consensus for more reliable decisions.

Foundation models, pre-trained on vast and varied datasets, can be used in a zero-shot setting with relatively minimal data or further improved through finetuning. We compare the performance of Google's model, called TimesFM, against conventional parametric and non-parametric models, including GARCH, Generalized Autoregressive Score (GAS), and empirical quantile estimates, using daily returns from the S\&P 100 index and its constituents over 19 years. Our backtesting results indicate that in terms of the actual-over-expected ratio the fine-tuned TimesFM model consistently outperforms traditional methods. Regarding the quantile score loss function, it achieves performance comparable to the best econometric approach, the GAS model. Overall, the foundation model is either the best or among the top performers in forecasting VaR across the 0.01, 0.025, 0.05, and 0.1 VaR levels. We also found that fine-tuning significantly improves the results, and the model should not be used in zero-shot settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Lotus: Diffusion-based Visual Foundation Model for High-quality Dense Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18124v4)** | 2024-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Leveraging the visual priors of pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models offers a promising solution to enhance zero-shot generalization in dense prediction tasks. However, existing methods often uncritically use the original diffusion formulation, which may not be optimal due to the fundamental differences between dense prediction and image generation. In this paper, we provide a systemic analysis of the diffusion formulation for the dense prediction, focusing on both quality and efficiency. And we find that the original parameterization type for image generation, which learns to predict noise, is harmful for dense prediction; the multi-step noising/denoising diffusion process is also unnecessary and challenging to optimize. Based on these insights, we introduce Lotus, a diffusion-based visual foundation model with a simple yet effective adaptation protocol for dense prediction. Specifically, Lotus is trained to directly predict annotations instead of noise, thereby avoiding harmful variance. We also reformulate the diffusion process into a single-step procedure, simplifying optimization and significantly boosting inference speed. Additionally, we introduce a novel tuning strategy called detail preserver, which achieves more accurate and fine-grained predictions. Without scaling up the training data or model capacity, Lotus achieves SoTA performance in zero-shot depth and normal estimation across various datasets. It also enhances efficiency, being significantly faster than most existing diffusion-based methods. Lotus' superior quality and efficiency also enable a wide range of practical applications, such as joint estimation, single/multi-view 3D reconstruction, etc. Project page: https://lotus3d.github.io/.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The first two authors contributed equally.

Such Lie symmetry groups uniquely determine their Lie symmetry algebras. Exact differential elimination algorithms have been developed to determine the dimension and structure constants of the Lie symmetry algebra of an exact polynomially nonlinear differential equation. Directly applying these symbolic algorithms to approximate models is prone to instability since these algorithms strongly depend on the orderings of the variables involved. This motivates the need to address questions at the algorithmic foundation of approximate Lie symmetry algebras of differential equations. How do we define approximate Lie symmetry? How do we compute and apply approximate Lie symmetry algebras of differential equations? How reliable are the results? To address such questions, we define approximate Lie symmetry algebras in terms of exact Lie symmetry algebras of a nearby differential equation. Our algorithm for identifying these hidden approximate Lie symmetry algebras uses the SVD to find nearby rank-deficient systems combined with approximate geometric involutive forms of the approximate symmetry-defining systems. Our approach is local and depends on an input base point in the space of independent and dependent variables. In general, our local approach can yield many different nearby Lie symmetry algebras. We also outline a numerical approach to determining the approximate isomorphic of such Lie symmetry algebras as the local base point varies across a grid in the base space. We also provide a method for evaluating the reliability of our results. This enables the base space to be partitioned into regions where different local Lie symmetry algebras are admitted, separated by unstable transition regions.</p></details> |  |

Current machine learning models trained on PPG signals are mostly task-specific and lack generalizability. Previous works often used single-device datasets, did not explore out-of-domain generalization, or did not release their models, hindering reproducibility and further research. We introduce PaPaGei, the first open foundation model for PPG signals. PaPaGei is pre-trained on more than 57,000 hours of 20 million unlabeled segments of PPG signals using publicly available datasets exclusively. We evaluate against popular time-series foundation models and other benchmarks on 20 tasks of 10 diverse datasets spanning cardiovascular health, sleep disorders, pregnancy monitoring, and wellbeing assessment. Our architecture incorporates novel representation learning approaches that leverage differences in PPG signal morphology across individuals, enabling it to capture richer representations than traditional contrastive learning methods. Across 20 tasks, PaPaGei improves classification and regression performance by an average of 6.3% and 2.9%, respectively, compared to other competitive time-series foundation models in at least 14 tasks. PaPaGei is more data- and parameter-efficient than other foundation models or methods, as it outperforms 70x larger models. Beyond accuracy, we also investigate robustness against different skin tones, establishing a benchmark for bias evaluations of future models. Notably, PaPaGei can be used out of the box as both a feature extractor and an encoder for other multimodal models, opening up new opportunities for multimodal health monitoring</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code and models: https://github.com/nokia-bell-labs/papagei-foundation-model</p></details> |

Moreover, robot policies that follow natural language instructions are typically trained on either templated language or expensive human-labeled instructions, hindering their scalability. To this end, we introduce NILS: Natural language Instruction Labeling for Scalability. NILS automatically labels uncurated, long-horizon robot data at scale in a zero-shot manner without any human intervention. NILS combines pretrained vision-language foundation models in order to detect objects in a scene, detect object-centric changes, segment tasks from large datasets of unlabelled interaction data and ultimately label behavior datasets. Evaluations on BridgeV2, Fractal, and a kitchen play dataset show that NILS can autonomously annotate diverse robot demonstrations of unlabeled and unstructured datasets while alleviating several shortcomings of crowdsourced human annotations, such as low data quality and diversity. We use NILS to label over 115k trajectories obtained from over 430 hours of robot data.

Meanwhile, recent breakthroughs in large Foundation Models (FMs) have expanded AI's potential across many domains due to their exceptional generalizability and zero-shot transfer capabilities. However, their success has largely been confined to natural data like images and video, with degraded performance and even failures for RS data of various non-optical modalities. This has inspired growing interest in developing Remote Sensing Foundation Models (RSFMs) to address the complex demands of Earth Observation (EO) tasks, spanning the surface, atmosphere, and oceans. This survey systematically reviews the emerging field of RSFMs. It begins with an outline of their motivation and background, followed by an introduction of their foundational concepts.

Moreover, we discuss construction of a novel TIU pretraining dataset, model initialization, with data and pretrained models intended for public release. By discussing technical challenges and details often lacking in the related literature, this work is intended to offer best practices to the geospatial community toward efficient training and benchmarking of larger FMs.</p></details> |  |

Molecular representation is key to building such models. Previous works have typically focused on a single representation or view of the molecules. Here, we develop a multi-view foundation model approach, that integrates molecular views of graph, image and text. Single-view foundation models are each pre-trained on a dataset of up to 200M molecules and then aggregated into combined representations. Our multi-view model is validated on a diverse set of 18 tasks, encompassing ligand-protein binding, molecular solubility, metabolism and toxicity. We show that the multi-view models perform robustly and are able to balance the strengths and weaknesses of specific views. We then apply this model to screen compounds against a large (>100 targets) set of G Protein-Coupled receptors (GPCRs). From this library of targets, we identify 33 that are related to Alzheimer's disease. On this subset, we employ our model to identify strong binders, which are validated through structure-based modeling and identification of key binding motifs.</p></details> | <details><summary>34 pa...</summary><p>34 pages including supplement. 9 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

However, their application on object detection is largely overlooked, especially without fine-tuning them. In this work, we show that frozen foundation models can be a versatile feature enhancer, even though they are not pre-trained for object detection. Specifically, we explore directly transferring the high-level image understanding of foundation models to detectors in the following two ways. First, the class token in foundation models provides an in-depth understanding of the complex scene, which facilitates decoding object queries in the detector's decoder by providing a compact context. Additionally, the patch tokens in foundation models can enrich the features in the detector's encoder by providing semantic details. Utilizing frozen foundation models as plug-and-play modules rather than the commonly used backbone can significantly enhance the detector's performance while preventing the problems caused by the architecture discrepancy between the detector's backbone and the foundation model. With such a novel paradigm, we boost the SOTA query-based detector DINO from 49.0% AP to 51.9% AP (+2.9% AP) and further to 53.8% AP (+4.8% AP) by integrating one or two foundation models respectively, on the COCO validation set after training for 12 epochs with R50 as the detector's backbone.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |

Furthermore, we jointly profile FMs' efficacy and efficiency when adapting to general video understanding tasks using cost measurements during both training and inference. Our main findings areas follows. First, task-specialized models significantly outperform the seven FMs studied in this work, in sharp contrast to what FMs have achieved in natural language and image understanding. Second, video-native FMs, whose pretraining data mainly contains the video modality, are generally better than image-native FMs in classifying motion-rich videos, localizing actions in time, and understanding a video of more than one action. Third, the video-native FMs can perform well on video tasks under light adaptations to downstream tasks (e.g., freezing the FM backbones), while image-native FMs win in full end-to-end finetuning. The first two observations reveal the need and tremendous opportunities to conduct research on video-focused FMs, and the last confirms that both tasks and adaptation methods matter when it comes to the evaluation of FMs. Our code is released under: https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/official/projects/videoglue.</p></details> | Accepted to TMLR |

The diverse nature of echo images, including variations in probe types, manufacturers, and pathologies, poses challenges for developing artificial intelligent models that can generalize across different clinical practice. We introduce EchoApex, the first general-purpose vision foundation model echocardiography with applications on a variety of clinical practice. Leveraging self-supervised learning, EchoApex is pretrained on over 20 million echo images from 11 clinical centres. By incorporating task-specific decoders and adapter modules, we demonstrate the effectiveness of EchoApex on 4 different kind of clinical applications with 28 sub-tasks, including view classification, interactive structure segmentation, left ventricle hypertrophy detection and automated ejection fraction estimation from view sequences. Compared to state-of-the-art task-specific models, EchoApex attains improved performance with a unified image encoding architecture, demonstrating the benefits of model pretraining at scale with in-domain data. Furthermore, EchoApex illustrates the potential for developing a general-purpose vision foundation model tailored specifically for echocardiography, capable of addressing a diverse range of clinical applications with high efficiency and efficacy.</p></details> |  |

Most methods rely on spotting them by analysing misclassified samples, in a semi-automated human-computer validation. In contrast, we propose ConceptDrift, a method which analyzes the weights of a linear probe, learned on top a foundational model. We capitalize on the weight update trajectory, which starts from the embedding of the textual representation of the class, and proceeds to drift towards embeddings that disclose hidden biases. Different from prior work, with this approach we can pin-point unwanted correlations from a dataset, providing more than just possible explanations for the wrong predictions. We empirically prove the efficacy of our method, by significantly improving zero-shot performance with biased-augmented prompting. Our method is not bounded to a single modality, and we experiment in this work with both image (Waterbirds, CelebA, Nico++) and text datasets (CivilComments).</p></details> |  |
| **[Predicting the Performance of Foundation Models via Agreement-on-the-Line](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01542v2)** | 2024-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Estimating the out-of-distribution performance in regimes where labels are scarce is critical to safely deploy foundation models. Recently, it was shown that ensembles of neural networks observe the phenomena "agreement-on-the-line", which can be leveraged to reliably predict OOD performance without labels. However, in contrast to classical neural networks that are trained on in-distribution data from scratch for numerous epochs, foundation models undergo minimal finetuning from heavily pretrained weights, which may reduce the ensemble diversity needed to observe agreement-on-the-line. In our work, we demonstrate that when lightly finetuning multiple runs from a single foundation model, the choice of randomness during training (linear head initialization, data ordering, and data subsetting) can lead to drastically different levels of agreement-on-the-line in the resulting ensemble. Surprisingly, only random head initialization is able to reliably induce agreement-on-the-line in finetuned foundation models across vision and language benchmarks. Second, we demonstrate that ensembles of multiple foundation models pretrained on different datasets but finetuned on the same task can also show agreement-on-the-line. In total, by careful construction of a diverse ensemble, we can utilize agreement-on-the-line-based methods to predict the OOD performance of foundation models with high precision.</p></details> |  |
| **[ONCOPILOT: A Promptable CT Foundation Model For Solid Tumor Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07908v3)** | 2024-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Carcinogenesis is a proteiform phenomenon, with tumors emerging in various locations and displaying complex, diverse shapes. At the crucial intersection of research and clinical practice, it demands precise and flexible assessment. However, current biomarkers, such as RECIST 1.1's long and short axis measurements, fall short of capturing this complexity, offering an approximate estimate of tumor burden and a simplistic representation of a more intricate process. Additionally, existing supervised AI models face challenges in addressing the variability in tumor presentations, limiting their clinical utility. These limitations arise from the scarcity of annotations and the models' focus on narrowly defined tasks. To address these challenges, we developed ONCOPILOT, an interactive radiological foundation model trained on approximately 7,500 CT scans covering the whole body, from both normal anatomy and a wide range of oncological cases. ONCOPILOT performs 3D tumor segmentation using visual prompts like point-click and bounding boxes, outperforming state-of-the-art models (e.g., nnUnet) and achieving radiologist-level accuracy in RECIST 1.1 measurements. The key advantage of this foundation model is its ability to surpass state-of-the-art performance while keeping the radiologist in the loop, a capability that previous models could not achieve. When radiologists interactively refine the segmentations, accuracy improves further. ONCOPILOT also accelerates measurement processes and reduces inter-reader variability, facilitating volumetric analysis and unlocking new biomarkers for deeper insights. This AI assistant is expected to enhance the precision of RECIST 1.1 measurements, unlock the potential of volumetric biomarkers, and improve patient stratification and clinical care, while seamlessly integrating into the radiological workflow.</p></details> |  |
| **[FedBaF: Federated Learning Aggregation Biased by a Foundation Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18352v1)** | 2024-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models are now a major focus of leading technology organizations due to their ability to generalize across diverse tasks. Existing approaches for adapting foundation models to new applications often rely on Federated Learning (FL) and disclose the foundation model weights to clients when using it to initialize the global model. While these methods ensure client data privacy, they compromise model and information security. In this paper, we introduce Federated Learning Aggregation Biased by a Foundation Model (FedBaF), a novel method for dynamically integrating pre-trained foundation model weights during the FL aggregation phase. Unlike conventional methods, FedBaF preserves the confidentiality of the foundation model while still leveraging its power to train more accurate models, especially in non-IID and adversarial scenarios. Our comprehensive experiments use Pre-ResNet and foundation models like Vision Transformer to demonstrate that FedBaF not only matches, but often surpasses the test accuracy of traditional weight initialization methods by up to 11.4\% in IID and up to 15.8\% in non-IID settings. Additionally, FedBaF applied to a Transformer-based language model significantly reduced perplexity by up to 39.2\%.</p></details> |  |

Techniques leveraging in-context learning (ICL) have shown promise here, allowing for dynamic adaptation to unseen data. ICL can provide predictions for entirely new datasets without further training or hyperparameter tuning, therefore providing very fast inference when encountering a novel task. However, scaling ICL for tabular data remains an issue: approaches based on large language models cannot efficiently process numeric tables, and tabular-specific techniques have not been able to effectively harness the power of real data to improve performance and generalization. We are able to overcome these challenges by training tabular-specific ICL-based architectures on real data with self-supervised learning and retrieval, combining the best of both worlds. Our resulting model -- the Tabular Discriminative Pre-trained Transformer (TabDPT) -- achieves state-of-the-art performance on the CC18 (classification) and CTR23 (regression) benchmarks with no task-specific fine-tuning, demonstrating the adapatability and speed of ICL once the model is pre-trained. TabDPT also demonstrates strong scaling as both model size and amount of available data increase, pointing towards future improvements simply through the curation of larger tabular pre-training datasets and training larger models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Minim...</summary><p>Minimal TabDPT interface to provide predictions on new datasets available at the following link: https://github.com/layer6ai-labs/TabDPT</p></details> |

Traditional visual language models (VLMs) use separate modules for understanding and generating visual content, which can lead to misalignment and increased complexity. In contrast, VILA-U employs a single autoregressive next-token prediction framework for both tasks, eliminating the need for additional components like diffusion models. This approach not only simplifies the model but also achieves near state-of-the-art performance in visual language understanding and generation. The success of VILA-U is attributed to two main factors: the unified vision tower that aligns discrete visual tokens with textual inputs during pretraining, which enhances visual perception, and autoregressive image generation can achieve similar quality as diffusion models with high-quality dataset. This allows VILA-U to perform comparably to more complex models using a fully token-based autoregressive framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/mit-han-lab/vila-u.

However, there is a lack of studies on FMs performance in exceptional scenarios, which we define as out-of-distribution (OOD) reasoning tasks. This paper is the first to address these cases, developing a novel dataset for evaluation of FMs across multiple modalities, including graphic novels, calligraphy, news articles, and lyrics. It includes tasks for instance classification, character recognition, token prediction, and text generation. The paper also proposes prompt engineering techniques like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and CoT+Few-Shot to enhance performance. Validation of FMs using various methods revealed improvements.

Accurate modeling of real-world chemical reactors through first-principles is often challenging, and the process of rebuilding and retraining models for each new chemical process is inefficient. This raises a critical question: can we develop a single, universal neural network (i.e., a foundation model) that can rapidly adapt to any new chemical process in a reactor? To address this, we propose a foundation model for chemical reactor modeling that employs a meta-learning approach, followed by physics-informed fine-tuning on new tasks with only a few data samples. Our model is designed to generalize across three classic reactor types: continuous stirred tank reactors, batch reactors, and plug flow reactors. Compared to conventional methods such as data-driven learning, physics-informed learning, transfer learning, and meta-learning, our approach demonstrates superior performance in few-shot scenarios. Specifically, it shows rapid adaptation to unseen reactions with varying integer orders across different reactor set-ups, requiring minimal data for fine-tuning.

| **[Securing Federated Learning Against Novel and Classic Backdoor Threats During Foundation Model Integration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17573v1)** | 2024-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated learning (FL) enables decentralized model training while preserving privacy. Recently, integrating Foundation Models (FMs) into FL has boosted performance but also introduced a novel backdoor attack mechanism. Attackers can exploit the FM's capabilities to embed backdoors into synthetic data generated by FMs used for model fusion, subsequently infecting all client models through knowledge sharing without involvement in the long-lasting FL process. These novel attacks render existing FL backdoor defenses ineffective, as they primarily detect anomalies among client updates, which may appear uniformly malicious under this attack. Our work proposes a novel data-free defense strategy by constraining abnormal activations in the hidden feature space during model aggregation on the server. The activation constraints, optimized using synthetic data alongside FL training, mitigate the attack while barely affecting model performance, as the parameters remain untouched. Extensive experiments demonstrate its effectiveness against both novel and classic backdoor attacks, outperforming existing defenses while maintaining model performance.</p></details> |  |

Yet great concerns have been raised about their mythic and uninterpreted potentials not only in machine learning, but also in various other disciplines. In this position paper, we propose to identify a neglected issue deeply rooted in LFMs: Catastrophic Inheritance, describing the weaknesses and limitations inherited from biased large-scale pre-training data to behaviors of LFMs on the downstream tasks, including samples that are corrupted, long-tailed, noisy, out-of-distributed, to name a few. Such inheritance can potentially cause catastrophes to downstream applications, such as bias, lack of generalization, deteriorated performance, security vulnerability, privacy leakage, and value misalignment. We discuss the challenges behind this issue and propose UIM, a framework to Understand the catastrophic inheritance of LFMs from both pre-training and downstream adaptation, Interpret the implications of catastrophic inheritance on downstream tasks, and how to Mitigate it. UIM aims to unite both the machine learning and social sciences communities for more responsible and promising AI development and deployment.</p></details> | Accepted by DMLR |

However, there are significant challenges that hinder the optimal use of multimodal e-commerce data by foundation models: (1) the scarcity of large-scale, high-quality multimodal benchmark datasets; and (2) the lack of effective multimodal information integration methods. To address these challenges, in this paper, we introduce MMECInstruct, the first-ever, large-scale, and high-quality multimodal instruction dataset for e-commerce. We also develop CASLIE, a simple, lightweight, yet effective framework for integrating multimodal information for e-commerce. Leveraging MMECInstruct, we fine-tune a series of e-commerce MFMs within CASLIE, denoted as CASLIE models. Our comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that CASLIE models substantially outperform 5 categories of advanced baseline models in the in-domain evaluation. Moreover, CASLIE models show strong generalizability to out-of-domain settings.

A key challenge is that an autonomous vehicle requires testing in every kind of driving scenario it could encounter, including rare events, to provide a strong case for safety and show there is no edge-case pathological behavior. Autonomous vehicle companies rely on potentially millions of miles driven in realistic simulation to expose the driving stack to enough miles to estimate rates and severity of collisions. To address scalability and coverage, we propose the use of a behavior foundation model, specifically a masked autoencoder (MAE), trained to reconstruct driving scenarios. We leverage the foundation model in two complementary ways: we (i) use the learned embedding space to group qualitatively similar scenarios together and (ii) fine-tune the model to label scenario difficulty based on the likelihood of a collision upon re-simulation. We use the difficulty scoring as importance weighting for the groups of scenarios. The result is an approach which can more rapidly estimate the rates and severity of collisions by prioritizing hard scenarios while ensuring exposure to every kind of driving scenario.</p></details> |  |

However, a critical issue remains: the lack of a comprehensive evaluation framework capable of assessing the quality and scientific validity of model outputs. To address this issue, we develop ClimaGen (Climate QA Generator), an automated algorithmic framework that generates question-answer pairs from graduate textbooks with climate scientists in the loop. As a result, we present ClimaQA-Gold, an expert-annotated benchmark dataset alongside ClimaQA-Silver, a large-scale, comprehensive synthetic QA dataset for climate science. Finally, we develop evaluation strategies and compare different Large Language Models (LLMs) on our benchmarks. Our results offer novel insights into various approaches used to enhance climate foundation models.</p></details> |  |

This question cannot be answered by the existing theory of representation, optimization or generalization, because the issues they mainly investigate are assumed to be nonexistent here. In this paper, we show that category theory provides powerful machinery to answer this question. We have proved three results. The first one limits the power of prompt-based learning, saying that the model can solve a downstream task with prompts if and only if the task is representable. The second one says fine tuning does not have this limit, as a foundation model with the minimum required power (up to symmetry) can theoretically solve downstream tasks for the category defined by pretext task, with fine tuning and enough resources. Our final result can be seen as a new type of generalization theorem, showing that the foundation model can generate unseen objects from the target category (e.g., images) using the structural information from the source category (e.g., texts). Along the way, we provide a categorical framework for supervised and self-supervised learning, which might be of independent interest.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICML'...</summary><p>ICML'23.

Yet there remains a gap in how to assess LLMs' conformity to important human values. In this paper, we investigate whether state-of-the-art LLMs, GPT-4 and Claude 2.1 (Gemini Pro and LLAMA 2 did not generate valid results) are moral hypocrites. We employ two research instruments based on the Moral Foundations Theory: (i) the Moral Foundations Questionnaire (MFQ), which investigates which values are considered morally relevant in abstract moral judgements; and (ii) the Moral Foundations Vignettes (MFVs), which evaluate moral cognition in concrete scenarios related to each moral foundation. We characterise conflicts in values between these different abstractions of moral evaluation as hypocrisy. We found that both models displayed reasonable consistency within each instrument compared to humans, but they displayed contradictory and hypocritical behaviour when we compared the abstract values present in the MFQ to the evaluation of concrete moral violations of the MFV.</p></details> | <details><summary>Final...</summary><p>Final version available at: https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AIES/article/view/31704 13 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

As sensors for these signals become more common, improving machine learning methods for multimodal healthcare data is crucial. Pretraining foundation models is a promising avenue for success. However, methods for developing foundation models in healthcare are still in early exploration and it is unclear which pretraining strategies are most effective given the diversity of physiological signals. This is partly due to challenges in multimodal health data: obtaining data across many patients is difficult and costly, there is a lot of inter-subject variability, and modalities are often heterogeneously informative across downstream tasks. Here, we explore these challenges in the PhysioNet 2018 dataset. We use a masked autoencoding objective to pretrain a multimodal model. We show that the model learns representations that can be linearly probed for a diverse set of downstream tasks. We hypothesize that cross-modal reconstruction objectives are important for successful multimodal training, as they encourage the model to integrate information across modalities. We demonstrate that modality dropout in the input space improves performance across downstream tasks. We also find that late-fusion models pretrained with contrastive learning objectives are less effective across multiple tasks. Finally, we analyze the model's representations, showing that attention weights become more cross-modal and temporally aligned with our pretraining strategy. The learned embeddings also become more distributed in terms of the modalities encoded by each unit. Overall, our work demonstrates the utility of multimodal foundation models with health data, even across diverse physiological data sources. We further argue that explicit methods for inducing cross-modality may enhance multimodal pretraining strategies.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2024 AIM-FM Workshop</p></details> |

However, they often struggle to adapt to specific tasks. Reinforcement learning (RL), which allows agents to learn through interaction and feedback, offers a compelling solution. Integrating RL with FMs enables these models to achieve desired outcomes and excel at particular tasks. Additionally, RL can be enhanced by leveraging the reasoning and generalization capabilities of FMs. This synergy is revolutionizing various fields, including robotics. FMs, rich in knowledge and generalization, provide robots with valuable information, while RL facilitates learning and adaptation through real-world interactions. This survey paper comprehensively explores this exciting intersection, examining how these paradigms can be integrated to advance robotic intelligence. We analyze the use of foundation models as action planners, the development of robotics-specific foundation models, and the mutual benefits of combining FMs with RL. Furthermore, we present a taxonomy of integration approaches, including large language models, vision-language models, diffusion models, and transformer-based RL models. We also explore how RL can utilize world representations learned from FMs to enhance robotic task execution. Our survey aims to synthesize current research and highlight key challenges in robotic reasoning and control, particularly in the context of integrating FMs and RL--two rapidly evolving technologies. By doing so, we seek to spark future research and emphasize critical areas that require further investigation to enhance robotics.

However, adapting these models to various downstream tasks remains challenging, particularly when faced with datasets from different sources and acquisition conditions, as well as limited data availability. In this study, we benchmark four pathology-specific foundation models across 14 datasets and two scenarios-consistency assessment and flexibility assessment-addressing diverse adaptation scenarios and downstream tasks. In the consistency assessment scenario, involving five fine-tuning methods, we found that the parameter-efficient fine-tuning approach was both efficient and effective for adapting pathology-specific foundation models to diverse datasets within the same downstream task. In the flexibility assessment scenario under data-limited environments, utilizing five few-shot learning methods, we observed that the foundation models benefited more from the few-shot learning methods that involve modification during the testing phase only. These findings provide insights that could guide the deployment of pathology-specific foundation models in real clinical settings, potentially improving the accuracy and reliability of pathology image analysis.

However, a significant challenge arises when adapting these models to domain-specific fields, such as digital pathology, due to substantial gaps between domains. To address this limitation, foundation models (FM) have been trained on large-scale in-domain datasets to learn the intricate features of histopathology images. In cancer diagnosis, whole-slide image (WSI) prediction is essential for patient prognosis, and multiple instance learning (MIL) has been implemented to handle the giga-pixel size of WSI. As MIL frameworks rely on patch-level feature aggregation, this work aims to compare the performance of various feature extractors developed under different pretraining strategies for cancer subtyping on WSI under a MIL framework.
