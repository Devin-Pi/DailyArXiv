| **[GeoRSMLLM: A Multimodal Large Language Model for Vision-Language Tasks in Geoscience and Remote Sensing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12490v1)** | 2025-03-16 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2503.12490v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The application of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in remote sensing (RS) has demonstrated significant potential in traditional tasks such as scene classification, object detection, and image captioning. However, current models, which excel in Referring Expression Comprehension (REC), struggle with tasks involving complex instructions (e.g., exists multiple conditions) or pixel-level operations like segmentation and change detection. In this white paper, we provide a comprehensive hierarchical summary of vision-language tasks in RS, categorized by the varying levels of cognitive capability required. We introduce the Remote Sensing Vision-Language Task Set (RSVLTS), which includes Open-Vocabulary Tasks (OVT), Referring Expression Tasks (RET), and Described Object Tasks (DOT) with increased difficulty, and Visual Question Answering (VQA) aloneside. Moreover, we propose a novel unified data representation using a set-of-points approach for RSVLTS, along with a condition parser and a self-augmentation strategy based on cyclic referring. These features are integrated into the GeoRSMLLM model, and this enhanced model is designed to handle a broad range of tasks of RSVLTS, paving the way for a more generalized solution for vision-language tasks in geoscience and remote sensing.</p></details> |  |

Geoscience foundation models (GFMs) emerge as a paradigm-shifting solution, integrating extensive cross-disciplinary data to enhance the simulation and understanding of Earth system dynamics. These data-centric AI models extract insights from petabytes of structured and unstructured data, effectively addressing the complexities of Earth systems that traditional models struggle to capture. The unique strengths of GFMs include flexible task specification, diverse input-output capabilities, and multi-modal knowledge representation, enabling analyses that surpass those of individual data sources or traditional AI methods. This review not only highlights the key advantages of GFMs, but also presents essential techniques for their construction, with a focus on transformers, pre-training, and adaptation strategies. Subsequently, we examine recent advancements in GFMs, including large language models, vision models, and vision-language models, particularly emphasizing the potential applications in remote sensing. Additionally, the review concludes with a comprehensive analysis of the challenges and future trends in GFMs, addressing five critical aspects: data integration, model complexity, uncertainty quantification, interdisciplinary collaboration, and concerns related to privacy, trust, and security. This review offers a comprehensive overview of emerging geoscientific research paradigms, emphasizing the untapped opportunities at the intersection of advanced AI techniques and geoscience. It examines major methodologies, showcases advances in large-scale models, and discusses the challenges and prospects that will shape the future landscape of GFMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>accpe...</summary><p>accpeted by IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Magazine</p></details> |

In this work, we discuss a series of developments in the field of prototype-based XAI that show potential for scientific learning tasks, with a focus on the geosciences. We organize the prototype-based XAI literature into three themes: the development and visualization of prototypes, types of prototypes, and the use of prototypes in various learning tasks. We discuss how the authors use prototype-based methods, their novel contributions, and any limitations or challenges that may arise when adapting these methods for geoscientific learning tasks. We highlight differences between geoscientific data sets and the standard benchmarks used to develop XAI methods, and discuss how specific geoscientific applications may benefit from using or modifying existing prototype-based XAI techniques.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at AI for Science Workshop-Oral (Attention Track), Proceedings of 41st International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML) 2024</p></details> |
| **[Interpretable Geoscience Artificial Intelligence (XGeoS-AI): Application to Demystify Image Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04940v2)** | 2024-05-07 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2311.04940v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As Earth science enters the era of big data, artificial intelligence (AI) not only offers great potential for solving geoscience problems, but also plays a critical role in accelerating the understanding of the complex, interactive, and multiscale processes of Earth's behavior. As geoscience AI models are progressively utilized for significant predictions in crucial situations, geoscience researchers are increasingly demanding their interpretability and versatility. This study proposes an interpretable geoscience artificial intelligence (XGeoS-AI) framework to unravel the mystery of image recognition in the Earth sciences, and its effectiveness and versatility is demonstrated by taking computed tomography (CT) image recognition as an example. Inspired by the mechanism of human vision, the proposed XGeoS-AI framework generates a threshold value from a local region within the whole image to complete the recognition. Different kinds of artificial intelligence (AI) methods, such as Support Vector Regression (SVR), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), can be adopted as the AI engines of the proposed XGeoS-AI framework to efficiently complete geoscience image recognition tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that the effectiveness, versatility, and heuristics of the proposed framework have great potential in solving geoscience image recognition problems. Interpretable AI should receive more and more attention in the field of the Earth sciences, which is the key to promoting more rational and wider applications of AI in the field of Earth sciences. In addition, the proposed interpretable framework may be the forerunner of technological innovation in the Earth sciences.</p></details> | <details><summary>there...</summary><p>there are some erros in the results, and a newer revision is still preparing</p></details> |
| **[GeoGalactica: A Scientific Large Language Model in Geoscience](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00434v2)** | 2024-04-13 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2401.00434v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have achieved huge success for their general knowledge and ability to solve a wide spectrum of tasks in natural language processing (NLP). Due to their impressive abilities, LLMs have shed light on potential inter-discipline applications to foster scientific discoveries of a specific domain by using artificial intelligence (AI for science, AI4S). In the meantime, utilizing NLP techniques in geoscience research and practice is wide and convoluted, contributing from knowledge extraction and document classification to question answering and knowledge discovery. In this work, we take the initial step to leverage LLM for science, through a rather straightforward approach. We try to specialize an LLM into geoscience, by further pre-training the model with a vast amount of texts in geoscience, as well as supervised fine-tuning (SFT) the resulting model with our custom collected instruction tuning dataset. These efforts result in a model GeoGalactica consisting of 30 billion parameters. To our best knowledge, it is the largest language model for the geoscience domain. More specifically, GeoGalactica is from further pre-training of Galactica. We train GeoGalactica over a geoscience-related text corpus containing 65 billion tokens, preserving as the largest geoscience-specific text corpus. Then we fine-tune the model with 1 million pairs of instruction-tuning data consisting of questions that demand professional geoscience knowledge to answer. In this technical report, we will illustrate in detail all aspects of GeoGalactica, including data collection, data cleaning, base model selection, pre-training, SFT, and evaluation. We open-source our data curation tools and the checkpoints of GeoGalactica during the first 3/4 of pre-training.</p></details> |  |
| **[A novel approach for estimating functions in the multivariate setting based on an adaptive knot selection for B-splines with an application to a chemical system used in geoscience](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00686v3)** | 2024-01-25 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2306.00686v3) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we will outline a novel data-driven method for estimating functions in a multivariate nonparametric regression model based on an adaptive knot selection for B-splines. The underlying idea of our approach for selecting knots is to apply the generalized lasso, since the knots of the B-spline basis can be seen as changes in the derivatives of the function to be estimated. This method was then extended to functions depending on several variables by processing each dimension independently, thus reducing the problem to a univariate setting. The regularization parameters were chosen by means of a criterion based on EBIC. The nonparametric estimator was obtained using a multivariate B-spline regression with the corresponding selected knots. Our procedure was validated through numerical experiments by varying the number of observations and the level of noise to investigate its robustness. The influence of observation sampling was also assessed and our method was applied to a chemical system commonly used in geoscience. For each different framework considered in this paper, our approach performed better than state-of-the-art methods. Our completely data-driven method is implemented in the glober R package which is available on the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN).</p></details> | 29 pages, 27 figures |
| **[When Geoscience Meets Generative AI and Large Language Models: Foundations, Trends, and Future Challenges](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03349v1)** | 2024-01-25 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2402.03349v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) represents an emerging field that promises the creation of synthetic data and outputs in different modalities. GAI has recently shown impressive results across a large spectrum of applications ranging from biology, medicine, education, legislation, computer science, and finance. As one strives for enhanced safety, efficiency, and sustainability, generative AI indeed emerges as a key differentiator and promises a paradigm shift in the field. This paper explores the potential applications of generative AI and large language models in geoscience. The recent developments in the field of machine learning and deep learning have enabled the generative model's utility for tackling diverse prediction problems, simulation, and multi-criteria decision-making challenges related to geoscience and Earth system dynamics. This survey discusses several GAI models that have been used in geoscience comprising generative adversarial networks (GANs), physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), and generative pre-trained transformer (GPT)-based structures. These tools have helped the geoscience community in several applications, including (but not limited to) data generation/augmentation, super-resolution, panchromatic sharpening, haze removal, restoration, and land surface changing. Some challenges still remain such as ensuring physical interpretation, nefarious use cases, and trustworthiness. Beyond that, GAI models show promises to the geoscience community, especially with the support to climate change, urban science, atmospheric science, marine science, and planetary science through their extraordinary ability to data-driven modeling and uncertainty quantification.</p></details> |  |
| **[Differentiable modeling to unify machine learning and physical models and advance Geosciences](http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.04027v2)** | 2023-12-27 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2301.04027v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Process-Based Modeling (PBM) and Machine Learning (ML) are often perceived as distinct paradigms in the geosciences. Here we present differentiable geoscientific modeling as a powerful pathway toward dissolving the perceived barrier between them and ushering in a paradigm shift. For decades, PBM offered benefits in interpretability and physical consistency but struggled to efficiently leverage large datasets. ML methods, especially deep networks, presented strong predictive skills yet lacked the ability to answer specific scientific questions. While various methods have been proposed for ML-physics integration, an important underlying theme -- differentiable modeling -- is not sufficiently recognized. Here we outline the concepts, applicability, and significance of differentiable geoscientific modeling (DG). "Differentiable" refers to accurately and efficiently calculating gradients with respect to model variables, critically enabling the learning of high-dimensional unknown relationships. DG refers to a range of methods connecting varying amounts of prior knowledge to neural networks and training them together, capturing a different scope than physics-guided machine learning and emphasizing first principles. Preliminary evidence suggests DG offers better interpretability and causality than ML, improved generalizability and extrapolation capability, and strong potential for knowledge discovery, while approaching the performance of purely data-driven ML. DG models require less training data while scaling favorably in performance and efficiency with increasing amounts of data. With DG, geoscientists may be better able to frame and investigate questions, test hypotheses, and discover unrecognized linkages.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we bring LLMs to the realm of geoscience with the objective of advancing research and applications in this field. To this end, we present the first-ever LLM in geoscience, K2, alongside a suite of resources developed to further promote LLM research within geoscience. For instance, we have curated the first geoscience instruction tuning dataset, GeoSignal, which aims to align LLM responses to geoscience-related user queries. Additionally, we have established the first geoscience benchmark, GeoBench, to evaluate LLMs in the context of geoscience. In this work, we experiment with a complete recipe to adapt a pre-trained general-domain LLM to the geoscience domain. Specifically, we further train the LLaMA-7B model on 5.5B tokens of geoscience text corpus, including over 1 million pieces of geoscience literature, and utilize GeoSignal's supervised data to fine-tune the model. Moreover, we share a protocol that can efficiently gather domain-specific data and construct domain-supervised data, even in situations where manpower is scarce. Meanwhile, we equip K2 with the abilities of using tools to be a naive geoscience aide. Experiments conducted on the GeoBench demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and datasets on geoscience knowledge understanding and utilization.We open-source all the training data and K2 model checkpoints at https://github.com/davendw49/k2.</p></details> |  |
| **[AI Security for Geoscience and Remote Sensing: Challenges and Future Trends](http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.09360v2)** | 2023-06-22 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2212.09360v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have significantly intensified research in the geoscience and remote sensing (RS) field. AI algorithms, especially deep learning-based ones, have been developed and applied widely to RS data analysis. The successful application of AI covers almost all aspects of Earth observation (EO) missions, from low-level vision tasks like super-resolution, denoising and inpainting, to high-level vision tasks like scene classification, object detection and semantic segmentation. While AI techniques enable researchers to observe and understand the Earth more accurately, the vulnerability and uncertainty of AI models deserve further attention, considering that many geoscience and RS tasks are highly safety-critical. This paper reviews the current development of AI security in the geoscience and RS field, covering the following five important aspects: adversarial attack, backdoor attack, federated learning, uncertainty and explainability. Moreover, the potential opportunities and trends are discussed to provide insights for future research. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this paper is the first attempt to provide a systematic review of AI security-related research in the geoscience and RS community. Available code and datasets are also listed in the paper to move this vibrant field of research forward.</p></details> |  |
| **[Coarse-to-fine Task-driven Inpainting for Geoscience Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.11059v3)** | 2022-12-06 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2211.11059v3) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The processing and recognition of geoscience images have wide applications. Most of existing researches focus on understanding the high-quality geoscience images by assuming that all the images are clear. However, in many real-world cases, the geoscience images might contain occlusions during the image acquisition. This problem actually implies the image inpainting problem in computer vision and multimedia. To the best of our knowledge, all the existing image inpainting algorithms learn to repair the occluded regions for a better visualization quality, they are excellent for natural images but not good enough for geoscience images by ignoring the geoscience related tasks. This paper aims to repair the occluded regions for a better geoscience task performance with the advanced visualization quality simultaneously, without changing the current deployed deep learning based geoscience models. Because of the complex context of geoscience images, we propose a coarse-to-fine encoder-decoder network with coarse-to-fine adversarial context discriminators to reconstruct the occluded image regions. Due to the limited data of geoscience images, we use a MaskMix based data augmentation method to exploit more information from limited geoscience image data. The experimental results on three public geoscience datasets for remote sensing scene recognition, cross-view geolocation and semantic segmentation tasks respectively show the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Investigating the fidelity of explainable artificial intelligence methods for applications of convolutional neural networks in geoscience](http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.03407v2)** | 2022-09-05 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2202.03407v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have recently attracted great attention in geoscience due to their ability to capture non-linear system behavior and extract predictive spatiotemporal patterns. Given their black-box nature however, and the importance of prediction explainability, methods of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) are gaining popularity as a means to explain the CNN decision-making strategy. Here, we establish an intercomparison of some of the most popular XAI methods and investigate their fidelity in explaining CNN decisions for geoscientific applications. Our goal is to raise awareness of the theoretical limitations of these methods and gain insight into the relative strengths and weaknesses to help guide best practices. The considered XAI methods are first applied to an idealized attribution benchmark, where the ground truth of explanation of the network is known a priori, to help objectively assess their performance. Secondly, we apply XAI to a climate-related prediction setting, namely to explain a CNN that is trained to predict the number of atmospheric rivers in daily snapshots of climate simulations. Our results highlight several important issues of XAI methods (e.g., gradient shattering, inability to distinguish the sign of attribution, ignorance to zero input) that have previously been overlooked in our field and, if not considered cautiously, may lead to a distorted picture of the CNN decision-making strategy. We envision that our analysis will motivate further investigation into XAI fidelity and will help towards a cautious implementation of XAI in geoscience, which can lead to further exploitation of CNNs and deep learning for prediction problems.</p></details> |  |

However, the predominant reliance on visual encoding of data continues to create accessibility barriers for people who are blind/vision impaired resulting in their under representation in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) disciplines. This research study seeks to understand the experiences of professionals who are blind/vision impaired in one such STEM discipline (geosciences) in accessing data visualizations. In-depth, semi-structured interviews with seven professionals were conducted to examine the accessibility barriers and areas for improvement to inform accessibility research pertaining to data visualizations through a socio-technical lens. A reflexive thematic analysis revealed the negative impact of visualizations in influencing their career path, lack of data exploration tools for research, barriers in accessing works of peers and mismatched pace of visualization and accessibility research. The article also includes recommendations from the participants to address some of these accessibility barriers.</p></details> |  |
| **[Neural Network Attribution Methods for Problems in Geoscience: A Novel Synthetic Benchmark Dataset](http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.10005v2)** | 2022-06-10 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2103.10005v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the increasingly successful application of neural networks to many problems in the geosciences, their complex and nonlinear structure makes the interpretation of their predictions difficult, which limits model trust and does not allow scientists to gain physical insights about the problem at hand. Many different methods have been introduced in the emerging field of eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), which aim at attributing the network s prediction to specific features in the input domain. XAI methods are usually assessed by using benchmark datasets (like MNIST or ImageNet for image classification). However, an objective, theoretically derived ground truth for the attribution is lacking for most of these datasets, making the assessment of XAI in many cases subjective. Also, benchmark datasets specifically designed for problems in geosciences are rare. Here, we provide a framework, based on the use of additively separable functions, to generate attribution benchmark datasets for regression problems for which the ground truth of the attribution is known a priori. We generate a large benchmark dataset and train a fully connected network to learn the underlying function that was used for simulation. We then compare estimated heatmaps from different XAI methods to the ground truth in order to identify examples where specific XAI methods perform well or poorly. We believe that attribution benchmarks as the ones introduced herein are of great importance for further application of neural networks in the geosciences, and for more objective assessment and accurate implementation of XAI methods, which will increase model trust and assist in discovering new science.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is an updated preprint version of the manuscript.

Quantifying complexity and non-stationarity of these data is a challenging task, and advanced complexity-based exploratory tool are required for understanding and visualizing such data. This paper discusses the Fisher-Shannon method, from which one can obtain a complexity measure and detect non-stationarity, as an efficient data exploration tool. The state-of-the-art studies related to the Fisher-Shannon measures are collected, and new analytical formulas for positive unimodal skewed distributions are proposed. Case studies on both synthetic and real data illustrate the usefulness of the Fisher-Shannon method, which can find application in different domains including time series discrimination and generation of times series features for clustering, modeling and forecasting. The paper is accompanied with Python and R libraries for the non-parametric estimation of the proposed measures.</p></details> | 18 pages, 5 figures |

In remote sensing and geosciences this is of special relevance to better understand the Earth's system and the complex interactions between the governing processes. In this paper, we focus on observational causal inference, thus we try to estimate the correct direction of causation using a finite set of empirical data. In addition, we focus on the more complex bivariate scenario that requires strong assumptions and no conditional independence tests can be used. In particular, we explore the framework of (non-deterministic) additive noise models, which relies on the principle of independence between the cause and the generating mechanism. A practical algorithmic instantiation of such principle only requires 1) two regression models in the forward and backward directions, and 2) the estimation of {\em statistical independence} between the obtained residuals and the observations. The direction leading to more independent residuals is decided to be the cause. We instead propose a criterion that uses the {\em sensitivity} (derivative) of the dependence estimator, the sensitivity criterion allows to identify samples most affecting the dependence measure, and hence the criterion is robust to spurious detections. We illustrate performance in a collection of 28 geoscience causal inference problems, in a database of radiative transfer models simulations and machine learning emulators in vegetation parameter modeling involving 182 problems, and in assessing the impact of different regression models in a carbon cycle problem. The criterion achieves state-of-the-art detection rates in all cases, it is generally robust to noise sources and distortions.</p></details> |  |

We propose to focus on the sensitivity (curvature) of the dependence estimator to account for the asymmetry of the forward and inverse densities of approximation residuals.

A thorough analysis of the co-developments of machine learning applications throughout the last 70 years relates the recent enthusiasm for machine learning to developments in geoscience. I explore the shift of kriging towards a mainstream machine learning method and the historic application of neural networks in geoscience, following the general trend of machine learning enthusiasm through the decades. Furthermore, this chapter explores the shift from mathematical fundamentals and knowledge in software development towards skills in model validation, applied statistics, and integrated subject matter expertise. The review is interspersed with code examples to complement the theoretical foundations and illustrate model validation and machine learning explainability for science. The scope of this review includes various shallow machine learning methods, e.g. Decision Trees, Random Forests, Support-Vector Machines, and Gaussian Processes, as well as, deep neural networks, including feed-forward neural networks, convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks and generative adversarial networks. Regarding geoscience, the review has a bias towards geophysics but aims to strike a balance with geochemistry, geostatistics, and geology, however excludes remote sensing, as this would exceed the scope. In general, I aim to provide context for the recent enthusiasm surrounding deep learning with respect to research, hardware, and software developments that enable successful application of shallow and deep machine learning in all disciplines of Earth science.</p></details> | <details><summary>36 pa...</summary><p>36 pages, 17 figures, book chapter</p></details> |

As such, neural networks have often been used within the geosciences to most accurately identify a desired output given a set of inputs, with the interpretation of what the network learns used as a secondary metric to ensure the network is making the right decision for the right reason. Neural network interpretation techniques have become more advanced in recent years, however, and we therefore propose that the ultimate objective of using a neural network can also be the interpretation of what the network has learned rather than the output itself. We show that the interpretation of neural networks can enable the discovery of scientifically meaningful connections within geoscientific data. In particular, we use two methods for neural network interpretation called backwards optimization and layerwise relevance propagation, both of which project the decision pathways of a network back onto the original input dimensions. To the best of our knowledge, LRP has not yet been applied to geoscientific research, and we believe it has great potential in this area.

Such extreme quantities of generated and modeled data greatly impact computational performances on many levels of high-performance computing (HPC): storage media, memory requirements, transfer capability, and finally simulation interactivity, necessary to exploit this instance of big data. Efficient representations and storage are thus becoming "enabling technologies'' in HPC experimental and simulation science. We propose HexaShrink, an original decomposition scheme for structured hexahedral volume meshes. The latter are used for instance in biomedical engineering, materials science, or geosciences. HexaShrink provides a comprehensive framework allowing efficient mesh visualization and storage. Its exactly reversible multiresolution decomposition yields a hierarchy of meshes of increasing levels of details, in terms of either geometry, continuous or categorical properties of cells. Starting with an overview of volume meshes compression techniques, our contribution blends coherently different multiresolution wavelet schemes in different dimensions. It results in a global framework preserving discontinuities (faults) across scales, implemented as a fully reversible upscaling at different resolutions. Experimental results are provided on meshes of varying size and complexity. They emphasize the consistency of the proposed representation, in terms of visualization, attribute downsampling and distribution at different resolutions. Finally, HexaShrink yields gains in storage space when combined to lossless compression techniques.</p></details> |  |

They have been applied in numerous science areas, but their application to the geosciences has been limited due to their inefficiency in high-dimensional systems in standard settings. However, huge progress has been made, and this limitation is disappearing fast due to recent developments in proposal densities, the use of ideas from (optimal) transportation, the use of localisation and intelligent adaptive resampling strategies. Furthermore, powerful hybrids between particle filters and ensemble Kalman filters and variational methods have been developed. We present a state of the art discussion of present efforts of developing particle filters for highly nonlinear geoscience state-estimation problems with an emphasis on atmospheric and oceanic applications, including many new ideas, derivations, and unifications, highlighting hidden connections, and generating a valuable tool and guide for the community. Initial experiments show that particle filters can be competitive with present-day methods for numerical weather prediction suggesting that they will become mainstream soon.</p></details> | <details><summary>Revie...</summary><p>Review paper, 36 pages, 9 figures, Resubmitted to Q.J.Royal Meteorol.

A rigorous statistical analysis of such observations is tricky, though. Observables can span several orders of magnitude, but the range for which the power law may be valid is typically truncated, usually because the smallest events are too tiny to be detected and the largest ones are limited by the system size. We revisit several examples of proposed power-law distributions dealing with potentially damaging natural phenomena. Adequate fits of the distributions of sizes are especially important in these cases, given that they may be used to assess long-term hazard. After reviewing the theoretical background for power-law distributions, we improve an objective statistical fitting method and apply it to diverse data sets. The method is described in full detail and it is easy to implement. Our analysis elucidates the range of validity of the power-law fit and the corresponding exponent, and whether a power-law tail is improved by a truncated log-normal. We confirm that impact fireballs and Californian earthquakes show untruncated power-law behavior, whereas global earthquakes follow a double power law. Rain precipitation over space and time and tropical cyclones show a truncated power-law regime. Karst sinkholes and wildfires, in contrast, are better described by truncated log-normals, although wildfires also may show power-law regimes. Our conclusions only apply to the analyzed data sets, but show the potential of applying this robust statistical technique in the future.</p></details> |  |

This term encompasses the entire sequence of operations that, starting from the observations of a system, and from additional statistical and dynamical information (such as a dynamical evolution model), provides an estimate of its state. Data assimilation is standard practice in numerical weather prediction, but its application is becoming widespread in many other areas of climate, atmosphere, ocean and environment modeling; in all circumstances where one intends to estimate the state of a large dynamical system based on limited information. While the complexity of data assimilation, and of the methods thereof, stands on its interdisciplinary nature across statistics, dynamical systems and numerical optimization, when applied to geosciences an additional difficulty arises by the continually increasing sophistication of the environmental models. Thus, in spite of data assimilation being nowadays ubiquitous in geosciences, it has so far remained a topic mostly reserved to experts. We aim this overview article at geoscientists with a background in mathematical and physical modeling, who are interested in the rapid development of data assimilation and its growing domains of application in environmental science, but so far have not delved into its conceptual and methodological complexities.</p></details> | <details><summary>79 pa...</summary><p>79 pages, 10 figures, Invited review</p></details> |

Following the paradigm introduced by DUSt3R, which unifies an image pair densely into a shared coordinate system, subsequent methods maintain an implicit memory to achieve dense 3D reconstruction from more images. However, such implicit memory is limited in capacity and may suffer from information loss of earlier frames. We propose Point3R, an online framework targeting dense streaming 3D reconstruction. To be specific, we maintain an explicit spatial pointer memory directly associated with the 3D structure of the current scene. Each pointer in this memory is assigned a specific 3D position and aggregates scene information nearby in the global coordinate system into a changing spatial feature. Information extracted from the latest frame interacts explicitly with this pointer memory, enabling dense integration of the current observation into the global coordinate system. We design a 3D hierarchical position embedding to promote this interaction and design a simple yet effective fusion mechanism to ensure that our pointer memory is uniform and efficient. Our method achieves competitive or state-of-the-art performance on various tasks with low training costs.

Recent efforts extend these models to incorporate conditional images (e.g., depth or pose maps) for fine-grained spatial control. Among them, feature injection methods have emerged as a training-free alternative to traditional fine-tuning approaches. However, they often suffer from structural misalignment, condition leakage, and visual artifacts, especially when the condition image diverges significantly from natural RGB distributions. By revisiting existing methods, we identify a core limitation: the synchronous injection of condition features fails to account for the trade-off between domain alignment and structural preservation during denoising. Inspired by this observation, we propose a flexible feature injection framework that decouples the injection timestep from the denoising process. At its core is a structure-rich injection module, which enables the model to better adapt to the evolving interplay between alignment and structure preservation throughout the diffusion steps, resulting in more faithful structural generation. In addition, we introduce appearance-rich prompting and a restart refinement strategy to further enhance appearance control and visual quality. Together, these designs enable training-free generation that is both structure-rich and appearance-rich. Extensive experiments show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse zero-shot conditioning scenarios.</p></details> |  |

However, to maintain this performance in dynamic scenarios, resource-intensive data-driven tracking algorithms become necessary to provide precise spatial guidance conditioned on the initial direction of a target speaker. As this additional computational overhead hinders application in resource-constrained scenarios such as real-time speech enhancement, we present a novel strategy utilizing a low-complexity tracking algorithm in the form of a particle filter instead. Assuming a causal, sequential processing style, we introduce temporal feedback to leverage the enhanced speech signal of the spatially selective filter to compensate for the limited modeling capabilities of the particle filter. Evaluation on a synthetic dataset illustrates how the autoregressive interplay between both algorithms drastically improves tracking accuracy and leads to strong enhancement performance. A listening test with real-world recordings complements these findings by indicating a clear trend towards our proposed self-steering pipeline as preferred choice over comparable methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE Workshop on Applications of Signal Processing to Audio and Acoustics (WASPAA) 2025</p></details> |

It extends Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) by integrating team welfare objectives specifically for spatial public goods games. Unlike conventional approaches where cooperation emerges indirectly from individual rewards, TUC-PPO instead optimizes a bi-level objective integrating policy gradients and team utility constraints. Consequently, all policy updates explicitly incorporate collective payoff thresholds. The framework preserves PPO's policy gradient core while incorporating constrained optimization through adaptive Lagrangian multipliers. Therefore, decentralized agents dynamically balance selfish and cooperative incentives. The comparative analysis demonstrates superior performance of this constrained deep reinforcement learning approach compared to unmodified PPO and evolutionary game theory baselines. It achieves faster convergence to cooperative equilibria and greater stability against invasion by defectors. The framework formally integrates team objectives into policy updates. This work advances multi-agent deep reinforcement learning for social dilemmas while providing new computational tools for evolutionary game theory research.</p></details> |  |

Joint spatial division and multiplexing (JSDM) emerges as a low-overhead transmission scheme for multi-user equipment (UE) scenarios, typically requiring complex matrix decomposition to achieve block-diagonalization of the effective channel matrix. In this study, we introduce an innovative JSDM design that leverages RISs to customize channels, thereby streamlining the overall procedures. By strategically positioning RISs at the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) directions of the base station (BS), we establish orthogonal line-of-sight links within the BS-RIS channel, enabling a straightforward pre-beamforming design. Based on UE grouping, we devise reflected beams of the RIS with optimized directions to mitigate inter-group interference in the RISs-UEs channel. An approximation of the channel cross-correlation coefficient is derived and serves as a foundation for the RISs-UEs association, further diminishing inter-group interference. Numerical results substantiate the efficacy of our RIS-customized JSDM in not only achieving effective channel block-diagonalization but also in significantly enhancing the sum spectral efficiency for multi-UE transmissions.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

Current research addresses subgraph-FL only from the structural perspective, neglecting the propagation of graph signals on spatial and spectral domains of the structure. From a spatial perspective, subgraph-FL introduces edge disconnections between clients, leading to disruptions in label signals and a degradation in the class knowledge of the global GNN. From a spectral perspective, spectral heterogeneity causes inconsistencies in signal frequencies across subgraphs, which makes local GNNs overfit the local signal propagation schemes. As a result, spectral client drifts occur, undermining global generalizability. To tackle the challenges, we propose a global knowledge repository to mitigate label signal disruption and a frequency alignment to address spectral client drifts. The combination of spatial and spectral strategies forms our framework S2FGL. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate the superiority of S2FGL.

Traditional detectors represent temporal information merely by stacking spatial frequency spectra across frames, resulting in the failure to detect temporal artifacts in the pixel plane. Our approach performs a 1D Fourier transform on the time axis for each pixel, extracting features highly sensitive to temporal inconsistencies, especially in areas prone to unnatural movements. To precisely locate regions containing the temporal artifacts, we introduce an attention proposal module trained in an end-to-end manner. Additionally, our joint transformer module effectively integrates pixel-wise temporal frequency features with spatio-temporal context features, expanding the range of detectable forgery artifacts. Our framework represents a significant advancement in deepfake video detection, providing robust performance across diverse and challenging detection scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by iccv 2025. code is will be available at https://github.com/rama0126/PwTF-DVD</p></details> |

Different from the conventional SC-TCs, the proposed codes have simpler and deterministic coupling structures. Most notably, the coupling of HSC-BCCs is performed by re-encoding the whole coupling sequence in the component encoder of one time instant, rather than spreading the coupling bits to component encoders of multiple time instants. This simplification not only addresses the window decoding threshold loss issue in existing BCCs, but also allows the proposed codes to attain very close-to-capacity performance with a coupling memory as small as 2.

Within this setting, different possible actions for the algorithm are defined, connecting with previous results on the classical, non-reinforcement learning spatial prisoner's dilemma, showcasing the versatility of the algorithm in modeling different game-theoretical scenarios and the benchmarking potential of this approach.As a result, a range of effects is observed, including evidence that games with fixed update rules can be qualitatively equivalent to those with learned ones, as well as the emergence of a symbiotic mutualistic effect between populations that forms when multiple actions are defined.</p></details> |  |

While CLIP-ViT works well for capturing global image features, it struggles to model local relationships between adjacent patches, leading to weaker visual representation, which in turn affects the detailed understanding ability of MLLMs. To solve this, we propose LLaVA-SP, which \textbf{ only adds six spatial visual tokens} to the original visual tokens to enhance the visual representation. Our approach offers three key advantages: 1)We propose a novel Projector, which uses convolutional kernels to derive visual spatial tokens from ViT patch features, simulating two visual spatial ordering approaches: ``from central region to global" and ``from abstract to specific". Then, a cross-attention mechanism is applied to fuse fine-grained visual information, enriching the overall visual representation. 2) We present two model variants: LLaVA-SP-Cropping, which focuses on detail features through progressive cropping, and LLaVA-SP-Pooling, which captures global semantics through adaptive pooling, enabling the model to handle diverse visual understanding tasks. 3) Extensive experiments show that LLaVA-SP, fine-tuned with LoRA, achieves significant performance improvements across various multimodal benchmarks, outperforming the state-of-the-art LLaVA-1.5 model in multiple tasks with nearly identical inference latency.

Spatial TUIs exploit human innate spatial and tactile ability in an intuitive and direct manner, affording interaction paradigms that are practically impossible using current interface technology. As proof-of-concept we examine implementations in the field of cognitive assessment and training. In this paper we use Cognitive Cubes, a novel TUI we developed, as an applied test bed for our beliefs, presenting promising experimental results for cognitive assessment of spatial ability, and possibly for training purposes.</p></details> |  |

S3D is designed to enable realistic steerable drilling while accounting for the anatomical constraints associated with vertebral access in spinal fixation (SF) procedures. To achieve this, we first enhanced our previously designed concentric tube Steerable Drilling Robot (CT-SDR) to facilitate steerable drilling across all vertebral levels of the spinal column. Additionally, we propose a four-Phase calibration, registration, and navigation procedure to perform realistic SF procedures on a spine holder phantom by integrating the CT-SDR with a seven-degree-of-freedom robotic manipulator. The functionality of this framework is validated through planar and out-of-plane steerable drilling experiments in vertebral phantoms.</p></details> |  |

However, prevalent AR models predominantly rely on the transformer architectures, which are beset by quadratic computational complexity concerning input sequence length and substantial memory overhead due to the necessity of maintaining key-value caches. Although linear attention mechanisms have successfully reduced this burden in language models, our initial experiments reveal that they significantly degrade image generation quality because of their inability to capture critical long-range dependencies in visual data. We propose Linear Attention with Spatial-Aware Decay (LASAD), a novel attention mechanism that explicitly preserves genuine 2D spatial relationships within the flattened image sequences by computing position-dependent decay factors based on true 2D spatial location rather than 1D sequence positions. Based on this mechanism, we present LASADGen, an autoregressive image generator that enables selective attention to relevant spatial contexts with linear complexity. Experiments on ImageNet show LASADGen achieves state-of-the-art image generation performance and computational efficiency, bridging the gap between linear attention's efficiency and spatial understanding needed for high-quality generation.</p></details> |  |

Using this high resolution data, we generate spatially distributed contact angle maps that reveal previously hidden wettability heterogeneity. Our analysis of mixed-wet systems demonstrates the severe limitations of averaged metrics: a sample with a mean contact angle of 64.7 degrees, conventionally classified as uniformly weakly water-wet, exhibits 40% of its pore space in the intermediate-wetting regime (70-110 degrees). This heterogeneity explains the presence of minimal surface interfaces and fundamentally different pore-filling mechanisms operating within the same sample. By providing open-source tools for spatially-resolved wettability characterization, this work enables more accurate predictions of multiphase flow behavior in heterogeneous porous materials, essential for optimizing subsurface energy storage and recovery processes.</p></details> |  |

A novel deep reinforcement learning framework, Proximal Policy Optimization with Adversarial Curriculum Transfer (PPO-ACT), is proposed to model agent strategy optimization in dynamic environments. Traditional evolutionary game models frequently exhibit limitations in modeling long-term decision-making processes. Deep reinforcement learning effectively addresses this limitation by bridging policy gradient methods with evolutionary game theory. Our study pioneers the application of proximal policy optimization's continuous strategy optimization capability to public goods games through a two-stage adversarial curriculum transfer training paradigm. The experimental results show that PPO-ACT performs better in critical enhancement factor regimes. Compared to conventional standard proximal policy optimization methods, Q-learning and Fermi update rules, achieve earlier cooperation phase transitions and maintain stable cooperative equilibria. This framework exhibits better robustness when handling challenging scenarios like all-defector initial conditions. Systematic comparisons reveal the unique advantage of policy gradient methods in population-scale cooperation, i.e., achieving spatiotemporal payoff coordination through value function propagation. Our work provides a new computational framework for studying cooperation emergence in complex systems, algorithmically validating the punishment promotes cooperation hypothesis while offering methodological insights for multi-agent system strategy design.</p></details> |  |

In particular, the network structure, which incorporates a flexible sparse deviation that can be regarded either as a latent component or as a misspecification of a predetermined adjacency matrix, is estimated using a debiased machine learning approach. The theoretical analysis establishes the consistency and asymptotic normality of our proposed estimator, taking into account general temporal and spatial dependencies inherent in the data-generating processes. A primary contribution of our study is the development of a uniform inference theory, which enables hypothesis testing on the parameters of interest, including zero or non-zero elements in the network structure. Additionally, the asymptotic properties of the estimator are derived for both linear and nonlinear moments. Simulations demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed approach. Finally, we apply our methodology to investigate the spatial network effects of stock returns.</p></details> |  |

A fundamental question, however, remains: What is the maximum spatial degree of freedom (DoF) of spatial multiplexing in the distance domain? In this paper, we address this open problem by investigating the spatial DoF of a line-of-sight (LoS) channel between a large two-dimensional transmit aperture and a linear receive array with collinearly-aligned elements (i.e., at the same angular direction) but located at different distances from the transmit aperture. We assume that both the aperture and linear array are continuous-aperture (CAP) arrays with an infinite number of elements and infinitesimal spacing, which establishes an upper bound for the spatial degrees of freedom (DoF) in the case of finite elements. First, we assume an ideal case where the transmit array is a single piece and the linear array is on the broad side of the transmit array. By reformulating the channel as an integral operator with a Hermitian convolution kernel, we derive a closed-form expression for the spatial DoF via the Fourier transform. Our analysis shows that the spatial DoF in the distance domain is predominantly determined by the extreme boundaries of the array rather than its detailed interior structure. We further extend the framework to non-broadside configurations by employing a projection method, which effectively converts the spatial DoF to an equivalent broadside case. Finally, we extend our analytical framework to the modular array, which shows the spatial DoF gain over the single-piece array given the constraint of the physical length of the array.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages and 13 figures.

While existing deep learning models predominantly utilize CYGNSS data with four-channel information, they often adopt single-channel inputs or simple channel concatenation without leveraging the benefits of cross-channel information interaction during training. To address this limitation, a novel spatial-channel attention-based network, namely SCAWaveNet, is proposed for SWH retrieval. Specifically, features from each channel of the DDMs are modeled as independent attention heads, enabling the fusion of spatial and channel-wise information. For auxiliary parameters, a lightweight attention mechanism is designed to assign weights along the spatial and channel dimensions. The final feature integrates both spatial and channel-level characteristics. Model performance is evaluated using four-channel CYGNSS data. When ERA5 is used as a reference, SCAWaveNet achieves an average RMSE of 0.438 m. When using buoy data from NDBC, the average RMSE reaches 0.432 m. Compared to state-of-the-art models, SCAWaveNet reduces the average RMSE by at least 3.52% on the ERA5 dataset and by 5.47% on the NDBC buoy observations.

However, this memory mechanism is very sensitive to even small imperfections, such as noise or heterogeneity, which are both common in biological systems. Previous work has shown that discretising the continuum into a finite set of discrete attractor states provides robustness to these imperfections, but necessarily reduces the resolution of the represented variable, creating a dilemma between stability and resolution. We show that this stability-resolution dilemma is most severe for CANs using unimodal bump-like codes, as in traditional models. To overcome this, we investigate sparse binary distributed codes based on random feature embeddings, in which neurons have spatially-periodic receptive fields. We demonstrate theoretically and with simulations that such grid-cell-like codes enable CANs to achieve both high stability and high resolution simultaneously. The model extends to embedding arbitrary nonlinear manifolds into a CAN, such as spheres or tori, and generalises linear path integration to integration along freely-programmable on-manifold vector fields. Together, this work provides a theory of how the brain could robustly represent continuous variables with high resolution and perform flexible computations over task-relevant manifolds.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 4 figures.

Previous trackers have explored many effective feature modification methods to preserve more aligned features. However, an important yet unexplored factor ultimately hinders their capability, which is the inherent differences in the temporal and spatial scale of information between visual and language inputs. To address this issue, we propose a novel visual-language tracker that enhances the effect of feature modification by \textbf{A}ligning \textbf{T}emporal and \textbf{S}patial scale of different input components, named as \textbf{ATSTrack}. Specifically, we decompose each language description into phrases with different attributes based on their temporal and spatial correspondence with visual inputs, and modify their features in a fine-grained manner. Moreover, we introduce a Visual-Language token that comprises modified linguistic information from the previous frame to guide the model to extract visual features that are more relevant to language description, thereby reducing the impact caused by the differences in spatial scale. Experimental results show that our proposed ATSTrack achieves performance comparable to existing methods. Our code will be released.</p></details> |  |

These models usually build upon pretrained Vision-Language Models (VLMs), which excel at semantic understanding due to large-scale text pretraining. However, VLMs typically lack precise spatial understanding capabilities, as they are primarily tuned on 2D image-text pairs without 3D supervision. To address this limitation, recent approaches have incorporated explicit 3D inputs such as point clouds or depth maps, but this necessitates additional depth sensors or defective estimation. In contrast, our work introduces a plug-and-play module that implicitly injects 3D geometry features into VLA models by leveraging an off-the-shelf visual geometry foundation models. We design five spatially challenging tasks that require precise spatial understanding ability to validate effectiveness of our method. Extensive evaluations show that our method significantly improves the performance of state-of-the-art VLA models across diverse scenarios.</p></details> |  |

This limitation is particularly problematic for fixed-focus cameras, such as those used in smart glasses, where adding autofocus mechanisms is challenging due to form factor and power constraints. Due to unmatched optical aberrations and defocus properties unique to each camera system, deep learning models trained on existing open-source datasets often face domain gaps and do not perform well in real-world settings. In this paper, we propose an efficient and scalable dataset synthesis approach that does not rely on fine-tuning with real-world data. Our method simultaneously models depth-dependent defocus and spatially varying optical aberrations, addressing both computational complexity and the scarcity of high-quality RGB-D datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that a network trained on our low resolution synthetic images generalizes effectively to high resolution (12MP) real-world images across diverse scenes.</p></details> |  |

Although these models process two-channel inputs, it is unclear how effectively they retain spatial information. In this work, we evaluate how several popular MSS models preserve spatial information on both standard stereo and novel binaural datasets. Our binaural data is synthesized using stems from MUSDB18-HQ and open-source head-related transfer functions by positioning instrument sources randomly along the horizontal plane. We then assess the spatial quality of the separated stems using signal processing and interaural cue-based metrics. Our results show that stereo MSS models fail to preserve the spatial information critical for maintaining the immersive quality of binaural audio, and that the degradation depends on model architecture as well as the target instrument. Finally, we highlight valuable opportunities for future work at the intersection of MSS and immersive audio.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages + references, 4 figures, 2 tables, 26th International Society for Music Information Retrieval (ISMIR) Conference</p></details> |

As the SPIM can represent Ising problems with rank-one coupling matrices, multiplexed versions have been proposed to enhance the applicability to higher-rank interactions. However, the multiplexing cost reduces the implementation efficiency, and even without multiplexing, the SPIM is known to represent coupling matrices beyond rank-one. In this paper, to clarify the intrinsic representation power of the original SPIM, we propose spatial QUBO (spQUBO), a formulation of Ising problems with spatially convolutional structures. We prove that any spQUBO reduces to a two-dimensional spQUBO, with the convolutional structure preserved, and that any two-dimensional spQUBO can be efficiently implemented on the SPIM without multiplexing. We further demonstrate its practical applicability to distance-based combinatorial optimization, such as placement problems and clustering problems. These results advance our understanding of the class of optimization problems where SPIMs exhibit superior efficiency and scalability. Furthermore, spQUBO's efficiency is not limited to the SPIM architecture; we show that its convolutional structure allows efficient computation using Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT).</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 6 figures (including supplementary information, 7 pages, 1 figure)</p></details> |

A purpose of this paper is to illustrate the utility of using simulation based strategies, including approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods for this task. Shirota and Gelfand (2017) proposed an extended version of an ABC approach for repulsive spatial point processes, including the Strauss point process and the determinantal point process, but their algorithm was not correctly detailed. We explain that is, in general, intractable and therefore impractical to use, except in some restrictive situations. This motivates us to instead consider an ABC-MCMC algorithm developed by Fearnhead and Prangle (2012). We further explore the use of the exchange algorithm, together with the recently proposed noisy Metropolis-Hastings algorithm (Alquier et al., 2016). As an extension of the exchange algorithm, which requires a single simulation from the likelihood at each iteration, the noisy Metropolis-Hastings algorithm considers multiple draws from the same likelihood function. We find that both of these inferential approaches yield good performance for repulsive spatial point processes in both simulated and real data applications and should be considered as viable approaches for the analysis of these models.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, 7 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

As an alternative, predicting gene expression from pathology whole slide images (WSI) is gaining increasing attention. However, existing methods typically rely on single patches or a single pathology modality, neglecting the complex spatial and molecular interactions between target and neighboring information (e.g., gene co-expression). This leads to a failure in establishing connections among adjacent regions and capturing intricate cross-modal relationships. To address these issues, we propose NH2ST, a framework that integrates spatial context and both pathology and gene modalities for gene expression prediction. Our model comprises a query branch and a neighbor branch to process paired target patch and gene data and their neighboring regions, where cross-attention and contrastive learning are employed to capture intrinsic associations and ensure alignments between pathology and gene expression.

Nonstationary spatially varying kernels (see, e.g., Paciorek, 2003) offer flexibility and richness, but computation is impeded by high-dimensional parameter spaces resulting from spatially varying process parameters. Matters are exacerbated if the number of locations recording measurements is massive. With limited theoretical tractability, obviating computational bottlenecks requires synergy between model construction and algorithm development. We build a class of scalable nonstationary spatial process models using spatially varying covariance kernels. We implement a Bayesian modeling framework using Hybrid Monte Carlo with nested interweaving. We conduct experiments on synthetic data sets to explore model selection and parameter identifiability, and assess inferential improvements accrued from nonstationary modeling. We illustrate strengths and pitfalls with a data set on remote sensed normalized difference vegetation index.</p></details> |  |

Despite their prevalence in geospatial tasks, neural network models usually assume spatial stationarity, which could limit their performance in the presence of spatial process heterogeneity. By allowing model parameters to vary over space, several approaches have been proposed to incorporate spatial heterogeneity into neural networks. However, current geographically weighting approaches are ineffective on graph neural networks, yielding no significant improvement in prediction accuracy. We assume the crux lies in the over-fitting risk brought by a large number of local parameters. Accordingly, we propose to model spatial process heterogeneity at the regional level rather than at the individual level, which largely reduces the number of spatially varying parameters. We further develop a heuristic optimization procedure to learn the region partition adaptively in the process of model training. Our proposed spatial-heterogeneity-aware graph convolutional network, named RegionGCN, is applied to the spatial prediction of county-level vote share in the 2016 US presidential election based on socioeconomic attributes. Results show that RegionGCN achieves significant improvement over the basic and geographically weighted GCNs. We also offer an exploratory analysis tool for the spatial variation of non-linear relationships through ensemble learning of regional partitions from RegionGCN.

Although some methods decompose the task into bone length and bone direction prediction based on the human anatomical skeleton to explicitly incorporate more human body prior constraints, the performance of these methods is significantly lower than that of the SOTA diffusion-based methods. This can be attributed to the tree structure of the human skeleton. Direct application of the disentangled method could amplify the accumulation of hierarchical errors, propagating through each hierarchy. Meanwhile, the hierarchical information has not been fully explored by the previous methods. To address these problems, a Disentangled Diffusion-based 3D Human Pose Estimation method with Hierarchical Spatial and Temporal Denoiser is proposed, termed DDHPose. In our approach: (1) We disentangle the 3D pose and diffuse the bone length and bone direction during the forward process of the diffusion model to effectively model the human pose prior. A disentanglement loss is proposed to supervise diffusion model learning. (2) For the reverse process, we propose Hierarchical Spatial and Temporal Denoiser (HSTDenoiser) to improve the hierarchical modeling of each joint. Our HSTDenoiser comprises two components: the Hierarchical-Related Spatial Transformer (HRST) and the Hierarchical-Related Temporal Transformer (HRTT). HRST exploits joint spatial information and the influence of the parent joint on each joint for spatial modeling, while HRTT utilizes information from both the joint and its hierarchical adjacent joints to explore the hierarchical temporal correlations among joints.

We hypothesize that one key factor limiting accuracy is the difficulty of capturing interactions that span distinct spatial and temporal scales, ranging from high-frequency local vibrations to low-frequency global conformational changes. To address these limitations, we propose Graph Fourier Neural ODEs (GF-NODE), integrating a graph Fourier transform for spatial frequency decomposition with a Neural ODE framework for continuous-time evolution. Specifically, GF-NODE first decomposes molecular configurations into multiple spatial frequency modes using the graph Laplacian, then evolves the frequency components in time via a learnable Neural ODE module that captures both local and global dynamics, and finally reconstructs the updated molecular geometry through an inverse graph Fourier transform. By explicitly modeling high- and low-frequency phenomena in this unified pipeline, GF-NODE captures long-range correlations and local fluctuations more effectively. We provide theoretical insight through heat equation analysis on a simplified diffusion model, demonstrating how graph Laplacian eigenvalues can determine temporal dynamics scales, and crucially validate this correspondence through comprehensive empirical analysis on real molecular dynamics trajectories showing quantitative spatial-temporal correlations across diverse molecular systems. Experimental results on challenging MD benchmarks demonstrate that GF-NODE achieves state-of-the-art accuracy while preserving essential geometrical features over extended simulations. These findings highlight the promise of bridging spectral decomposition with continuous-time modeling to improve the robustness and predictive power of MD simulations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in Transactions on Machine Learning Research (06/2025)</p></details> |

A prevalent issue in compositional generation is the misalignment of spatial relationships, as models often fail to faithfully generate images that reflect the spatial configurations specified between objects in the input prompts. To address this challenge, we propose a novel probabilistic framework for modeling the relative spatial positioning of objects in a scene, leveraging the concept of Probability of Superiority (PoS). Building on this insight, we make two key contributions. First, we introduce a novel evaluation metric, PoS-based Evaluation (PSE), designed to assess the alignment of 2D and 3D spatial relationships between text and image, with improved adherence to human judgment. Second, we propose PoS-based Generation (PSG), an inference-time method that improves the alignment of 2D and 3D spatial relationships in T2I models without requiring fine-tuning. PSG employs a Part-of-Speech PoS-based reward function that can be utilized in two distinct ways: (1) as a gradient-based guidance mechanism applied to the cross-attention maps during the denoising steps, or (2) as a search-based strategy that evaluates a set of initial noise vectors to select the best one. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the PSE metric exhibits stronger alignment with human judgment compared to traditional center-based metrics, providing a more nuanced and reliable measure of complex spatial relationship accuracy in text-image alignment. Furthermore, PSG significantly enhances the ability of text-to-image models to generate images with specified spatial configurations, outperforming state-of-the-art methods across multiple evaluation metrics and benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 ma...</summary><p>12 main pages, 18 figures, and 16 tables</p></details> |

But existing clustering methods do not work well for community detection of CosMx ST data, and the commonly used kNN compositional data method shows lack of informative neighboring cell patterns for huge CosMx data. In this article, we propose a novel and more informative disk compositional data (DCD) method, which identifies neighboring patterns of each cell via taking into account of ST data features from recent new technologies. After initial processing ST data into DCD matrix, a new innovative and interpretable DCD-TMHC community detection method is proposed here. Extensive simulation studies and CosMx breast cancer data analysis clearly show that our proposed DCD-TMHC method is superior to other methods. Based on the communities detected by DCD-TMHC method for CosMx breast cancer data, the logistic regression analysis results demonstrate that DCD-TMHC method is clearly interpretable and superior, especially in terms of assessment for different stages of cancer. These suggest that our proposed novel, innovative, informative and interpretable DCD-TMHC method here will be helpful and have impact to future cancer research based on ST data, which can improve cancer diagnosis and monitor cancer treatment progress.</p></details> |  |

Current methods often focus on specific data types and lack a unified framework in urban field for processing them comprehensively. The recent success of multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) presents a promising opportunity to overcome this limitation. In this paper, we introduce $\textit{UrbanLLaVA}$, a multi-modal large language model designed to process these four types of data simultaneously and achieve strong performance across diverse urban tasks compared with general MLLMs. In $\textit{UrbanLLaVA}$, we first curate a diverse urban instruction dataset encompassing both single-modal and cross-modal urban data, spanning from location view to global view of urban environment. Additionally, we propose a multi-stage training framework that decouples spatial reasoning enhancement from domain knowledge learning, thereby improving the compatibility and downstream performance of $\textit{UrbanLLaVA}$ across diverse urban tasks.

The motivation stems from the observation that images exhibit local structures, and spatially distant regions tend to have minimal interdependence. Given a partially decoded set of visual tokens, in addition to the original next-token prediction scheme in the row dimension, the tokens corresponding to spatially adjacent regions in the column dimension can be decoded in parallel, enabling the ``next-set prediction'' paradigm. By decoding multiple tokens simultaneously in a single forward pass, the number of forward passes required to generate an image is significantly reduced, resulting in a substantial improvement in generation efficiency. Experiments demonstrate that ZipAR can reduce the number of model forward passes by up to 91% on the Emu3-Gen model without requiring any additional retraining.

However, existing methods may still encounter challenges in handling complex instructions that require accurate spatial reasoning, even if the 3D point cloud data provides detailed spatial cues such as size and position for identifying the targets. To tackle this issue, we propose Relevant Reasoning Segmentation (R$^2$S), a reasoning-based segmentation framework. The framework emulates human cognitive processes by decomposing spatial reasoning into two sequential stages: first identifying relevant elements, then processing instructions guided by their associated visual priors. Furthermore, acknowledging the inadequacy of existing datasets in complex reasoning tasks, we introduce 3D ReasonSeg, a reasoning-based segmentation dataset comprising 25,185 training samples and 3,966 validation samples with precise annotations. Both quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that the R$^2$S and 3D ReasonSeg effectively endow 3D point cloud perception with stronger spatial reasoning capabilities, and we hope that they can serve as a new baseline and benchmark for future work.</p></details> |  |

However, existing reasoning benchmarks focus on text-only reasoning, or employ multimodal questions that can be answered by directly retrieving information from a non-text modality. Thus, complex reasoning remains poorly understood in multimodal domains. Here, we present MARBLE, a challenging multimodal reasoning benchmark that is designed to scrutinize multimodal language models (MLLMs) in their ability to carefully reason step-by-step through complex multimodal problems and environments. MARBLE is composed of two highly challenging tasks, M-Portal and M-Cube, that require the crafting and understanding of multistep plans under spatial, visual, and physical constraints. We find that current MLLMs perform poorly on MARBLE -- all the 12 advanced models obtain near-random performance on M-Portal and 0% accuracy on M-Cube. Only in simplified subtasks some models outperform the random baseline, indicating that complex reasoning is still a challenge for existing MLLMs. Moreover, we show that perception remains a bottleneck, where MLLMs occasionally fail to extract information from the visual inputs. By shedding a light on the limitations of MLLMs, we hope that MARBLE will spur the development of the next generation of models with the ability to reason and plan across many, multimodal reasoning steps.</p></details> |  |

However, current error compensation methods face several critical challenges, including overly simplified mechanism modeling, a lack of physical consistency in data-driven approaches, and substantial data requirements. These issues make it difficult to achieve both high accuracy and strong generalization simultaneously. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a Spatial-Physical Informed Attention Residual Network (SPI-BoTER). This method integrates the kinematic equations of the robotic manipulator with a Transformer architecture enhanced by sparse self-attention masks. A parameter-adaptive hybrid loss function incorporating spatial and physical information is employed to iteratively optimize the network during training, enabling high-precision error compensation under small-sample conditions. Additionally, inverse joint angle compensation is performed using a gradient descent-based optimization method. Experimental results on a small-sample dataset from a UR5 robotic arm (724 samples, with a train:test:validation split of 8:1:1) demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method. It achieves a 3D absolute positioning error of 0.2515 mm with a standard deviation of 0.15 mm, representing a 35.16\% reduction in error compared to conventional deep neural network (DNN) methods. Furthermore, the inverse angle compensation algorithm converges to an accuracy of 0.01 mm within an average of 147 iterations. This study presents a solution that combines physical interpretability with data adaptability for high-precision control of industrial robots, offering promising potential for the reliable execution of precision tasks in intelligent manufacturing.</p></details> |  |

Such hybrid interfaces combine both traditional and immersive displays to facilitate the exploration of 2D and 3D data representations in the environment in which they are best displayed. One key aspect is to introduce transitional animations that change between the different dimensionalities to illustrate the connection between the different representations and to reduce the potential cognitive load on the user. The specific transitions to be used depend on the type of data, the needs of the application domain, and other factors. We summarize these as a transition design space to simplify the decision-making process and provide inspiration for future designs. First, we discuss 3D visualizations from a spatial perspective: a spatial encoding pipeline, where 3D data sampled from the physical world goes through various transformations, being mapped to visual representations, and then being integrated into a hybrid AR-desktop environment. The transition design then focuses on interpolating between two spatial encoding pipelines to provide a smooth experience. To illustrate the use of our design space, we apply it to three case studies that focus on applications in astronomy, radiology, and chemistry; we then discuss lessons learned from these applications.</p></details> | 14 pages, 6 figures |

Although video super-resolution (VSR) is an efficient video enhancing technique, existing VSR methods focus less on compressed videos. Consequently, directly applying general VSR approaches fails to improve practical videos with compression artifacts, especially when frames are highly compressed at a low bit rate. The inevitable quantization information loss complicates the reconstruction of texture details. Recently, diffusion models have shown superior performance in low-level visual tasks. Leveraging the high-realism generation capability of diffusion models, we propose a novel method that exploits the priors of pre-trained diffusion models for compressed VSR. To mitigate spatial distortions and refine temporal consistency, we introduce a Spatial Degradation-Aware and Temporal Consistent (SDATC) diffusion model. Specifically, we incorporate a distortion control module (DCM) to modulate diffusion model inputs, thereby minimizing the impact of noise from low-quality frames on the generation stage. Subsequently, the diffusion model performs a denoising process to generate details, guided by a fine-tuned compression-aware prompt module (CAPM) and a spatio-temporal attention module (STAM). CAPM dynamically encodes compression-related information into prompts, enabling the sampling process to adapt to different degradation levels. Meanwhile, STAM extends the spatial attention mechanism into the spatio-temporal dimension, effectively capturing temporal correlations. Additionally, we utilize optical flow-based alignment during each denoising step to enhance the smoothness of output videos. Extensive experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed modules in restoring compressed videos.</p></details> |  |

To address this limitation, we propose a novel neural network, termed WTFormer, for MIMO speech enhancement that leverages the multi-resolution characteristics of wavelet transform and multi-dimensional collaborative attention to effectively capture globally distributed spatial features, while using Conformer for time-frequency modeling. A multi task loss strategy accompanying MUSIC algorithm is further proposed for optimization training to protect spatial information to the greatest extent. Experimental results on the LibriSpeech dataset show that WTFormer can achieve comparable denoising performance to advanced systems while preserving more spatial information with only 0.98M parameters.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Interspeech2025</p></details> |

The World Health Organization 2023 report highlights that road traffic injuries are the leading cause of death among individuals aged 5-29, with over half of fatalities involving pedestrians, cyclists, and motorcyclists. This study addresses this critical issue by identifying high-risk areas in Montgomery County, Maryland, contributing to the global goal of halving road traffic deaths and injuries by 2030. Using Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) and spatial autocorrelation analysis, we estimate collision densities and identify hotspots for targeted interventions. Our findings reveal significant spatial clustering of traffic collisions, with distinct patterns in densely populated urban areas and rural regions, offering valuable insights for policymakers to enhance road safety.</p></details> |  |

To alleviate the reliance on costly 3D training data, recent studies have explored zero-shot 3DVG by leveraging the extensive knowledge and powerful reasoning capabilities of pre-trained LLMs and VLMs. However, existing paradigms tend to emphasize either spatial (3D-based) or semantic (2D-based) understanding, limiting their effectiveness in complex real-world applications. In this work, we introduce SPAZER - a VLM-driven agent that combines both modalities in a progressive reasoning framework. It first holistically analyzes the scene and produces a 3D rendering from the optimal viewpoint. Based on this, anchor-guided candidate screening is conducted to perform a coarse-level localization of potential objects. Furthermore, leveraging retrieved relevant 2D camera images, 3D-2D joint decision-making is efficiently performed to determine the best-matching object. By bridging spatial and semantic reasoning neural streams, SPAZER achieves robust zero-shot grounding without training on 3D-labeled data. Extensive experiments on ScanRefer and Nr3D benchmarks demonstrate that SPAZER significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art zero-shot methods, achieving notable gains of 9.0% and 10.9% in accuracy.</p></details> |  |

This study addresses the challenge of estimating a static, spatially-varying error function using a team of robots. We introduce a State Bias Estimation Algorithm (SBE) whose purpose is to estimate the GPS biases. The central idea is to use sensed estimates of the range and bearing to the other robots in the team to estimate changes in bias across the environment. A set of drones moves in a 2D environment, each sampling data from GPS, range, and bearing sensors. The biases calculated by the SBE at estimated positions are used to train a Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) model. We use a Sparse Gaussian process-based Informative Path Planning (IPP) algorithm that identifies high-value regions of the environment for data collection. The swarm plans paths that maximize information gain in each iteration, further refining their understanding of the environment's positional bias landscape. We evaluated SBE and IPP in simulation and compared the IPP methodology to an open-loop strategy.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 7 figures, 2025 IEEE 21st International Conference on Automation Science and Engineering</p></details> |

While multimodal approaches integrating diverse data sources have emerged, a critical gap remains in the comprehensive integration of whole-slide images (WSIs) with spatial transcriptomics (ST), which is crucial for capturing critical molecular heterogeneity beyond standard hematoxylin & eosin (H&E) staining. We introduce SPADE, a foundation model that integrates histopathology with ST data to guide image representation learning within a unified framework, in effect creating an ST-informed latent space. SPADE leverages a mixture-of-data experts technique, where experts, created via two-stage feature-space clustering, use contrastive learning to learn representations of co-registered WSI patches and gene expression profiles. Pre-trained on the comprehensive HEST-1k dataset, SPADE is evaluated on 14 downstream tasks, demonstrating significantly superior few-shot performance compared to baseline models, highlighting the benefits of integrating morphological and molecular information into one latent space.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we introduce SpatialReasoner-R1, a vision-language reasoning model designed to address these limitations. To construct high-quality supervision for spatial reasoning, we design a Multi-Model Monte Carlo Tree Search (M3CTS) method that generates diverse, logically consistent Long Chain-of-Thought (LongCoT) reasoning trajectories. In addition, we propose fine-grained Direct Preference Optimization (fDPO), which introduces segment-specific preference granularity for descriptive grounding and logical reasoning, guided by a spatial reward mechanism that evaluates candidate responses based on visual consistency, spatial grounding, and logical coherence. Experimental results demonstrate that fDPO achieves an average improvement of 4.1% over standard DPO across spatial quality tasks, and a 9.0% gain in spatial quantity tasks. SpatialReasoner-R1, trained with fDPO, sets a new SoTA on SPATIALRGPT-Bench, outperforming the strongest baseline by 9.8% in average accuracy, while maintaining competitive performance on general vision-language tasks.</p></details> | 29 pages |

Humans form spatial mental models, internal representations of unseen space, to reason about layout, perspective, and motion. Our new MindCube benchmark with 21,154 questions across 3,268 images exposes this critical gap, where existing VLMs exhibit near-random performance. Using MindCube, we systematically evaluate how well VLMs build robust spatial mental models through representing positions (cognitive mapping), orientations (perspective-taking), and dynamics (mental simulation for "what-if" movements). We then explore three approaches to help VLMs approximate spatial mental models, including unseen intermediate views, natural language reasoning chains, and cognitive maps. The significant improvement comes from a synergistic approach, "map-then-reason", that jointly trains the model to first generate a cognitive map and then reason upon it. By training models to reason over these internal maps, we boosted accuracy from 37.8% to 60.8% (+23.0%). Adding reinforcement learning pushed performance even further to 70.7% (+32.9%). Our key insight is that such scaffolding of spatial mental models, actively constructing and utilizing internal structured spatial representations with flexible reasoning processes, significantly improves understanding of unobservable space.</p></details> | Preprint version |

While MLLMs have been extensively studied for visual semantic understanding tasks, their ability to perform precise and quantitative spatial-temporal understanding in real-world applications remains largely unexamined, leading to uncertain prospects. To evaluate models' Spatial-Temporal Intelligence, we introduce STI-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs' spatial-temporal understanding through challenging tasks such as estimating and predicting the appearance, pose, displacement, and motion of objects. Our benchmark encompasses a wide range of robot and vehicle operations across desktop, indoor, and outdoor scenarios. The extensive experiments reveals that the state-of-the-art MLLMs still struggle in real-world spatial-temporal understanding, especially in tasks requiring precise distance estimation and motion analysis.</p></details> |  |

This model incorporates additional audio features (spectral roll-off and chroma features) into the embedding feature extracted from the mel-spectral feature to im-prove the classification capabilities of an audio-tagging model in the spatial semantic segmentation of sound scenes (S5) system. This approach is motivated by the fact that mixed audio often contains subtle cues that are difficult to capture with mel-spectrograms alone. Thus, these additional features offer alterna-tive perspectives for the model. Second, an agent-based label correction system is applied to the outputs processed by the S5 system. This system reduces false positives, improving the final class-aware signal-to-distortion ratio improvement (CA-SDRi) metric. Finally, we refine the training dataset to enhance the classi-fication accuracy of low-performing classes by removing irrele-vant samples and incorporating external data. That is, audio mix-tures are generated from a limited number of data points; thus, even a small number of out-of-class data points could degrade model performance. The experiments demonstrate that the submit-ted systems employing these approaches relatively improve CA-SDRi by up to 14.7% compared to the baseline of DCASE 2025 Challenge Task 4.</p></details> | <details><summary>DCASE...</summary><p>DCASE 2025 challenge Task4, 5 pages</p></details> |

Therefore, estimating the counterfactual outcomes with spatial-temporal attributes is a crucial problem. However, previous methods are based on classical statistical models, which still have limitations in performance and generalization. This paper proposes a novel framework for estimating counterfactual outcomes with spatial-temporal attributes using the Transformer, exhibiting stronger estimation ability. Under mild assumptions, the proposed estimator within this framework is consistent and asymptotically normal. To validate the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct simulation experiments and real data experiments. Simulation experiments show that our estimator has a stronger estimation capability than baseline methods. Real data experiments provide a valuable conclusion to the causal effect of conflicts on forest loss in Colombia.

However, complex spatiotemporal relationships in traffic systems continue to limit the performance of demand forecasting models. To improve the accuracy of spatiotemporal traffic demand prediction, we propose a new graph convolutional network structure called DKGCM. Specifically, we first consider the spatial flow distribution of different traffic nodes and propose a novel temporal similarity-based clustering graph convolution method, DK-GCN. This method utilizes Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and K-means clustering to group traffic nodes and more effectively capture spatial dependencies. On the temporal scale, we integrate the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) within the bidirectional Mamba deep learning framework to capture temporal dependencies in traffic demand. To further optimize model training, we incorporate the GRPO reinforcement learning strategy to enhance the loss function feedback mechanism. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms several advanced methods and achieves strong results on three public datasets.</p></details> | 39 pages, 14 figures |

Existing forgery detection methods typically rely on single visual features to capture predefined artifacts, such as spatial-domain cues to detect forged objects like roads or buildings in RSI, or frequency-domain features to identify artifacts from up-sampling operations in adversarial generative networks (GANs). However, the nature of artifacts can significantly differ depending on geographic terrain, land cover types, or specific features within the RSI. Moreover, these complex artifacts evolve as generative models become more sophisticated. In short, over-reliance on a single visual cue makes existing forgery detectors struggle to generalize across diverse remote sensing data. This paper proposed a novel forgery detection framework called SFNet, designed to identify fake images in diverse remote sensing data by leveraging spatial and frequency domain features. Specifically, to obtain rich and comprehensive visual information, SFNet employs two independent feature extractors to capture spatial and frequency domain features from input RSIs. To fully utilize the complementary domain features, the domain feature mapping module and the hybrid domain feature refinement module(CBAM attention) of SFNet are designed to successively align and fuse the multi-domain features while suppressing redundant information. Experiments on three datasets show that SFNet achieves an accuracy improvement of 4%-15.18% over the state-of-the-art RS forgery detection methods and exhibits robust generalization capabilities.

To address the registration challenge, most existing methods employ spatial transformations on the HSI to achieve alignment with the MSI. However, due to the substantial differences in spatial resolution of the images, the performance of these methods is often unsatisfactory. Moreover, the registration process tends to be time-consuming when dealing with large-sized images in remote sensing. To address these issues, we propose tackling the registration problem from the spectral domain. Initially, a lightweight Spectral Prior Learning (SPL) network is developed to extract spectral features from the HSI and enhance the spectral resolution of the MSI. Following this, the obtained image undergoes spatial downsampling to produce the registered HSI. In this process, subspace representation and cyclic training strategy are employed to improve spectral accuracy of the registered HSI obtained. Next, we propose a blind sparse fusion (BSF) method, which utilizes group sparsity regularization to equivalently promote the low-rankness of the image. This approach not only circumvents the need for rank estimation, but also reduces computational complexity. Then, we employ the Proximal Alternating Optimization (PAO) algorithm to solve the BSF model, and present its convergence analysis. Finally, extensive numerical experiments on simulated and real datasets are conducted to verify the effectiveness of our method in registration and fusion. We also demonstrate its efficacy in enhancing classification performance.</p></details> |  |

However, existing PointMamba-based methods depend on complex token ordering and random masking, which disrupt spatial continuity and local semantic correlations. We propose ZigzagPointMamba to tackle these challenges. The core of our approach is a simple zigzag scan path that globally sequences point cloud tokens, enhancing spatial continuity by preserving the proximity of spatially adjacent point tokens. Nevertheless, random masking undermines local semantic modeling in self-supervised learning. To address this, we introduce a Semantic-Siamese Masking Strategy (SMS), which masks semantically similar tokens to facilitate reconstruction by integrating local features of original and similar tokens. This overcomes the dependence on isolated local features and enables robust global semantic modeling. Our pre-trained ZigzagPointMamba weights significantly improve downstream tasks, achieving a 1.59% mIoU gain on ShapeNetPart for part segmentation, a 0.4% higher accuracy on ModelNet40 for classification, and 0.19%, 1.22%, and 0.72% higher accuracies respectively for the classification tasks on the OBJ-BG, OBJ-ONLY, and PB-T50-RS subsets of ScanObjectNN.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The format of the document has an error and needs to be revised</p></details> |

However, existing methods primarily rely on the visual token's feature similarity for token merging, overlooking the potential of integrating spatial information, which can serve as a reliable criterion for token merging in the early layers of ViT, where the visual tokens only possess weak visual information. In this paper, we propose ToSA, a novel token merging method that combines both semantic and spatial awareness to guide the token merging process. ToSA leverages the depth image as input to generate pseudo spatial tokens, which serve as auxiliary spatial information for the visual token merging process. With the introduced spatial awareness, ToSA achieves a more informed merging strategy that better preserves critical scene structure. Experimental results demonstrate that ToSA outperforms previous token merging methods across multiple benchmarks on visual and embodied question answering while largely reducing the runtime of the ViT, making it an efficient solution for ViT acceleration.

In this study, we propose a Two-Stream Spatial-Temporal Transformer Framework for person identification using upper body keypoints visible during online conversations, which we term conversational keypoints. Our framework processes both spatial relationships between keypoints and their temporal evolution through two specialized branches: a Spatial Transformer (STR) that learns distinctive structural patterns in keypoint configurations, and a Temporal Transformer (TTR) that captures sequential motion patterns. Using the state-of-the-art Sapiens pose estimator, we extract 133 keypoints (based on COCO-WholeBody format) representing facial features, head pose, and hand positions. The framework was evaluated on a dataset of 114 individuals engaged in natural conversations, achieving recognition accuracies of 80.12% for the spatial stream, 63.61% for the temporal stream. We then explored two fusion strategies: a shared loss function approach achieving 82.22% accuracy, and a feature-level fusion method that concatenates feature maps from both streams, significantly improving performance to 94.86%.

Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential in robotic manipulation tasks, primarily due to the extensive world knowledge they gain from large-scale datasets. In this process, Spatial Representations (such as points representing object positions or vectors representing object orientations) act as a bridge between VLMs and real-world scene, effectively grounding the reasoning abilities of VLMs and applying them to specific task scenarios. However, existing VLM-based robotic approaches often adopt a fixed spatial representation extraction scheme for various tasks, resulting in insufficient representational capability or excessive extraction time. In this work, we introduce T-Rex, a Task-Adaptive Framework for Spatial Representation Extraction, which dynamically selects the most appropriate spatial representation extraction scheme for each entity based on specific task requirements. Our key insight is that task complexity determines the types and granularity of spatial representations, and Stronger representational capabilities are typically associated with Higher overall system operation costs. Through comprehensive experiments in real-world robotic environments, we show that our approach delivers significant advantages in spatial understanding, efficiency, and stability without additional training.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted to NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

Prior modular pipelines offer interpretability but lack unified memory, while end-to-end (M)LLM agents excel at fusing vision and language yet remain constrained by fixed context windows and implicit spatial reasoning. We introduce \textbf{Mem4Nav}, a hierarchical spatial-cognition long-short memory system that can augment any VLN backbone. Mem4Nav fuses a sparse octree for fine-grained voxel indexing with a semantic topology graph for high-level landmark connectivity, storing both in trainable memory tokens embedded via a reversible Transformer. Long-term memory (LTM) compresses and retains historical observations at both octree and graph nodes, while short-term memory (STM) caches recent multimodal entries in relative coordinates for real-time obstacle avoidance and local planning. At each step, STM retrieval sharply prunes dynamic context, and, when deeper history is needed, LTM tokens are decoded losslessly to reconstruct past embeddings. Evaluated on Touchdown and Map2Seq across three backbones (modular, state-of-the-art VLN with prompt-based LLM, and state-of-the-art VLN with strided-attention MLLM), Mem4Nav yields 7-13 pp gains in Task Completion, sufficient SPD reduction, and >10 pp nDTW improvement. Ablations confirm the indispensability of both the hierarchical map and dual memory modules. Our codes are open-sourced via https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/Mem4Nav.</p></details> |  |

Loss functions play a central role in optimizing and evaluating algorithms that generate binaural signals. However, traditional signal-related difference measures often fail to capture the perceptual properties that are essential to spatial audio quality. This review paper surveys recent loss functions that incorporate spatial perception cues relevant to binaural reproduction. It focuses on losses applied to binaural signals, which are often derived from microphone recordings or Ambisonics signals, while excluding those based on room impulse responses. Guided by the Spatial Audio Quality Inventory (SAQI), the review emphasizes perceptual dimensions related to source localization and room response, while excluding general spectral-temporal attributes. The literature survey reveals a strong focus on localization cues, such as interaural time and level differences (ITDs, ILDs), while reverberation and other room acoustic attributes remain less explored in loss function design. Recent works that estimate room acoustic parameters and develop embeddings that capture room characteristics indicate their potential for future integration into neural network training. The paper concludes by highlighting future research directions toward more perceptually grounded loss functions that better capture the listener's spatial experience.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to I3DA 2025</p></details> |

A drawback of Gaussian processes is their computational cost having $\mathcal{O}(N^3)$ time and $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ memory complexity which makes them prohibitive for large data sets. Numerous approximation techniques have been proposed to address this limitation. In this work, we systematically compare the accuracy of different Gaussian process approximations concerning likelihood evaluation, parameter estimation, and prediction taking into account the computational time required to perform these tasks. In other words, we analyze the trade-off between accuracy and runtime on multiple simulated and large-scale real-world data sets. We find that Vecchia approximations consistently emerge as the most accurate in almost all experiments.</p></details> |  |

Current deep learning architectures for remote sensing are fundamentally rigid. They are engineered for fixed input-output configurations, restricting their adaptability to the heterogeneous spatial, temporal, and spectral dimensions inherent in real-world data. Furthermore, these models neglect the intrinsic correlations among semantic segmentation, binary change detection, and semantic change detection, necessitating the development of distinct models or task-specific decoders. This paradigm is also constrained to a predefined set of output semantic classes, where any change to the classes requires costly retraining. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the Spatial-Temporal-Spectral Unified Network (STSUN) for unified modeling. STSUN can adapt to input and output data with arbitrary spatial sizes, temporal lengths, and spectral bands by leveraging their metadata for a unified representation. Moreover, STSUN unifies disparate dense prediction tasks within a single architecture by conditioning the model on trainable task embeddings. Similarly, STSUN facilitates flexible prediction across any set of semantic categories by integrating trainable category embeddings as metadata. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets with diverse STS configurations in multiple scenarios demonstrate that a single STSUN model effectively adapts to heterogeneous inputs and outputs, unifying various dense prediction tasks and diverse semantic class predictions. The proposed approach consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, highlighting its robustness and generalizability for complex remote sensing applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 6 figures, Code link:https://github.com/walking-shadow/Official_TSSUN</p></details> |
| **[Progressive Cross-Stream Cooperation in Spatial and Temporal Domain for Action Localization](http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.11575v2)** | 2025-06-24 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/1905.11575v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal action localization consists of three levels of tasks: spatial localization, action classification, and temporal localization. In this work, we propose a new progressive cross-stream cooperation (PCSC) framework that improves all three tasks above. The basic idea is to utilize both spatial region (resp., temporal segment proposals) and features from one stream (i.e., the Flow/RGB stream) to help another stream (i.e., the RGB/Flow stream) to iteratively generate better bounding boxes in the spatial domain (resp., temporal segments in the temporal domain). In this way, not only the actions could be more accurately localized both spatially and temporally, but also the action classes could be predicted more precisely. Specifically, we first combine the latest region proposals (for spatial detection) or segment proposals (for temporal localization) from both streams to form a larger set of labelled training samples to help learn better action detection or segment detection models. Second, to learn better representations, we also propose a new message passing approach to pass information from one stream to another stream, which also leads to better action detection and segment detection models. By first using our newly proposed PCSC framework for spatial localization at the frame-level and then applying our temporal PCSC framework for temporal localization at the tube-level, the action localization results are progressively improved at both the frame level and the video level. Comprehensive experiments on two benchmark datasets UCF-101-24 and J-HMDB demonstrate the effectiveness of our newly proposed approaches for spatio-temporal action localization in realistic scenarios.</p></details> | TPAMI |

Spatial regionalization remains largely unexplored in quantum computing due to its complexity and large number of variables. In this paper, we introduce the first hybrid quantum-classical method to spatial regionalization by decomposing the problem into manageable subproblems, leveraging the strengths of both classical and quantum computation. This study establishes a foundational framework for effectively integrating quantum computing methods into realistic and complex spatial optimization tasks. Our initial results show a promising quantum performance advantage for a broad range of spatial regionalization problems and their variants.</p></details> |  |

However, due to occlusions and data sparsity, these sensors often fail to capture complete information. Semantic Occupancy Prediction (SOP) addresses this challenge by inferring both occupancy and semantics of unobserved regions. Existing transformer-based SOP methods lack explicit modeling of spatial structure in attention computation, resulting in limited geometric awareness and poor performance in sparse or occluded areas. To this end, we propose Spatially-aware Window Attention (SWA), a novel mechanism that incorporates local spatial context into attention. SWA significantly improves scene completion and achieves state-of-the-art results on LiDAR-based SOP benchmarks. We further validate its generality by integrating SWA into a camera-based SOP pipeline, where it also yields consistent gains across modalities.</p></details> | under reviewed |
| **[A Spatial-Domain Coordinated Control Method for CAVs at Unsignalized Intersections Considering Motion Uncertainty](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04290v2)** | 2025-06-23 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2412.04290v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Coordinated control of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) emerges as a promising technology to improve traffic safety, efficiency, and sustainability. Meanwhile, mixed traffic, where CAVs coexist with conventional human-driven vehicles (HDVs), represents an upcoming and necessary stage in the development of intelligent transportation systems. Considering the motion uncertainty of HDVs, this paper proposes a coordinated control method for trajectory planning of CAVs at an unsignalized intersection in mixed traffic. By sampling in distance and using an exact change of variables, the coordinated control problem is formulated in the spatial domain as a nonlinear program, thereby allowing for unified linear collision avoidance constraints to handle vehicle crossing, following, merging, and diverging conflicts. The motion uncertainty of HDVs is decoupled and modeled as path uncertainty and speed uncertainty, whereby the robustness of collision avoidance is ensured in both spatial and temporal dimensions. The prediction deviation for HDVs is compensated by receding horizon optimization, and a real-time iteration (RTI) scheme is developed to improve computational efficiency. Simulation case studies are conducted to validate the efficacy, robustness, and potential for real-time application of the proposed methods. The results show that the proposed control scheme provides collision-free and smooth trajectories with state and control constraints satisfied. Compared with the converged baseline, the RTI scheme reduces the computation time by orders of magnitude, and the solution deviation is less than 2.3%, demonstrating a favorable trade-off between computational effort and optimality.</p></details> | 15 pages, 15 figures |

Specifically, a physics-informed neural network, referred to as Neural Steerer, is used to interpolate measured steering vectors (SVs) on a fixed microphone array. This allows for a more robust estimation of the so-called $\alpha$-stable spatial measure, which represents the most plausible direction of arrival (DOA) of a target signal. As an $\alpha$-stable model for the non-Gaussian case ($\alpha$ $\in$ (0, 2)) theoretically defines a unique spatial measure, we choose to leverage it to account for residual reconstruction error of the Neural Steerer in the downstream tasks. The objective scores indicate that our proposed technique outperforms state-of-the-art methods in the case of multiple sound sources.</p></details> | <details><summary>Europ...</summary><p>European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO), Sep 2025, Palermo, Italy</p></details> |

In this work, we introduce InternSpatial, the largest open-source dataset for spatial reasoning in VLMs, along with InternSpatial-Bench, a corresponding evaluation benchmark designed to assess spatial understanding under diverse instruction formats. InternSpatial comprises 12 million QA pairs spanning both single-view and multi-view settings, drawn from diverse visual environments and supporting 19 instruction formats that reflect varied query styles. For evaluation, we propose InternSpatial-Bench for single-view tasks and expand multi-view reasoning by introducing a novel rotation angle prediction task that has not been explored in prior work. Experimental results show that models trained on InternSpatial achieve 12.1% improvement on InternSpatial-Bench and 10.7% on VSI-Bench, while maintaining strong performance on general-purpose benchmarks. We hope these resources will support the development of spatially capable VLMs in practical applications such as robotics and embodied AI.</p></details> |  |

In practical applications, the number of images in each category is usually less than that in traditional deep learning, which can lead to over-fitting and poor generalization performance. Currently, many Few-shot classification models pay more attention to spatial domain information while neglecting frequency domain information, which contains more feature information. Ignoring frequency domain information will prevent the model from fully exploiting feature information, which would effect the classification performance. Based on conventional data augmentation, this paper proposes an SFIFNet with innovative data preprocessing. The key of this method is enhancing the accuracy of image feature representation by integrating frequency domain information with spatial domain information. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of this method in enhancing classification performance.</p></details> |  |

At training time, models for estimating treatment effects are typically trained on well-structured medical datasets that contain detailed patient information. However, at inference time, predictions are often made using textual descriptions (e.g., descriptions with self-reported symptoms), which are incomplete representations of the original patient information. In this work, we make three contributions. (1) We show that the discrepancy between the data available during training time and inference time can lead to biased estimates of treatment effects. We formalize this issue as an inference time text confounding problem, where confounders are fully observed during training time but only partially available through text at inference time. (2) To address this problem, we propose a novel framework for estimating treatment effects that explicitly accounts for inference time text confounding. Our framework leverages large language models together with a custom doubly robust learner to mitigate biases caused by the inference time text confounding. (3) Through a series of experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

We focus on the recovery of an unknown spatial source function in a multi-dimensional TSFDE, incorporating Caputo time-fractional derivatives and the fractional Laplacian. The inherent ill-posedness is addressed via a quasi-boundary value regularization, followed by a finite difference discretization that leads to large, structured linear systems. We develop and analyze a block triangular preconditioning strategy that mimics the coefficient matrix, while simplifying its structure for computational efficiency. Numerical experiments using the GMRES solver demonstrate that the proposed preconditioner significantly improve convergence rates, robustness, and accuracy, making it well-suited for large-scale, real-world inverse problems involving fractional modeling.</p></details> |  |

To accelerate algorithmic progress, a recent benchmark released intracranial recordings from a paralyzed participant attempting to speak, along with a baseline decoding algorithm. Prior work on the benchmark showed impressive accuracy gains. However, these gains increased computational costs and were not demonstrated in a real-time decoding setting. Here, we make three contributions that pave the way towards accurate, efficient, and real-time neural speech decoding. First, we incorporate large amounts of time masking during training. On average, over $50\%$ of each trial is masked. Second, we replace the gated recurrent unit (GRU) architecture used in the baseline algorithm with a compact Transformer. The Transformer architecture uses $77\%$ fewer parameters, cuts peak GPU memory usage by $36\%$ relative, and is significantly faster to calibrate relative to the GRU. Third, we design a lightweight variant of an existing test-time adaptation method developed for decoding handwriting from neural activity. Our variant adapts the model using multiple time masked augmentations of a single trial and requires only one gradient step per trial. Together, these contributions reduce word error rate by $19.5\%$ and effectively mitigate performance degradations across held-out days in a real-time decoding setting while substantially lowering computational costs.</p></details> | 10 pages, 4 figures |

At the same time, we show that the happy edge property does not hold in this setting. This has to be seen in contrast to several results for reconfiguration problems where the absence of the happy edge property implies algorithmic hardness of the flip distance problem. Further, we show that our algorithm can be adapted for (1) compatible flips (2) local flips and (3) flips for plane spanning paths in simple polygons.</p></details> | 16 pages, 12 Figures |

Non-exact abstractions, however, introduce an approximation error making convergence to the optimal action in the abstract space impossible. Hence, as proposed as a component of Elastic Monte Carlo Tree Search by Xu et al., abstraction algorithms should eventually drop the abstraction. In this paper, we propose two novel abstraction dropping schemes, namely OGA-IAAD and OGA-CAD which can yield clear performance improvements whilst being safe in the sense that the dropping never causes any notable performance degradations contrary to Xu's dropping method. OGA-IAAD is designed for time critical settings while OGA-CAD is designed to improve the MCTS performance with the same number of iterations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for Publication at the IEEE Conference on Games 2025</p></details> |

We use the Spatiotemporal Generative Adversarial Network (STGAN) framework combining Graph Neural Networks and Long Short-Term Memory networks to capture complex spatial and temporal dependencies in traffic data. We apply STGAN to real-time, minute-by-minute observations from 42 traffic cameras across Gothenburg, Sweden, collected over several months in 2020. The images are processed to compute a flow metric representing vehicle density, which serves as input for the model. Training is conducted on data from April to November 2020, and validation is performed on a separate dataset from November 14 to 23, 2020. Our results demonstrate that the model effectively detects traffic anomalies with high precision and low false positive rates. The detected anomalies include camera signal interruptions, visual artifacts, and extreme weather conditions affecting traffic flow.</p></details> |  |

Departing from classical Tikhonov regularization, we propose a novel approach based on moment analysis of the heat flow, transforming the problem into a more stable inverse moment formulation. By evolving the measured terminal time moments backward through their governing ODE system, we recover the moments of the initial distribution. We then reconstruct the source by solving a convex optimization problem that minimizes the total variation of a measure subject to these moment constraints. This formulation naturally promotes sparsity, yielding atomic solutions that are sums of Dirac measures. Compared to existing methods, our moment-based approach reduces exponential error growth to polynomial growth with respect to the terminal time. We provide explicit error estimates on the recovered initial distributions in terms of moment order, terminal time, and measurement errors. In addition, we develop efficient numerical discretization schemes and demonstrate significant stability improvements of our approach through comprehensive numerical experiments.</p></details> | 30 pages |

A particularly challenging scenario involves materials exhibiting a sparkling or glittering appearance, caused by discrete microfacets scattered across their surface. In this paper, we propose an efficient approximation for image-based lighting of glints, enabling fully dynamic material properties and environment maps. Our novel approach is grounded in real-time glint rendering under area light illumination and employs standard environment map filtering techniques. Crucially, our environment map filtering process is sufficiently fast to be executed on a per-frame basis. Our method assumes that the environment map is partitioned into few homogeneous regions of constant radiance. By filtering the corresponding indicator functions with the normal distribution function, we obtain the probabilities for individual microfacets to reflect light from each region. During shading, these probabilities are utilized to hierarchically sample a multinomial distribution, facilitated by our novel dual-gated Gaussian approximation of binomial distributions. We validate that our real-time approximation is close to ground-truth renderings for a range of material properties and lighting conditions, and demonstrate robust and stable performance, with little overhead over rendering glints from a single directional light. Compared to rendering smooth materials without glints, our approach requires twice as much memory to store the prefiltered environment map.</p></details> |  |

While its effects on training stability are well documented, its role at inference time is poorly understood. Additionally, LN layers hinder mechanistic interpretability by introducing additional nonlinearities and increasing the interconnectedness of individual model components. Here, we show that all LN layers can be removed from every GPT-2 model with only a small increase in validation loss (e.g. +0.03 cross-entropy loss for GPT-2 XL). Thus, LN cannot play a substantial role in language modeling. We find that the amount of fine-tuning data needed for LN removal grows sublinearly with model parameters, suggesting scaling to larger models is feasible. We release a suite of LN-free GPT-2 models on Hugging Face. Furthermore, we test interpretability techniques on LN-free models. Direct logit attribution now gives the exact direct effect of individual components, while the accuracy of attribution patching does not significantly improve. We also confirm that GPT-2's "confidence neurons" are inactive in the LN-free models. Our work clarifies the role of LN layers in language modeling, showing that GPT-2-class models can function without LN layers. We hope that our LN-free analogs of the GPT-2 family of models will enable more precise interpretability research and improve our understanding of language models.</p></details> |  |

Traditional model-based control relies on precise system models, whereas purely data-driven methods often lack formal stability guarantees, limiting their applicability in safety-critical systems. This paper proposes a novel control framework that synergistically integrates data-driven modeling with model-based control. The framework first employs the Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition with Control (EDMDc) to identify a high-dimensional Koopman linear model and quantify its bounded uncertainty from data. Subsequently, a novel Prescribed-Time Adaptive Backstepping (PTAB) controller is synthesized based on this data-driven model. The design leverages the structural advantages of Koopman linearization to systematically handle model errors and circumvent the "explosion of complexity" issue inherent in traditional backstepping. The proposed controller is validated through simulations on the classic Van der Pol oscillator. The results demonstrate that the controller can precisely stabilize the system states to a small neighborhood of the origin within a user-prescribed time, regardless of the initial conditions, while ensuring the boundedness of all closed-loop signals. This research successfully combines the flexibility of data-driven approaches with the rigor of Lyapunov-based analysis. It provides a high-performance control strategy with quantifiable performance and pre-assignable settling time for nonlinear systems, showcasing its great potential for controlling complex dynamics.</p></details> | 6pages,4figs,1tables |

Recurrent DeepONet extensions inherit the discrete-time limitations of sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) RNN architectures, while neural-ODE surrogates cannot incorporate new inputs after initialization. We introduce NCDE-DeepONet, a continuous-time operator network that embeds a Neural Controlled Differential Equation (NCDE) in the branch and augments the trunk with explicit space-time coordinates. The NCDE encodes an entire load history as the solution of a controlled ODE driven by a spline-interpolated input path, making the representation input-resolution-independent: it encodes different input signal discretizations of the observed samples. The trunk then probes this latent path at arbitrary spatial locations and times, rendering the overall map output-resolution independent: predictions can be queried on meshes and time steps unseen during training without retraining or interpolation. Benchmarks on transient Poisson, elastodynamic, and thermoelastic problems confirm the robustness and accuracy of the framework, achieving almost instant solution prediction. These findings suggest that controlled dynamics provide a principled and efficient foundation for high-fidelity operator learning in transient mechanics.</p></details> |  |

This variability often results in lower classification accuracy compared to subject-specific models, presenting a major barrier to developing calibration-free BCIs suitable for real-world applications. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach that significantly enhances cross-subject MI classification performance through optimized preprocessing and deep learning techniques. Our approach involves direct classification of Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT)-transformed EEG data, optimized STFT parameters, and a balanced batching strategy during training of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This approach is uniquely validated across four different datasets, including three widely-used benchmark datasets leading to substantial improvements in cross-subject classification, achieving 67.60% on the BCI Competition IV Dataset 1 (IV-1), 65.96% on Dataset 2A (IV-2A), and 80.22% on Dataset 2B (IV-2B), outperforming state-of-the-art techniques. Additionally, we systematically investigate the classification performance using MI windows ranging from the full 4-second window to 1-second windows. These results establish a new benchmark for generalizable, calibration-free MI classification in addition to contributing a robust open-access dataset to advance research in this domain.</p></details> |  |

Existing TTA methods consider scenarios where data from one or multiple domains arrives in complete domain units. However, in clinical practice, data usually arrives in domain fragments of arbitrary lengths and in random arrival orders, due to resource constraints and patient variability. This paper investigates a practical Free-Form Test-Time Adaptation (F$^{2}$TTA) task, where a source model is adapted to such free-form domain fragments, with shifts occurring between fragments unpredictably. In this setting, these shifts could distort the adaptation process. To address this problem, we propose a novel Image-level Disentangled Prompt Tuning (I-DiPT) framework. I-DiPT employs an image-invariant prompt to explore domain-invariant representations for mitigating the unpredictable shifts, and an image-specific prompt to adapt the source model to each test image from the incoming fragments. The prompts may suffer from insufficient knowledge representation since only one image is available for training. To overcome this limitation, we first introduce Uncertainty-oriented Masking (UoM), which encourages the prompts to extract sufficient information from the incoming image via masked consistency learning driven by the uncertainty of the source model representations. Then, we further propose a Parallel Graph Distillation (PGD) method that reuses knowledge from historical image-specific and image-invariant prompts through parallel graph networks.

| **[A Novel Tuning Method for Real-time Multiple-Object Tracking Utilizing Thermal Sensor with Complexity Motion Pattern](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02408v1)** | 2025-07-03 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2507.02408v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-Object Tracking in thermal images is essential for surveillance systems, particularly in challenging environments where RGB cameras struggle due to low visibility or poor lighting conditions. Thermal sensors enhance recognition tasks by capturing infrared signatures, but a major challenge is their low-level feature representation, which makes it difficult to accurately detect and track pedestrians. To address this, the paper introduces a novel tuning method for pedestrian tracking, specifically designed to handle the complex motion patterns in thermal imagery. The proposed framework optimizes two-stages, ensuring that each stage is tuned with the most suitable hyperparameters to maximize tracking performance. By fine-tuning hyperparameters for real-time tracking, the method achieves high accuracy without relying on complex reidentification or motion models. Extensive experiments on PBVS Thermal MOT dataset demonstrate that the approach is highly effective across various thermal camera conditions, making it a robust solution for real-world surveillance applications.</p></details> |  |

Firstly, the first-order semi-implicit backward Euler (BE) method is utilized to discretize the CHNS model; Secondly, the time filter, as a post-processing strategy, is incorporated into the BE scheme, requiring only minimal modifications to the existing BE framework to improve its temporal accuracy from first- to second-order. The unconditional energy stability and second-order temporal error estimations are obtained, and several numerical experiments are conducted to verify the theoretical results.</p></details> |  |
| **[Running-time Analysis of ($μ+λ$) Evolutionary Combinatorial Optimization Based on Multiple-gain Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02381v1)** | 2025-07-03 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2507.02381v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The running-time analysis of evolutionary combinatorial optimization is a fundamental topic in evolutionary computation. However, theoretical results regarding the $(\mu+\lambda)$ evolutionary algorithm (EA) for combinatorial optimization problems remain relatively scarce compared to those for simple pseudo-Boolean problems. This paper proposes a multiple-gain model to analyze the running time of EAs for combinatorial optimization problems. The proposed model is an improved version of the average gain model, which is a fitness-difference drift approach under the sigma-algebra condition to estimate the running time of evolutionary numerical optimization. The improvement yields a framework for estimating the expected first hitting time of a stochastic process in both average-case and worst-case scenarios. It also introduces novel running-time results of evolutionary combinatorial optimization, including two tighter time complexity upper bounds than the known results in the case of ($\mu+\lambda$) EA for the knapsack problem with favorably correlated weights, a closed-form expression of time complexity upper bound in the case of ($\mu+\lambda$) EA for general $k$-MAX-SAT problems and a tighter time complexity upper bounds than the known results in the case of ($\mu+\lambda$) EA for the traveling salesperson problem. Experimental results indicate that the practical running time aligns with the theoretical results, verifying that the multiple-gain model is an effective tool for running-time analysis of ($\mu+\lambda$) EA for combinatorial optimization problems.</p></details> |  |

However, forecasting multivariate time series with Transformer presents a unique challenge as it requires modeling both temporal (cross-time) and variate (cross-variate) dependencies. While Transformer-based models have gained popularity for their flexibility in capturing both sequential and cross-variate relationships, it is unclear how to best integrate these two sources of information in the context of the Transformer architecture while optimizing for both performance and efficiency. We re-purpose the Transformer architecture to effectively model both cross-time and cross-variate dependencies. Our approach begins by embedding each variate independently into a variate-wise representation that captures its cross-time dynamics, and then models cross-variate dependencies through attention mechanisms on these learned embeddings. Gating operations in both cross-time and cross-variate modeling phases regulate information flow, allowing the model to focus on the most relevant features for accurate predictions. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across 13 real-world datasets and can be seamlessly integrated into other Transformer-based and LLM-based forecasters, delivering performance improvements up to 20.7\% over original models.

| **[An Experimental Approach for Running-Time Estimation of Multi-objective Evolutionary Algorithms in Numerical Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02372v1)** | 2025-07-03 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2507.02372v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) have become essential tools for solving multi-objective optimization problems (MOPs), making their running time analysis crucial for assessing algorithmic efficiency and guiding practical applications. While significant theoretical advances have been achieved for combinatorial optimization, existing studies for numerical optimization primarily rely on algorithmic or problem simplifications, limiting their applicability to real-world scenarios. To address this gap, we propose an experimental approach for estimating upper bounds on the running time of MOEAs in numerical optimization without simplification assumptions. Our approach employs an average gain model that characterizes algorithmic progress through the Inverted Generational Distance metric. To handle the stochastic nature of MOEAs, we use statistical methods to estimate the probabilistic distribution of gains. Recognizing that gain distributions in numerical optimization exhibit irregular patterns with varying densities across different regions, we introduce an adaptive sampling method that dynamically adjusts sampling density to ensure accurate surface fitting for running time estimation. We conduct comprehensive experiments on five representative MOEAs (NSGA-II, MOEA/D, AR-MOEA, AGEMOEA-II, and PREA) using the ZDT and DTLZ benchmark suites. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in estimating upper bounds on the running time without requiring algorithmic or problem simplifications. Additionally, we provide a web-based implementation to facilitate broader adoption of our methodology. This work provides a practical complement to theoretical research on MOEAs in numerical optimization.</p></details> |  |

Most existing methods focus on exploiting target data, while overlooking another crucial source of information, the pre-trained weights, which encode underutilized domain-invariant priors. This paper takes the geometric attributes of pre-trained weights as a starting point, systematically analyzing three key components: magnitude, absolute angle, and pairwise angular structure. We find that the pairwise angular structure remains stable across diverse corrupted domains and encodes domain-invariant semantic information, suggesting it should be preserved during adaptation. Based on this insight, we propose PAID (Pairwise Angular-Invariant Decomposition), a prior-driven CTTA method that decomposes weight into magnitude and direction, and introduces a learnable orthogonal matrix via Householder reflections to globally rotate direction while preserving the pairwise angular structure. During adaptation, only the magnitudes and the orthogonal matrices are updated. PAID achieves consistent improvements over recent SOTA methods on four widely used CTTA benchmarks, demonstrating that preserving pairwise angular structure offers a simple yet effective principle for CTTA.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods apply fixed processing based on a reference track, limiting users' ability to fine-tune the results to match their artistic intent. In this paper, we introduce the ITO-Master framework, a reference-based mastering style transfer system that integrates Inference-Time Optimization (ITO) to enable finer user control over the mastering process. By optimizing the reference embedding during inference, our approach allows users to refine the output dynamically, making micro-level adjustments to achieve more precise mastering results. We explore both black-box and white-box methods for modeling mastering processors and demonstrate that ITO improves mastering performance across different styles. Through objective evaluation, subjective listening tests, and qualitative analysis using text-based conditioning with CLAP embeddings, we validate that ITO enhances mastering style similarity while offering increased adaptability. Our framework provides an effective and user-controllable solution for mastering style transfer, allowing users to refine their results beyond the initial style transfer.</p></details> | ISMIR 2025 |
| **[DecoRTL: A Run-time Decoding Framework for RTL Code Generation with LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02226v1)** | 2025-07-03 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2507.02226v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As one of their many applications, large language models (LLMs) have recently shown promise in automating register transfer level (RTL) code generation. However, conventional LLM decoding strategies, originally designed for natural language, often fail to meet the structural and semantic demands of RTL, leading to hallucinated, repetitive, or invalid code outputs. In this paper, we first investigate the root causes of these decoding failures through an empirical analysis of token-level entropy during RTL generation. Our findings reveal that LLMs exhibit low confidence in regions of structural ambiguity or semantic complexity, showing that standard decoding strategies fail to differentiate between regions requiring determinism (syntax-critical regions) and those that benefit from creative exploratory variability (design-critical regions). Then, to overcome this, we introduce DecoRTL, a novel run-time decoding strategy, that is both syntax-aware and contrastive for RTL code generation. DecoRTL integrates two complementary components: (i) self-consistency sampling, which generates multiple candidates and re-ranks them based on token-level agreement to promote correctness while maintaining diversity; and (ii) syntax-aware temperature adaptation, which classifies tokens by their syntactical and functional roles and adjusts the sampling temperature accordingly, enforcing low temperature for syntax-critical tokens and higher temperature for exploratory ones. Our approach operates entirely at inference time without requiring any additional model fine-tuning. Through evaluations on multiple open-source LLMs using the VerilogEval benchmark, we demonstrate significant improvements in syntactic validity, functional correctness, and output diversity, while the execution overhead (performance overhead) is imperceptible.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD 2025)</p></details> |

Although such models can generate high-quality data points from a noise distribution, the sampling demands multiple iterations to solve an ordinary differential equation (ODE) with high computational complexity. Most existing methods focus on reducing the number of time steps during the sampling process to improve efficiency. In this work, we explore a complementary direction in which the quality-complexity tradeoff can be dynamically controlled in terms of time steps and in the length of the neural network. We achieve this by rewiring the blocks in the transformer-based architecture to solve an inner discretized ODE w.r.t. its length. Then, we employ time- and length-wise consistency terms during flow matching training, and as a result, the sampling can be performed with an arbitrary number of time steps and transformer blocks. Unlike others, our ODE$_t$(ODE$_l$) approach is solver-agnostic in time dimension and decreases both latency and memory usage. Compared to the previous state of the art, image generation experiments on CelebA-HQ and ImageNet show a latency reduction of up to 3$\times$ in the most efficient sampling mode, and a FID score improvement of up to 3.5 points for high-quality sampling. We release our code and model weights with fully reproducible experiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint. Github page: github.com/gudovskiy/odelt</p></details> |

Existing machine learning methods can generate scientific hypotheses from complex datasets, but many approaches assume causal relationships are static over time, limiting their applicability to systems with dynamic, state-dependent behavior, such as the brain. While some techniques attempt dynamic causal discovery through factor models, they often restrict relationships to linear patterns or impose other simplifying assumptions. We propose a novel method that models dynamic graphs as a conditionally weighted superposition of static graphs, where each static graph can capture nonlinear relationships. This approach enables the detection of complex, time-varying interactions between variables beyond linear limitations. Our method improves f1-scores of predicted dynamic causal patterns by roughly 22-28% on average over baselines in some of our experiments, with some improvements reaching well over 60%. A case study on real brain data demonstrates our method's ability to uncover relationships linked to specific behavioral states, offering valuable insights into neural dynamics.</p></details> |  |

To address this challenge, we introduce TAGF, a Time-aware Gated Fusion framework for multimodal emotion recognition. The TAGF adaptively modulates the contribution of recursive attention outputs based on temporal dynamics. Specifically, the TAGF incorporates a BiLSTM-based temporal gating mechanism to learn the relative importance of each recursive step and effectively integrates multistep cross-modal features. By embedding temporal awareness into the recursive fusion process, the TAGF effectively captures the sequential evolution of emotional expressions and the complex interplay between modalities. Experimental results on the Aff-Wild2 dataset demonstrate that TAGF achieves competitive performance compared with existing recursive attention-based models. Furthermore, TAGF exhibits strong robustness to cross-modal misalignment and reliably models dynamic emotional transitions in real-world conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 2 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

However, current models remain inefficient at reasoning: they apply fixed inference-time compute regardless of task complexity, often overthinking simple problems while underthinking hard ones. This survey presents a comprehensive review of efficient test-time compute (TTC) strategies, which aim to improve the computational efficiency of LLM reasoning. We introduce a two-tiered taxonomy that distinguishes between L1-controllability, methods that operate under fixed compute budgets, and L2-adaptiveness, methods that dynamically scale inference based on input difficulty or model confidence. We benchmark leading proprietary LLMs across diverse datasets, highlighting critical trade-offs between reasoning performance and token usage. Compared to prior surveys on efficient reasoning, our review emphasizes the practical control, adaptability, and scalability of TTC methods. Finally, we discuss emerging trends such as hybrid thinking models and identify key challenges for future work towards making LLMs more computationally efficient, robust, and responsive to user constraints.</p></details> |  |

Following a variational approach, we employ a finite difference discretization and solve the resulting finite-dimensional optimization problem using the Chambolle--Pock primal--dual algorithm. As this involves computing proximal operators and solving ill-conditioned linear systems at each iteration, we propose a general class of parallel-in-time preconditioners based on diagonalization techniques using discrete Fourier transforms. These enable efficient, scalable iterative solvers with robustness across a wide range of viscosities. We further develop fast solvers for the resulting ill-conditioned systems arising at each time step, using exact recursive schemes for structured grids while allowing for other geometries. Numerical experiments confirm the improved performance and parallel scalability of our approach.</p></details> |  |

Through sharing the backbone network and using task-specific heads for next token prediction and process scoring respectively, SPRM successfully integrates the policy model and process reward model(PRM) into a unified interface without extra process annotation, reducing over 99% PRM parameters for efficient reasoning. Equipped with SPRM, MetaStone-S1 is naturally suitable for test time scaling (TTS), and we provide three reasoning effort modes (low, medium, and high), based on the controllable thinking length. Moreover, we empirically establish a scaling law that reveals the relationship between total thinking computation and TTS performance. Experiments demonstrate that our MetaStone-S1 achieves comparable performance to OpenAI-o3-mini's series with only 32B parameter size.

Furthermore, controllers often need only information-rich representations of the original data. To address this, we propose a semantic-driven predictive control combined with a channel-aware scheduling to enhance control performance for multiple devices under limited network capacity. At its core, the proposed framework, coined Time-Series Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (TS-JEPA), encodes high-dimensional sensory data into low-dimensional semantic embeddings at the sensor, reducing communication overhead. Furthermore, TS-JEPA enables predictive inference by predicting future embeddings from current ones and predicted commands, which are directly used by a semantic actor model to compute control commands within the embedding space, eliminating the need to reconstruct raw data. To further enhance reliability and communication efficiency, a channel-aware scheduling is integrated to dynamically prioritize device transmissions based on channel conditions and age of information (AoI). Simulations on inverted cart-pole systems show that the proposed framework significantly outperforms conventional control baselines in communication efficiency, control cost, and predictive accuracy. It enables robust and scalable control under limited network capacity compared to traditional scheduling schemes.</p></details> |  |

Particularly within the automotive domain, these cameras find significant relevance for their integration into embedded real-time systems due to lower latency and energy consumption.

In this study, we introduce a custom EFGCN (Event-based FPGA-accelerated Graph Convolutional Network) designed with a series of hardware-aware optimisations tailored for PointNetConv, a graph convolution designed for point cloud processing. The proposed techniques result in up to 100-fold reduction in model size compared to Asynchronous Event-based GNN (AEGNN), one of the most recent works in the field, with a relatively small decrease in accuracy (2.9% for the N-Caltech101 classification task, 2.2% for the N-Cars classification task), thus following the TinyML trend.

We first identify a multi-target learning conflict in the calibrating process, which arises when optimizing variables across time steps, leading to the underutilization of the model's learning capabilities. To address this issue, we propose an innovative calibrating strategy called Socket+Plug (SoP). This approach retains an exclusive optimizer and early-stopping monitor for each predicted target within each Plug while keeping the fully trained Socket backbone frozen. The model-agnostic nature of SoP allows it to directly calibrate the performance of any trained deep forecasting models, regardless of their specific architectures. Extensive experiments on various time series benchmarks and a spatio-temporal meteorological ERA5 dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of SoP, achieving up to a 22% improvement even when employing a simple MLP as the Plug (highlighted in Figure 1).

When a process generates multiple synchronized signals we are faced with multidimensional time series. In this context a fundamental problem is that of motif mining, where we seek patterns repeating twice with minor variations, spanning some of the dimensions. State of the art exact solutions for this problem run in time quadratic in the length of the input time series. We provide a scalable method to find the top-k motifs in multidimensional time series with probabilistic guarantees on the quality of the results. Our algorithm runs in time subquadratic in the length of the input, and returns the exact solution with probability at least $1-\delta$, where $\delta$ is a user-defined parameter. The algorithm is designed to be adaptive to the input distribution, self-tuning its parameters while respecting user-defined limits on the memory to use. Our theoretical analysis is complemented by an extensive experimental evaluation, showing that our algorithm is orders of magnitude faster than the state of the art.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 7 figures, extended experimental section, change of algorithm name due to a title clash with another paper published in the same issue</p></details> |

However, existing CTTA methods typically rely on shared model parameters across all domains, making them vulnerable to feature entanglement and catastrophic forgetting in the presence of large or non-stationary domain shifts. To address this limitation, we propose ExPaMoE, a novel framework based on an Expandable Parallel Mixture-of-Experts architecture. ExPaMoE decouples domain-general and domain-specific knowledge via a dual-branch expert design with token-guided feature separation, and dynamically expands its expert pool based on a Spectral-Aware Online Domain Discriminator (SODD) that detects distribution changes in real-time using frequency-domain cues. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of ExPaMoE across diverse CTTA scenarios. We evaluate our method on standard benchmarks including CIFAR-10C, CIFAR-100C, ImageNet-C, and Cityscapes-to-ACDC for semantic segmentation. Additionally, we introduce ImageNet++, a large-scale and realistic CTTA benchmark built from multiple ImageNet-derived datasets, to better reflect long-term adaptation under complex domain evolution. ExPaMoE consistently outperforms prior arts, showing strong robustness, scalability, and resistance to forgetting.</p></details> |  |

Most research on TKG reasoning (TKGR) focuses on modelling the repetition of global facts and designing patterns of local historical facts. However, they face two significant challenges: inadequate modeling of the event distribution shift between training and test samples, and reliance on random entity substitution for generating negative samples, which often results in low-quality sampling. To this end, we propose a novel distributional feature modeling approach for training TKGR models, Test-Time Training-guided Distribution shift Modelling (T3DM), to adjust the model based on distribution shift and ensure the global consistency of model reasoning. In addition, we design a negative-sampling strategy to generate higher-quality negative quadruples based on adversarial training. Extensive experiments show that T3DM provides better and more robust results than the state-of-the-art baselines in most cases.</p></details> |  |

This problem has broad applications, including the deployment of autonomous taxis and coordination in search and rescue operations. The achievement of effective coverage is complicated by the presence of time-varying density functions, nonlinear agent dynamics, and stringent system and safety constraints. In this paper, we present a distributed multi-agent control framework for time-varying coverage under nonlinear constrained dynamics. Our approach integrates a reference trajectory planner and a tracking model predictive control (MPC) scheme, which operate at different frequencies within a multi-rate framework. For periodic density functions, we demonstrate closed-loop convergence to an optimal configuration of trajectories and provide formal guarantees regarding constraint satisfaction, collision avoidance, and recursive feasibility. Additionally, we propose an efficient algorithm capable of handling nonperiodic density functions, making the approach suitable for practical applications. Finally, we validate our method through hardware experiments using a fleet of four miniature race cars.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we propose Time Vision Transformer (TiViT), a framework that converts time series into images to leverage the representational power of frozen Vision Transformers (ViTs) pretrained on large-scale image datasets. First, we theoretically motivate our approach by analyzing the 2D patching of ViTs for time series, showing that it can increase the number of label-relevant tokens and reduce the sample complexity. Second, we empirically demonstrate that TiViT achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard time series classification benchmarks by utilizing the hidden representations of large OpenCLIP models. We explore the structure of TiViT representations and find that intermediate layers with high intrinsic dimension are the most effective for time series classification. Finally, we assess the alignment between TiViT and TSFM representation spaces and identify a strong complementarity, with further performance gains achieved by combining their features. Our findings reveal a new direction for reusing vision representations in a non-visual domain. Code is available at https://github.com/ExplainableML/TiViT.</p></details> | Preprint |

The proposed approach is based on E2PANNs, a fine-tuned convolutional neural network derived from EPANNs, and optimized for binary sound event detection under urban acoustic conditions. A key contribution is the creation of curated and semantically structured datasets - AudioSet-EV, AudioSet-EV Augmented, and Unified-EV - developed using a custom AudioSet-Tools framework to overcome the low reliability of standard AudioSet annotations. The system is deployed on a Raspberry Pi 5 equipped with a high-fidelity DAC+microphone board, implementing a multithreaded inference engine with adaptive frame sizing, probability smoothing, and a decision-state machine to control false positive activations. A remote WebSocket interface provides real-time monitoring and facilitates live demonstration capabilities. Performance is evaluated using both framewise and event-based metrics across multiple configurations.

In this study, we explore the recently proposed State-Space Model, Mamba, leveraging its computational efficiency and capability for long-sequence modeling to effectively process dense image sequences in tracking tasks. First, we highlight the issue of temporal inconsistency in existing Mamba-based methods, specifically the failure to account for temporal continuity in the Mamba scanning mechanism. Secondly, building upon this insight,we propose TrackingMiM, a Mamba-in-Mamba architecture, a minimal-computation burden model for handling image sequence of tracking problem. In our framework, the mamba scan is performed in a nested way while independently process temporal and spatial coherent patch tokens. While the template frame is encoded as query token and utilized for tracking in every scan. Extensive experiments conducted on five UAV tracking benchmarks confirm that the proposed TrackingMiM achieves state-of-the-art precision while offering noticeable higher speed in UAV tracking.</p></details> | 12 pages |

Models that employ the exceedances of values above suitably selected high thresholds possess the advantage of capturing the "sub-asymptotic" dependence of data. This paper presents an extension of spatial random scale mixture models to the spatio-temporal domain. A comprehensive framework for characterizing the dependence structure of extreme events across both dimensions is provided. Indeed, the model is capable of distinguishing between asymptotic dependence and independence, both in space and time, through the use of parametric inference. The high complexity of the likelihood function for the proposed model necessitates a simulation approach based on neural networks for parameter estimation, which leverages summaries of the sub-asymptotic dependence present in the data. The effectiveness of the model in assessing the limiting dependence structure of spatio-temporal processes is demonstrated through both simulation studies and an application to rainfall datasets.</p></details> |  |

By applying a new general data transformation, that randomly perturbs multiple times the PCA subspace projection of a test input, GTTA forms robust ensembles at test time in which, due to sound statistical properties, the structural and systematic noises in the initial input data is filtered out and final estimator errors are reduced. Different from other existing methods, we also propose a final self-supervised learning stage in which the ensemble output, acting as an unsupervised teacher, is used to train the initial single student model, thus reducing significantly the test time computational cost, at no loss in accuracy. Our tests and comparisons to strong TTA approaches and SoTA models on various vision and non-vision well-known datasets and tasks, such as image classification and segmentation, speech recognition and house price prediction, validate the generality of the proposed GTTA. Furthermore, we also prove its effectiveness on the more specific real-world task of salmon segmentation and detection in low-visibility underwater videos, for which we introduce DeepSalmon, the largest dataset of its kind in the literature.</p></details> |  |
| **[Real-Time AIoT for AAV Antenna Interference Detection via Edge-Cloud Collaboration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03055v3)** | 2025-07-02 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2412.03055v3) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the fifth-generation (5G) era, eliminating communication interference sources is crucial for maintaining network performance. Interference often originates from unauthorized or malfunctioning antennas, and radio monitoring agencies must address numerous sources of such antennas annually. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can improve inspection efficiency. However, the data transmission delay in the existing cloud-only (CO) artificial intelligence (AI) mode fails to meet the low latency requirements for real-time performance. Therefore, we propose a computer vision-based AI of Things (AIoT) system to detect antenna interference sources for UAVs. The system adopts an optimized edge-cloud collaboration (ECC+) mode, combining a keyframe selection algorithm (KSA), focusing on reducing end-to-end latency (E2EL) and ensuring reliable data transmission, which aligns with the core principles of ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC). At the core of our approach is an end-to-end antenna localization scheme based on the tracking-by-detection (TBD) paradigm, including a detector (EdgeAnt) and a tracker (AntSort). EdgeAnt achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with a mean average precision (mAP) of 42.1% on our custom antenna interference source dataset, requiring only 3 million parameters and 14.7 GFLOPs. On the COCO dataset, EdgeAnt achieves 38.9% mAP with 5.4 GFLOPs. We deployed EdgeAnt on Jetson Xavier NX (TRT) and Raspberry Pi 4B (NCNN), achieving real-time inference speeds of 21.1 (1088) and 4.8 (640) frames per second (FPS), respectively. Compared with CO mode, the ECC+ mode reduces E2EL by 88.9%, increases accuracy by 28.2%. Additionally, the system offers excellent scalability for coordinated multiple UAVs inspections.

By encoding multiple points into the quantum circuit to predict subsequent data, each point becomes a feature, transforming the problem into a multidimensional one. Building on theoretical foundations from prior research, which demonstrated that Variational Quantum Circuits (VQCs) can be expressed as multidimensional Fourier series, we explore the capabilities of different architectures and ansatz. This analysis considers the concepts of circuit expressibility and the presence of barren plateaus. Analyzing the problem within the framework of the Fourier series enabled the design of an architecture that incorporates data reuploading, resulting in enhanced performance. Rather than a strict requirement for the number of free parameters to exceed the degrees of freedom of the Fourier series, our findings suggest that even a limited number of parameters can produce Fourier functions of higher degrees. This highlights the remarkable expressive power of quantum circuits. This observation is also significant in reducing training times. The ansatz with greater expressibility and number of non-zero Fourier coefficients consistently delivers favorable results across different scenarios, with performance metrics improving as the number of qubits increases.</p></details> |  |

We establish novel results for convergence rates of numerical approximations of such models under reasonable assumptions on exact solutions, and prove the existence and uniqueness of the approximate solution for suitably small time steps. The main interest of our results lies in covering several approximation methods and various applications of the considered model such as the generalised Burgers-Fisher (GBF) and the generalised Burgers-Huxley (GBH) models. Numerical tests based on the hybrid mimetic mixed (HMM) method for the GBF model are performed on various types of general meshes to examine the accuracy of the proposed gradient scheme. The results confirm our theoretical rates of convergence, even on mesh with extreme distortions.</p></details> |  |

However, a major problem with fitting such models is the exponentially growing number of parameters in the model order. A popular approach to parsimonious modeling is to use a Variable Length Markov Chain (VLMC), which determines relevant contexts (recent pasts) of variable orders and forms a context tree. A more general parsimonious modeling approach is given by Sparse Markov Models (SMMs), where all possible histories of order $m$ are partitioned such that the transition probability vectors are identical for the histories belonging to any particular group. In this paper, we develop an elegant method of fitting SMMs based on convex clustering and regularization. The regularization parameter is selected using the BIC criterion. Theoretical results establish model selection consistency of our method for large sample size. Extensive simulation results under different set-ups are presented to study finite sample performance of the method. Real data analysis on modelling and classifying disease sub-types demonstrates the applicability of our method as well.</p></details> |  |

To address this, we introduce the Probabilistic Visibility Graph (PVG), a novel approach inspired by the quantum tunnelling phenomenon. The PVG extends the classical Visibility Graph (VG) by introducing probabilistic connections between time points that are obstructed in the VG due to intermediate values. We demonstrate the PVG's effectiveness in capturing long-range dependencies through simulations of amplitude-modulated signals and analysis of electrocorticography (ECoG) data under rest and anesthesia conditions. Key results show that the PVG presents distinct network properties between rest and anesthesia, with rest exhibiting stronger small-worldness and scale-free behavior, reflecting a hub-dominated, centralized connectivity structure, compared to anesthesia. These findings highlight the PVG's potential for analyzing complex signals with interacting temporal scales, offering new insights into neural dynamics and other real-world phenomena.</p></details> |  |

The new scheme, ETDRK4RDP, is constructed by approximating the matrix exponentials in the ETDRK4 scheme with a fourth order, L-acceptable, non-Pad\'e rational function having real and distinct poles (RDP). Using RDP rational functions to construct the scheme ensures efficient damping of spurious oscillations arising from non-smooth initial and boundary conditions and a straightforward parallelization. We verify empirically that the new ETDRK4RDP scheme is fourth-order accurate for several reaction diffusion systems with Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions and show it to be more efficient than competing exponential time differencing schemes, especially when implemented in parallel, with up to six times speedup in CPU time.</p></details> |  |

The framework of temporal hypergraphs makes it possible to represent them by taking into account the higher-order and temporal nature of the interactions. However, the corresponding datasets are often incomplete and/or limited in size and duration, and surrogate time-varying hypergraphs able to reproduce their statistical features constitute interesting substitutions, especially to understand how dynamical processes unfold on group interactions. Here, we present a new temporal hypergraph model, the Emerging Activity Temporal Hypergraph (EATH), which can be fed by parameters measured in a dataset and create synthetic datasets with similar properties. In the model, each node has an independent underlying activity dynamic and the overall system activity emerges from the nodes dynamics, with temporal group interactions resulting from both the activity of the nodes and memory mechanisms. We first show that the EATH model can generate surrogate hypergraphs of several empirical datasets of face-to-face interactions, mimicking temporal and topological properties at the node and hyperedge level. We also showcase the possibility to use the resulting synthetic data in simulations of higher-order contagion dynamics, comparing the outcome of such process on original and surrogate datasets. Finally, we illustrate the flexibility of the model, which can generate synthetic hypergraphs with tunable properties: as an example, we generate "hybrid" temporal hypergraphs, which mix properties of different empirical datasets. Our work opens several perspectives, from the generation of synthetic realistic hypergraphs describing contexts where data collection is difficult to a deeper understanding of dynamical processes on temporal hypergraphs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Main ...</summary><p>Main document: 19 pages, 10 figures; Supplementary Material: 37 pages, 54 figures</p></details> |

On onboard agents, RTMap simultaneously addresses three core challenges in an end-to-end fashion: (1) Uncertainty-aware positional modeling for HD map elements, (2) probabilistic-aware localization w.r.t. the crowdsourced prior-map, and (3) real-time detection for possible road structural changes. Experiments on several public autonomous driving datasets demonstrate our solid performance on both the prior-aided map quality and the localization accuracy, demonstrating our effectiveness of robustly serving downstream prediction and planning modules while gradually improving the accuracy and freshness of the crowdsourced prior-map asynchronously.

In our previous work [15], we proposed ETD-RK-Pad\'{e} scheme to compute high-order numerical solutions for nonlinear parabolic reaction-diffusion equation with constant time delay. However, the based ETD-RK numerical scheme in [15] is very complex and the corresponding calculation program is also very complicated. We propose in this paper ETD-MS-Pad\'{e} and ETD-IMS-Pad\'{e} schemes for the solution of semilinear parabolic equations with delay. We synergize the ETD-MS-Pad\'{e} with ETD-IMS-Pad\'{e} to construct efficient predictor-corrector scheme. This new predictor-corrector scheme will become an important tool for solving the numerical solutions of parabolic differential equations. Remarkably, we also conducted experiments in Table$10$ to compare the numerical results of the predictor-corrector scheme with the EERK scheme proposed in paper [42]. The predictor-corrector scheme demonstrated better convergence. The main idea is to employ an ETD-based Adams multistep extrapolation for the time integration of the corresponding equation. To overcome the well-known numerical instability associated with computing the exponential operator, we utilize the Pad\'{e} approach to approximate this exponential operator. This methodology leads to the development of the ETD-MS-Pad\'{e} and ETD-IMS-Pad\'{e} schemes, applicable even for arbitrary time orders.

The corresponding quantum dynamic programming algorithms retain the same space complexity as their classical counterpart, while achieving a computational speedup. For a combinatorial (search or optimization) problem $\mathcal P$ and an instance $I$ of $\mathcal P$, such a speedup can be expressed in terms of the average degree $\delta$ of the dependency digraph $G_{\mathcal{P}}(I)$ of $I$, determined by a recursive formulation of $\mathcal P$. The nodes of this graph are the subproblems of $\mathcal P$ induced by $I$ and its arcs are directed from each subproblem to those on whose solution it relies. In particular, our framework allows us to solve the considered problems in $\tilde{O}(|V(G_{\mathcal{P}}(I))| \sqrt{\delta})$ time. As an example, we obtain a quantum version of the Bellman-Ford algorithm for computing shortest paths from a single source vertex to all the other vertices in a weighted $n$-vertex digraph with $m$ edges that runs in $\tilde{O}(n\sqrt{nm})$ time, which improves the best known classical upper bound when $m \in \Omega(n^{1.4})$.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is the extended version of a paper to appear at the 19th Algorithms and Data Structures Symposium (WADS 2025)</p></details> |

(3) Error accumulation in autoregressive frameworks. To address these challenges, we proposed LangTime, a language-guided unified model for time series forecasting that incorporates cross-domain pre-training with reinforcement learning-based fine-tuning. Specifically, LangTime constructs Temporal Comprehension Prompts (TCPs), which include dataset-wise and channel-wise instructions, to facilitate domain adaptation and condense time series into a single token, enabling LLMs to understand better and align temporal data. To improve autoregressive forecasting, we introduce TimePPO, a reinforcement learning-based fine-tuning algorithm. TimePPO mitigates error accumulation by leveraging a multidimensional rewards function tailored for time series and a repeat-based value estimation strategy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LangTime achieves state-of-the-art cross-domain forecasting performance, while TimePPO fine-tuning effectively enhances the stability and accuracy of autoregressive forecasting.</p></details> |  |

Inaccurate or inconsistent predictions regarding the movement of agents in its surroundings lead to poorly planned maneuvers and potentially dangerous situations for the end-user. Current state-of-the-art deep-learning-based trajectory prediction models can achieve excellent accuracy on public datasets. However, when used in more complex, interactive scenarios, they often fail to capture important interdependencies between agents, leading to inconsistent predictions among agents in the traffic scene. Inspired by the efficacy of incorporating human preference into large language models, this work fine-tunes trajectory prediction models in multi-agent settings using preference optimization. By taking as input automatically calculated preference rankings among predicted futures in the fine-tuning process, our experiments--using state-of-the-art models on three separate datasets--show that we are able to significantly improve scene consistency while minimally sacrificing trajectory prediction accuracy and without adding any excess computational requirements at inference time.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at ITSC 2025</p></details> |
| **[Towards Bio-Inspired Robotic Trajectory Planning via Self-Supervised RNN](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02171v1)** | 2025-07-02 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2507.02171v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory planning in robotics is understood as generating a sequence of joint configurations that will lead a robotic agent, or its manipulator, from an initial state to the desired final state, thus completing a manipulation task while considering constraints like robot kinematics and the environment. Typically, this is achieved via sampling-based planners, which are computationally intensive. Recent advances demonstrate that trajectory planning can also be performed by supervised sequence learning of trajectories, often requiring only a single or fixed number of passes through a neural architecture, thus ensuring a bounded computation time. Such fully supervised approaches, however, perform imitation learning; they do not learn based on whether the trajectories can successfully reach a goal, but try to reproduce observed trajectories. In our work, we build on this approach and propose a cognitively inspired self-supervised learning scheme based on a recurrent architecture for building a trajectory model. We evaluate the feasibility of the proposed method on a task of kinematic planning for a robotic arm. The results suggest that the model is able to learn to generate trajectories only using given paired forward and inverse kinematics models, and indicate that this novel method could facilitate planning for more complex manipulation tasks requiring adaptive solutions.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables.

| **[Tenure and Research Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10575v2)** | 2025-07-02 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2411.10575v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tenure is a cornerstone of the US academic system, yet its relationship to faculty research trajectories remains poorly understood. Conceptually, tenure systems may act as a selection mechanism, screening in high-output researchers; a dynamic incentive mechanism, encouraging high output prior to tenure but low output after tenure; and a creative search mechanism, encouraging tenured individuals to undertake high-risk work. Here, we integrate data from seven different sources to trace US tenure-line faculty and their research outputs at an unprecedented scale and scope, covering over 12,000 researchers across 15 disciplines. Our analysis reveals that faculty publication rates typically increase sharply during the tenure track and peak just before obtaining tenure. Post-tenure trends, however, vary across disciplines: in lab-based fields, such as biology and chemistry, research output typically remains high post-tenure, whereas in non-lab-based fields, such as mathematics and sociology, research output typically declines substantially post-tenure. Turning to creative search, faculty increasingly produce novel, high-risk research after securing tenure. However, this shift toward novelty and risk-taking comes with a decline in impact, with post-tenure research yielding fewer highly cited papers. Comparing outcomes across common career ages but different tenure years or comparing research trajectories in tenure-based and non-tenure-based research settings underscores that breaks in the research trajectories are sharply tied to the individual's tenure year. Overall, these findings provide a new empirical basis for understanding the tenure system, individual research trajectories, and the shape of scientific output.</p></details> |  |
| **[AMD: Adaptive Momentum and Decoupled Contrastive Learning Framework for Robust Long-Tail Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01801v1)** | 2025-07-02 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2507.01801v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurately predicting the future trajectories of traffic agents is essential in autonomous driving. However, due to the inherent imbalance in trajectory distributions, tail data in natural datasets often represents more complex and hazardous scenarios. Existing studies typically rely solely on a base model's prediction error, without considering the diversity and uncertainty of long-tail trajectory patterns. We propose an adaptive momentum and decoupled contrastive learning framework (AMD), which integrates unsupervised and supervised contrastive learning strategies. By leveraging an improved momentum contrast learning (MoCo-DT) and decoupled contrastive learning (DCL) module, our framework enhances the model's ability to recognize rare and complex trajectories. Additionally, we design four types of trajectory random augmentation methods and introduce an online iterative clustering strategy, allowing the model to dynamically update pseudo-labels and better adapt to the distributional shifts in long-tail data. We propose three different criteria to define long-tail trajectories and conduct extensive comparative experiments on the nuScenes and ETH$/$UCY datasets. The results show that AMD not only achieves optimal performance in long-tail trajectory prediction but also demonstrates outstanding overall prediction accuracy.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, an efficient, accurate, and widely applicable pseudospectral method is proposed to solve multi-revolution low-thrust trajectory optimization problems with various objective functions and perturbations. The method is based on the Sundman transformation and pseudospectral method, together with a sparse mesh that is monotonic, near-uniformly spaced, and uniformly scattered on the unit circle. Two methods are proposed to construct the mesh: a deterministic method based on rotation mapping; a stochastic method utilizing autocorrelated random sequences. Core mechanisms ensuring the correctness of the method are analyzed, including the dual roles of mesh points as both integration points in the temporal domain and sampling points in the angular domain, the slow dynamics of the system excluding the fast angle variable, and the nearly commutative vector fields generated by applying different control inputs. The method is demonstrated through a multi-revolution low-thrust orbital rendezvous problem. Results show that the proposed method achieves high accuracy with only a few seconds of computational time for challenging problems.</p></details> |  |

Most of the current designs of motion prediction models are based on the major representation of lane centerlines, which limits their capability to capture critical road environments and traffic rules and constraints. In this work, we propose an enhanced motion forecasting model informed by multiple vector map elements, including lane boundaries and road edges, that facilitates a richer and more complete representation of driving environments. An effective feature fusion strategy is developed to merge information in different vector map components, where the model learns holistic information on road structures and their interactions with agents. Since encoding more information about the road environment increases memory usage and is computationally expensive, we developed an effective pruning mechanism that filters the most relevant map connections to the target agent, ensuring computational efficiency while maintaining essential spatial and semantic relationships for accurate trajectory prediction. Overcoming the limitations of lane centerline-based models, our method provides a more informative and efficient representation of the driving environment and advances the state of the art for autonomous vehicle motion forecasting. We verify our approach with extensive experiments on the Argoverse 2 motion forecasting dataset, where our method maintains competitiveness on AV2 while achieving improved performance.

Cluster analysis with longitudinal data further allows for clinical representation of groups of subjects with similar trajectories and identification of unique characteristics, or phenotypes, that can be investigated as risk factors or disease outcomes. Some of the challenges in estimating these clustered trajectories lie in the handling of observations at inconsistent time intervals and the usability of algorithms across programming languages. Methods: We propose longitudinal trajectory clustering using a k-means algorithm with thin-plate regression splines, implemented across multiple platforms, the R package clustra and corresponding \SAS macros. The \SAS macros accommodate flexible clustering approaches, and also include visualization of the clusters, and silhouette plots for diagnostic evaluation of the appropriate cluster number. The R package, designed in parallel, has similar functionality, with additional multi-core processing and Rand-index-based diagnostics. Results: The package and macros achieve comparable results when applied to an example of simulated blood pressure measurements based on real data from Veterans Affairs Healthcare recipients who were initiated on anti-hypertensive medication. Conclusion: The R package clustra and the SAS macros integrate a K-means clustering algorithm for longitudinal trajectories that operates with large electronic health record data. The implementations provide comparable results in both platforms, satisfying the needs of investigators familiar with, or constrained by access to, one or the other platform.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 11 figures, clustra package available in https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/clustra/index.html, SAS macros available in https://github.com/MVP-CHAMPION/clustra-SAS</p></details> |

The state-of-the-art optimal control approaches often rely on numerical methods sensitive to initial guesses. This paper presents an innovative collision-free finite-time formation control scheme for multiple UAVs leveraging the differential flatness of the UAV dynamics, eliminating the need for numerical methods. We formulate a finite-time optimal control problem to plan a formation trajectory for feasible initial states. This optimal control problem in formation trajectory planning involves a collective performance index to meet the formation requirements to achieve relative positions and velocity consensus. It is solved by applying Pontryagin's principle. Subsequently, a collision-constrained regulating problem is addressed to ensure collision-free tracking of the planned formation trajectory. The tracking problem incorporates a directionally aware collision avoidance strategy that prioritizes avoiding UAVs in the forward path and relative approach. It assigns lower priority to those on the sides with an oblique relative approach, disregarding UAVs behind and not in the relative approach. The high-fidelity simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for Journal of the Franklin Institute</p></details> |

The proposed method systematically accounts for gyroscopic effects, rotor dynamics, parametric uncertainties, and external disturbances, ensuring robust performance across varying trajectory speeds. Through novel mathematical manipulation in the error system development, the quadrotor dynamics are expressed in a control-oriented form, which explicitly incorporates the uncertainty in the gyroscopic term and control actuation term. An adaptive modified RISE law is then designed to stabilize both the position and attitude loops of the quadrotor system. A rigorous Lyapunov-based analysis is utilized to prove asymptotic trajectory tracking, where the region of convergence can be made arbitrarily large through judicious control gain selection. Moreover, the stability analysis formally addresses gyroscopic effects and actuator uncertainty. To illustrate the performance of the control law, comparative numerical simulation results are provided, which demonstrate the improved closed-loop performance achieved under varying levels of parametric uncertainty, disturbance magnitudes and trajectory speeds.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is under review</p></details> |

In this scenario, the NICO robot was characterized by the ability to point to specific points in space with precise linear movements, increasing the predictability of the robotic action during its interaction with humans. To achieve this goal, the neural network computes the forward kinematics of the robot arm. By integrating it with a generator of joint angles, another neural network was developed and trained on an artificial dataset created from suitable start and end poses of the robotic arm. Through the computation of angular velocities, the robot was characterized by its ability to perform the movement, and the quality of its action was evaluated in terms of shape and accuracy.

While learning-based prediction models have shown success in generating likely human trajectory predictions, integrating these stochastic models into a robot controller presents several challenges. The controller needs to account for interactive coupling between planned robot motion and human predictions while ensuring both predictions and robot actions are safe (i.e. collision-free). To address these challenges, we present a receding horizon crowd navigation method for single-robot multi-human environments. We first propose a diffusion model to generate joint trajectory predictions for all humans in the scene. We then incorporate these multi-modal predictions into a SICNav Bilevel MPC problem that simultaneously solves for a robot plan (upper-level) and acts as a safety filter to refine the predictions for non-collision (lower-level). Combining planning and prediction refinement into one bilevel problem ensures that the robot plan and human predictions are coupled. We validate the open-loop trajectory prediction performance of our diffusion model on the commonly used ETH/UCY benchmark and evaluate the closed-loop performance of our robot navigation method in simulation and extensive real-robot experiments demonstrating safe, efficient, and reactive robot motion.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L)</p></details> |

Modeling the environment risk information by field is a promising and effective approach for safe trajectory planning. However, existing risk assessment theories only analyze the risk by current information, ignoring future prediction. This paper proposes a predictive risk analysis and safe trajectory planning framework for intelligent and connected vehicles. This framework first predicts future trajectories of objects by a local risk-aware algorithm, following with a spatiotemporal-discretised predictive risk analysis using the prediction results. Then the safe trajectory is generated based on the predictive risk analysis. Finally, simulation and vehicle experiments confirm the efficacy and real-time practicability of our approach.</p></details> |  |

Principal component analysis (PCA) is applied to trajectory data consisting of $n_s = 4,000,000$ datapoints, of the FPUT $\beta$ model with $N = 32$ coupled oscillators, revealing a critical relationship between $m^{\ast}$ and the model's nonlinear strength. By estimating the intrinsic dimension $m^{\ast}$ using multiple methods (participation ratio, Kaiser rule, and the Kneedle algorithm), it is found that $m^{\ast}$ increases with the model nonlinearity. Interestingly, in the weakly nonlinear regime, for trajectories initialized by exciting the first mode, the participation ratio estimates $m^{\ast} = 2, 3$, strongly suggesting that quasi-periodic motion on a low-dimensional Riemannian manifold underlies the characteristic energy recurrences observed in the FPUT model.</p></details> | 15 pages, 15 figures |

Therefore, distillation techniques are utilized to accelerate the multi-step teacher model into one-step student model. Nevertheless, these methods significantly raise training costs and constrain the performance of the student model by the teacher model. To overcome these tough challenges, we propose Consistency Trajectory Matching for Super-Resolution (CTMSR), a distillation-free strategy that is able to generate photo-realistic SR results in one step. Concretely, we first formulate a Probability Flow Ordinary Differential Equation (PF-ODE) trajectory to establish a deterministic mapping from low-resolution (LR) images with noise to high-resolution (HR) images. Then we apply the Consistency Training (CT) strategy to directly learn the mapping in one step, eliminating the necessity of pre-trained diffusion model. To further enhance the performance and better leverage the ground-truth during the training process, we aim to align the distribution of SR results more closely with that of the natural images. To this end, we propose to minimize the discrepancy between their respective PF-ODE trajectories from the LR image distribution by our meticulously designed Distribution Trajectory Matching (DTM) loss, resulting in improved realism of our recovered HR images. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed methods can attain comparable or even superior capabilities on both synthetic and real datasets while maintaining minimal inference latency.</p></details> |  |

To support real-time sensing and conserve the limited energy budget of the HAPs, the proposed framework assumes that the acquired radar data are transmitted in real time to a ground base station for SAR image reconstruction. A dynamic trajectory model is developed, and the power consumption associated with radar sensing, data transmission, and circular flight is comprehensively analyzed. In addition, solar energy harvesting is considered to enhance system sustainability. An energy-aware mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem is formulated to maximize radar beam coverage while satisfying operational constraints. To solve this challenging problem, a sub-optimal successive convex approximation (SCA)-based framework is proposed, incorporating iterative optimization and finite search. Simulation results validate the convergence of the proposed algorithm and demonstrate its effectiveness in balancing SAR performance, communication reliability, and energy efficiency. A final SAR imaging simulation on a 9-target lattice scenario further confirms the practical feasibility of the proposed solution.</p></details> |  |

However, models can suffer from mode collapse, where only the most likely mode is predicted, posing significant safety risks. While existing methods employ various strategies to generate diverse predictions, they often overlook the diversity in interaction modes among agents. Additionally, traditional metrics for evaluating prediction models are dataset-dependent and do not evaluate inter-agent interactions quantitatively. To our knowledge, none of the existing metrics explicitly evaluates mode collapse. In this paper, we propose a novel evaluation framework that assesses mode collapse in joint trajectory predictions, focusing on safety-critical interactions. We introduce metrics for mode collapse, mode correctness, and coverage, emphasizing the sequential dimension of predictions. By testing four multi-agent trajectory prediction models, we demonstrate that mode collapse indeed happens. When looking at the sequential dimension, although prediction accuracy improves closer to interaction events, there are still cases where the models are unable to predict the correct interaction mode, even just before the interaction mode becomes inevitable. We hope that our framework can help researchers gain new insights and advance the development of more consistent and accurate prediction models, thus enhancing the safety of autonomous driving systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 8 figures, submitted to a journal</p></details> |

Dataset augmentation through the addition of synthetically generated trajectory data is necessary to develop a more robust aircraft trajectory model and ensure that the trajectory dataset is sufficient and balanced. In this work, we propose a novel framework called ATRADA for aircraft trajectory dataset augmentation. In the proposed framework, a Transformer encoder learns the underlying patterns in the original trajectory dataset and converts each data point into a context vector in the learned latent space. The converted dataset in the latent space is projected into reduced dimensions using principal component analysis (PCA), and a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) is applied to fit the probability distribution of the data points in the reduced-dimensional space. Finally, new samples are drawn from the fitted GMM, the dimension of the samples is reverted to the original dimension, and they are decoded with a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP). Several experiments demonstrate that the framework effectively generates new, high-quality synthetic aircraft trajectory data, which were compared to the results of several baselines.</p></details> |  |

Trajectory enabled Unified Online Detection of Adversarial Examples and Backdoor Attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22722v1)** | 2025-06-28 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2506.22722v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The proposed UniGuard is the first unified online detection framework capable of simultaneously addressing adversarial examples and backdoor attacks. UniGuard builds upon two key insights: first, both AE and backdoor attacks have to compromise the inference phase, making it possible to tackle them simultaneously during run-time via online detection. Second, an adversarial input, whether a perturbed sample in AE attacks or a trigger-carrying sample in backdoor attacks, exhibits distinctive trajectory signatures from a benign sample as it propagates through the layers of a DL model in forward inference. The propagation trajectory of the adversarial sample must deviate from that of its benign counterpart; otherwise, the adversarial objective cannot be fulfilled. Detecting these trajectory signatures is inherently challenging due to their subtlety; UniGuard overcomes this by treating the propagation trajectory as a time-series signal, leveraging LSTM and spectrum transformation to amplify differences between adversarial and benign trajectories that are subtle in the time domain. UniGuard exceptional efficiency and effectiveness have been extensively validated across various modalities (image, text, and audio) and tasks (classification and regression), ranging from diverse model architectures against a wide range of AE attacks and backdoor attacks, including challenging partial backdoors and dynamic triggers. When compared to SOTA methods, including ContraNet (NDSS 22) specific for AE detection and TED (IEEE SP 24) specific for backdoor detection, UniGuard consistently demonstrates superior performance, even when matched against each method's strengths in addressing their respective threats-each SOTA fails to parts of attack strategies while UniGuard succeeds for all.</p></details> |  |

However, the demand charge component in the monthly electricity cost, make it difficult to be encapsulated in additive stage costs, and can make solutions violate the principle of optimality if naively introduced in the objective function. Moreover, previous EMPC based works mostly rely on a-priori knowledge of an optimal economic steady state or optimal periodic trajectory for performance guarantees, which are not useful or possibly don't exist respectively, for real-time economical MG dispatch where load/generation forecasts are known only 24-48 h in advance. This paper, first, proposes an EMPC formulation for a generic deterministic discrete non-linear time varying system with hard state and input constraints, without any a-priori requirements of an optimal economic steady state or optimal periodic trajectory. It is proved that under mild assumptions on terminal cost and region, the asymptotic average economic cost of the proposed method is no worse than the asymptotic average economic cost of any other non-fixed arbitrary reference trajectory which is known only until the current time-step. The EMPC framework is then leveraged for optimal MG dispatch by showing that the problem can be reformulated to satisfy the assumptions required for the asymptotic performance guarantee. Realistic simulations at the Port of San Diego MG demonstrated that the proposed method can also reduce monthly electricity costs in closed-loop with respect to reference trajectories generated by directly optimizing the electricity cost function over the prediction horizon or by tracking an ideal grid import curve in a majority of the cases.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 4 tables, Manuscript under review</p></details> |

The growing interest in this challenge highlights the need for comprehensive datasets that capture unstructured environments, enabling the development of more robust prediction models to enhance pedestrian safety and vehicle navigation. In this paper, we introduce an Indian driving pedestrian dataset designed to address the complexities of modeling pedestrian behavior in unstructured environments, such as illumination changes, occlusion of pedestrians, unsignalized scene types and vehicle-pedestrian interactions. The dataset provides high-level and detailed low-level comprehensive annotations focused on pedestrians requiring the ego-vehicle's attention. Evaluation of the state-of-the-art intention prediction methods on our dataset shows a significant performance drop of up to $\mathbf{15\%}$, while trajectory prediction methods underperform with an increase of up to $\mathbf{1208}$ MSE, defeating standard pedestrian datasets. Additionally, we present exhaustive quantitative and qualitative analysis of intention and trajectory baselines.

While many models have been developed towards this end, effectively capturing and predicting the variability inherent to human behavior still remains an open challenge. This paper proposes TrajFlow - a new approach for probabilistic trajectory prediction based on Normalizing Flows. We reformulate the problem of capturing distributions over trajectories into capturing distributions over abstracted trajectory features using an autoencoder, simplifying the learning task of the Normalizing Flows. TrajFlow outperforms state-of-the-art behavior prediction models in capturing full trajectory distributions in two synthetic benchmarks with known true distributions, and is competitive on the naturalistic datasets ETH/UCY, rounD, and nuScenes. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of TrajFlow in probabilistic prediction of human behavior.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we introduce Multimodal Trajectory Retrieval, bridging the gap between universal retrieval and agent-centric trajectory modeling. We construct the Unified Agent Trajectory Dataset (UATD) from annotated demonstrations and states across diverse real-world scenarios. Based on this, we present GAE-Bench, a benchmark containing a large number of trajectory-based retrieval pairs. In addition, we propose GAE-Retriever, a multimodal retrieval framework that adopts vision-language models and incorporates optimized contrastive learning through a token selection and the GradCache mechanism. Comprehensive evaluations across multiple datasets show that GAE-Retriever consistently outperforms strong baselines in retrieval recall, highlighting its effectiveness in advancing multimodal trajectory retrieval.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 3 figures, accepted by Workshop on Computer-use Agents @ ICML 2025</p></details> |

Despite their utility in advancing digital automation, a critical bottleneck persists: collecting high-quality trajectory data for training. Common practices for collecting such data rely on human supervision or synthetic data generation through executing pre-defined tasks, which are either resource-intensive or unable to guarantee data quality. Moreover, these methods suffer from limited data diversity and significant gaps between synthetic data and real-world environments. To address these challenges, we propose OS-Genesis, a novel GUI data synthesis pipeline that reverses the conventional trajectory collection process. Instead of relying on pre-defined tasks, OS-Genesis enables agents first to perceive environments and perform step-wise interactions, then retrospectively derive high-quality tasks to enable trajectory-level exploration. A trajectory reward model is then employed to ensure the quality of the generated trajectories. We demonstrate that training GUI agents with OS-Genesis significantly improves their performance on highly challenging online benchmarks. In-depth analysis further validates OS-Genesis's efficiency and its superior data quality and diversity compared to existing synthesis methods.

However, this requires that the dataset be labeled by a reward function. In applied settings such as video game development, the availability of the reward function is not always guaranteed. This paper proposes Trajectory-Ranked OFfline Inverse reinforcement learning (TROFI), a novel approach to effectively learn a policy offline without a pre-defined reward function. TROFI first learns a reward function from human preferences, which it then uses to label the original dataset making it usable for training the policy. In contrast to other approaches, our method does not require optimal trajectories. Through experiments on the D4RL benchmark we demonstrate that TROFI consistently outperforms baselines and performs comparably to using the ground truth reward to learn policies. Additionally, we validate the efficacy of our method in a 3D game environment. Our studies of the reward model highlight the importance of the reward function in this setting: we show that to ensure the alignment of a value function to the actual future discounted reward, it is fundamental to have a well-engineered and easy-to-learn reward function.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at Reinforcement Learning and Video Games Workshop at RLC 2025</p></details> |

We develop a feature adaptor to effectively aggregate lane-graph features into grid space, enabling seamless integration with the maximum entropy IRL paradigm to infer the reward distribution and obtain the policy that can be sampled to induce multiple plausible plans. Furthermore, conditioned on the sampled plans, we implement a hierarchical parameterized trajectory generator with a refinement module to enhance prediction accuracy and a probability fusion strategy to boost prediction confidence.

This paper proposes a unified framework that jointly predicts both behavioral intentions and trajectories to enhance prediction accuracy, interpretability, and efficiency. Specifically, we employ a shared context encoder for both intention and trajectory predictions, thereby reducing structural redundancy and information loss. Moreover, we address the lack of ground-truth behavioral intention labels in mainstream datasets (Waymo, Argoverse) by auto-labeling these datasets, thus advancing the community's efforts in this direction. We further introduce a vectorized occupancy prediction module that infers the probability of each map polyline being occupied by the target vehicle's future trajectory. By leveraging these intention and occupancy prediction priors, our method conducts dynamic, modality-dependent pruning of irrelevant agents and map polylines in the decoding stage, effectively reducing computational overhead and mitigating noise from non-critical elements. Our approach ranks first among LiDAR-free methods on the Waymo Motion Dataset and achieves first place on the Waymo Interactive Prediction Dataset. Remarkably, even without model ensembling, our single-model framework improves the soft mean average precision (softmAP) by 10 percent compared to the second-best method in the Waymo Interactive Prediction Leaderboard. Furthermore, the proposed framework has been successfully deployed on real vehicles, demonstrating its practical effectiveness in real-world applications.</p></details> | under review |

Our approach integrates several novel contributions, including a tailored object detector optimized for high-altitude bird's-eye view perspectives, a unique track stabilization method that uses detected vehicle bounding boxes as exclusion masks during image registration, and an orthophoto and master frame-based georeferencing strategy that enhances consistent alignment across multiple drone viewpoints. Additionally, our framework features robust vehicle dimension estimation and detailed road segmentation, enabling comprehensive traffic analysis. Conducted in the Songdo International Business District, South Korea, the study utilized a multi-drone experiment covering 20 intersections, capturing approximately 12TB of 4K video data over four days. The framework produced two high-quality datasets: the Songdo Traffic dataset, comprising approximately 700,000 unique vehicle trajectories, and the Songdo Vision dataset, containing over 5,000 human-annotated images with about 300,000 vehicle instances in four classes. Comparisons with high-precision sensor data from an instrumented probe vehicle highlight the accuracy and consistency of our extraction pipeline in dense urban environments. The public release of Songdo Traffic and Songdo Vision, and the complete source code for the extraction pipeline, establishes new benchmarks in data quality, reproducibility, and scalability in traffic research. Results demonstrate the potential of integrating drone technology with advanced computer vision for precise and cost-effective urban traffic monitoring, providing valuable resources for developing intelligent transportation systems and enhancing traffic management strategies.</p></details> |  |

Due to the significant interest in the area, data collection has improved substantially, resulting in a large number of features becoming available for training and predicting models. However, this introduces a high-dimensionality-induced feature explosion problem, which reduces the efficiency and interpretability of the data, thereby reducing the accuracy of machine learning models. To overcome this issue, feature selection has become one of the most prevalent tools. Thus, the objective of this paper was to introduce a taxonomy-based feature selection method that categorizes features based on their internal structure. This approach classifies the data into geometric and kinematic features, further categorizing them into curvature, indentation, speed, and acceleration. The comparative analysis indicated that a taxonomy-based approach consistently achieved comparable or superior predictive performance. Furthermore, due to the taxonomic grouping, which reduces combinatorial space, the time taken to select features was drastically reduced. The taxonomy was also used to gain insights into what feature sets each dataset was more sensitive to. Overall, this study provides robust evidence that a taxonomy-based feature selection method can add a layer of interpretability, reduce dimensionality and computational complexity, and contribute to high-level decision-making. It serves as a step toward providing a methodological framework for researchers and practitioners dealing with trajectory datasets and contributing to the broader field of explainable artificial intelligence.</p></details> |  |

However, their performance depends heavily on accurate camera pose priors. Existing approaches attempt to address this issue by introducing external constraints but fall short of achieving satisfactory accuracy, particularly when camera trajectories are complex. In this paper, we propose a novel method, RA-NeRF, capable of predicting highly accurate camera poses even with complex camera trajectories. Following the incremental pipeline, RA-NeRF reconstructs the scene using NeRF with photometric consistency and incorporates flow-driven pose regulation to enhance robustness during initialization and localization. Additionally, RA-NeRF employs an implicit pose filter to capture the camera movement pattern and eliminate the noise for pose estimation. To validate our method, we conduct extensive experiments on the Tanks\&Temple dataset for standard evaluation, as well as the NeRFBuster dataset, which presents challenging camera pose trajectories. On both datasets, RA-NeRF achieves state-of-the-art results in both camera pose estimation and visual quality, demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness in scene reconstruction under complex pose trajectories.</p></details> | IROS 2025 |

The model integrates a learnable component that predicts robot-terrain interaction forces with a neural-symbolic layer that enforces the laws of classical mechanics and consequently improves generalization on out-of-distribution data. The neural-symbolic layer includes a differentiable physics engine that computes the robot's trajectory by querying these forces at the points of contact with the terrain. As the proposed architecture comprises substantial geometrical and physics priors, the resulting model can also be seen as a learnable physics engine conditioned on real sensor data that delivers $10^4$ trajectories per second. We argue and empirically demonstrate that this architecture reduces the sim-to-real gap and mitigates out-of-distribution sensitivity. The differentiability, in conjunction with the rapid simulation speed, makes the model well-suited for various applications including model predictive control, trajectory shooting, supervised and reinforcement learning, or SLAM.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/ctu-vras/fusionforce</p></details> |

This distinctive feature makes them the preferred choice for vehicles required to traverse soft and uneven terrain. From a robotics perspective, however, this flexibility comes at a cost: the complexity of modelling the system and the resulting difficulty in designing theoretically sound navigation solutions. In this paper, we aim to bridge this gap by proposing a framework for the navigation of tracked vehicles, built upon three key pillars. The first pillar comprises two models: a simulation model and a control-oriented model. The simulation model captures the intricate terramechanics dynamics arising from soil-track interaction and is employed to develop faithful digital twins of the system across a wide range of operating conditions. The control-oriented model is pseudo-kinematic and mathematically tractable, enabling the design of efficient and theoretically robust control schemes. The second pillar is a Lyapunov-based feedback trajectory controller that provides certifiable tracking guarantees. The third pillar is a portfolio of motion planning solutions, each offering different complexity-accuracy trade-offs. The various components of the proposed approach are validated through an extensive set of simulation and experimental data.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we present a reinforcement-learning framework for multi-setpoint and multi-trajectory tracking. Tracking multiple setpoints and time-varying trajectories in reinforcement learning is challenging due to the complexity of balancing multiple objectives, a difficulty further exacerbated by system uncertainties such as uncertain initial conditions and stochastic dynamics. This challenge is relevant, e.g., in bioprocesses involving microbial consortia, where precise control over population compositions is required. We introduce a novel return function based on multiplicative reciprocal saturation functions, which explicitly couples reward gains to the simultaneous satisfaction of multiple references. Through a case study involving light-mediated cybergenetic growth control in microbial consortia, we demonstrate via computational experiments that our approach achieves faster convergence, improved stability, and superior control compliance compared to conventional quadratic-cost-based return functions. Moreover, our method enables tuning of the saturation function's parameters, shaping the learning process and policy updates. By incorporating system uncertainties, our framework also demonstrates robustness, a key requirement in industrial bioprocessing. Overall, this work advances reinforcement-learning-based control strategies in bioprocess engineering, with implications in the broader field of process and systems engineering.</p></details> |  |

Despite their differences in workflows, existing LLM-based multi-agent systems mostly use natural language for agent communication. While this is appealing for its simplicity and interpretability, it also introduces inevitable information loss as one model must down sample its continuous state vectors to concrete tokens before transferring them to the other model. Such losses are particularly significant when the information to transfer is not simple facts, but reasoning logics or abstractive thoughts. To tackle this problem, we propose a new communication protocol that transfers both natural language tokens and token-wise state transition trajectory from one agent to another. Particularly, compared to the actual state value, we find that the sequence of state changes in LLMs after generating each token can better reflect the information hidden behind the inference process, so we propose a State Delta Encoding (SDE) method to represent state transition trajectories. The experimental results show that multi-agent systems with SDE achieve SOTA performance compared to other communication protocols, particularly in tasks that involve complex reasoning. This shows the potential of communication augmentation for LLM-based multi-agent systems.</p></details> | 22 pages, 5 figures |

While robotic manipulators offer high precision, versatility, and productivity, they exhibit expressionless and monotonous motions that conceal the robot's intention, resulting in a lack of efficiency and transparency with humans. In this work, we use Laban notation, a dance annotation language, to enable robotic manipulators to generate trajectories with functional expressivity, where the robot uses nonverbal cues to communicate its abilities and the likelihood of succeeding at its task. We achieve this by introducing two novel variants of Hesitant expressive motion (Spoke-Like and Arc-Like). We also enhance the emotional expressivity of four existing emotive trajectories (Happy, Sad, Shy, and Angry) by augmenting Laban Effort usage with Laban Shape. The functionally expressive motions are validated via a human-subjects study, where participants equate both variants of Hesitant motion with reduced robot competency. The enhanced emotive trajectories are shown to be viewed as distinct emotions using the Valence-Arousal-Dominance (VAD) spectrum, corroborating the usage of Laban Shape.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for presentation at the 2025 IEEE RO-MAN Conference</p></details> |

Previous PRMs are primarily trained on model final output responses and struggle to evaluate intermediate thinking trajectories robustly, especially in the emerging setting of trajectory-response outputs generated by frontier reasoning models like Deepseek-R1. In this work, we introduce ReasonFlux-PRM, a novel trajectory-aware PRM explicitly designed to evaluate the trajectory-response type of reasoning traces. ReasonFlux-PRM incorporates both step-level and trajectory-level supervision, enabling fine-grained reward assignment aligned with structured chain-of-thought data. We adapt ReasonFlux-PRM to support reward supervision under both offline and online settings, including (i) selecting high-quality model distillation data for downstream supervised fine-tuning of smaller models, (ii) providing dense process-level rewards for policy optimization during reinforcement learning, and (iii) enabling reward-guided Best-of-N test-time scaling. Empirical results on challenging downstream benchmarks such as AIME, MATH500, and GPQA-Diamond demonstrate that ReasonFlux-PRM-7B selects higher quality data than strong PRMs (e.g., Qwen2.5-Math-PRM-72B) and human-curated baselines. Furthermore, our derived ReasonFlux-PRM-7B yields consistent performance improvements, achieving average gains of 12.1% in supervised fine-tuning, 4.5% in reinforcement learning, and 6.3% in test-time scaling.

These agents operate by autonomously generating natural language thoughts, invoking external tools, and iteratively refining their solutions. Despite their widespread adoption, the internal decision-making processes of these agents remain largely unexplored, limiting our understanding of their operational dynamics and failure modes. In this paper, we present a large-scale empirical study of the thought-action-result trajectories of three state-of-the-art LLM-based agents: \textsc{RepairAgent}, \textsc{AutoCodeRover}, and \textsc{OpenHands}. We unify their interaction logs into a common format, capturing 120 trajectories and 2822 LLM interactions focused on program repair and issue resolution. Our study combines quantitative analyses of structural properties, action patterns, and token usage with qualitative assessments of reasoning coherence and feedback integration. We identify key trajectory characteristics such as iteration counts and token consumption, recurring action sequences, and the semantic coherence linking thoughts, actions, and their results. Our findings reveal behavioral motifs and anti-patterns that distinguish successful from failed executions, providing actionable insights for improving agent design, including prompting strategies, failure diagnosis, and anti-pattern detection.

Relying on a single predicted path, as in regression-based approaches, usually does not explicitly assess the safety of the predicted trajectory. Selection-based methods address this by generating and scoring multiple trajectory candidates and predicting the safety score for each, but face optimization challenges in precisely selecting the best option from thousands of possibilities and distinguishing subtle but safety-critical differences, especially in rare or underrepresented scenarios. We propose DriveSuprim to overcome these challenges and advance the selection-based paradigm through a coarse-to-fine paradigm for progressive candidate filtering, a rotation-based augmentation method to improve robustness in out-of-distribution scenarios, and a self-distillation framework to stabilize training. DriveSuprim achieves state-of-the-art performance, reaching 93.5% PDMS in NAVSIM v1 and 87.1% EPDMS in NAVSIM v2 without extra data, demonstrating superior safetycritical capabilities, including collision avoidance and compliance with rules, while maintaining high trajectory quality in various driving scenarios.</p></details> | 15 pages, 6 figures |

Naturally, it is common to demonstrate the advantages of these new controllers against established methods like analytical controllers. We observe, however, that reliably comparing the performance of such very different classes of controllers is more complicated than might appear at first sight. As a case study, we take up the problem of agile tracking of an end-effector for a quadrotor with a fixed arm. We develop a set of best practices for synthesizing the best-in-class RL and geometric controllers (GC) for benchmarking. In the process, we resolve widespread RL-favoring biases in prior studies that provide asymmetric access to: (1) the task definition, in the form of an objective function, (2) representative datasets, for parameter optimization, and (3) feedforward information, describing the desired future trajectory. The resulting findings are the following: our improvements to the experimental protocol for comparing learned and classical controllers are critical, and each of the above asymmetries can yield misleading conclusions. Prior works have claimed that RL outperforms GC, but we find the gaps between the two controller classes are much smaller than previously published when accounting for symmetric comparisons. Geometric control achieves lower steady-state error than RL, while RL has better transient performance, resulting in GC performing better in relatively slow or less agile tasks, but RL performing better when greater agility is required.

This work proposes a Physics-Informed Mixture of Experts (PIMOE) network that computes battery degradation trajectories using partial, field-accessible signals in a single cycle. PIMOE leverages an adaptive multi-degradation prediction module to classify degradation modes using expert weight synthesis underpinned by capacity-voltage and relaxation data, producing latent degradation trend embeddings. These are input to a use-dependent recurrent network for long-term trajectory prediction. Validated on 207 batteries across 77 use conditions and 67,902 cycles, PIMOE achieves an average mean absolute percentage (MAPE) errors of 0.88% with a 0.43 ms inference time. Compared to the state-of-the-art Informer and PatchTST, it reduces computational time and MAPE by 50%, respectively. Compatible with random state of charge region sampling, PIMOE supports 150-cycle forecasts with 1.50% average and 6.26% maximum MAPE, and operates effectively even with pruned 5MB training data. Broadly, PIMOE framework offers a deployable, history-free solution for battery degradation trajectory computation, redefining how second-life energy storage systems are assessed, optimized, and integrated into the sustainable energy landscape.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory tracking control of USV with actuator constraints in the presence of disturbances](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17005v1)** | 2025-06-20 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2506.17005v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>All practical systems often pose a problem of finite control capability, which can notably degrade the performance if not properly addressed. Since actuator input bounds are typically known, integrating actuator saturation considerations into the control law design process can lead to enhanced performance and more precise trajectory tracking. Also, the actuators cannot provide the demanded forces or torques instantaneously; hence, there is a limitation on the rate of magnitude. This work proposes nonlinear feedback controller designs developed using the Lyapunov stability and backstepping method while actively considering the actuator magnitude and rate constraints. The system dynamics are augmented with a smooth control input saturation model. Additionally, an observer is incorporated to estimate the disturbance vector. Through Lyapunov stability analysis, we demonstrate the system's stability under the proposed controller for the Uncrewed Surface Vessel (USV), ensuring adherence to actuator constraints provided their initial values fall within the prescribed bounds. Extensive numerical simulations performed by considering various trajectories and multiple initial conditions demonstrate the effectiveness of the controller in maintaining tracking performance without violating actuator constraints. This work also relaxes the assumption of equally capable actuators to be used to control the motion of USVs, affirming the viability of the controller in practical applications.</p></details> |  |

However, traditional methods often struggle to extract deep semantic representations and incorporate contextual map information. We propose TrajSceneLLM, a multimodal perspective for enhancing semantic understanding of GPS trajectories. The framework integrates visualized map images (encoding spatial context) and textual descriptions generated through LLM reasoning (capturing temporal sequences and movement dynamics). Separate embeddings are generated for each modality and then concatenated to produce trajectory scene embeddings with rich semantic content which are further paired with a simple MLP classifier. We validate the proposed framework on Travel Mode Identification (TMI), a critical task for analyzing travel choices and understanding mobility behavior. Our experiments show that these embeddings achieve significant performance improvement, highlighting the advantage of our LLM-driven method in capturing deep spatio-temporal dependencies and reducing reliance on handcrafted features. This semantic enhancement promises significant potential for diverse downstream applications and future research in geospatial artificial intelligence.

While model-driven, rule-based, and classical learning-based methods are widely used to tackle these tasks at present, they can struggle to effectively capture the complex, multimodal distributions of future trajectories. In this paper we investigate whether a generative adversarial network (GAN) trained on videos of bird's-eye view (BEV) traffic scenarios can generate statistically accurate trajectories that correctly capture spatial relationships between the agents. To this end, we propose a pipeline that uses low-resolution BEV occupancy grid videos as training data for a video generative model. From the generated videos of traffic scenarios we extract abstract trajectory data using single-frame object detection and frame-to-frame object matching. We particularly choose a GAN architecture for the fast training and inference times with respect to diffusion models. We obtain our best results within 100 GPU hours of training, with inference times under 20\,ms. We demonstrate the physical realism of the proposed trajectories in terms of distribution alignment of spatial and dynamic parameters with respect to the ground truth videos from the Waymo Open Motion Dataset.</p></details> |  |

Multi-drone thermal screening systems offer promising solutions for fast, large-scale, and non-intrusive human temperature monitoring. However, trajectory planning for multiple drones in complex urban environments poses significant challenges, including collision avoidance, coverage efficiency, and constrained flight environments. In this study, we propose an enhanced trust region sequential convex optimization (TR-SCO) algorithm for optimal trajectory planning of multiple drones performing thermal screening tasks. Our improved algorithm integrates a refined convex optimization formulation within a trust region framework, effectively balancing trajectory smoothness, obstacle avoidance, altitude constraints, and maximum screening coverage. Simulation results demonstrate that our approach significantly improves trajectory optimality and computational efficiency compared to conventional convex optimization methods. This research provides critical insights and practical contributions toward deploying efficient multi-drone systems for real-time thermal screening in urban areas.

However, in such a complex environment the selection of optimum trajectory of UAVs is of utmost importance. UAV trajectory optimization deals with finding the shortest path in the minimal possible time. In this paper, a cluster optimization scheme (COS) is proposed using the Henry gas optimization (HGO) metaheuristic algorithm to identify the shortest path having minimal transportation cost and algorithm complexity. The mathematical model is designed for COS using the HGO algorithm and compared with the state-of-the-art metaheuristic algorithms such as particle swarm optimization (PSO), grey wolf optimization (GWO), cuckoo search algorithm (CSA) and barnacles mating optimizer (BMO). In order to prove the robustness of the proposed model, four different scenarios are evaluated that includes ambient environment, constrict environment, tangled environment, and complex environment. In all the aforementioned scenarios, the HGO algorithm outperforms the existing algorithms. Particularly, in the ambient environment, the HGO algorithm achieves a 39.3% reduction in transportation cost and a 16.8% reduction in computational time as compared to the PSO algorithm. Hence, the HGO algorithm can be used for autonomous trajectory optimization of UAVs in smart cities.</p></details> | 12 pages, 9 figuers |
| **[TrajDiff: Diffusion Bridge Network with Semantic Alignment for Trajectory Similarity Computation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15898v1)** | 2025-06-18 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2506.15898v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the proliferation of location-tracking technologies, massive volumes of trajectory data are continuously being collected. As a fundamental task in trajectory data mining, trajectory similarity computation plays a critical role in a wide range of real-world applications. However, existing learning-based methods face three challenges: First, they ignore the semantic gap between GPS and grid features in trajectories, making it difficult to obtain meaningful trajectory embeddings. Second, the noise inherent in the trajectories, as well as the noise introduced during grid discretization, obscures the true motion patterns of the trajectories. Third, existing methods focus solely on point-wise and pair-wise losses, without utilizing the global ranking information obtained by sorting all trajectories according to their similarity to a given trajectory. To address the aforementioned challenges, we propose a novel trajectory similarity computation framework, named TrajDiff. Specifically, the semantic alignment module relies on cross-attention and an attention score mask mechanism with adaptive fusion, effectively eliminating semantic discrepancies between data at two scales and generating a unified representation. Additionally, the DDBM-based Noise-robust Pre-Training introduces the transfer patterns between any two trajectories into the model training process, enhancing the model's noise robustness. Finally, the overall ranking-aware regularization shifts the model's focus from a local to a global perspective, enabling it to capture the holistic ordering information among trajectories. Extensive experiments on three publicly available datasets show that TrajDiff consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. In particular, it achieves an average HR@1 gain of 33.38% across all three evaluation metrics and datasets.</p></details> |  |

MENSA learns a shared representation of the input features while capturing the complex dependence structures between events. In practice, it optimizes the sum of the traditional negative log-likelihood across events and a novel trajectory-based likelihood, which encourages the model to learn the temporal order in which events occur. Experiments on real-world clinical datasets demonstrate that MENSA improves risk and time-to-event prediction compared to state-of-the-art models across single-event, competing-risk, and multi-event settings. Moreover, MENSA achieves this with fewer parameters and lower computational cost (FLOPs) than several deep learning baselines, particularly in high-dimensional feature spaces (more than 100 features).</p></details> |  |

This metric builds on the recently introduced probabilistic GOSPA metric to account for both the existence and state estimation uncertainties of individual object states. Similar to trajectory GOSPA (TGOSPA), it can be formulated as a multidimensional assignment problem, and its linear programming relaxation--also a valid metric--is computable in polynomial time. Additionally, this metric retains the interpretability of TGOSPA, and we show that its decomposition yields intuitive costs terms associated to expected localization error and existence probability mismatch error for properly detected objects, expected missed and false detection error, and track switch error. The effectiveness of the proposed metric is demonstrated through a simulation study.</p></details> | 7 pages, 4 figures |

However, due to the instability of heterogeneous communication and time-varying characteristics of SAGIN, it is challenging to meet the remote Internet of Things (IoT) demands for data collection and offloading. In this paper, we investigate a two-phase hierarchical data uplink model in SAGIN. Specifically, UAVs optimize trajectories to enable efficient data collection from IoT devices, and then they transmit the data to LEO satellites with computing capabilities for further processing. The problem is formulated to minimize the total energy consumption for IoT devices, UAVs, and LEO satellites. Since the problem is in the form of mixed-integer nonlinear programming and intractable to solve directly, we decompose it into two phases. In the IoT-UAV phase, we design the algorithm to jointly optimize the IoT pairing, power allocation, and UAVs trajectories. Considering the high dynamic characteristics of LEO satellites, a real-time LEO satellite selection mechanism joint with the Satellite Tool Kit is proposed in the UAV-LEO phase. Finally, simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms, with about 10% less energy consumption compared with the benchmark algorithm.</p></details> |  |

Purpose: Our objective is to develop a general, nonlinear gradient system model that can accurately predict gradient distortions using convolutional networks.

Results: The trained network was able to accurately predict nonlinear distortions produced by the gradient system. Network prediction of gradient waveforms was incorporated into the image reconstruction pipeline and provided improvements in image quality and diffusion parameter mapping compared to both the nominal gradient waveform and the gradient impulse response function. Conclusion: Temporal convolutional networks can more accurately model gradient system behavior than existing linear methods and may be used to retrospectively correct gradient errors.</p></details> |  |

While the lack of exact latent inversion is a core advantage of these methods, it often results in unstable editing trajectories and poor source consistency. To address this limitation, we propose FlowAlign, a novel inversion-free flow-based framework for consistent image editing with principled trajectory control. FlowAlign introduces a flow-matching loss as a regularization mechanism to promote smoother and more stable trajectories during the editing process. Notably, the flow-matching loss is shown to explicitly balance semantic alignment with the edit prompt and structural consistency with the source image along the trajectory. Furthermore, FlowAlign naturally supports reverse editing by simply reversing the ODE trajectory, highlighting the reversible and consistent nature of the transformation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FlowAlign outperforms existing methods in both source preservation and editing controllability.</p></details> |  |

Despite considerable progress, the challenge of designing trajectory representations that can capture diverse and complementary information remains an open research problem. Existing methods struggle in incorporating trajectory fine-grained details and high-level summary in a single model, limiting their ability to attend to both long-term dependencies while preserving local nuances. To address this, we propose HiT-JEPA (Hierarchical Interactions of Trajectory Semantics via a Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture), a unified framework for learning multi-scale urban trajectory representations across semantic abstraction levels. HiT-JEPA adopts a three-layer hierarchy that progressively captures point-level fine-grained details, intermediate patterns, and high-level trajectory abstractions, enabling the model to integrate both local dynamics and global semantics in one coherent structure. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets for trajectory similarity computation show that HiT-JEPA's hierarchical design yields richer, multi-scale representations.

While existing approaches primarily focus on social interactions between pedestrians, they often overlook the rich environmental context that significantly shapes human movement patterns. In this paper, we propose SceneAware, a novel framework that explicitly incorporates scene understanding to enhance trajectory prediction accuracy. Our method leverages a Vision Transformer~(ViT) scene encoder to process environmental context from static scene images, while Multi-modal Large Language Models~(MLLMs) generate binary walkability masks that distinguish between accessible and restricted areas during training. We combine a Transformer-based trajectory encoder with the ViT-based scene encoder, capturing both temporal dynamics and spatial constraints. The framework integrates collision penalty mechanisms that discourage predicted trajectories from violating physical boundaries, ensuring physically plausible predictions. SceneAware is implemented in both deterministic and stochastic variants. Comprehensive experiments on the ETH/UCY benchmark datasets show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods, with more than 50\% improvement over previous models. Our analysis based on different trajectory categories shows that the model performs consistently well across various types of pedestrian movement. This highlights the importance of using explicit scene information and shows that our scene-aware approach is both effective and reliable in generating accurate and physically plausible predictions.

However, they face challenges due to their high-dimensional and unstable dynamics, as well as the complex contact-rich nature of the tasks. Model-based optimal control methods offer flexibility to define precise motion but are limited by high computational complexity and accurate contact sensing. On the other hand, reinforcement learning (RL) handles high-dimensional spaces with strong robustness but suffers from inefficient learning, unnatural motion, and sim-to-real gaps. To address these challenges, we introduce Opt2Skill, an end-to-end pipeline that combines model-based trajectory optimization with RL to achieve robust whole-body loco-manipulation. Opt2Skill generates dynamic feasible and contact-consistent reference motions for the Digit humanoid robot using differential dynamic programming (DDP) and trains RL policies to track these optimal trajectories. Our results demonstrate that Opt2Skill outperforms baselines that rely on human demonstrations and inverse kinematics-based references, both in motion tracking and task success rates. Furthermore, we show that incorporating trajectories with torque information improves contact force tracking in contact-involved tasks, such as wiping a table. We have successfully transferred our approach to real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we investigate learning-based models that imitate a model-based time-optimal trajectory planner to accelerate trajectory generation. Given a dataset of collision-free geometric paths, we show that modeling architectures can effectively learn the patterns underlying time-optimal trajectories. We introduce a quantitative framework to analyze local analytic properties of the learned models, and link them to the Backward Reachable Tube of the geometric tracking controller. To enhance robustness, we propose a data augmentation scheme that applies random perturbations to the input paths. Compared to classical planners, our method achieves substantial speedups, and we validate its real-time feasibility on a hardware quadrotor platform. Experiments demonstrate that the learned models generalize to previously unseen path lengths. The code for our approach can be found here: https://github.com/maokat12/lbTOPPQuad</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces a novel mixed Bernstein-Fourier approximation framework tailored explicitly for optimal motion planning. Our proposed methodology leverages the uniform convergence properties of Bernstein polynomials for nonperiodic behaviors while effectively capturing periodic dynamics through Fourier series. Theoretical results are established, including uniform convergence proofs for approximations of functions, derivatives, and integrals, as well as detailed error bound analyses. We further introduce a regulated least squares approach for determining approximation coefficients, enhancing numerical stability and practical applicability. Within an optimal control context, we establish feasibility and consistency of approximated solutions to their continuous counterparts. We also extend the covector mapping theorem, providing theoretical guarantees for approximating dual variables crucial in verifying the necessary optimality conditions from Pontryagin's Maximum Principle. Comprehensive numerical examples illustrate the method's superior performance, demonstrating substantial improvements in computational efficiency and precision in scenarios with complex periodic constraints and dynamics. Our mixed Bernstein-Fourier methodology thus presents a robust, theoretically grounded, and computationally efficient approach for advanced optimal trajectory planning in autonomous systems.</p></details> | 49 pages, 9 figures |

Our approach consists of two steps: estimating temporally consistent geometry, and generative rendering guided by this geometry. By integrating geometric priors, the generative model focuses on synthesizing realistic details where the estimated geometry is uncertain. We eliminate the need for extensive 4D training data through a factorized fine-tuning framework that separately trains spatial and temporal components using multi-view image and video data.

Our main results establish ultimate boundedness of the tracking error and give a constructive bound for the high-gain scaling parameter to achieve arbitrary tracking precision. Further we establish that the peaking phenomenon can be attenuated using MFC.

However, existing calibration methods typically require complex and often human-operated processes to collect data. Moreover, most frameworks neglect acoustic sensors, thereby limiting the associated systems' auditory perception capabilities. To alleviate these issues, we propose an observability-aware active calibration method for ground robots with multimodal sensors, including a microphone array, a LiDAR (exteroceptive sensors), and wheel encoders (proprioceptive sensors). Unlike traditional approaches, our method enables active trajectory optimization for online data collection and calibration, contributing to the development of more intelligent robotic systems. Specifically, we leverage the Fisher information matrix (FIM) to quantify parameter observability and adopt its minimum eigenvalue as an optimization metric for trajectory generation via B-spline curves. Through planning and replanning of robot trajectory online, the method enhances the observability of multi-sensor extrinsic parameters. The effectiveness and advantages of our method have been demonstrated through numerical simulations and real-world experiments.

Current reward modeling typically relies on scores of overall responses to learn the outcome rewards for the responses. However, since the response-level scores are coarse-grained supervision signals, the reward model struggles to identify the specific components within a response trajectory that truly correlate with the scores, leading to poor generalization on unseen responses. In this paper, we propose to leverage generation probabilities to establish reward consistency between processes in the response trajectory, which allows the response-level supervisory signal to propagate across processes, thereby providing additional fine-grained signals for reward learning. Building on analysis under the Bayesian framework, we develop an intra-trajectory consistency regularization to enforce that adjacent processes with higher next-token generation probability maintain more consistent rewards. We apply the proposed regularization to the advanced outcome reward model, improving its performance on RewardBench.

However, optimal controllers are highly sensitive to model mismatch, which can occur due to loaded equipment, packages to be delivered, or pre-existing variability in fundamental structural and thrust-related parameters. To circumvent this problem, optimal controllers can be paired with parameter estimators to improve their trajectory planning performance and perform adaptive control. However, UAV platforms are limited in terms of onboard processing power, oftentimes making nonlinear parameter estimation too computationally expensive to consider. To address these issues, we propose a relaxed, affine-in-parameters multirotor model along with an efficient optimal parameter estimator. We convexify the nominal Moving Horizon Parameter Estimation (MHPE) problem into a linear-quadratic form (LQ-MHPE) via an affine-in-parameter relaxation on the nonlinear dynamics, resulting in fast quadratic programs (QPs) that facilitate adaptive Model Predictve Control (MPC) in real time. We compare this approach to the equivalent nonlinear estimator in Monte Carlo simulations, demonstrating a decrease in average solve time and trajectory optimality cost by 98.2% and 23.9-56.2%, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures.

The main obstacle is that trajectory data are prone to measurement noise. While this is negligible for city level, large-scale flow aggregation, it poses substantial difficulties for road level, small-scale aggregation. To overcome these difficulties, we introduce innovative local alignment algorithms, where we infer road segments to serve as local reference segments, and proceed to align nearby road segments to them. We deploy these algorithms in an iterative workflow to compute locally aligned flow maps. By applying this workflow to synthetic and empirical trajectories, we verify that our locally aligned flow maps provide high levels of accuracy and spatial resolution of flow aggregation at multiple scales for static and interactive maps.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches rely either on domain-specific architectures and losses or on strong assumptions on the constraint space, restricting their applicability to linear or convex constraints. We propose a general-purpose framework for constraint-aware refinement that leverages denoising diffusion implicit models (DDIMs). Starting from a coarse prediction, our method iteratively refines it through a deterministic diffusion trajectory guided by a learned prior and augmented by constraint gradient corrections. The approach accommodates a wide class of non-convex and nonlinear equality constraints and can be applied post hoc to any base model. We demonstrate the method in two representative domains: constrained adversarial attack generation on tabular data with column-level dependencies and in AC power flow prediction under Kirchhoff's laws. Across both settings, our diffusion-guided refinement improves both constraint satisfaction and performance while remaining lightweight and model-agnostic.</p></details> |  |

However, their vulnerabilities against backdoor attacks are poorly understood. We find that existing backdoor attacks in reinforcement learning are based on reward manipulation, which are largely ineffective against the TO model due to its inherent sequence modeling nature. Moreover, the complexities introduced by high-dimensional action spaces further compound the challenge of action manipulation. To address these gaps, we propose TrojanTO, the first action-level backdoor attack against TO models. TrojanTO employs alternating training to enhance the connection between triggers and target actions for attack effectiveness. To improve attack stealth, it utilizes precise poisoning via trajectory filtering for normal performance and batch poisoning for trigger consistency. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that TrojanTO effectively implants backdoor attacks across diverse tasks and attack objectives with a low attack budget (0.3\% of trajectories). Furthermore, TrojanTO exhibits broad applicability to DT, GDT, and DC, underscoring its scalability across diverse TO model architectures.</p></details> | 23 pages, 6 figures |

The problem is societally important to curb illegal activities in international waters, such as unauthorized fishing and illicit oil transfers. The problem is challenging due to advances in AI generated in deep fakes generation (e.g., additive noise, fake trajectories) and lack of adequate amount of labeled samples for ground-truth verification. Recent literature shows promising results for anomalous trajectory detection using generative models despite data sparsity. However, they do not consider fine-scale spatiotemporal dependencies and prior physical knowledge, resulting in higher false-positive rates. To address these limitations, we propose a physics-informed diffusion model that integrates kinematic constraints to identify trajectories that do not adhere to physical laws. Experimental results on real-world datasets in the maritime and urban domains show that the proposed framework results in higher prediction accuracy and lower estimation error rate for anomaly detection and trajectory generation methods, respectively. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/arunshar/Physics-Informed-Diffusion-Probabilistic-Model.</p></details> |  |

The learned reward function is utilized to maximize the likelihood of output by the encoder-decoder architecture that combines Mamba blocks for efficient long-sequence dependency modeling with graph attention networks to encode spatial interactions among traffic agents. Comprehensive evaluations on urban intersections and roundabouts demonstrate that the proposed method not only outperforms various popular approaches in prediction accuracy but also achieves 2 times higher generalization performance to unseen scenarios compared to other IRL-based method.</p></details> |  |

We leverage the connections between trajectory inference and continuous-time synthetic data generation, along with a computational method based on mean-field Langevin dynamics. As discretized mean-field Langevin dynamics and noisy particle gradient descent are equivalent, DP results for noisy SGD can be applied to our setting. We provide experiments that generate realistic trajectories on a synthesized variation of hand-drawn MNIST data while maintaining meaningful privacy guarantees. Crucially, our method has strong utility guarantees under the setting where each person contributes data for \emph{only one time point}, while prior methods require each person to contribute their \emph{entire temporal trajectory}--directly improving the privacy characteristics by construction.</p></details> |  |

However, their out-of-distribution generalization remains a significant challenge, particularly due to unbalanced data and a lack of enough data and diversity to ensure robustness and calibration. To address this, we propose SHIFT (Spectral Heteroscedastic Informed Forecasting for Trajectories), a novel framework that uniquely combines well-calibrated uncertainty modeling with informative priors derived through automated rule extraction. SHIFT reformulates trajectory prediction as a classification task and employs heteroscedastic spectral-normalized Gaussian processes to effectively disentangle epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties. We learn informative priors from training labels, which are automatically generated from natural language driving rules, such as stop rules and drivability constraints, using a retrieval-augmented generation framework powered by a large language model. Extensive evaluations over the nuScenes dataset, including challenging low-data and cross-location scenarios, demonstrate that SHIFT outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving substantial gains in uncertainty calibration and displacement metrics. In particular, our model excels in complex scenarios, such as intersections, where uncertainty is inherently higher.

In unsupervised healthcare data analysis, interpreting clustered data can offer meaningful insights into patients' health outcomes, which hold direct implications for healthcare providers. This paper addresses the problem of interpreting clustered sensor data collected from older adult patients recovering from lower-limb fractures in the community. A total of 560 days of multimodal sensor data, including acceleration, step count, ambient motion, GPS location, heart rate, and sleep, alongside clinical scores, were remotely collected from patients at home. Clustering was first carried out separately for each data modality to assess the impact of feature sets extracted from each modality on patients' recovery trajectories. Then, using context-aware prompting, a large language model was employed to infer meaningful cluster labels for the clusters derived from each modality. The quality of these clusters and their corresponding labels was validated through rigorous statistical testing and visualization against clinical scores collected alongside the multimodal sensor data. The results demonstrated the statistical significance of most modality-specific cluster labels generated by the large language model with respect to clinical scores, confirming the efficacy of the proposed method for interpreting sensor data in an unsupervised manner. This unsupervised data analysis approach, relying solely on sensor data, enables clinicians to identify at-risk patients and take timely measures to improve health outcomes.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 2 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

Node2Vec is employed to generate low-dimensional embeddings, which are subsequently clustered using K-means to identify distinct floors. Evaluated on the Huawei University Challenge 2021 dataset, our method outperforms traditional community detection algorithms, achieving an accuracy of 68.97\%, an F1-score of 61.99\%, and an Adjusted Rand Index of 57.19\%. By publicly releasing the preprocessed dataset and implementation code, this work contributes to advancing research in indoor positioning.

Numerous methods have been proposed to address specific problems within trajectory modeling. However, the heterogeneity of data and the diversity of trajectory tasks make effective and reliable trajectory modeling an important yet highly challenging endeavor, even for domain experts.

Building on \textit{UniEnv}, we introduce an agentic workflow designed for automatic trajectory modeling across various trajectory tasks and data. Furthermore, we introduce collaborative learning schema between LLM-based agents and small speciallized models, to enhance the performance of the whole framework effectively.

Trajectory optimization is a powerful and widely used algorithm in control, parameterized by a cost and a dynamics function. The key to our approach is to leverage the recent progress in differentiable trajectory optimization, which enables computing the gradients of the loss with respect to the parameters of trajectory optimization. As a result, the cost and dynamics functions of trajectory optimization can be learned end-to-end. DiffTORI addresses the ``objective mismatch'' issue of prior model-based RL algorithms, as the dynamics model in DiffTORI is learned to directly maximize task performance by differentiating the policy gradient loss through the trajectory optimization process. We further benchmark DiffTORI for imitation learning on standard robotic manipulation task suites with high-dimensional sensory observations and compare our method to feed-forward policy classes as well as Energy-Based Models (EBM) and Diffusion. Across 15 model-based RL tasks and 35 imitation learning tasks with high-dimensional image and point cloud inputs, DiffTORI outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods in both domains.

In this paper, we establish a generalization bound for gradient flow that aligns with the classical Rademacher complexity bounds for kernel methods-specifically those based on the RKHS norm and kernel trace-through a data-dependent kernel called the loss path kernel (LPK). Unlike static kernels such as NTK, the LPK captures the entire training trajectory, adapting to both data and optimization dynamics, leading to tighter and more informative generalization guarantees. Moreover, the bound highlights how the norm of the training loss gradients along the optimization trajectory influences the final generalization performance. The key technical ingredients in our proof combine stability analysis of gradient flow with uniform convergence via Rademacher complexity. Our bound recovers existing kernel regression bounds for overparameterized neural networks and shows the feature learning capability of neural networks compared to kernel methods. Numerical experiments on real-world datasets validate that our bounds correlate well with the true generalization gap.</p></details> |  |

Poutine is trained in two stages. To obtain strong base driving capabilities, we train Poutine-Base in a self-supervised vision-language-trajectory (VLT) next-token prediction fashion on 83 hours of CoVLA nominal driving and 11 hours of Waymo long-tail driving. Accompanying language annotations are auto-generated with a 72B-parameter VLM. Poutine is obtained by fine-tuning Poutine-Base with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) using less than 500 preference-labeled frames from the Waymo validation set. We show that both VLT pretraining and RL fine-tuning are critical to attain strong driving performance in the long-tail. Poutine-Base achieves a rater-feedback score (RFS) of 8.12 on the validation set, nearly matching Waymo's expert ground-truth RFS. The final Poutine model achieves an RFS of 7.99 on the official Waymo test set, placing 1st in the 2025 Waymo Vision-Based End-to-End Driving Challenge by a significant margin. These results highlight the promise of scalable VLT pre-training and lightweight RL fine-tuning to enable robust and generalizable autonomy.</p></details> |  |

Previous wireframe-alignment-based method LoD-Loc has shown promising localization results leveraging LoD models. However, LoD-Loc mainly relies on high-LoD (LoD3 or LoD2) city models, but the majority of available models and those many countries plan to construct nationwide are low-LoD (LoD1). Consequently, enabling localization on low-LoD city models could unlock drones' potential for global urban localization. To address these issues, we introduce LoD-Loc v2, which employs a coarse-to-fine strategy using explicit silhouette alignment to achieve accurate localization over low-LoD city models in the air. Specifically, given a query image, LoD-Loc v2 first applies a building segmentation network to shape building silhouettes. Then, in the coarse pose selection stage, we construct a pose cost volume by uniformly sampling pose hypotheses around a prior pose to represent the pose probability distribution. Each cost of the volume measures the degree of alignment between the projected and predicted silhouettes. We select the pose with maximum value as the coarse pose. In the fine pose estimation stage, a particle filtering method incorporating a multi-beam tracking approach is used to efficiently explore the hypothesis space and obtain the final pose estimation. To further facilitate research in this field, we release two datasets with LoD1 city models covering 10.7 km , along with real RGB queries and ground-truth pose annotations. Experimental results show that LoD-Loc v2 improves estimation accuracy with high-LoD models and enables localization with low-LoD models for the first time. Moreover, it outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by large margins, even surpassing texture-model-based methods, and broadens the convergence basin to accommodate larger prior errors.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025</p></details> |

However, existing approaches are typically limited to small-scale environments, lacking the scalability and compositional reasoning capabilities necessary for large, complex urban settings. To overcome these limitations, we propose GeoProg3D, a visual programming framework that enables natural language-driven interactions with city-scale high-fidelity 3D scenes. GeoProg3D consists of two key components: (i) a Geography-aware City-scale 3D Language Field (GCLF) that leverages a memory-efficient hierarchical 3D model to handle large-scale data, integrated with geographic information for efficiently filtering vast urban spaces using directional cues, distance measurements, elevation data, and landmark references; and (ii) Geographical Vision APIs (GV-APIs), specialized geographic vision tools such as area segmentation and object detection. Our framework employs large language models (LLMs) as reasoning engines to dynamically combine GV-APIs and operate GCLF, effectively supporting diverse geographic vision tasks. To assess performance in city-scale reasoning, we introduce GeoEval3D, a comprehensive benchmark dataset containing 952 query-answer pairs across five challenging tasks: grounding, spatial reasoning, comparison, counting, and measurement. Experiments demonstrate that GeoProg3D significantly outperforms existing 3D language fields and vision-language models across multiple tasks.

Generating 4D cities is more challenging than 3D scenes due to the presence of structurally complex, visually diverse objects like buildings and vehicles, and heightened human sensitivity to distortions in urban environments. To tackle these issues, we propose CityDreamer4D, a compositional generative model specifically tailored for generating unbounded 4D cities. Our main insights are 1) 4D city generation should separate dynamic objects (e.g., vehicles) from static scenes (e.g., buildings and roads), and 2) all objects in the 4D scene should be composed of different types of neural fields for buildings, vehicles, and background stuff. Specifically, we propose Traffic Scenario Generator and Unbounded Layout Generator to produce dynamic traffic scenarios and static city layouts using a highly compact BEV representation. Objects in 4D cities are generated by combining stuff-oriented and instance-oriented neural fields for background stuff, buildings, and vehicles. To suit the distinct characteristics of background stuff and instances, the neural fields employ customized generative hash grids and periodic positional embeddings as scene parameterizations. Furthermore, we offer a comprehensive suite of datasets for city generation, including OSM, GoogleEarth, and CityTopia. The OSM dataset provides a variety of real-world city layouts, while the Google Earth and CityTopia datasets deliver large-scale, high-quality city imagery complete with 3D instance annotations.

The culmination of this vision would be a generative simulated city, where given a map of the city and an autonomous vehicle (AV) software stack, the simulator can seamlessly simulate the trip from point A to point B by populating the city around the AV and controlling all aspects of the scene, from animating the dynamic agents (e.g., vehicles, pedestrians) to controlling the traffic light states. We refer to this vision as CitySim, which requires an agglomeration of simulation technologies: scene generation to populate the initial scene, agent behavior modeling to animate the scene, occlusion reasoning, dynamic scene generation to seamlessly spawn and remove agents, and environment simulation for factors such as traffic lights. While some key technologies have been separately studied in various works, others such as dynamic scene generation and environment simulation have received less attention in the research community.

We study this interaction by simulating human drivers and AVs. Our experiments with standard MARL algorithms reveal that, both in simplified and complex networks, policies often fail to converge to an optimal solution or require long training periods. This problem is amplified by the fact that we cannot rely entirely on simulated training, as there are no accurate models of human routing behavior. At the same time, real-world training in cities risks destabilizing urban traffic systems, increasing externalities, such as $CO_2$ emissions, and introducing non-stationarity as human drivers will adapt unpredictably to AV behaviors. In this position paper, we argue that city authorities must collaborate with the ML community to monitor and critically evaluate the routing algorithms proposed by car companies toward fair and system-efficient routing algorithms and regulatory standards.</p></details> |  |

This paper explores the design considerations and engagement opportunities of public service chatbots, using a 311 chatbot from a metropolitan city as a case study. Our qualitative study consisted of official survey data and 16 interviews examining stakeholder experiences and design preferences for the chatbot. We found two key areas of concern regarding these public chatbots: individual-level and community-level. At the individual level, citizens experience three key challenges: interpretation, transparency, and social contextualization. Moreover, the current chatbot design prioritizes the efficient completion of individual tasks but neglects the broader community perspective.

| **[Bi-directional Mapping of Morphology Metrics and 3D City Blocks for Enhanced Characterization and Generation of Urban Form](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15801v2)** | 2025-06-13 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2412.15801v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Urban morphology, examining city spatial configurations, links urban design to sustainability. Morphology metrics play a fundamental role in performance-driven computational urban design (CUD) which integrates urban form generation, performance evaluation and optimization. However, a critical gap remains between performance evaluation and complex urban form generation, caused by the disconnection between morphology metrics and urban form, particularly in metric-to-form workflows. It prevents the application of optimized metrics to generate improved urban form with enhanced urban performance. Formulating morphology metrics that not only effectively characterize complex urban forms but also enable the reconstruction of diverse forms is of significant importance. This paper highlights the importance of establishing a bi-directional mapping between morphology metrics and complex urban form to enable the integration of urban form generation with performance evaluation. We present an approach that can 1) formulate morphology metrics to both characterize urban forms and in reverse, retrieve diverse similar 3D urban forms, and 2) evaluate the effectiveness of morphology metrics in representing 3D urban form characteristics of blocks by comparison. We demonstrate the methodology with 3D urban models of New York City, covering 14,248 blocks. We use neural networks and information retrieval for morphology metric encoding, urban form clustering and morphology metric evaluation. We identified an effective set of morphology metrics for characterizing block-scale urban forms through comparison. The proposed methodology tightly couples complex urban forms with morphology metrics, hence it can enable a seamless and bidirectional relationship between urban form generation and optimization in performance-driven urban design towards sustainable urban design and planning.</p></details> |  |

Most existing acoustic scene classification (ASC) approaches focus on identifying common acoustic scene patterns across cities to enhance generalization. However, the potential acoustic differences introduced by city-specific environmental and cultural factors are overlooked. In this paper, we hypothesize that the city-specific acoustic features are beneficial for the ASC task rather than being treated as noise or bias. To this end, we propose City2Scene, a novel framework that leverages city features to improve ASC. Unlike conventional approaches that may discard or suppress city information, City2Scene transfers the city-specific knowledge from pre-trained city classification models to scene classification model using knowledge distillation. We evaluate City2Scene on three datasets of DCASE Challenge Task 1, which include both scene and city labels. Experimental results demonstrate that city features provide valuable information for classifying scenes. By distilling city-specific knowledge, City2Scene effectively improves accuracy across a variety of lightweight CNN backbones, achieving competitive performance to the top-ranked solutions of DCASE Challenge in recent years.</p></details> |  |

In this study, we analyze traffic incidents in Munich to identify patterns and characteristics that distinguish different types of accidents. The dataset consists of both structured tabular features, such as location, time, and weather conditions, as well as unstructured free-text descriptions detailing the circumstances of each accident. Each incident is categorized into one of seven predefined classes. To assess the reliability of these labels, we apply NLP methods, including topic modeling and few-shot learning, which reveal inconsistencies in the labeling process. These findings highlight potential ambiguities in accident classification and motivate a refined predictive approach. Building on these insights, we develop a classification model that achieves high accuracy in assigning accidents to their respective categories. Our results demonstrate that textual descriptions contain the most informative features for classification, while the inclusion of tabular data provides only marginal improvements. These findings emphasize the critical role of free-text data in accident analysis and highlight the potential of transformer-based models in improving classification reliability.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 4 tables, 4 figures.

| **[A Framework for Ethical Judgment of Smart City Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05172v1)** | 2025-06-05 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2506.05172v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As modern cities increasingly adopt a variety of sensors and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies to collect and analyze data about residents, environments, and public services, they are fostering greater interactions among smart city applications, residents, governments, and businesses. This trend makes it essential for regulators to focus on these interactions to manage smart city practices effectively and prevent unethical outcomes. To facilitate ethical analysis for smart city applications, this paper introduces a judgment framework that examines various scenarios where ethical issues may arise. Employing a multi-agent approach, the framework incorporates diverse social entities and applies logic-based ethical rules to identify potential violations. Through a rights-based analysis, we developed a set of 13 ethical principles and rules to guide ethical practices in smart cities. We utilized two specification languages, Prototype Verification System (PVS) and Alloy, to model our multi-agent system. Our analysis suggests that Alloy may be more efficient for formalizing smart cities and conducting ethical rule checks, particularly with the assistance of a human evaluator. Simulations of a real-world smart city application demonstrate that our ethical judgment framework effectively detects unethical outcomes and can be extended for practical use.</p></details> |  |

However, rendering city-scale 3DGS scenes on mobile devices, e.g., your smartphones, remains a significant challenge due to the limited resources on mobile devices. A natural solution is to offload computation to the cloud; however, naively streaming rendered frames from the cloud to the client introduces high latency and requires bandwidth far beyond the capacity of current wireless networks. In this paper, we propose an effective solution to enable city-scale 3DGS rendering on mobile devices. Our key insight is that, under normal user motion, the number of newly visible Gaussians per second remains roughly constant. Leveraging this, we stream only the necessary Gaussians to the client. Specifically, on the cloud side, we propose asynchronous level-of-detail search to identify the necessary Gaussians for the client. On the client side, we accelerate rendering via a lookup table-based rasterization. Combined with holistic runtime optimizations, our system can deliver low-latency, city-scale 3DGS rendering on mobile devices. Compared to existing solutions, Voyager achieves over 100$\times$ reduction on data transfer and up to 8.9$\times$ speedup while retaining comparable rendering quality.</p></details> |  |

Although deep learning-based methods have shown considerable promise, most existing approaches produce deterministic point estimates, thereby neglecting the uncertainty arising from unobserved traffic flows. Furthermore, current models are typically trained in a city-specific manner, which hinders their generalizability and limits scalability across diverse urban contexts. To overcome these limitations, we introduce TrafficPPT, a Pretrained Probabilistic Transformer designed to model traffic volume as a distributional aggregation of trajectories. Our framework fuses heterogeneous data sources-including real-time observations, historical trajectory data, and road network topology-enabling robust and uncertainty-aware traffic inference. TrafficPPT is initially pretrained on large-scale simulated data spanning multiple urban scenarios, and later fine-tuned on target cities to ensure effective domain adaptation. Experiments on real-world datasets show that TrafficPPT consistently surpasses state-of-the-art baselines, particularly under conditions of extreme data sparsity.

Yet, these systems often risk biased and disparate outcomes. Scholars studying public sector technology design have converged on the need to ground these systems in the goals and organizational contexts of employees using them. We expand our understanding of employees' contexts by focusing on the equity practices of city government employees to surface important equity considerations around public sector data and technology use. Through semi-structured interviews with thirty-six employees from ten departments of a U.S. city government, our findings reveal challenges employees face when operationalizing equity, perspectives on data needs for advancing equity goals, and the design space for acceptable government technology. We discuss what it looks like to foreground equity in data use and technology design, and considerations for how to support city government employees in operationalizing equity with and without official equity offices.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACM CSCW 2025</p></details> |

To address this gap, we introduce DVL-Suite, a comprehensive framework for analyzing long-term urban dynamics through remote sensing imagery. Our suite comprises 15,063 high-resolution (1.0m) multi-temporal images spanning 42 megacities in the U.S. from 2005 to 2023, organized into two components: DVL-Bench and DVL-Instruct. The DVL-Bench includes seven urban understanding tasks, from fundamental change detection (pixel-level) to quantitative analyses (regional-level) and comprehensive urban narratives (scene-level), capturing diverse urban dynamics including expansion/transformation patterns, disaster assessment, and environmental challenges. We evaluate 17 state-of-the-art multimodal large language models and reveal their limitations in long-term temporal understanding and quantitative analysis. These challenges motivate the creation of DVL-Instruct, a specialized instruction-tuning dataset designed to enhance models' capabilities in multi-temporal Earth observation. Building upon this dataset, we develop DVLChat, a baseline model capable of both image-level question-answering and pixel-level segmentation, facilitating a comprehensive understanding of city dynamics through language interactions.</p></details> |  |

The role of inter-city commuting in the scaling of urban crime](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20822v1)** | 2025-05-27 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2505.20822v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cities attract a daily influx of non-resident commuters, reflecting their role in wider urban networks -- not as isolated places. However, it remains unclear how this inter-connectivity shapes the way crime scales with population, given that larger cities tend to receive more commuters and experience more crime. Here, we investigate how inter-city commuting relates to the population--crime relationship. We find that larger cities receive proportionately more commuters, which in turn is associated with higher crime levels. Specifically, each 1% increase in inbound commuters corresponds to a 0.32% rise in theft and 0.20% rise in burglary, holding population constant. We show that models incorporating both population and commuter inflows better explain crime variation than population-only models. These findings underscore the importance of considering how cities are connected -- not just their population size -- in disentangling the population--crime relationship.</p></details> | 16 pages, 2 figures |

It has become more destructive during large-scale events such as the annual pilgrimage to Makkah, Saudi Arabia, one of the world's largest religious gatherings. This event's popularity has attracted millions worldwide, leading to significant and un-predictable accumulation of waste. Such a tremendous number of visitors leads to in-creased waste management issues at the Grand Mosque and other holy sites, highlighting the need for an effective solution other than traditional methods based on rigid collection schedules. To address this challenge, this research proposed an innovative solution that is context-specific and tailored to the unique requirements of pilgrimage season: a Smart Waste Management System, called TUHR, that utilizes the Internet of Things and Artificial Intelligence. This system encompasses ultrasonic sensors that monitor waste levels in each container at the performance sites. Once the container reaches full capacity, the sensor communicates with the microcontroller, which alerts the relevant authorities. Moreover, our system can detect harmful substances such as gas from the gas detector sensor. Such a proactive and dynamic approach promises to mitigate the environmental and health risks associated with waste accumulation and enhance the cleanliness of these sites. It also delivers economic benefits by reducing unnecessary gasoline consumption and optimizing waste management resources. Importantly, this research aligns with the principles of smart cities and exemplifies the innovative, sustainable, and health-conscious approach that Saudi Arabia is implementing as part of its Vision 2030 initiative.</p></details> | 10 pages, 5 figures |

Traditional traffic management approaches have shown limited success in addressing these complex, dynamic problems. To address the current research gaps, three potential tools are developed: a comprehensive 3D city-wide simulation environment that integrates both macroscopic and microscopic traffic dynamics; a collision model; and a reinforcement learning framework with custom reward functions prioritizing safety over efficiency. Unity game engine-based simulation is used for direct collision modeling. A custom reward enabled reinforcement learning method, proximal policy optimization (PPO) model, yields substantial improvements over baseline results, reducing the number of serious collisions, number of vehicle-vehicle collisions, and total distance travelled by over 3 times the baseline values. The model also improves fuel efficiency by 39% and reduces carbon emissions by 88%. Results establish feasibility for city-wide 3D traffic simulation applications incorporating the vision-zero safety principles of the Department of Transportation, including physics-informed, adaptable, realistic collision modeling, as well as appropriate reward modeling for real-world traffic signal light control towards reducing collisions, optimizing traffic flow and reducing greenhouse emissions.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, figures at end, methods at end.

To bridge this gap, we introduce CityEQA, a new task where an embodied agent answers open-vocabulary questions through active exploration in dynamic city spaces. To support this task, we present CityEQA-EC, the first benchmark dataset featuring 1,412 human-annotated tasks across six categories, grounded in a realistic 3D urban simulator. Moreover, we propose Planner-Manager-Actor (PMA), a novel agent tailored for CityEQA. PMA enables long-horizon planning and hierarchical task execution: the Planner breaks down the question answering into sub-tasks, the Manager maintains an object-centric cognitive map for spatial reasoning during the process control, and the specialized Actors handle navigation, exploration, and collection sub-tasks. Experiments demonstrate that PMA achieves 60.7% of human-level answering accuracy, significantly outperforming competitive baselines. While promising, the performance gap compared to humans highlights the need for enhanced visual reasoning in CityEQA. This work paves the way for future advancements in urban spatial intelligence.

However, it is challenging to obtain the data due to the high cost of travel surveys and privacy concerns. Surprisingly, we find that satellite imagery, publicly available across the globe, contains rich urban semantic signals to support high-quality OD flow generation, with over 98\% expressiveness of traditional multisource hard-to-collect urban sociodemographic, economics, land use, and point of interest data. This inspires us to design a novel data generator, GlODGen, which can generate OD flow data for any cities of interest around the world. Specifically, GlODGen first leverages Vision-Language Geo-Foundation Models to extract urban semantic signals related to human mobility from satellite imagery. These features are then combined with population data to form region-level representations, which are used to generate OD flows via graph diffusion models. Extensive experiments on 4 continents and 6 representative cities show that GlODGen has great generalizability across diverse urban environments on different continents and can generate OD flow data for global cities highly consistent with real-world mobility data. We implement GlODGen as an automated tool, seamlessly integrating data acquisition and curation, urban semantic feature extraction, and OD flow generation together.

Many studies have examined the distinctive features of urban road networks, such as their length, efficiency, connection to population density, and other properties. However, the relationship between car routes and population in city structures remains unclear. In this study, we used the center of mass for each city tract, defined by the US Census, as the origins and destinations for our itineraries. We calculated travel time, and both Euclidean and travel distances for sixty major cities. We discovered that the total sum of all routes adheres to an urban law. The distribution of these car journeys follows Weibull functions, suggesting that the urban center plays a crucial role in optimizing routes across multiple cities. We also developed a simple point pattern model for the population, which aligns with the well-known decreasing exponential density expression. Our findings show that the interplay between population and path optimization influences city structure through its center.

In this paper, we conduct the first empirical study of how United States cities' procurement practices shape critical decisions surrounding public sector AI. We conduct semi-structured interviews with 19 city employees who oversee AI procurement across 7 U.S. cities. We found that cities' legacy procurement practices, which are shaped by decades-old laws and norms, establish infrastructure that determines which AI is purchased, and which actors hold decision-making power over procured AI. We characterize the emerging actions cities have taken to adapt their purchasing practices to address algorithmic harms. From employees' reflections on real-world AI procurements, we identify three key challenges that motivate but are not fully addressed by existing AI procurement reform initiatives.

The search for seamless communication in time-critical scenarios has become evident during this evolution. With the escalating complexity of urban environments, envisioning a future with a blend of autonomous and conventional systems, each demanding distinct quality-of-service considerations, services in smart cities vary in criticality levels and necessitate differentiated traffic handling, prioritizing critical flows without compromising the network's reliability or failing on hard real-time requirements. To tackle these challenges, in this article, we discuss a time-sensitive networking approach, which presents multi-faceted challenges, notably interoperability among diverse technologies and standards at the scale of a smart city network.

To better anticipate and accommodate such demand surges, it is essential to estimate cross-city visitor flows with awareness of public events. Although prior studies typically focused on the effects of a single mega event or disruptions around a single venue, this study introduces a generalizable framework to analyze visitor flows under diverse and concurrent events. We propose to leverage large language models (LLMs) to extract event features from multi-source online information and massive user-generated content on social media platforms. Specifically, social media popularity metrics are designed to capture the effects of online promotion and word-of-mouth in attracting visitors. An event-aware machine learning model is then adopted to uncover the specific impacts of different event features and ultimately predict visitor flows for upcoming events. Using Hong Kong as a case study, the framework is applied to predict daily flows of mainland Chinese visitors arriving at the city, achieving a testing R-squared of over 85%. We further investigate the heterogeneous event impacts on visitor numbers across different event types and major travel modes. Both promotional popularity and word-of-mouth popularity are found to be associated with increased visitor flows, but the specific effects vary by the event type. This association is more pronounced among visitors arriving by metro and high-speed rail, while it has less effect on air travelers. The findings can facilitate coordinated measures across government agencies and guide specialized transport policies, such as shuttle transit services to event venues, and comprehensive on-site traffic management strategies.</p></details> |  |

However, manual object tracking and matching across multiple non-overlapping cameras pose significant challenges in city-scale urban traffic scenarios. These challenges include handling diverse vehicle attributes, occlusions, illumination variations, shadows, and varying video resolutions. To address these issues, we propose an efficient and cost-effective deep learning-based framework for Multi-Object Multi-Camera Tracking (MO-MCT). The proposed framework utilizes Mask R-CNN for object detection and employs Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) to select target objects from overlapping detections. Transfer learning is employed for re-identification, enabling the association and generation of vehicle tracklets across multiple cameras. Moreover, we leverage appropriate loss functions and distance measures to handle occlusion, illumination, and shadow challenges. The final solution identification module performs feature extraction using ResNet-152 coupled with Deep SORT based vehicle tracking. The proposed framework is evaluated on the 5th AI City Challenge dataset (Track 3), comprising 46 camera feeds. Among these 46 camera streams, 40 are used for model training and validation, while the remaining six are utilized for model testing. The proposed framework achieves competitive performance with an IDF1 score of 0.8289, and precision and recall scores of 0.9026 and 0.8527 respectively, demonstrating its effectiveness in robust and accurate vehicle tracking.</p></details> |  |

Residents of Atlanta and DeKalb County, environmental activists, police and prison abolitionists, and other activists and concerned individuals formed the movement in opposition to the facility, known as the Stop Cop City / Defend the Atlanta Forest movement. Social media and digital maps became common tools for communicating information about the facility and the movement. Here, we examine online maps about the facility and the opposition movement, originating from grassroots organizations, the City of Atlanta, news media outlets, the Atlanta Police Foundation, and individuals. We gather and examine 32 publicly available maps collected through the Google Search API, Twitter (now X), Instagram and reddit. Using a framework of critical cartography, we conduct a content analysis of these maps to identify the mapping technologies and techniques (data, cartographic elements, styles) used by different stakeholders and roles that maps and mapping technologies can play in social movements. We examine the extent to which these maps provide data to confirm or contradict concerns raised by grassroots organizations and local residents about the facility. We find that stakeholders and mapmakers use geospatial tools in different ways and likely have varied access to mapping technologies. We argue that documenting the use of maps to communicate information about a contentious project can help enumerate community positions and perspectives, and we advocate for accessible mapmaking tools. We conclude by discussing the implications of accessibility of mapping technology and posting maps to social media, and share example map images that extend the geographic information systems (GIS) techniques seen in the retrieved maps.</p></details> | <details><summary>Suppl...</summary><p>Supplementary material available at https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/PCQ294</p></details> |

To mitigate the scarcity of traffic data while maintaining data privacy, numerous Federated Traffic Knowledge Transfer (FTT) approaches have been developed, which use transfer learning and federated learning to transfer traffic knowledge from data-rich cities to data-scarce cities, enhancing traffic prediction capabilities for the latter. However, current FTT approaches face challenges such as privacy leakage, cross-city data distribution discrepancies, low data quality, and inefficient knowledge transfer, limiting their privacy protection, effectiveness, robustness, and efficiency in real-world applications. To this end, we propose FedTT, an effective, efficient, and privacy-aware cross-city traffic knowledge transfer framework that transforms the traffic data domain from the data-rich cities and trains traffic models using the transformed data for the data-scarce cities. First, to safeguard data privacy, we propose a traffic secret transmission method that securely transmits and aggregates traffic domain-transformed data from source cities using a lightweight secret aggregation approach. Second, to mitigate the impact of traffic data distribution discrepancies on model performance, we introduce a traffic domain adapter to uniformly transform traffic data from the source cities' domains to that of the target city. Third, to improve traffic data quality, we design a traffic view imputation method to fill in and predict missing traffic data. Finally, to enhance transfer efficiency, FedTT is equipped with a federated parallel training method that enables the simultaneous training of multiple modules. Extensive experiments using 4 real-life datasets demonstrate that FedTT outperforms the 14 state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> |  |

To date, their potential to mitigate the noise impact on radar object detection remains under-explored. In this paper, we first introduce a unique dataset, RadarCity, comprising 54K synchronized radar-image pairs and semantic 3D city models. Moreover, we propose a novel neural network, RADLER, leveraging the effectiveness of contrastive self-supervised learning (SSL) and semantic 3D city models to enhance radar object detection of pedestrians, cyclists, and cars. Specifically, we first obtain the robust radar features via a SSL network in the radar-image pretext task. We then use a simple yet effective feature fusion strategy to incorporate semantic-depth features from semantic 3D city models. Having prior 3D information as guidance, RADLER obtains more fine-grained details to enhance radar object detection. We extensively evaluate RADLER on the collected RadarCity dataset and demonstrate average improvements of 5.46% in mean avarage precision (mAP) and 3.51% in mean avarage recall (mAR) over previous radar object detection methods.

However, the intensive manual effort required to prepare input 3D city models has hindered its widespread adoption. To address this challenge, we present VoxCity, an open-source Python package that provides a one-stop solution for grid-based 3D city model generation and urban environment simulation for cities worldwide. VoxCity's `generator' subpackage automatically downloads building heights, tree canopy heights, land cover, and terrain elevation within a specified target area, and voxelizes buildings, trees, land cover, and terrain to generate an integrated voxel city model. The `simulator' subpackage enables users to conduct environmental simulations, including solar radiation and view index analyses. Users can export the generated models using several file formats compatible with external software, such as ENVI-met (INX), Blender, and Rhino (OBJ). We generated 3D city models for eight global cities, and demonstrated the calculation of solar irradiance, sky view index, and green view index. We also showcased microclimate simulation and 3D rendering visualization through ENVI-met and Rhino, respectively, through the file export function. Additionally, we reviewed openly available geospatial data to create guidelines to help users choose appropriate data sources depending on their target areas and purposes. VoxCity can significantly reduce the effort and time required for 3D city model preparation and promote the utilization of urban environment simulations. This contributes to more informed urban and architectural design that considers environmental impacts, and in turn, fosters sustainable and livable cities. VoxCity is released openly at https://github.com/kunifujiwara/VoxCity.</p></details> |  |

Integrating sustainability into TRS has become essential with the increasing need to balance environmental impact, local community interests, and visitor satisfaction. This paper proposes a novel approach to enhancing TRS for sustainable city trips using Large Language Models (LLMs) and a modified Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline. We enhance the traditional RAG system by incorporating a sustainability metric based on a city's popularity and seasonal demand during the prompt augmentation phase. This modification, called Sustainability Augmented Reranking (SAR), ensures the system's recommendations align with sustainability goals. Evaluations using popular open-source LLMs, such as Llama-3.1-Instruct-8B and Mistral-Instruct-7B, demonstrate that the SAR-enhanced approach consistently matches or outperforms the baseline (without SAR) across most metrics, highlighting the benefits of incorporating sustainability into TRS.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the RecSoGood 2024 Workshop co-located with the 18th ACM Conference on Recommender Systems (RecSys 2024)</p></details> |

The task involves procedurally or automatically generating spatial arrangements for urban elements such as roads, buildings, water, and vegetation. Previous methods, whether procedural modeling or deep learning-based approaches like VAEs and GANs, rely on complex priors, expert guidance, or initial layouts, and often lack diversity and interactivity. In this paper, we present CityGen, an end-to-end framework for infinite, diverse, and controllable city layout generation. Our framework introduces an infinite expansion module to extend local layouts to city-scale layouts and a multi-scale refinement module to upsample and refine them. We also designed a user-friendly control scheme, allowing users to guide generation through simple sketching. Additionally, we convert the 2D layout to 3D by synthesizing a height field, facilitating downstream applications. Extensive experiments demonstrate CityGen's state-of-the-art performance across various metrics, making it suitable for a wide range of downstream applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2025 USM3D Workshop</p></details> |

Effectively analyzing these complex soundscapes, often characterized by overlapping sound sources, diverse acoustic events, and unpredictable noise levels, requires precise source separation. This task becomes more complicated when only limited training data is available. This paper introduces a novel Quantum-Inspired Genetic Algorithm (p-QIGA) for source separation, drawing inspiration from quantum information theory to enhance acoustic scene analysis in smart cities. By leveraging quantum superposition for efficient solution space exploration and entanglement to handle correlated sources, p-QIGA achieves robust separation even with limited data. These quantum-inspired concepts are integrated into a genetic algorithm framework to optimize source separation parameters. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated on two datasets: the TAU Urban Acoustic Scenes 2020 Mobile dataset, representing typical urban soundscapes, and the Silent Cities dataset, capturing quieter urban environments during the COVID-19 pandemic. Experimental results show that the p-QIGA achieves accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art methods while exhibiting superior resilience to noise and limited training data, achieving up to 8.2 dB signal-to-distortion ratio (SDR) in noisy environments and outperforming baseline methods by up to 2 dB with only 10% of the training data. This research highlights the potential of p-QIGA to advance acoustic signal processing in smart cities, particularly for noise pollution monitoring and acoustic surveillance.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 2 figures, IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC 2025)</p></details> |

When wide-area connectivity is unavailable or significantly degraded, our system, MapMesh, enables static access points and mobile devices equipped with Wi-Fi in a city to route packets via each other for intra-city connectivity and to/from any nodes that might have Internet access, e.g., via satellite. The chief contribution of our work is a new routing protocol that scales to millions of nodes, a significant improvement over prior work on wireless mesh and mobile ad hoc networks. Our approach uses detailed information about buildings from widely available maps--data that was unavailable at scale over a decade ago, but is widely available now--to compute paths in a scalable way.</p></details> |  |
| **[Estimating City-wide Operating Mode Distribution of Light-Duty Vehicles: A Neural Network-based Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22118v2)** | 2025-04-04 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2503.22118v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Driving cycles are a set of driving conditions and are crucial for the existing emission estimation model to evaluate vehicle performance, fuel efficiency, and emissions, by matching them with average speed to calculate the operating modes, such as braking, idling, and cruising. While existing emission estimation models, such as the Motor Vehicle Emission Simulator (MOVES), are powerful tools, their reliance on predefined driving cycles can be limiting, as these cycles often do not accurately represent regional driving conditions, making the models less effective for city-wide analyses. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a modular neural network (NN)-based framework to estimate operating mode distributions bypassing the driving cycle development phase, utilizing macroscopic variables such as speed, flow, and link infrastructure attributes. The proposed method is validated using a well-calibrated microsimulation model of Brookline MA, the United States. The results indicate that the proposed framework outperforms the operating mode distribution calculated by MOVES based on default driving cycles, providing a closer match to the actual operating mode distribution derived from trajectory data. Specifically, the proposed model achieves an average RMSE of 0.04 in predicting operating mode distribution, compared to 0.08 for MOVES. The average error in emission estimation across pollutants is 8.57% for the proposed method, lower than the 32.86% error for MOVES. In particular, for the estimation of CO2, the proposed method has an error of just 4%, compared to 35% for MOVES. The proposed model can be utilized for real-time emissions monitoring by providing rapid and accurate emissions estimates with easily accessible inputs.</p></details> |  |

Data-driven predictive methods, especially those utilizing machine learning techniques, have emerged to handle these complexities in urban delivery demand management problems. One particularly pressing issue that has yet to be sufficiently addressed is the joint estimation and prediction of city-wide delivery demand, as well as the generalization of the model to new cities. To this end, we formulate this problem as a transferable graph-based spatiotemporal learning task. First, an individual-collective message-passing neural network model is formalized to capture the interaction between demand patterns of associated regions. Second, by exploiting recent advances in large language models (LLMs), we extract general geospatial knowledge encodings from the unstructured locational data using the embedding generated by LLMs. Last, to encourage the cross-city generalization of the model, we integrate the encoding into the demand predictor in a transferable way. Comprehensive empirical evaluation results on two real-world delivery datasets, including eight cities in China and the US, demonstrate that our model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in accuracy, efficiency, and transferability.</p></details> |  |

However, they lack contextual information about, for example, the history or functionality of buildings. On another side, multimedia documents like images, videos or texts usually contain such information. Crossing these two types of data can therefore help in the analysis and understanding of the organization of our cities. This could also be used to develop document search based on spatial navigation, instead of the classical textual query. In this paper, we propose four approaches to integrate multimedia documents in a 3D urban scene, allowing to contextualize the scene with any type of media. We combine these integration approaches with user guidance modes that allows to guide the user through the consumption of these media and support its understanding of the territory. We demonstrate the usefulness of these techniques in the context of different projects within the Lyon area (France). The use of multimedia documents integrated into a digital tour allows, for example, the iconic buildings to be contextualised or to understand the evolution of a territory through time.</p></details> | 8 pages, 11 figures |

We then describe a survey that was administered by the Street Vendor Project while distributing Coronavirus relief aid to vendors operating in New York City both with and without a license or permit. Finally, we calculate the total number of vendors using ratio estimation. We find that approximately 23,000 street vendors operate in New York City: 20,500 mobile food vendors and 2,300 general merchandise vendors. One third are located in just six ZIP Codes: 11368 (16%), 11372 (3%), and 11354 (3%) in North and West Queens and 10036 (5%), 10019 (4%), and 10001 (3%) in the Chelsea and Clinton neighborhoods of Manhattan. We also provide a theoretical justification of our estimates based on the theory of point processes and a discussion of their accuracy and implications. In particular, our estimates suggest the American Community Survey fails to cover the majority of New York City street vendors.</p></details> |  |

However, existing studies primarily utilize static historical data and often overlook dynamic, real-time contextual factors crucial for precise prediction, particularly in densely populated Indian cities. This research addresses these gaps by integrating real-time contextual variables such as traffic density, weather conditions, local events, and geospatial data (restaurant and delivery location coordinates) into predictive models. We systematically compare various machine learning algorithms, including Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Bagging, Random Forest, XGBoost, and LightGBM, on a comprehensive food delivery dataset specific to Indian urban contexts. Rigorous data preprocessing and feature selection significantly enhanced model performance. Experimental results demonstrate that the LightGBM model achieves superior predictive accuracy, with an R2 score of 0.76 and Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 20.59, outperforming traditional baseline approaches.

The research addresses the critical issue of rapid urban growth in the U.S. and explores how innovations within the smart city paradigm influence urban development. Utilizing principles from Urban Complexity Theory, this study identifies four key variables relevant to smart cities and their impact on urbanization: smart city technology, government policy, environmental sustainability, and socioeconomic factors. A mixed-method approach, combining quantitative and qualitative methodologies, was employed. A web-based survey (n=50) utilizing a five-point Likert scale was conducted among residents of Manhattan, New York, and Capitol Hill, Seattle. Results indicate that the implementation of smart city technologies is significantly associated with shifts in population density, land use diversification, and enhanced infrastructure dynamics. Additionally, residents demonstrated preferences for smart cities based on efficient urban mobility, environmental sustainability, and personal socioeconomic improvements. The findings highlight essential considerations for urban planners, policymakers, and employers.

For the task of urban planning and urban operation, we take the stance that even if the necessary representations of these structures and processes can be achieved, the most important representation of the relevant mindsets of the citizens are, unfortunately, mostly neglected. After a review of major "traditional" urban models of structures behind urban scale, form, and dynamics, we turn to major recent modeling approaches triggered by recent advances in AI that enable multi-modal generative models. Some of these models can create representations of geometries, networks and images, and reason flexibly at a human-compatible semantic level. They provide huge amounts of knowledge extracted from Terabytes of text and image documents and cover the required rich representation spectrum including geographic knowledge by different knowledge sources, degrees of granularity and scales. We then discuss what these new opportunities mean for the modeling challenges posed by cities, in particular with regard to the role and impact of citizens and their interactions within the city infrastructure. We propose to integrate these possibilities with existing approaches, such as agent-based models, which opens up new modeling spaces including rich citizen models which are able to also represent social interactions. Finally, we put forward some thoughts about a vision of a "social AI in a city ecosystem" that adds relevant citizen models to state-of-the-art structural and process models. This extended city representation will enable urban planners to establish citizen-oriented planning of city infrastructures for human culture, city resilience and sustainability.</p></details> | 8 figures |

Blockchain technology provides immutable, scalable, and decentralized solutions to address these challenges, and integrating deep reinforcement learning (DRL) into the IoT environment offers enhanced adaptability and decision-making. This paper investigates the integration of blockchain and DRL to optimize mobile transmission and secure data exchange in IoT-assisted smart cities. Through the clustering and categorization of IoT application systems, the combination of DRL and blockchain is shown to enhance the performance of IoT networks by maintaining privacy and security. Based on the review of papers published between 2015 and 2024, we have classified the presented approaches and offered practical taxonomies, which provide researchers with critical perspectives and highlight potential areas for future exploration and research. Our investigation shows how combining blockchain's decentralized framework with DRL can address privacy and security issues, improve mobile transmission efficiency, and guarantee robust, privacy-preserving IoT systems. Additionally, we explore blockchain integration for DRL and outline the notable applications of DRL technology.

The abundance of user-generated reviews on social media encapsulates nuanced perceptions and feelings associated with different places, offering rich insights into segregation. However, leveraging this data poses significant challenges due to its vast volume, ambiguity, and confluence of diverse perspectives. To tackle these challenges, we propose using Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate online review mining for segregation prediction. We design a Reflective LLM Coder to digest social media content into insights consistent with real-world feedback, and eventually produce a codebook capturing key dimensions that signal segregation experience, such as cultural resonance and appeal, accessibility and convenience, and community engagement and local involvement. Guided by the codebook, LLMs can generate both informative review summaries and ratings for segregation prediction. Moreover, we design a REasoning-and-EMbedding (RE'EM) framework, which combines the reasoning and embedding capabilities of language models to integrate multi-channel features for segregation prediction. Experiments on real-world data demonstrate that our framework greatly improves prediction accuracy, with a 22.79% elevation in R2 and a 9.33% reduction in MSE. The derived codebook is generalizable across three different cities, consistently improving prediction accuracy. Moreover, our user study confirms that the codebook-guided summaries provide cognitive gains for human participants in perceiving POIs' social inclusiveness. Our study marks an important step toward understanding implicit social barriers and inequalities, demonstrating the great potential of promoting social inclusiveness with AI.</p></details> | 11 pages, 6 figures |

Existing mapping efforts are often limited to large cities in developed regions and rely on data sources that are unavailable in many developing countries. This data scarcity hinders the establishment of consistent urban indicators, such as accessibility, to assess progress towards the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Here, we develop and validate a global map of the socioeconomic centers of cities for 2020 by integrating nighttime light and population density data within an advanced geospatial modeling framework. Our analysis reveals that monocentric cities -- the standard urban model -- still dominate our planet, accounting for over 80% of cities worldwide. However, these monocentric cities encompass only approximately 20% of the total urbanized area, urban population, and nighttime light intensity; this 80/20 pattern underscores significant disparities in urban development. Further analysis, combined with socioeconomic datasets, reveals a marked difference between developed and developing regions: high-income countries exhibit greater polycentricity than low-income countries, demonstrating a positive correlation between urban sprawl and economic growth. Our global dataset and findings provide critical insights into urban structure and development, with important implications for urban planning, policymaking, and the formulation of indicators for urban sustainability assessment.</p></details> |  |

However, with the common issues of missing regional features and lacking OD flow data, it is quite daunting to predict OD flow in developing cities. To address this challenge, we propose a novel Causality-Enhanced OD Flow Prediction (CE-OFP), a unified framework that aims to transfer urban knowledge between cities and achieve accuracy improvements in OD flow predictions across data-scarce cities. In specific, we propose a novel reinforcement learning model to discover universal causalities among urban features in data-rich cities and build corresponding causal graphs. Then, we further build Causality-Enhanced Variational Auto-Encoder (CE-VAE) to incorporate causal graphs for effective feature reconstruction in data-scarce cities. Finally, with the reconstructed features, we devise a knowledge distillation method with a graph attention network to migrate the OD prediction model from data-rich cities to data-scare cities. Extensive experiments on two pairs of real-world datasets validate that the proposed CE-OFP remarkably outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, which can reduce the RMSE of OD flow prediction for data-scarce cities by up to 11%.</p></details> |  |

The City of New York (NYC) has been at the forefront of this movement since the enactment of the Open Data Law in 2012, creating the NYC Open Data portal. The portal currently hosts 2,700 datasets, serving as a crucial resource for research across various domains, including health, urban development, and transportation. However, the effective use of open data relies heavily on data quality and usability, challenges that remain insufficiently addressed in the literature. This paper examines these challenges via a case study of the NYC 311 Service Request dataset, identifying key issues in data validity, consistency, and curation efficiency. We propose a set of data curation principles, tailored for government-released open data, to address these challenges.

| **[A modeling framework to support the electrification of private transport in African cities: a case study of Addis Ababa](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03671v1)** | 2025-03-05 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2503.03671v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The electrification of road transport, as the predominant mode of transportation in Africa, represents a great opportunity to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and dependence on costly fuel imports. However, it introduces major challenges for local energy infrastructures, including the deployment of charging stations and the impact on often fragile electricity grids. Despite its importance, research on electric mobility planning in Africa remains limited, while existing planning tools rely on detailed local mobility data that is often unavailable, especially for privately owned passenger vehicles. In this study, we introduce a novel framework designed to support private vehicle electrification in data-scarce regions and apply it to Addis Ababa, simulating the mobility patterns and charging needs of 100,000 electric vehicles. Our analysis indicate that these vehicles generate a daily charging demand of approximately 350 MWh and emphasize the significant influence of the charging location on the spatial and temporal distribution of this demand. Notably, charging at public places can help smooth the charging demand throughout the day, mitigating peak charging loads on the electricity grid. We also estimate charging station requirements, finding that workplace charging requires approximately one charging point per three electric vehicles, while public charging requires only one per thirty. Finally, we demonstrate that photovoltaic energy can cover a substantial share of the charging needs, emphasizing the potential for renewable energy integration. This study lays the groundwork for electric mobility planning in Addis Ababa while offering a transferable framework for other African cities.</p></details> |  |

This study investigates the relationship between heatwaves and nighttime light (NTL) radiance, a proxy of nighttime economic activity, in four hyperdense cities: Delhi, Guangzhou, Cairo, and Sao Paulo. We hypothesised that heatwaves increase nighttime activity. Using a double machine learning (DML) framework, we analysed data from 2013 to 2019 to quantify the impact of heatwaves on NTL while controlling for local climatic confounders. Results revealed a statistically significant increase in NTL intensity during heatwaves, with Cairo, Delhi, and Guangzhou showing elevated NTL on the third day, while S\~ao Paulo exhibits a delayed response on the fourth day. Sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of these findings, indicating that prolonged heat stress prompts urban populations to shift activities to night. Heterogeneous responses across cities highlight the possible influence of urban morphology and adaptive capacity to heatwave impacts. Our findings provide a foundation for policymakers to develop data-driven heat adaptation strategies, ensuring that cities remain liveable and economically resilient in an increasingly warming world.</p></details> | 4 figures 2 tables |

Recently 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) has emerged as a highly efficient alternative for object-level 3D generation. However, adapting 3D-GS from finite-scale 3D objects and humans to infinite-scale 3D cities is non-trivial. Unbounded 3D city generation entails significant storage overhead (out-of-memory issues), arising from the need to expand points to billions, often demanding hundreds of Gigabytes of VRAM for a city scene spanning 10km^2. In this paper, we propose GaussianCity, a generative Gaussian Splatting framework dedicated to efficiently synthesizing unbounded 3D cities with a single feed-forward pass. Our key insights are two-fold: 1) Compact 3D Scene Representation: We introduce BEV-Point as a highly compact intermediate representation, ensuring that the growth in VRAM usage for unbounded scenes remains constant, thus enabling unbounded city generation. 2) Spatial-aware Gaussian Attribute Decoder: We present spatial-aware BEV-Point decoder to produce 3D Gaussian attributes, which leverages Point Serializer to integrate the structural and contextual characteristics of BEV points. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GaussianCity achieves state-of-the-art results in both drone-view and street-view 3D city generation. Notably, compared to CityDreamer, GaussianCity exhibits superior performance with a speedup of 60 times (10.72 FPS v.s. 0.18 FPS).</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025.

Irrespective of these riots' specific trigger, a key question is how the capacity for such widespread city rioting might be foreseen through some precursor behavior that flags an emerging appetite for such rioting at scale. Here we show evidence that points toward particular online behavior which developed at scale well ahead of the riots, across the multi-platform landscape of hate/extremist communities. Our analysis of detailed multi-platform data reveals a web-of-influence that existed well before the riots, involving online hate and extremism communities locally, nationally, and globally. This web-of-influence fed would-be rioters in each city mainly through video platforms. This web-of-influence has a persistent resilience -- and hence still represents a significant local, national, and international threat in the future -- because of its feedback across regional-national-international scales and across topics such as immigration; and its use of multiple lesser-known platforms that put it beyond any single government or platform's reach. Going forward, our findings mean that if city administrators coordinate with each other across local-national-international divides, they can map this threat as we have done here and initiate deliberation programs that might then soften such pre-existing extremes at scale, perhaps using automated AI-based technology.</p></details> |  |

However, the challenge of matching vehicle trajectories across different cameras based solely on feature extraction poses significant difficulties. This article introduces an innovative multi-camera vehicle tracking system that utilizes a self-supervised camera link model. In contrast to related works that rely on manual spatial-temporal annotations, our model automatically extracts crucial multi-camera relationships for vehicle matching. The camera link is established through a pre-matching process that evaluates feature similarities, pair numbers, and time variance for high-quality tracks. This process calculates the probability of spatial linkage for all camera combinations, selecting the highest scoring pairs to create camera links. Our approach significantly improves deployment times by eliminating the need for human annotation, offering substantial improvements in efficiency and cost-effectiveness when it comes to real-world application. This pairing process supports cross camera matching by setting spatial-temporal constraints, reducing the searching space for potential vehicle matches. According to our experimental results, the proposed method achieves a new state-of-the-art among automatic camera-link based methods in CityFlow V2 benchmarks with 61.07% IDF1 Score.</p></details> | <details><summary>Uploa...</summary><p>Upload the revised manuscript with the publisher's requirement</p></details> |

Governments and utilities have designed incentives to stimulate the adoption of decarbonization technologies such as rooftop PV and heat pumps. However, studies have shown that many of these incentives are inefficient since a substantial fraction of spending does not actually promote adoption, and incentives are not equitably distributed across socioeconomic groups. We present a novel data-driven approach that adopts a holistic, emissions-based and city-scale perspective on decarbonization. We propose an optimization model that dynamically allocates a total incentive budget to households to directly maximize city-wide carbon reduction. We leverage techniques for the multi-armed bandits problem to estimate human factors, such as a household's willingness to adopt new technologies given a certain incentive. We apply our proposed framework to a city in the Northeast U.S., using real household energy data, grid carbon intensity data, and future price scenarios. We show that our learning-based technique significantly outperforms an example status quo incentive scheme, achieving up to 32.23% higher carbon reductions. We show that our framework can accommodate equity-aware constraints to equitably allocate incentives across socioeconomic groups, achieving 78.84% of the carbon reductions of the optimal solution on average.</p></details> |  |

By varying the fraction in the circle we can map complex spatial data to a simple model of concentric rings which we then fit to determine natural density cutoffs. We apply this method to population, occupation, economic and transport data from England and Wales, finding that the regions determined by this method affirm well known social facts such as the disproportionate wealth of London or the relative isolation of the North East and South West of England. We then show how different data sets give us different views of the same cities, providing insight into their development and dynamics.</p></details> | 13 Figures |

Due to burgeoning cybercrime on new technological frontiers, efforts have been made to assist digital forensic investigators (DFI) and law enforcement agencies (LEA) in their investigative efforts. Forensic tool innovations and ontology developments, such as the Unified Cyber Ontology (UCO) and Cyber-investigation Analysis Standard Expression (CASE), have been proposed to assist DFI and LEA. Although these tools and ontologies are useful, they lack extensive information sharing and tool interoperability features, and the ontologies lack the latest Smart City Infrastructure (SCI) context that was proposed. To mitigate the weaknesses in both solutions and to ensure a safer cyber-physical environment for all, we propose the Smart City Ontological Paradigm Expression (SCOPE), an expansion profile of the UCO and CASE ontology that implements SCI threat models, SCI digital forensic evidence, attack techniques, patterns and classifications from MITRE. We showcase how SCOPE could present complex data such as SCI-specific threats, cybercrime, investigation data and incident handling workflows via an incident scenario modelled after publicly reported real-world incidents attributed to Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) groups.

However, the observed traffic flow from sensors is usually limited across the entire network due to the associated high installation and maintenance costs. To address this issue, existing research uses various supplementary data sources to compensate for insufficient sensor coverage and estimate the unobserved traffic flow. Although these studies have shown promising results, the inconsistent availability and quality of supplementary data across cities make their methods typically face a trade-off challenge between accuracy and generality. In this research, we first time advocate using the Global Open Multi-Source (GOMS) data within an advanced deep learning framework to break the trade-off. The GOMS data primarily encompass geographical and demographic information, including road topology, building footprints, and population density, which can be consistently collected across cities. More importantly, these GOMS data are either causes or consequences of transportation activities, thereby creating opportunities for accurate network-wide flow estimation. Furthermore, we use map images to represent GOMS data, instead of traditional tabular formats, to capture richer and more comprehensive geographical and demographic information. To address multi-source data fusion, we develop an attention-based graph neural network that effectively extracts and synthesizes information from GOMS maps while simultaneously capturing spatiotemporal traffic dynamics from observed traffic data. A large-scale case study across 15 cities in Europe and North America was conducted. The results demonstrate stable and satisfactory estimation accuracy across these cities, which suggests that the trade-off challenge can be successfully addressed using our approach.</p></details> |  |

Recently, reinforcement learning (RL) has been the research trend for TSC. However, existing RL algorithms face several real-world challenges that hinder their practical deployment in TSC: (1) Sensor accuracy deteriorates with increased sensor detection range, and data transmission is prone to noise, potentially resulting in unsafe TSC decisions. (2) During the training of online RL, interactions with the environment could be unstable, potentially leading to inappropriate traffic signal phase (TSP) selection and traffic congestion. (3) Most current TSC algorithms focus only on TSP decisions, overlooking the critical aspect of phase duration, affecting safety and efficiency. To overcome these challenges, we propose a robust two-stage fuzzy approach called FuzzyLight, which integrates compressed sensing and RL for TSC deployment. FuzzyLight offers several key contributions: (1) It employs fuzzy logic and compressed sensing to address sensor noise and enhances the efficiency of TSP decisions. (2) It maintains stable performance during training and combines fuzzy logic with RL to generate precise phases. (3) It works in real cities across 22 intersections and demonstrates superior performance in both real-world and simulated environments. Experimental results indicate that FuzzyLight enhances traffic efficiency by 48% compared to expert-designed timings in the real world. Furthermore, it achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in simulated environments using six real-world datasets with transmission noise.

However, data collection in each city is impeded by technical challenges such as budget limitations and sensor failures, necessitating effective data imputation techniques that can enhance data quality and reliability. Existing imputation models, categorized into learning-based and analytics-based paradigms, grapple with the trade-off between capacity and generalizability. Collaborative learning to reconstruct data across multiple cities holds the promise of breaking this trade-off. Nevertheless, urban data's inherent irregularity and heterogeneity issues exacerbate challenges of knowledge sharing and collaboration across cities. To address these limitations, we propose a novel collaborative imputation paradigm leveraging meta-learned implicit neural representations (INRs). INRs offer a continuous mapping from domain coordinates to target values, integrating the strengths of both paradigms. By imposing embedding theory, we first employ continuous parameterization to handle irregularity and reconstruct the dynamical system. We then introduce a cross-city collaborative learning scheme through model-agnostic meta learning, incorporating hierarchical modulation and normalization techniques to accommodate multiscale representations and reduce variance in response to heterogeneity. Extensive experiments on a diverse urban dataset from 20 global cities demonstrate our model's superior imputation performance and generalizability, underscoring the effectiveness of collaborative imputation in resource-constrained settings.</p></details> |  |

Smart city applications, such as, federated learning, Internet of Things (IoT), and online financial services, require reliable Quality of Service (QoS) from telecommunications networks to ensure effective information transfer. However, with over three billion people underserved or lacking access to internet, many of these AI-driven applications are at risk of either remaining underutilized or failing altogether. Furthermore, many IoT and video-based applications in densely populated urban areas require high-quality connectivity. This paper explores these issues, focusing on the challenges that need to be mitigated to make AI succeed in emerging countries, where more than 80% of the world population resides and urban migration grows. In this context, an overview of a case study conducted in Kathmandu, Nepal, highlights citizens' aspirations for affordable, high-quality internet-based services. The findings underscore the pressing need for advanced telecommunication networks to meet diverse user requirements while addressing investment and infrastructure gaps. This discussion provides insights into bridging the digital divide and enabling AI's transformative potential in urban areas.</p></details> |  |

Forecasting the evolution of CO in real-time can enable the deployment of effective early warning systems and intervention strategies. However, the computational cost associated with the physics and chemistry-based simulation makes it prohibitive to implement such a model at the city and country scale. To address this challenge, here, we present a machine learning model based on neural operator, namely, Complex Neural Operator for Air Quality (CoNOAir), that can effectively forecast CO concentrations. We demonstrate this by developing a country-level model for short-term (hourly) and long-term (72-hour) forecasts of CO concentrations. Our model outperforms state-of-the-art models such as Fourier neural operators (FNO) and provides reliable predictions for both short and long-term forecasts. We further analyse the capability of the model to capture extreme events and generate forecasts in urban cities in India. Interestingly, we observe that the model predicts the next hour CO concentrations with R2 values greater than 0.95 for all the cities considered. The deployment of such a model can greatly assist the governing bodies to provide early warning, plan intervention strategies, and develop effective strategies by considering several what-if scenarios. Altogether, the present approach could provide a fillip to real-time predictions of CO pollution in urban cities.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, 14 figures, under submission process</p></details> |

In industrial scenarios, reliance on manual annotation for map updates creates a critical bottleneck. Lane-level updates require precise change information and must ensure consistency with adjacent data while adhering to strict standards. Traditional methods utilize a three-stage approach-construction, change detection, and updating-which often necessitates manual verification due to accuracy limitations. This results in labor-intensive processes and hampers timely updates. To address these challenges, we propose LDMapNet-U, which implements a new end-to-end paradigm for city-scale lane-level map updating. By reconceptualizing the update task as an end-to-end map generation process grounded in historical map data, we introduce a paradigm shift in map updating that simultaneously generates vectorized maps and change information. To achieve this, a Prior-Map Encoding (PME) module is introduced to effectively encode historical maps, serving as a critical reference for detecting changes. Additionally, we incorporate a novel Instance Change Prediction (ICP) module that learns to predict associations with historical maps. Consequently, LDMapNet-U simultaneously achieves vectorized map element generation and change detection. To demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of LDMapNet-U, extensive experiments are conducted using large-scale real-world datasets. In addition, LDMapNet-U has been successfully deployed in production at Baidu Maps since April 2024, supporting map updating for over 360 cities and significantly shortening the update cycle from quarterly to weekly. The updated maps serve hundreds of millions of users and are integrated into the autonomous driving systems of several leading vehicle companies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by KDD 2025, camera-ready version</p></details> |

A significant aspect of our research is the creation of a proprietary dataset specific to Granada, which is instrumental in training our neural network model. We employ Fully Convolutional Networks, Pyramid Networks and Dilated Convolutions, demonstrating their effectiveness in urban semantic segmentation. Our approach involves comparative analysis and optimization of various models, including Dynamic U-Net, PSPNet and DeepLabV3+, tailored for the segmentation of aerial images. The study includes a thorough experimentation phase, using datasets such as UDD5 and UAVid, alongside our custom Granada dataset. We evaluate our models using metrics like Foreground Accuracy, Dice Coefficient and Jaccard Index. Our results indicate that DeepLabV3+ offers the most promising performance. We conclude with future directions, emphasizing the need for a dedicated neural network for parked car detection and the potential for application in other urban environments.

However, the computational requirements of high-fidelity computational fluid dynamics (CFD) methods make them impractical for real cities. To address these limitations, this study investigates the effectiveness of the Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) model in predicting flow fields under different wind directions and urban layouts. In this study, we investigate the effectiveness of the Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) model in predicting urban wind conditions under different wind directions and urban layouts. By training the model on velocity data from large eddy simulation data, we evaluate the performance of the model under different urban configurations and wind conditions. The results show that the FNO model can provide accurate predictions while significantly reducing the computational time by 99%. Our innovative approach of dividing the wind field into smaller spatial blocks for training improves the ability of the FNO model to capture wind frequency features effectively. The SDF data also provides important spatial building information, enhancing the model's ability to recognize physical boundaries and generate more realistic predictions. The proposed FNO approach enhances the AI model's generalizability for different wind directions and urban layouts.</p></details> |  |

Existing systems are, in many cases, generalizations of previous domain specific tools and or methodologies that may not cover all urban interdependencies and makes it difficult to have homogeneous indicators. In order to overcome this limitation while seeking for effective support to decision makers, this article introduces a novel hybrid simulation framework for risk mitigation. The framework is built on a proposed city concept that considers urban space as a Complex Adaptive System composed by interconnected Critical Infrastructures. In this concept, a Social System, which models daily patterns and social interactions of the citizens in the Urban Landscape, drives the CIs demand to configure the full city picture. The frameworks hybrid design integrates agent based and network based modeling by breaking down city agents into system dependent subagents, to enable both inter and intra system interaction simulation, respectively. A layered structure of indicators at different aggregation levels is also developed, to ensure that decisions are not only data driven but also explainable. Therefore, the proposed simulation framework can serve as a DSS tool that allows the quantitative analysis of the impact of threats at different levels. First, system level metrics can be used to get a broad view on the city resilience. Then, agent level metrics back those figures and provide better explainability. On implementation, the proposed framework enables component reusability (for eased coding), simulation federation (enabling the integration of existing system oriented simulators), discrete simulation in accelerated time (for rapid scenario simulation) and decision oriented visualization (for informed outputs).</p></details> | 24 pages |

The success of many user-facing smart city technologies requires understanding barriers to adoption, including persistent inequalities in urban areas. An analysis of a random sample telephone survey (n=489) in four neighborhoods of Tel Aviv merged with digital municipal services usage data found that neighborhood residency influences the reasons why residents adopt resident-facing smart city services, as well as individual-level factors. Structured Equation Modeling shows that neighborhood residency is related to digital proficiency and privacy perceptions beyond demographic factors and that those influence the adoption of smart-city services. We summarize the paper by discussing why and how place effects must be considered in further research in smart cities and the study and mitigation of digital inequality.</p></details> | 14 pages, 4 figures |

However, excessive use of social media can negatively impact students' academic performance. This preliminary study examines social media's impact on students' academic performance at Walter Sisulu University (WSU), Buffalo City campus. Using a positivist paradigm and a quantitative approach, randomly sampled data were collected from 71 students through a survey to identify trends and generate preliminary insights. Results indicate that while social media can facilitate academic work, it predominantly acts as a distraction, negatively affecting academic performance, particularly for first-year students. Notably, 84.5% of the students spend more than four hours daily on social media, and 39.4% agree that it negatively impacts their assignment completion. The study underscores the need for students to balance their social media use and academic responsibilities, highlighting the importance of this issue. Recommendations for achieving this balance, such as adopting time management strategies and integrating social media into teaching methodologies, are discussed.</p></details> | 17 pages |

Traditional zoning codes, which often segregate land uses, have been linked to increased vehicular dependence, urban sprawl, and social disconnection, undermining broader social and environmental sustainability objectives. This study investigates the adoption and impact of form-based codes (FBCs), which aim to promote sustainable, compact, and mixed-use urban forms as a solution to these issues. Using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, we analyzed zoning documents from over 2000 U.S. census-designated places to identify linguistic patterns indicative of FBC principles. Our findings reveal widespread adoption of FBCs across the country, with notable variations within regions. FBCs are associated with higher floor-to-area ratios, narrower and more consistent street setbacks, and smaller plots. We also find that places with FBCs have improved walkability, shorter commutes, and a higher share of multi-family housing. Our findings highlight the utility of NLP for evaluating zoning codes and underscore the potential benefits of form-based zoning reforms for enhancing urban sustainability.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages, 6 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

Recently, reinforcement learning (RL) methods have been used to solve TSC problems and achieve superior performance over conventional TSC methods. However, applying RL methods to the real world is challenging due to the huge cost of experiments in real-world traffic environments. One possible solution is TSC domain adaptation, which adapts trained models to target environments and reduces the number of interactions and the training cost. However, existing TSC domain adaptation methods still face two major issues: the lack of consideration for differences across cities and the low utilization of multi-city data. To solve aforementioned issues, we propose an approach named Adaptive Modularized Model (AMM). By modularizing TSC problems and network models, we overcome the challenge of possible changes in environmental observations. We also aggregate multi-city experience through meta-learning. We conduct extensive experiments on different cities and show that AMM can achieve excellent performance with limited interactions in target environments and outperform existing methods. We also demonstrate the feasibility and generalizability of our method.</p></details> |  |

Among ABM frameworks, John Conway's Game of Life (GoL) stands out for its simplicity and ability to generate emergent macroscopic patterns from basic microscopic rules. In this paper, we propose and implement a novel GoL-based framework to simulate urban migration dynamics. Using a grid-within-a-grid approach, our approach encodes probabilistic tendencies for out-migration due to densification and sparsification, simulating the evolution of population centers. By initializing GoL grids with different distributions and parameterizing migration preferences, we explore how urban structures emerge and stabilize over time. Through a series of experiments, we demonstrate that even with simple rules, this framework shows promise for understanding emergent urban phenomena, providing insights into city growth and structure. Methodologically, our framework offers a versatile and computationally efficient tool for studying urban migration patterns, contributing to the broader application of ABMs in computational urban social science.</p></details> |  |
